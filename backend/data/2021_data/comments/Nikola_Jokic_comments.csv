"Currently, the consensus Vegas odds are as follows.  LeBron James	+350  Nikola Jokic	+440  Joel Embiid	+550  Kevin Durant	+750  Luka Doncic	+750  Steph Curry	+1200  Giannis Antetokounmpo	+1300"
Imagine this : nikola jokic grabs rebound and throws one of his quarterback passes to an open MPJ cherrypicking. The ball is in the air but jokic gets fouled. It was an easy basket but now they get sideline out of bounds?
Would you say that Nikola Jokic has some of the same skills that Our-vydas Sabonis had?  That's about the closest analogue I can think of to a modern comparison
"Jamal Murray, Garry Harris, Michael Porter Jr, Bol Bol, Nikola Jokic."
"I am so confused. I‚Äôm giving you reasons why advanced stats aren‚Äôt accurate and not the thing to go off. Your reply is ‚Äúwhen did I say the stats was perfect‚Äù. Well your using them as an argument so if you wanna use them and then back it up fine. But don‚Äôt use them and basically be like ‚Äòwell there are reasons why other A is higher than B, but that doesn‚Äôt apply to Lebron‚Äô because stats aren‚Äôt perfect, which is what your doing when saying those stats mean something for Lebron but not others.  And I‚Äôm not complaining about win shares at all. I will use a different player to Kawhi because your right, 11 games is a big difference. Gobert also had a high win share than Nikola Jokic who played more games than Gobert. I could give a list of stupid examples; Tatum and Simmons in the 20s, Embiid and Young in the 30s, Mitchell and Pascall in the 40s. Just a stat that doesn‚Äôt really mean much if you ask me.  Again BPM how your team goes with you on the court, so many factors go into it. Are you playing against bench players more in the second and third quarters? How good are the other 4 people on your team? How good is the other team? Each game is different, at the end of the day we know it doesn‚Äôt get any better than Lebron is on the court. Don‚Äôt need to tell say this stat that relies on more than just Lebron supports that. Kobe who finished second in the MVP voting had less W/S and BPM than Wade and averaged less than Wade in literally everything.   Advance stats only suck because it sums up a whole picture into a one sided story. Advanced stats are weighted more on more things than basic stats. Like BPM has more factors than PPG, yet you will only hear the number and not how the number came. Not saying advanced stats are completely useless or worse than basic stats, but advanced stats are the only stats that can tell a different or more Rosie story than what‚Äôs happening, aka Whiteside last year.  My point with, you are just assuming that about Lebron. You have no way to prove that LeBrons team would be lottery without him. Your proof is 2 years in the future (which is a lot in nba time). I‚Äôm sure we could both bet our life‚Äôs with almost 100% certainty that lebrons team probably wouldn‚Äôt of made playoffs without him, but what do we know for sure? Wades team was a lottery team without him.  Only stat that Lebron definitively beats Wade is the amount of wins each team won, which is what your going off. Which is fine, again I understand the argument of Lebron is taking this team to 66 wins, but if you can‚Äôt atleast acknowledge Wade wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúterrible example‚Äù, then I‚Äôm happy to be done with this back and forth. Kobe finished higher than Wade, why is that? Because of wins, not because of play, and Kobe is my hero/favourite person ever. Just sometimes it is what it is. 99% of the time it goes to the person with the best record."
"There are a lot of different types of teams and players, and different people enjoy watching different styles of basketball.  If you're looking for fast-paced action, watch a Wizards game. They aren't an especially good team this year, but they play very fast and focus more on offense than defense. The Nets also focus a lot more on offense, and they have two or three of the best players in the league.  If you're looking for a slower, more defensively-minded team, you could try the Lakers. That would also let you watch LeBron James. The Suns and the Jazz are also slower teams.  If you're looking for a one-man show, try watching the Warriors. Steph Curry pulls off some of the most amazing shots in basketball history. Nikola Jokic is one of the best passers in the league right now (and a good scorer as well). He plays for the Nuggets.  When I got into basketball, I watched my local team (the Suns) and found a player that I could root for. I really liked Steve Nash. I learned the things that he was good at and the things he was bad at, and that helped me understand the game better. It also helped me appreciate what other players and teams were good at.  I hope you have fun watching! I'm no expert, but let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them."
Well he lost so I guess his *substantial gap over Joel Embiid and thus Nikola Jokic remained unchanged.*
"Most star players are whiners. LeBron whines more than anyone. My favourite player in the league currently, Nikola Jokic, is a massive whiner. Its  a bit annoying but guys with this much talent are genuinely getting fouled almost every trip down the floor. Its the only way to slow down offensive prodigies. Kawhi is another example, he screams on every fucking drive lol"
Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic are better than either Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Is that really a hot take?
"Did Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker, Giannis, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Peja Stojakovic, Arvydas Sabonis etc... all just fail to exist?"
"I didn't say I necessarily agreed with the take, simply that those things may have been where it came from. I think Luka is much more similar in regards to playstyle to James Harden than Nikola Jokic, but I don't think it's ludicrous for that comparison either."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"It's possible that Embiid will be the only first round pick from the draft to make an All-Star team.   Good second round though: Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Dwight Powell (who was pretty good before his Achilles injury), Jordan Clarkson."

"LeBron‚Äôs won the last 6 game 7‚Äôs he‚Äôs played, unless you‚Äôre taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition?

"Depends how you are measuring impact, but for the past three years he is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. With one exception, those were the top five finishers in the 2019-20 MVP vote (Jokic was 9th), while Gobert wasn‚Äôt mentioned on a single ballot.  I prefer these kinds of metrics versus 1st all-nba ballot nods and such, but to eachs own. I get an argument against 10 impact too"

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"I don't think Jokic is a lock by any means. He is easily one of the best players in the West, but his fan support is in no way in the LeBron, Luka &amp; Steph category.   Steph has had a few down years in terms of team releveancy, so he may not make the fan vote. Jokic will also be going up against Davis, Kawhi, PG, (possibly LeBron or Luka if they are listed as front court players). So far from a lock IMO.   FWIW, I think the West starters will be:   F1: Anthony Davis  F2: Nikola Jokic  F3: Kawhi Leonard  G1: LeBron James  G2: Luka Donƒçiƒá   &amp;#x200B;  With Nikola and Kawhi's spots most up for grabs."

[YOU LOST TO NIKOLA JOKIC](https://youtu.be/Xn1xG8ovc4c)
"Nikola ""Slim Honey"" Jokic is the best player in the NBA right now"
2 fantastic defensive plays by defensive juggernauts Nikola Jokic and Devin Booker
"If you look at Jokic's complete history as a player he's not a bad defender.   https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/2/10/21131100/stat-of-the-week-nikola-jokic-defensive-impact-nba-rim-protectors-are-overrated  Small sample size this season, he'll get better there probably. He's not making an all defensive team but he's certainly a contributor defensively."
&gt; athleticism   &gt; Nikola Jokic  pick one
"Nikola Jokic has been exceptional since the beginning of the season, but a team can't hope to win the title when its star player has to turn triple-double every night.  The Nuggets need to improve collectively behind Jokic to really hope to make a difference in the post-season."
Nikola Jokic.
"The opposing team would have to play a true center to even slow him down when Shaq‚Äôs on offense. Guys like Elden Campbell, Dale Davis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Vlade Divac, etc got the match up because teams needed to put big bodies on Shaq. There were people who only had a roster spot to be a body to put on Shaq and give up 5/6 fouls. These guys typically didn‚Äôt have the athleticism and the perimeter shooting that you‚Äôd see from today‚Äôs bigs like Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, or Nikola Jokic. Part of why position-less basketball is as prevalent as it is is because there is no Shaq in the league bulldozing people in the paint."
Hopefully he becomes Nikola Jokic
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
**Guys averaging 20+ppg on 65%+ TS:**        Kevin Durant - 31.3 PPG on 66.9% TS            Joel Embiid - 26.4 PPG on 66.3% TS            Nikola Jokic - 25.1 PPG on 65.8% TS                      Paul George - 24.4 PPG on 68.5% TS                    That's insane efficiency. KD in particular is pretty jaw-dropping.
"They‚Äôre both awesome especially in how vastly different but effective their games are. I truly view Jokic as one of the best offensive big men of all time. They also seem to respect and like each other a lot, Joel was once asked who his favorite player growing up was and he said ‚ÄúNikola Jokic‚Äù"
Offense:  -	Steph Curry -	James Harden -	Kevin Durant -	LeBron James -	Nikola Jokic  Defense:  -	Jrue Holiday -	Kawhi Leonard -	Ben Simmons -	Giannis Antetekounmpo -	Anthony Davis/Rudy Gobert
"Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Jerry West and Rick Barry all come to mind. Good shooters, good passers, those guys were phenomenal, they would excel in any form of basketball in any decade, but would be even better now.   Magic Johnson would be akin to Russell Westbrook, only 6'9. He'd be a menace in today's game and compared to Zion and Lebron with his athletic abilities, size and skill.   Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic would've been even more frightening in 90s Isoball era. Nikola Jokic especially, it takes a whole team to stop his passing and shooting.   Shaquille O' Neal in todays game would score 45 points a game. Early 90s Shaq, before he ate/lifted to be so heavy was a damn freak. And there wouldn't be anyone who could stop it.   And finally AD, put that guy in any era of basketball, and he's amazing. But late 70s ball? he'd be equal to Walton, Moses, Kareem, McAdoo, Lanier and be on teams whose sole business would be to let him unleash havoc on D."
"That is not ""blind"" per se, that is Nikola Jokic knowing the coaches play inside and out, and just reacting right. Complete skill play here. He eyeballs the spot where the three point shooter is to go, sees his first option is covered and makes a judgement call.   I will say it's insane he can do that as fast as he can."
"Murray: [narrating] Our last night in the bubble. I draw curfew watch. [Murray goes into the head to find Private Jokic sitting on a toilet, miming shooting the ball]  Jokic: [eerily] Hiii... Blue Arrow. [Jokic mimics passing the ball as Murray turns off his flashlight]  Murray: [alarmed] Are those... flashy passes?  Jokic: Seven-six-two millimeter. Full. Metal. Jacket. I love that movie.  Murray: [shaken and worried] Nikola... if Malone comes in here and catches us... we'll both be in a world of shit.  Jokic: I AM... in a world... of shit! [pretends to dunk and begins drilling loudly] Left baseline, hut! Right baseline, hut! Lock and load! [Grabs a basketball, starts dribbling] Order, hut! [brings the ball up to the ""spinning on finger"" position] This is my ball! There are many like it but this one is mine! My b-ball is my best friend! It is life!   Malone: [storms out of his bedroom; angrily, to the other Nuggets, who have gotten out of bed to see what the noise is] Get back in your bunks!  Jokic: I must master basketball as I must master my life! Without me, my basketball is useless!  Murray: H-hey!  Malone: [storms into the head] What is this Mickey Mouse shit? What in the name of Jesus H. Christ are you animals doing in my head? [to Murray] Why is Private Joker out of his bunk after lights-out? Why is Private Joker holding that basketball? Why aren't you stomping Private Jokers's guts out?  Murray: Sir, it is the private's duty to inform the head coach that Private Joker has a nba regulation basketball and has locked and loaded, sir!  Malone: [calmly, to Nikola] Now you listen to me, Private Joker, and you listen good. I want that ball, and I want it now. You will place that ball on the deck at your feet and step back away from it. [Nikola aims at Malone's chest]  Malone: [full voice] What is your major malfunction, numbnuts? Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you enough attention when you were a child? [Jokic passes to him, killing him, the ball bounces back, then he aims another pass slowly up toward Murray]  Murray: Easy, Nikola. Go easy, man. [Jokic lowers it, sits on a toilet, and puts the ball in his mouth]  Murray: NO!! [Nicola spins the ball, killing himself and splattering his brains across the wall]"

"&gt; Jokic is actually having a better season than Giannis' MVP last year  That is the title of your post, and there is no attempt to add any additional context so it's taken at face value.  For starters, Jokic's team is 11th place in the West, and at the end of the day it's all about *winning games*. That's the goal, even ""from a pure basketball standpoint"".  I'd amend your claim to ""Through 13 games, Nikola Jokic is on pace to statistically outperform Giannis' 2020 MVP season"" This title would also correct your implication that all the factors that go into having a better or worse season can be captured by these basic ""advanced stats"". They can't. We just have to accept that.   You also make no attempt to add context to the statistics. Giannis was playing 5 fewer minutes because he was blowing teams out; how should that factor into this? How much should we even care about PER, especially since Giannis' is higher? How are you accounting for DPOY-level defense vs average defense, and what are the inherent flaws in the stats you're using to estimate this impact?  There's tons more questions that can be asked that you don't even begin to attempt to address."
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he‚Äôs back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he‚Äôll bounce back soon enough"
Nikola jokic is the most entertaining basketball player in the NBA nobody change my mind
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned

*The gang murders Nikola Jokic*
I think youre missing the point.   Nikola jokic is an immensely skilled huge guy known for partying that takes a lot of shots down low. He plays a very physical game. That's on this list he falls in line next to Notorious players who are not known for such things. Who are known as being poor again until 9. Who have very little of the craft and knack that he possesses around the use of physicality.   I would say all in all his placement on the list shows he's being officiated unfairly
&gt;Damian Lillard and Kyle Lowry  That sure is a funny way of spelling Nikola Jokic!
[Jokic got suspended for just a couple steps off the bench.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25850702/nba-suspends-nikola-jokic-denver-nuggets-one-game-leaving-bench-altercation-utah-jazz)  [So did CJ McCollum.](https://www.nba.com/news/trail-blazers-mccollum-suspended-one-game)  So you should do a little research before spouting off.
"&gt;Ya i think OG should have got a tech too  It really wasn't a hard play to call.  Obvious Flagrant-2 on Anunoby, and then offsetting single technicals on Harrell and Trent for the aftermath.  Common foul on Schroder for the live ball play.  A Flagrant-1 is ""unnecessary"" contact, and this was clearly that.  It upgrades to a Flagrant-2 if the contact is ""excessive"", again, absolutely no doubt on that point.  That the officials somehow screwed that up into offsetting double techs on Harrell and Anunoby, and nothing for Trent, is typical of NBA officials.  Apparently Trent has compromising pictures of this crew, because he also got away with drilling Caruso with an intentional elbow later.  &gt; Unless fred and co are out there ... escalating   That is literally what Van Vleet would be doing, were he not restrained by a security guard -- see the image linked above.

Nobody gives a shit about boomer whining over tanking or building teams through free agency  The chances of drafting a Draymond Green or Nikola Jokic in the second round are immensely small. Counting on that is not a very viable strategy. The Warriors just got lucky that they drafted one of the greatest defensive players ever who also happened to be an all-time passer at his position.
If anything him being tiny makes him marketable. People love an underdog. And nikola jokic is one ugly motherfucker and people love him. It‚Äôs cause he foul baits and his team has sucked for majority of his career.
"So he wants to be like his childhood hero Nikola Jokic, how cute!"
"Normaly for a center to have an mvp caliber season, they have to have near record breaking FT rates.  Nikola Jokic is proving that he can be an mvp with pure skill, and not just size.   How's that?"

"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.       Hopefully you don't mind but I decided to post this ranked table for total differential.        |Rank|Team|Player|Total Differential| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|**17.6**| |2|LA Lakers|LeBron James|**15.2**| |3|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid|**14.7**| |4|Utah Jazz|Rudy Gobert|**14.4**| |5|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|**12.2**| |6|LA Clippers|Paul George|**11.0**| |7|LA Clippers|Kawhi Leonard|**10.7**| |8|Minnesota Timberwolves|Karl-Anthony Towns|**10.7**| |9|Brooklyn Nets|Kevin Durant|**9.8**| |10|Denver Nuggets|Nikola Jokic|**9.8**| |11|Miami Heat|Jimmy Butler|**9.5**| |12|LA Lakers|Anthony Davis|**8.4**| |13|Atlanta Hawks|Trae Young|**8.1**| |14|Houston Rockets|Christian Wood|**7.9**| |15|Toronto Raptors|Pascal Siakam|**7.9**| |16|Detroit Pistons|Jerami Grant|**7.8**| |17|Brooklyn Nets|Kyrie Irving|**7.5**| |18|Boston Celtics|Jason Tatum|**7.4**| |19|Miami Heat|Bam Adebayo|**6.6**| |20|New York Knicks|Julius Randle|**6.1**| |21|Dallas Mavericks|Luka Doncic|**6.0**|"
"The thing that‚Äôs annoying, and a negative contribution to discussion, is this notion that ‚ÄúJokic bangs in the post just as much.‚Äù ‚ÄúJokic is just as physical of a center.‚Äù Etc. The reason why it‚Äôs annoying is because Joel and Nikola have distinctly different play styles and the way embiid forces a defender into a foul through his dexterity and footwork leading to an unguardable position where a foul is necessary to prevent a bucket is an elite skill, and the notion that Jokic does that just as well minimizes Joel‚Äôs play style, but if anyone dared to suggest that Joel can do any of the unique things that Jokic does it would be met with derision that he could pass out of the post and create looks. (He can‚Äôt, not nearly at Jokic levels.) Joel has a very interesting and unique skill in the way he not only draws fouls but forces fouls, and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so good at getting them. Certainly Jokic deserves more free throws. That‚Äôs not Joel‚Äôs fault."
We must proselytize and spread the word of the Most Holy Church of Nikola Jokic. We will NOT rest until the r/nba sub is full of Jokic posts. The mods' teams must consist of subpar passing centers who are oddly enough exceptional free throw shooters. Their jealousy knows no bounds!

"There was, but it lasted long enough that by the time the trade was made most had moved over to support Jokic.  Nikola replaced Nurkic as a starter sometime mid-December in 2015, and at that point the fanbase was pretty split because of how high we had been on Nurkic.  Over the next 2-3 months, our offensive rating shot through the roof and we started winning games with some insane highlight reel passes.  By the time the trade deadline hit in February, I don't know anyone that wanted to keep Nurkic except for a small contingency that thought we could convince him to embrace a bench role.

I mean how much of this clearly has to do with him specifically playing with Nikola Jokic lol  There are very few players that I think can make others flourish like Jokic
Nikola D. Jokic
"Nikola ""Moses"" Jokic"
Nikola Jokic is the MVP this season. Jokic will also go in the the NBA history books.
"If he came in at the same age as jokic I'd agree. He came past his prime and just won't be able to keep that title, if it is not lost already to nikola.     He paved the way for others, but as position less basketball grows the room for big men to have the autonomy to playmake for longer NBA careers then he will fade down that list. I see it similar to shooters, without those before Steph never exists. But with the growth of the game shooting exploded just like playmaking is starting to for larger players."

Just looking through the 2nd round in 2014 and there was several great players taken there. Makes you wonder wtf teams were thinking taking PJ Hairston over Jordan Clarkson joe Harris nikola Jokic etc
"It just takes 1 player to change a perspective and I think with Bargnani being the most famous name (being the number 1 overall pick), the reputation isn't well. It took Nikola Jokic to change the reputation of Serbian players after Darko Milicic (not to say Bargnani is like Darko). Luka also helped with that reputation because another Slavic country even though Slavic countries aren't the same."

"It‚Äôs fair to say russ hunts for assists but it‚Äôs unreasonable to say that it‚Äôs only for the stats.   Jokic likes to setup his teammates to score, too. There‚Äôs hardly any difference.   If you think nikola outright sees plays ahead like Nash does with hockey assists that‚Äôs totally fine but that doesnt automatically mean Russ just goes for the stats."
"Q4     01:33     Foul: Personal     Paul George     Nikola Jokic     CNC  **Comment:** George (LAC) maintains legal guarding position while knocking the shit out of Jokic (DEN).  -NBA L2M report, probably"
"I mean, you can convince the voters if you'd like lol   &gt;So essentially, the Rockets fucked his MVP campaign?  No, he did. But even ignoring all that, I believe Nikola Jokic makes a mighty fine case anyways."
Dame Lillard is playing Trae young level defense. It shouldn‚Äôt be enough to keep him off first or second team all nba but I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs something that shouldn‚Äôt be excluded from consideration for MVP voting. It should dock him. I get all the excuses about him having to shoulder so much offensive load but it‚Äôs the mvp race the standards are super high. Other candidates don‚Äôt mail it in like he does on defense.   Yes everybody knows nikola jokic isn‚Äôt Ben Wallace on that end either and point guard defense isn‚Äôt a big deal but still his defense is just a good bit below anybody else‚Äôs. It‚Äôs been enough of a joke it‚Äôs actually had an impact on the court
Was curious about clutch minutes. This is the list:  1. Damian Lillard - 135 (77.7% TS) 2. Zach LaVine - 116 (58.4% TS) 3. De'Aaron Fox - 106 (56.9% TS) 4. James Harden - 98 (69.8% TS) 5. Nikola Jokic - 94 (59.2% TS) 6. Chris Paul - 87 (59.0% TS) 7. Jerami Grant - 83 (57.2% TS) 8. Joel Embiid - 80 (65.3% TS) 9. DeMar DeRozan - 74 (61.0% TS) 10. LeBron James - 74 (55.6% TS)
"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."
CP3  Marcus Smart  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  This team is winning at least 2 championships

"&gt;All the same passes?  Yes, all the same passes, your homer goggles notwithstanding.  &gt;This is really simple- the Venn diagram between players who are big enough to play C and who have the passing skill of Chris Paul has only a tiny sliver of overlap, Nikola Jokic.   Paul has averaged 11+ assists in multiple seasons, and carries a career 9.4 average.  Jokic's career high for a whole season is currently 7.3, which he will likely raise to 8.x this year.  His career number is 5.8, and even many of those come from simply being tall -- as they do with many centers, who can look over a defense.  So, flatly, no.  You are talking completely out of your ass here, again.  &gt; Nuggets are one of the best teams in the NBA  Yet at the moment, they will play their first-round series without home-court.  &gt;, the record isn‚Äôt that relevant with only 46 games played   So they are pacing themselves and planning to turn it on later?  &gt; Net rating and ORTG say what they‚Äôre doing is working, and they‚Äôll be above the 5 seed soon.   If so, only due to other teams' injuries.  &gt; and they‚Äôve been one of the most successful teams   That's pretty questionable, with 1 game won beyond the second round since 2009 and only 2 visits to the playoffs under Malone.  &gt; Yes, playing at their pace works.   Kind-of.  Good enough to be a low seed in the playoffs, but maybe they can pull a first-round upset.  Were I a Nugget fan, my sights would be set higher.  &gt; and it seems that most of the people you interact with agree, judging by your post history   Yeah, this is r/nba, populated mostly by teenagers with little knowledge of basketball.  I'm absolutely fine with being in opposition to that crowd.  &gt;  Jokic is going to win MVP this year   He might very well.  Hopefully he doesn't run out of gas.  Ya know, like he did in the Conference Finals against the Lakers last year.  Actually never mind.  Keep running him ragged.  Being able to brag about him dribbling the ball up the court is probably way more important than the Conference Finals."
"All the same passes? Those aren‚Äôt even good passes by Jokic standards, almost all the passes in that video are routine 5ft passes from the post, Jokic does those all the time.   This is really simple- the Venn diagram between players who are big enough to play C and who have the passing skill of Chris Paul has only a tiny sliver of overlap, Nikola Jokic. There simply aren‚Äôt many players like that, period. Vlade doesn‚Äôt show even 30% of the versatility Jokic has as a passer in that video, he was clearly quite limited in his capacity there, and couldn‚Äôt have played like a PG. Those are just glorified drive and kick passes except to another player in the paint, and a couple of easy bounce passes on breakaways. Nothing that special.    Nuggets are one of the best teams in the NBA, the record isn‚Äôt that relevant with only 46 games played. Net rating and ORTG say what they‚Äôre doing is working, and they‚Äôll be above the 5 seed soon. Taking the ball up has a marginal effect on fatigue if anything, again you haven‚Äôt proven that or even provided evidence that it matters.    Yes, playing at their pace works. It fits the flow of the team and they‚Äôve been one of the most successful teams over the past few years even with an extremely young core. You seem cognitively impaired, based on the way you‚Äôre framing arguments, and it seems that most of the people you interact with agree, judging by your post history. Jokic is going to win MVP this year, or at least is a major favorite according to Vegas, and if you think you understand this stuff better than the Nuggets excellent staff &amp; Jokic himself do, you should probably get a job in the league instead of typing out long posts with 14 upvotes like a loser."
"Paul Millsap yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Michael Porter JR gave a look of pleasant surprise. JaMychal Green belted, ‚ÄúWe got an [expeltive] squad now.‚Äù And before Nikola Jokic could hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Allen Iverson hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
"people keep talking about how everyone gets triple doubles now and this is commonplace, but nobody is ACTUALLY doing this shit except Russ. I'm not saying no one else will have a triple double for a whole season for another 40 years or anything, but averaging one for a full season 4 out of 5 seasons? Are you kidding me? this shit is not happening bro. if nikola jokic can't do this shit, if lebron can't do it, who the fuck can? only russ apparently.   the guy is a statistical anomaly and all anyone wants to fucking do is talk about TS%. he creates like a billion points a night and is a one man wrecking crew on the court, grabbing more rebounds than jesus while being no bigger than me. he's an aberration to every statistician's rules, and all he gets is fucking criticism. he should be hyped more.  also he wears stupid fucking clothes i would never be caught dead in, and makes them look cool, so you know he's that dude"
"Yeah I think post-up play is bound to have a comeback again. LeBron's most consistent midrange shot is out of the post. With players like Jokic or to a lesser degree Bam emerging postplay will gain more value again since it's easy for a guy like Nikola to collapse the defense in the post and find the perfect cut or corner 3 that way. So post-scoring might not be the center of the offense like it was in the 90s but posting up smallball 5s and either getting high% 2s or finding a dunk, layup or corner 3 goes perfectly with the current trajectory of the league, it's just not utilized as much yet. Creating out of the post will also remain one of the better options for Iso play and there's a reason almost all all-time great scorers had a strong post game to rely on, wing forward or big man doesn't even really matter."
PG: Chris Paul (Reserve: Stephen Curry)  SG: Kyrie Irving (Reserve: Klay Thompson)  SF: Kevin Durant (Reserve: Scottie Pippen)  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Reserve: Kevin Garnett)  C: Nikola Jokic (Reserve: Hakeem Olajuwon)  Assistant Coach: Mike Dan Tony  Head Coach: Dick Carlisle
"I agree that Nikola makes him a better coach,but it takes some knowledge to see how good of a player he was. Since sure as hell not many saw from scouting and his starting few years. I just think there is way more behind the scene stuff that counts and not only rotations and how are plays drawn. Meloune went to Serbia just to be with his best player,if he didn't show to Jokic how important of a player he is,would Jokic return the favor with such dedication and work ethics. It all counts towards coaching in my book,and it's possible that if there was no Malone Jokic wouldn't be a player he is today. Maybe I'm wrong,but it feels that way to me. I mean I'm certantly not the one who is better than Malone to judge it,I'm laying on my bed writting this comment I have no right to judge somebody who is so long in basketball."
So Malone literally doesn't have an offense. I'm not exaggerating. Look it up. He doesn't scheme offense.  Jokic made Denver's offense. Jokic schemes Denver's offense. Jokic taught the players Denver's offense. Jokic runs Denver's offense.   No Nikola as we know it? Lol. Malone wouldn't have a job anywhere near the NBA in 2021 without Jokic.

"KAT has become solidly the 3rd best big in the league (generously) while Nikola Jokic is the MVP lol all he does is lose, and all Jokic does is win. Just look at the lineup he womped you with tonight lmao  These two teams were supposedly even three years ago, and now one team is on an 11-0 streak (8-0 with KAT) and has the MVP. Gotta imagine Wolves fans didn't think this would be the outcome after that day, but you love to see it.  GGWP here's to many more dominating performances of Jokic over KAT and the TWolves in the future!"

"Honestly, I respect celebrity status, but if there‚Äôs one person in the world I couldn‚Äôt resist asking at a grocery store to take a picture of and hug and maybe a kiss on the forehead, it‚Äôs Nikola Jokic"
"Nikola Jokic holds the NBA record for minutes played in a playoff game. Not by a Center, by anybody. And he‚Äôs quite a bit slimmer than he was then, maybe 30 pounds. Both Embiid and Jokic have caught flak (rightfully) for their conditioning in the past but they look great this year."
"So the Lakers running pick and rolls with the ball in Lebron's hands is done to help him pad his stats? Why doesn't he just give it to AD in the post and get out of his way?   Of course it isn't, when you've got an all time great playmaker like lebron or Jokic you play to their strengths. You think if Jokic played more like Nikola Vucevic then the Nuggets without Murray, Barton, Morris and Dozier would be racking up wins?  MPJ is an elite shooter and off ball player, but his handle and passing are incredibly raw. You'd know this if you watched games and didn't get your information from FS1"
Nikola Jokic is not leading the league in anything!!?? Weird flex but ok. Mr. Common Denominator
"&gt;And while all that is good, there‚Äôs an even better upside of Jokic as a Knick. As many of you know Nikola Jokic is Serbian and that‚Äôs where his first name ‚ÄúNikola‚Äù comes from. If Jokic becomes a Knick, they could start calling him ‚ÄúKnickola‚Äù as a nickname, or rather, a Knickname.  No no, he has a point."
"I guess it depends on what shape you think Moses Malone, Charles Barkley and and Nikola jokic are supposed to be and if they're out of that shape lol"
"He destroys in the post quite frequently, its absolutely a part of a modern and efficent offense if you have players that can do it like Jokic. Jokic also handles quite a bit and turns it over less than Donch. Doncic is a better handler but it doesnt give him this crazy edge like youre implying, because Nikola can still get his in Iso's once hes got position and he does handle a lot even still. I think i just disagree with you"
I've watched every single game Nikola Jokic has played. I also have Mavs season tickets at the AAC. He definitely is.
"""I mean, that's really up to the play calls, that's really up to the coaches, who they want to put the ball in whose hands,"" Porter said. ""We kept going to [Nikola] Jokic and [Jamal Murray], and they're two amazing players, you can never get mad at that. But I just think to beat that team, we gotta get more players involved, we gotta move the ball a little bit better. We can't be predictable against that team.""  Maybe he wasn't wrong"

"&gt; Switching into guards like Curry, Booker, Kyrie, etc. is still probably a bad idea because those guys are just unreal on the offensive end.  That applies to literally everyone in the league though.  Obviously you don't want him guarding guys like that all game long but he does *shockingly* well in short bursts.  Someone posted that clip of Devin Booker absolutely demolishing Gobert a week ago as proof that he doesn't deserve DPOY- the thing is, t[here are clips of him doing exactly the same thing to guys like Lu Dort and Ben Simmons and Bam/Jimmy Butler](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/5/12/22431989/nba-awards-ballot-mvp-nikola-jokic-joel-embiid) (scroll down to DPOY)."
"For the people downvoting me:  Click the full list and look at a couple things. DeMar's ratio may be the highest but he's not in the top 50 players for passes made. He is right above Anthony Edwards for passes made this season.  Combine his low number of passes with this league leading ratio and you see a pretty clear picture of a selfish passer.  To contrast, Nikola Jokic has thrown the most passes in the league BY FAR and his ratio is only 11%. Jokic is #5 in potential assists too meaning that his passes are not all potential assists.   If you look at the ratio of passes to potential assists, Jokic is: 18%, DeRozan is: 37.2%.  Very clearly selfish passing."

"Yes, in that he‚Äôs an extension of your coach. Jokic is your team‚Äôs valve. The offense goes through him, often in the high block or back to the basket out past the elbow‚Ä¶a series of dribble hand off options and back cuts, and it‚Äôs up to Nikola to decide what to do. It‚Äôs all up to him to position the sets and decide. He dictates the entire pace of your team.    Draymond does a lot of that for us. Curry is often off-ball, and when he‚Äôs not he gets doubled almost immediately and has to release the ball to Green. That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs up to Draymond to either go downhill 4 v 3, wait for off-ball action to get Steph open, or dribble into the mix with Curry and help create space for him to launch. Also, Green creates in the post, slip screen back door cuts or split action to get open threes."
"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."

"Hi! My friend and I have been working on a tool to help explore and visualize how the league‚Äôs top scorers are getting it done this year. With it, you can:  - Compare players‚Äô favorite spots on the floor with a shot chart, including where they‚Äôre making and missing from and where they are streaky from. - Add a bunch of filters to explore and visualize exactly what you‚Äôre interested in. I had a lot of fun finding out that Steph Curry‚Äôs shooting percentage on step-back 3-pointers from 25+ feet in April in San Francisco was an absurd 71.4%. - Finding out who similar shot takers are this year for a given player with our custom ""similar shooter"" recommendation engine. We gleaned some pretty cool insights from this, like that Nikola Jokic and Colin Sexton tend to shoot from the same areas. - Give at-a-glance information on how a player has been scoring this year.  We hope this tool is equal parts interesting for the basketball fan that wants to learn more about data and the data science fan that wants to learn more about basketball.  We plan to actively support this tool over the coming weeks and would love to hear any feedback you guys have."
"Ah yes, elite guard Nikola Jokic"
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
if we would‚Äôve picked nikola jokic at 2 overall it would‚Äôve been ludicrous
MVP  1. Chris Paul  2. Nikola Jokic  3. Joel Embiid  4. Julius Randle  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo
A foul is a foul is a foul. If Zion can graze Westbrook and have it decide a game then Nikola Jokic should not be able to whack Zion in the head and have it be a no-call.
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."

"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Hakeem Olajuwon, Sabonis, Lamar Odom, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis, Andrea Bargnani, Boris Diaw, Nikola Jokic, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony-Towns, Bam Adebayo, Rasheed Wallace, Kevin Love, Nikola Vucevic and more all have fadeaway jumpers in their bag."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
Nikola Jokic will finish as a top 5 player all time

"nikola ""despite the lost"" jokic is back"
1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Kevin Durant  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Joel Embiid  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard  this is the objective list. you cannot disagree with me
"jokic runs rampant on everyone, first of all  [and second of all this isnt really true](https://i.imgur.com/dbjo0Vo.png)   though nikola has had some huge games, hes also been stifled"
"[Of all Centers with at least 200 field goals attempted against them, Nikola Jokic is 2nd to last in the entire league. Barely better than Enes Kanter, Jokic is giving up 65.5% of attempts taken on him.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*200&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  Usually stats that measure D are unreliable and way too noisy, but tracking field goals attempted against a Center (where the main role of a Center is rim protecting) is the most reliable out of all of them as it focuses on tracking a specific, defined thing.... and it shows Jokic is a bad rim protector.  Jokic is a bad rim protector, and since that's the most important aspect of a Center's defense (even in today's age), it means he's a mediocre defender. He's also bad at defending the P&amp;R and his lack of defensive ability on the perimeter makes him exploitable when teams specifically attack that in the playoffs."
"According to whom? Basketball reference‚Äôs tracker has had him as the wire to wire leader - largely because it bases its algorithm more on stats than narrative.  I‚Äôm sure talking heads had LeBron and embiid as the leaders early in the season, but I‚Äôm not sure that argument carries any weight since those are the same people who have been looking for *anyone else* besides Nikola all year to win it. Cp3 is the latest one right now, but before that it was Steph, dame, harden, and ofc lebron and embiid.  Acting like those guys were ‚Äúclear cut‚Äù favorites over Jokic at any point in the season is foolish. Especially because the only thing that *can* be clear cut at that point in the season is the stats. Narrative can‚Äôt be, because the season‚Äôs narrative isn‚Äôt written yet. Record can‚Äôt be, because standings aren‚Äôt final/games haven‚Äôt been played yet. Stats are much less likely to fluctuate throughout the season just because the sample size keeps getting larger so it‚Äôs harder and harder to move the overall numbers up or down with outlier performances.  So, please back up your argument that Jokic was clearly trailing behind anyone at any point in the year with anything other than ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs what ESPN told me‚Äù when we know that they [specifically talk about what they think will generate interaction, which usually means catering to larger markets with a higher density of people to engage](https://twitter.com/trizzytrey_5/status/1390392795295256580?s=21)  I‚Äôll hang up and listen"
"Big Honey is 26/11/9 and I am pretty sure he is at 65 TS% while getting to the line half as many times as Harden. Joker is also playing without Murray/Morris/Barton for roughly a third of the season.  Its a similar narrative to Harden, I think. Jokic is arguably having one of the all-time great seasons for a big as far as usage and efficiency. He is always making everyone better around him, no matter who it is.   I think we should be celebrating this guy and his incredible season. I do not understand why so many people are trying to downplay how good and fun Nikola Jokic is."
"* Zion Williamson and **Chris Paul**. CP3's playmaking can help open the floor for Zion, and he won't be taking shots away from him like other ball-dominant guards. Also, the lobs would be fun. Bam Adebayo is another good option, a solid secondary playmaker who can cover for Zion's defensive limitations thanks to his versatility.  * LaMelo Ball and **Nikola Jokic**. LaMelo has thrived this year thanks to Hornets' ball-sharing system, which lets him function as a playmaker and an off-ball threat. Jokic is the perfect fit for that, even if Melo/Jokic would be serviceable at best on defense. Of course, if Melo-Jokic pick and pops aren't your speed, Melo-Zion would also be fun, again because of lobs.  * Tyrese Haliburton and **Damian Lillard**. Hali doesn't iso a lot, usually having others set up his shots for him, but is a great playmaker. Dame can create his own shot with ease, but isn't a spectacular playmaker, and can be worn down if he has to have the ball in his hands on every possession. The strengths perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Hali and Steph would also be a really fun pairing, or Hali and Jimmy Butler."

Nick Wrighg and his dumb colleague: a person not named Nikola Jokic
"Nikola spent every free summer on horse racing track in Subotica in Serbia. Every Sunday there are horse races, and every single time you can see Jokic and his family there. Every time I've been there I saw him greeting people, talking with people, taking pictures with kids with great patience. Guy often just walks around between races, he has place in VIP section, but he walks to the stables back and forth all the time during breaks. He is just one of normal people there, really tall but just normal guy, no one would say he is worth millions, you can approach him, talk with him about various topics. People here are also kind of used to him, so people don't bother him too much or make much noise that NBA star is there.  I don't know Nikola personally, I have talked with him few times and was around him many times, and he is really relaxed and fun guy to be around. At any time when I was near him, I never had feeling he is a super star, cause he simply never acted like one, just ordinary guy, enjoying life and doing what he likes. It might not make him good person, but it's kind of hard to imagine guy like that being bad person."
"Nikola Jokic's career ranks:  Box +/-: 3rd (behind MJ &amp; LeBron)  PER (Nick Wright likes PER): 7th  WS/48: 8th  No one in NBA history matches Jokic's career marks of 22.7 PTS, 12.1 REB &amp; 7.4 AST per 75 poss.

"Less than two months after his 27th birthday, Joel Embiid looks like one of the most important players in professional basketball. He's more confident than ever for one reason: He has become one of the most complete superstars in the game.  As Embiid enters his prime, he's the centerpiece on both ends of the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers, who have become a legitimate threat to win it all.  No center has won the MVP award since Shaquille O'Neal in 1999-2000 for the Los Angeles Lakers. That drought should end this year, with both Embiid and Nikola Jokic making strong cases and reminding us that big men still matter. Not only does Embiid rank third in the league in scoring this season, but he also anchors one of the best defenses in the league, a key claim that Jokic cannot make.  Entering Thursday, the Sixers have the best record in the East, and Embiid is the biggest reason for that. Consider this:   In the 1,457 minutes he's been on the court this season, Philadelphia has a monstrous net rating of plus-12.0.  In the 1,693 minutes he's been on the bench this season, Philadelphia has a net rating of minus-0.3.  Embiid has had a breakout season, and while his place in the MVP race might dominate podcast conversations, that's just a distraction -- the real story here is Embiid and the new-look 76ers appear to be evolving into one of the most sustainable contenders in the NBA.  The arrivals of Daryl Morey and Doc Rivers signified the beginning of a new era in Philadelphia. Together, they've overhauled the vibes around Embiid and Ben Simmons. Morey quickly traded Al Horford and added good shooters like Seth Curry and Danny Green, while Rivers refreshed the actions and the rotations.  The result has been a more cohesive, more spacey ecosystem, which has cleared out the clutter and enabled Embiid to do what he does best. He's scoring more than ever, and he's doing so at a more efficient clip than we've ever seen from him. He's on pace to set career highs in both 2-point shooting percentage and 3-point shooting percentage. When you look at his shot chart from this season, you can see he's filling it up from all over the place.  Embiid is both more active and more efficient as a jump shooter than ever. He has both attempted and made more jumpers than anyone else on the Sixers. He's taking more than 15 jumpers per 100 possessions, up from 13.6 last season, and he's making more than 40% of them for the first time in his career.  Coming into this season, he'd struggled to achieve average 3-point shooting efficiency despite being gifted wide-open looks by defenses that dared him to shoot. But this season, Embiid has converted 36.8% of his 3.1 3-point tries per game.  That's a massive development because defenses now must honor his long-range game, which opens up other opportunities for him and his teammates elsewhere.  The bigger development has come inside the arc, where Embiid now shows off a feathery touch on midrange shots. He's attempting 11.4 non-paint 2s per 100, the highest such number among the 83 players who have tried at least 100 midrangers this season. Oh, and he's making them, too, converting 43.6% of his non-paint 2s this season. That's not only the highest such mark of his career by far, but it also changes the math on how teams must defend him away from the rim.  While his outside shooting has developed, it's his nightly performances on the low block that provide us all a reminder of the virtues of a style of play mostly left for dead in recent years. For decades, big post-up centers like Embiid dominated the NBA, but post play rapidly declined as the NBA fell in love with 3-point shots, motion offenses and faster-paced action. Post -ups happen more than 50% less frequently than they did just eight years ago.  Since the league added its player tracking system in 2013-14, post-up activity has cratered. That season, NBA teams posted up over 16.35 times per 100 possessions. This season, that figure is 8.17 times per 100.  But that staggering trend does not apply in Philly or in Denver, where the league's top two MVP candidates just happen to be dominating the league via old-school post play.  Get this: Embiid is posting up as an individual more per game than 27 other teams are collectively! Only the Lakers and Nuggets as teams are posting up more than he does.  Jokic isn't far behind, posting up more than 24 teams.  Just like the folks who have made us recently reconsider our stances on mom jeans, Embiid and Jokic are making post play cool again.  Embiid ranks first in the league, posting up 19.3 times per 100 possessions. Jokic ranks fourth, posting up 13.7 times per 100. And out of 19 players who have posted up at least 200 times this season, Jokic ranks first in efficiency, Embiid ranks second.  It's remarkable that the league's top two MVP candidates are both centers who are revising the conventional wisdom of the past 10 years: Centers were supposed to be endangered species; post play was supposed to be dying out.  Embiid is the only player in the league scoring double digits per game on post plays, and his MVP campaign is also a demonstration that the old Mikan-Russell-Chamberlain-Jabbar dance ain't dead just yet.  The pace-and-space era and the 3-point revolution have reformed the ways NBA front offices value the skills of frontcourt talent. The ability to thrive in the post on offense and defense used to be paramount. Now it isn't, and scouting reports for big men now examine their abilities to guard multiple positions, shoot from 25 feet, run the floor, grab rebounds, protect the rim, and serve up dribble-handoffs to the guards and wings they share the floor with.  As a result, the players attempting to stop the post actions of Embiid and Jokic might not be as common or as equipped to defend these actions in years past.  Just as post offense is a lost art, so is post defense. That is great news for Embiid, who is on the right side of his prime, one of the most imposing post players this league has seen in decades and still getting better. Embiid and Jokic would have thrived in any era, but in the context of the modern NBA, in which strength and size are less prioritized, there is a mouse in the house more than ever before.  As a defender himself, Embiid provides the Sixers with quite the opposite. As a 280-pound 7-footer with a 7-foot, 6-inch wingspan, he's among the league's biggest and best defenders.  The Sixers rank second in defensive efficiency in the NBA this season, giving up just 106.8 points per 100. While they decorate the defensive end with an imposing fleet of willing, savvy and sizable defenders, they play their best defense when both Simmons and Embiid are on the floor. Simmons is one of the world's most talented perimeter defenders. The combination of his point guard instincts, his defensive will and his own physical prowess make him a solid Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Meanwhile, Embiid is both an elite rim protector and rebounder.  The numbers are staggering.  Philadelphia is 32-6 in games in which Embiid and Simmons have played, a 69-win pace in a full 82-game season. In the 1,066 minutes in which they've shared the floor, Philadelphia's net rating is an absurd plus-16.2. That's the highest such mark among any two-man combo in the Eastern Conference (minimum 1,000 minutes played), and it has a lot to do with getting stops; with Embiid and Simmons on the floor, Philly's defensive rating is an eye-popping 102.2. If these guys can stay healthy, Philly's crunch-time lineups will be two-way nightmares for anyone.  At 27, it's impossible to watch Embiid and not think of former GM Sam Hinkie, and the early days of Embiid's pro career. It didn't look good. How many players miss two entire seasons of play before eventually turning into franchise players? Not many, but that's exactly how Embiid's arc began in Philly, which makes what he's doing right now even more impressive.  Along with Jokic, Embiid is making centers great again, but along with Simmons, he's also further validating the radical team-building process Hinkie designed eight years ago. No matter what happens from here on out, Embiid's eventual legacy will be tied to that polarizing tanking experiment.  No center has won the NBA MVP since Shaq did so in 1999-2000. That's about to change. Centers are relevant again, but that's not all. Basketball in Philadelphia is relevant, too. And even though Embiid might come up short on the MVP vote this season, it would be foolish to label this regular season anything short of a triumph. As a player, he has yet to reach his ceiling, but he has driven himself into the MVP conversation, and in the process, he has taken the 76ers from a punchline to the top of the Eastern Conference.  That was the plan all along."
"&gt; So, the first question regarding whether Jokic could be an MVP stems from if he can handle the workload, and the jury is still out on that.  35.0 MPG this year, and who could forget the 4OT thriller against the Blazers in the playoffs where he played 65 minutes.    &gt; The second question is if he can average enough points that an MVP usually produces. The short answer? No.  26.4 PPG with a 50-burger, five games of 40+ points, and 21 games with 30+ points.  &gt; Nikola Jokic will never be a dominant scorer in the fashion of a Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Karl Malone, or David Robinson down low.  LOL  &gt; If anything, Jokic would have to crack the 20 ppg mark, something he could definitely accomplish with more minutes and slightly more aggression, but he would also have to average over 10 rebounds and 7 assists per game.  26.4/10.9/8.4  I'm not trying to bash the authors of this piece (as this was way early on in Jokic's career), I'm just trying to show how big of a leap Jokic has made."

"I would really like to dispel the myth that the Nuggets are a better team without Jamal.   We've had 10 games from the trade deadline to the injury and 10 games since the injury until now.  Pre injury they were 8-2. Post injury they're 9-1. Pre injury they're 111 defensive rating, post injury they're 110. Pre injury they're 116 offensive rating, post injury they're 118.      I think it's indicative of how good a coach Mike Malone is, how good a Front Office Tim Connelly has built, and how great of players Nikola Jokic and MPJ are that despite all the injuries the team hasn't missed a beat.   We're going to miss him in the playoffs, and I think the last three minutes of the Raptors game and the last three minutes of this game show that. Maybe once Monte comes back, there will be more stability on offense at the end of games with him and Jokic running the 2 man game.      Anyway. Just getting annoyed with the growing myth that the Nuggets are better without Murray."

"Did either of them win the MVP playing more minutes than the rest of the league by a significant margin as the sole offensive engine for their MVP team in back to back condensed seasons with barely any offseason at all?  No, of course they didn‚Äôt. Because this is an unprecedented situation.  Re: other stars are playing - plenty of guys are also opting out. Jimmy butler just did.

"He literally said multiple times he didn‚Äôt care about it. When he was given the award he tried to shift the honor to his teammates and out of the spotlight.  Jokic made a commitment to Denver and wanted to see it through by playing every game. He hasn‚Äôt made that commitment to the NT so I can understand why the mentality on playing every game is different.  Furthermore, comparing him to players for other countries or historical players for your team or other countries (like manu which I‚Äôve seen a bunch) is disingenuous. It‚Äôs not comparing apples to apples.  Not only has he had an insane workload in terms of minutes, as the OP points out, but he has had so much put on his shoulders. When Jamal went down, he was our entire offense. He had to do everything on every possession with no break. Add to that opposing offenses trying to target him and make him run through screens to wear him down because that‚Äôs the best way to try to stop his offensive onslaught is to tire him out.  Manu never carried a load like that. Nor has any other Serbian player in history. And that‚Äôs before we even get to the unprecedented scheduling over the past year and a half with covid. We had the bubble with a condensed schedule, a super short offseason, a full season with a confessed schedule, and now we are going into an already shortened offseason WITH the Olympics?  If Jokic played with the NT, his offseason would be a total of like 6 weeks. That‚Äôs just simply not enough with the mental and physical fatigue he‚Äôs been through for the past year and a half. He needs a break. He needs rest.  It‚Äôs super unfortunate circumstances, especially given the situation from 2017 where he needed to get his body right and didn‚Äôt play. And I really feel for Serbians since watching nikola is an absolute treat, so it‚Äôs gotta be painful to not see him out there with the NT.  But he‚Äôs absolutely the one guy across all teams/countries that should get a pass for this one."

"He doesn't have to go vegetarian like Chris Paul he just needs to stop eating Big Macs on the bench. I put him in the same dietary category as Nikola jokic before this last 18 months,  a diet that isn't good for anybody but particularly not a professional athlete. Cases of Snickers or bags of Big Macs are not snack foods, if you got Joel embiid to stop snacking on the  things other people consider meals then he probably loses some weight but really not that much.  He would get better results from just cardio training because really his problem is stamina not weight"

He is 6'10. That is Center Position Height nowadays.  Look at Nikola Jokic, being a Playmaker at Center.  Maybe he needs to be the Center for a Team, who makes plays like Jokic. Embiid might not be the right fit in modern basketball for him then, because they both sit on the same position.  It is a Puzzle to solve. In the current constellation i dont think it works out."

They can‚Äôt defend with porter and Jokic. All you have to do is put him and Nikola in the same action and any other good defender you have is diminished because those two require so much assistance.

"The Bucks are a super team.

A healthy Nets is on a different level, but you can‚Äôt compare the Bucks to the Raptors teams LeBron used to dominate."
"Lmao if y'all are seriously arguing Khris Middleton is better than Nikola Jokic that's wild. I usually ignore those kind of takes but this is too funny. Just to clarify:  So the Bucks probably get swept if James Harden is playing. Y'all were a shot away from being down 3-0. Now Kyrie goes down and the Bucks have the luxury of playing a team whose 2/3 stars are out. Plus Khris plays next to Giannis, one of the best players on Earth to take defensive gravity off of Khris.   Meanwhile we all know how much of a playoff beast Jamal Murray is. So the Nuggets are clearly missing their second best player and it's blatant when you watch their offense right now. Their second best player has basically been Monte Morris.   And your best data/argument for Middleton over Jokic completely ignores the MAJOR injury scenarios present. That's some impressive critical thinking skills ya got there."

Chris Paul 7. LeBron James 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Jimmy Butler 10. DeMar DeRozan"
Trading everyone for an Alen Smailagic/Nikola Jokic front court.
"Jokic is one of the very few guys to truly elevate his play in the post season, he's simply unstoppable really. I think he's def in the tier of first Options capable of running a championship team but since he's playing in Denver the franchise struggles to get someone of Kyrie calibre to his squad. And I think the nuggets are doing a great job with the cards they're dealt, but Nikola definitely plays on a higher difficulty right now and has to rely on his GM finding ways to grow a championship level team through high value trades or good drafts instead of having a natural superstar gravity provided by locations such as LA, NYC or Miami."
"&gt;jokic and Murray do crazy shit  Except you know they kinda can't do it now that Murray is out? And as I keep telling yall there's the whole thing where Jokiƒá and Murray also command shitton of double teams which in turn creates shitton of space for the other guys that would get much better and more frequent looks if we could run Jokiƒá+Murray pnr, which would impact both their efficiency and production positively. You know what, now that I've put it like that, I just figured out it's actually a team sport! Crazy!  And yeah, dude's also missing PJ and he only got Thrill back two games ago, who should still be on a minutes restriction... I don't think any of the coaches remaining in the playoffs are particularly envious of his position at the moment.  Really, it's a success that we even made it to the 2nd round in this state and I already said this on our sub, but seriously, the only reason yall are complaining about the team (or in your case, more specifically about the coach), is that Nikola Jokiƒá is so fucking good that he's giving you an illusion that this team in its injured-ass state might have a realistic shot at making the finals."

"Sixer second third and fourth leading scorer are at 24 ppg, 17 ppg an 13.5 pg. Nuggets are at 17, 12, 12. Embiid does not even come close to shouldering the offensive load by those numbers alone. You also clearly haven‚Äôt watched any nuggets games. Jokic is the primary ball handler on the majority of actions and has to initiate and set up almost all of the offensive sets. He has no where near the spacing Embiid does, as both the suns and the blazers essentially leave Gordon, facu and rivers open so they can soft double Jokic. Jokic also averages more ppg, assists per game and has a higher usage percentage. By the numbers you are wrong, and even by simple eye test you are wrong. Embiid doesn‚Äôt shoulder near the offensive workload nikola does. And TS% is not even close to being a player comparison device. No sane person would say MPj, monte and jamychal are even close to the trio of Seth, Tobias and Simmons. The best player of those three nuggets is not even better than the second best sixers player. This is just a bad faith argument man"

"You're taking it too literal. That's not what he saying. Those players are not even close.  What really makes is Giannis better than Nikola Jokic or James Harden or Damian Lillard or whoever? What separates him?  You could say defense, but what about about some people who don't value individual defense as highly as you or I do?  What if offense and shooting threes and getting assists is more important?"
"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"

"I don‚Äôt think Giannis is super close with any other superstars. U can even see it on his social media accounts, he only follows like 8 people. Plus, he never works out with other players as well.

Trae Young leaves the Hawks to help form a super team out west, with Nikola Jokic  Suns and CP3 win back to back rings this year and next year   Devin Booker wins 1 MVP  Giannis wins another MVP and a ring in 2023  Seattle and Las Vegas get expansion teams, bringing the NBA to 32 teams  James Wiseman is traded next summer and thrives with his new team"
What an asinine argument.  It was a playoff series that AD completely outplayed Lillard in...  And we can compre their playoff careers too if you want.   &gt;Don't take teammates into account?   Jrue Holiday vs Nurkic and CJ  &gt;Is Devin Booker a better #1 than Nikola Jokic? Is he a better #1 than Lebron?  How is this remotely relevant?
The W/L record of 4 games from 4 seasons ago is all we have to go off?  Not the hundreds of games both have played afterward? Don't take teammates into account? Is Devin Booker a better #1 than Nikola Jokic? Is he a better #1 than Lebron?
"He definitely has a thing for KG and Bird if you're wondering old player biases. Currently, he has 3 players he absolutely ADORES: Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and Nikola Jokic."
nikola jokic
"\&gt;He broke Kyrie's Cavs records for most 3pters made by a rookie.   \&gt;He broke LeBron's Cavs record of most 20 + point games as a rookie, and most consecutive 20 + point games to open a season this year.   \&gt;This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others).  \&gt;Are those all tradeable mediocre players too?  &amp;#x200B;  This isn't ""statistical refutation"" as much as it's post-editing in data-picked factoids that I don't give a fuck about. You still completely refuse to cope with the reasoning as to why the franchises that owned the 22 year old versions of those players wouldn't have dreamed on not extending them, which is so much more telling about what you deep-down know to be true about Sexton's value as a player.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;It's almost as if they need additional pieces to help flesh out their scoring, and like they need a tandem of JAllen, Okoro, and Mobley to provide a solid defensive wall to back up their height disadvantage (and provide some great pick n roll targets).  &amp;#x200B;  If Mobley falls to them, there's probably a slight chance they extend Sexton. I still think they'd much rather re-sign Allen who can fit next to Mobley, and keep that cap space free while rolling with a Garland-Mobley facilitated offense.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;And you're right when have members of the sports media ever been wrong ! /  &amp;#x200B;  What does this even mean? In instances where there is this much consensus smoke, they are right very often.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;Cavs aint the ones trying to shoot loads of cum to hype Sexton for a trade. We just recognize what we have and can provide the stats to prove it. Which is what Ive done consistently and only gotten random opinions in response where no one has yet to explain how we replace our #1 scorer and the 25 ppg and spacing, and gritty infectious attitude, he brings w mid-level draft picks and Obi. No one.  &amp;#x200B;  You can only provide the same singular stat, PPG, and his eFG% and TS% which at least have trended towards league average for a SG that only averages about 4 3PAs a game. You ignore his tendency to ball-stop and really bad defensive fit which help contribute to a bad Net Rating and awful team relative on/off numbers. You also ignore a bad Ast/TO ratio and mediocre Ast% which is discouraging for someone who can reliably break down the defense as much as he can.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;But please give me more opinions I can refute with stats.  You've refuted literally none of my opinions with stats, because my collective feelings towards Sexton already acknowledge that he is developing into a nice three-level scorer capable of being a sole offensive option on a really bad team. It is his holistic package as a player that I am not very interested in.  \&gt;I got karma to burn so prove me wrong w stats or gtfo  &amp;#x200B;  ""muh downarrows"" is cringe enough without ignoring the fact that I'm the one displaying unpopular dislike for a young player that I think has been erroneously labeled as someone that meaningfully moves a team towards championship contention.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't even know why you're taking such offense to this. I'm trying to argue that your team is smart for, rumors have it, choosing not to extend Donovan Mitchell money to a potentially worse version of Donovan Mitchell and for seeing the limited value in that type of player."
"All of those stats / accolades are pretty cherrypicked and none of them contradict the comment above you since they're all related to scoring. Maybe you should've looked for something that suggests he's not a terrible defender/passer  &gt; This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others)  This is just obnoxious and could be done with any 1st option player in the league"

"You can do anything, unless your Nikola jokic. Then you'll get ejected from a win or go home game."
"Khris ""Two-face"" Middleton  Nikola ""Joker"" Jokic  Desmond Bane  Terrence Ross-al-Ghul  Klay ""Klayface"" Thompson  Could the Batman villain starting 5 make the playoffs in the East?"
I agree any squad Jokic plays on has automatic offense. He runs halfcourt offenses like a savant and has some of the best outlet passes for quick buckets in the fastbreak as well. He handles the ball really well and loading doubleteams or traps on Jokic will hurt other teams more often than not. But if you don't double Nikola he'll just score on elite splits from anywhere on the floor. There's no way of truly stopping him as long as he has some guys that can hit wide-open looks somewhat consistently.
"Lebron, Harden, Curry, Luka/Giannis/Jokic/Paul tied for #4  People saying LeBron isn't #1 should consider that he had his team at the top of the Western Conference or was like 2W short max, lead the #1 RS Defense in the league + put up yet another MVP campaign on a team with shit spacing and AD missing a lot of time. The injury to Bron really derailed this year for LA, but if injuries play a part in the equation Harden also shouldn't be as high. I think at full health LeBron still manages to run an always dangerous team with every roleplayer buying into it and going full throttle the best.  So that's why I agree with OP concerning Bron and Harden being second also makes a lot of sense to me. Brooklyn was mad consistent as soon as he joined them and stormed to the top of the conference as a result. Other than him only LBJ can carry a team loaded with vets and roleplayers to homecourt-advantage. This holds true even this season as KD and Kyrie missed a lot of time and Harden still managed to run the Brooklyn offense to historic levels with one or even both of his Co-Stars missing.   After that comes Steph who managed to do a lot with an otherwise underperforming and underwhelming roster. He doesn't bring quite the acumen of Hardens or Brons playmaking but his gravity and still stellar playmaking makes teams with a healthy Steph almost certainly a lock for the playoffs.  I think Jokic comes very close to these guys but he's also had some great quality roleplayers on his squad. But I still think he could probably replace Steph because Nikola lead his teams to a high seed for 3 consecutive seasons without injuries and other setbacks really mattering at the end of the season. But then again this holds true for the other guys I have tied for 4th. Idk it becomes really hard after that and I don't feel qualified to ranking them further after the top 3.  The NBA has so many top-level talents atm, there are like 12 players having an argument for top 5 in the league and a lot of them are great playmakers, thus making them great floor raisers as well.  I want to give a shoutout to Embiid as well. Evven with nagging injuries every season he manages to boast a very competitive Sixers squad year in year out. He also has very solid players around him but I think he might actually be a part of the huge ""tied for 4th"" group as well at this point."
Your average American sports fan doesn't even know who Nikola Jokic is. I don't think that holds much weight.

"That‚Äôs because star basketball players play at least 35 of a 48 minute game. Trout has 4 plate appearances and, while he‚Äôs the best in the game, he can hit .310 meaning he fails at the plate almost 70% of the time. LeBron could go 5/20 from the field but he‚Äôll have 10 boards and 15 assists so you are seeing him do something great almost every night. You don‚Äôt see that in baseball. Baseball is actually doing a great job with Ohtani but not every player can be on pace for 60 plus home runs and be a Cy Young contender.   And I‚Äôm talking about promoting the next generation and not the stars that have been here for 10 plus years. How many causal fans know who Nikola Jokic is? A lot of media people can‚Äôt even pronounce his name correctly, showing a complete lack of respect. The same goes for Giannis.   Like I said, this series has a two time MVP in his prime and one of the best players ever in his first finals yet the ratings are not good. That shows a compete failure from the NBA to promote their superstars not named Curry, Durant and LeBron James."

I‚Äôd trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"Id rather have a #1 option center thats literally one of the best offensive big man of all time and a neutral defender over a #3 option center thats okay offensively and great defensively but not special.  KAT is literally beating Ayton in almost every advanced metric and is clear of Ayton in every other statistic besides defense. This is disrespectful to another degree. Ayton right now is likely just barely a Top 5 center depending on who you ask.  Nikola Jokic just won MVP and hes a worse defender than KAT, so obviously you will take Ayton over Jokic right? Do you see the problem here?  It's not tough to look good as a 3rd option center playing behind CP3 and Booker, I can only imagine how unstoppable the Suns would be if they had KAT as a 3rd option lmao."
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each.

The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who‚Äôs good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
"Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic all have nasty post moves, and they are all objectively top 10 players currently. Elite post moves are far from a thing of the past"
"Darko had the talent.  Jokic brothers are friends with him. Extremely close. And they know all the fuck ups he did, and made sure Nikola didn't do the same dumb stuff. If Darko had the work ethic and mindset, he would have been a way better player. Not sure if the ""consensus #2"", but definitely way, way better than he ended up being."
"&gt; 16 Nikola Jokic: 6‚Äô11‚Äù C, Serbia, 19.4 yrs. DX: 42, ESPN: 31  &gt;His poor athleticism and speed make it fair to take his stats with a grain of salt, but based on his stats he appears to have a shot of becoming the best passing big man of all-time. That gives him a world of intrigue to me on its own  This guy's good"
"Man, you're all sorts of wrong. Scola isn't 42, he's 41. I know that's not much of a difference but he was 39 when he ""carried"" Argentina to the finals. So it seems like two years is a huge difference in your mind. He also didn't carry the team. Deck, Campazzo and Vildoza are now in the NBA in part due to the amazing performances in the WC. That team was also comprised of well stablished players in Europe like Laprovittola (MVP of Liga Endesa in 2019), Brussino and Garino (all of whom had NBA experience as well). Since you claim to know European basketball so well I believe you should know this. Now, you gotta help me out with this, since I clearly don't know european basketball at all. Which 3 second rules are you talking about? The one by which you can't be in the paint for three seconds if you're the offensive player? Because that one's in the NBA, too. In fact, the NBA has the more restrictive rules, since you can't do that also if you're the defensive player. In FIBA, though? You can live in the paint if you're defending. Now, are you claiming that Giannis can't dominate because defensive players would just wait for him in the paint? It seems like you need to watch him play more, you seem to have the notion that he just jumps from the free throw line and stuffs it in the rim and that's how he got two MVPs. So, two times MVP Antetokoumpo can't carry Greece, but Luka Docic can carry a Slovenian team who has had absolutely no experience in Olympics nor WC. 39 yo Scola can and did, according to you, carry Argentina to a WC final. Finally, you say that all big teams were missing key players. Argentina knocked out Serbia in the quarter finals game. Their best player was Nikola Jokic. I know you claim you watch european basketball so you probably don't know who he is. He's the current MVP of the NBA. Other notable NBA players were Bogdan Bogdanovic (he played in the ECF with the Hawks), Bjelica and Boban Marjanovic. They also had Micic, which is the current MVP of the Euroleague. But you knew that already, you know a lot of european basketball.  In the Semi finals, Argentina beat France. Their best player was Rudy Gobert. As in, NBA's current DPOY. Also on that team: Fournier, De Colo, Ntilikina and Batum. So tell me again, who they were missing? Serbia didn't have 34 yo Teodosic which is a great player but far from the best. He got injured before the WC. So I guess that makes Argentina a non contender for these Olympics. The fact that you think an amazing yet young player like Doncic can carry an unproven and, to be honest, fairly mediocre, Slovenian team past Argentina tells me you know 0 about european (or latin american, for that matter) basketball."

"Not trying to be a homer but:  1. Jokic  2. Embiid  3. Gobert 4. Towns  Whose the fifth guy you‚Äôre putting above Ayton? I‚Äôm comfortable putting those first four ahead based on track record but is it really crazy to have Ayton above, like, Domantas Sabonis and Nikola Vucevic?"
Serbians aren't happy about Nikola Jokic staying out. I would be pissed too.
&gt;Stop hating on Jokic lmao. Bogdanovic isn't even close to Jokic as a player.   My guy watch NT Bogdanovic for once in your life. The world doesn't revolve around Nikola.
"Serbians were already targetting Jokic calling him a fraud a traitor. It's about to get 10 times worse if they fail to qualify.   Meanwhile, in another galaxy, Nikola Jokic is chilling with dreamcatcher."
"Well I mean it's kind of weird to think about #1 picks because almost every time, the #1 pick isn't the best in the class   2020- LaMelo #3 (so far but can change) 2019- Ja #2(only because Zions health is a huge question for his career)  2018 - Luka #3 (I don't need to explain this one) 2017 - Jayson Tatum #3 (Markelle and Zo went before him)  2016 - Jaylen Brown #3  2015 - Devin Booker #13 2014- Nikola Jokic or Embiid at #41 and #3 respectively   And this is just in the last 7 draft classes, there are plenty more examples, and for quite a few of these there is obviously still plenty of time before their career are over, but right now none of the last 7 #1 picks are the best player in their draft. That's why the #1 pick isn't really as valuable to me in general because usually even if a guy seems like a can't miss, someone else could always end up being better"
Steve Nash and Nikola Jokic are now the only MVPs to have never made the finals.
NBA all-white lineup  PG-Luka Doncic SG-Duncan Robinson SF-Gordon Hayward PF-Domantas Sabonis C-Nikola Jokic
KAT is one of the best offensive centers of all time and Ayton is only a good defensive center and a #3/#4 option.  Is Rudy Gobert better than Nikola Jokic too?
"You‚Äôre out here comparing his scoring ability in the post to that of Nikola Jokic so idk what to tell you man, they aren‚Äôt even on the same stratosphere."
"These are some of his posts over the last year or so lmao.     ''Should Jokic be fined for purposely trying to injure Kanter, or should he receive a 1 game ban?""     ""There's a good chance that todays Warriors Nuggets game put Jokic out of the MVP conversation permanently.""     ""Who would you rather have on your team, Nikola Jokic or Ben Simmons?""     ""Did the last 3 Nuggets losses put Jokic out of the MVP conversation late into the season?"""
"No, what happened was Nikola Jokic was having a historic season and Giannis went on a 4-5 game losing streak at the start of the season that was the death knell to his MVP chances."
"I think 2014 just has Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Marcus Smart  2013 is Cody Zeller, CJ McCullom, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Rudy Gobert  Pretty much it‚Äôs only the top players in any given draft and Cody Zeller who stays with their team 7+ years"
"In addition to about 10-15 other centers, I would put Bill Walton and Nikola Jokic squarely above Dwight. They don't have the longevity, but they are clearly so much better at basketball that their abilities on the court outweigh Dwight's 5-yesr reign as the best center in the league."

"Fuck your race baiter bullshit. Bev deserves hate. Shit loads of it.    Nikola Jokic deserved hate for acting like a child and smacking someone‚Äôs face when his season fell apart. Instead the sub debated if it was a common foul.    I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs white, if he‚Äôs European, or because he‚Äôs chunky but the bias is stupid obvious. And it follows Luka too. Unless you want to seriously deny that, shut the fuck up.   If you do want to debate that I‚Äôm all ears. That‚Äôs a comical stance"
"The brothers looked about the same as Jokic did, except one of his brother that I can remember is tatted from head to toe and unlike Nikola, looked ripped. Honestly looked like someone Putin would trust with a deadly mission, especially yelling in broken/angry accents."

"I didn't question his off ball, though. I said playing with the leagues MVP helps. Does it not? These other players that you listed did not have that luxury at such ages. I'd say his numbers especially his percentages are slight skewed. Almost if not all of his shots are assisted by Nikola Jokic, one of the best passers in the league."
"Yeah, LeBron stands out pretty heavily in this one.   But definitely can't discount the likes of Giannis, Westbrook, John Wall.   There was always those lighting quick guards who could get out and run as well, Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash and even Leandro Barbosa used to cause their fair share of damage.   There's always the dagger three type of guys as well, who could dribbling out in space, pull up from deep and kill you that way like Curry, Lillard or even Reggie Miller would occasionally hit that fast break triple.   Probably not really the question but the elite passing bigmen who can hit those amazing outlet passes would also be an interesting answer to this question, Kevin Love and Nikola Jokic specifically."
I have literally killed humans with a Morningstar for saying that Nikola Jokic can't play defense.

And here‚Äôs an article from end of January (period before Kd got Covid)  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-rankings-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nikola-jokic-in-mix-but-joel-embiid-is-quarter-pole-leader/amp/  Kd was firmly in mvp convos before injury.  And here is the on/off net rating of harden and Kd. https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935  The offense is so much better with Kd, then it was with harden. Like what the hell is hardens argument over Kd? When healhy Kd provided way more value. Kd is like the best player in the world while harden is like 5th or 6th. Cmon"
Dikembe Jokic would be pretty legit.  And I'd be curious to see how unorthodox Nikola Iverson's crossover would look.
"Strictly speaking to skill level and productivity/efficiency on the court i believe that Luka Doncic was the best player in the league that year. The team was stopable, but luka was unstoppable. It can be argued that season that Joel embiid and nikola jokic were better. I might add there isn‚Äôt much to argue. They both played MVP caliber seasons. The numbers aren‚Äôt particularly there state wise but thats why there is a valid argument."
"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."
Nikola Jokic √ó David Robinson    The Offensive Maestro becomes an Elite Defensive Anchor with insane athleticism and endurance. Jokic plays both ends of the court now at triple the speed and never ends the game gassed.  Kawhi Leonard √ó Scottie Pippen   The Claw becomes an extremely smooth athlete and a better playmaker shoring up some of the only real knocks on his game. He'd also have even more physical tools to work with on the defensive end and presumably is freed from his knee issues.  Steph Curry √ó Vince Carter   The Worlds Greatest Shooter now has size and ridiculous leaping added to his elite conditioning. Imagine him running through the defense as an absolute lob threat as well; you could never take your eyes off him for even a split second inside or outside the arc with or without the ball as an oposing player or a fan.
lmaooo [Jokic was 4th in MVP voting in 2019 dawg](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/06/25/michael-malone-coach-year-voting-nikola-jokic-4th-mvp-nba/)
"&gt;The players that never won a championship, despite wiinning an MVP in their careers, are:  &gt;Russell Westbrook  &gt;James Harden  &gt;Nikola Jokic  Why do people include active players when discussing things that ""never"" happened.  They could still win one.  &gt;nev¬∑er /Àànev…ôr/ adverb  1.  at no time in the past or future; on no occasion; not ever.  &gt;Definitions from Oxford Languages"
"Ok so here's my breakdown: 1A) Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Giannis. Their job is to carry teams, even if they're shitty.  1B) Dame, AD, Kyrie, Harden, Embiid, Luka, Tatum, CP3 1C) Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Brad Beal, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young"
"Uh, add Jokic to that list please.  Duncan obvs &gt; Jokic but Nikola just had very arguably a better offensive season than Duncan ever had specifically because of this"
"James Harden, Nikola Jokic, and a bunch of randos from r/nba to fill out the starting lineup and bench. Once per season they both would get so crazy hot at the same time they would overcome essentially playing 2 on 5."
I‚Äôm just saying you see posts like this guy couldn‚Äôt guard Westbrook or couldn‚Äôt guard Patrick Ewing or couldn‚Äôt guard Nikola Jokic.   These guys are the top talents at their position and everybody struggles guarding them so why would they be different. It‚Äôs amazing that they can even possibly do it

"&gt; how could darko bust w so much skill? he looked like ass in game &gt;  &gt; what happened from then to gametime?  There was an article on Jokic about his brothers that touched on Darko's time with the Pistons:  https://deadspin.com/nikola-jokics-two-huge-brothers-go-everywhere-he-goes-1792143260  One of his older brothers, Nemanja, was roomates with Darko during his time with the Pistons and he was in college at Detroit Mercy. They would party all the time, and i'd imagine hitting up college parties as well.   It does seeem like Darko let the money / fame  / women overhwhelm his life and focus, and part of why Jokic's borthers drove to every single game and lived with him during Jokic's rookie season so he doesn't mess up like Darko.  https://www.denverstiffs.com/2017/2/11/14587494/darko-milicic-on-nikola-jokic-dont-mess-up-like-i-did"
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense‚Äî some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange‚Äî I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"

"Before we start just naming players, let‚Äôs think about what kind of skillset we‚Äôre looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won‚Äôt really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn‚Äôt expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I‚Äôd be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn‚Äôt need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the WORST player (he‚Äôs very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I‚Äôm hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he‚Äôs obviously young and still developing, so we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6‚Äô5‚Äù, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous ‚ÄúBig Body.‚Äù   P.S. Another interesting question is who‚Äôs the BEST player who WOULDN‚ÄôT succeed on a team of clones of himself. I‚Äôd be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it‚Äôs hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn‚Äôt still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
"he's making the correct point that you would obviously be willing to say who's the better player between a guard and a center when the answer is obvious, such as between nick van exel and nikola jokic. which means you can't lean on mental shortcuts like ""different positions, no point in comparing"". there is such a thing as value to a team, irrespective of position"
Nikola Jokic

"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, Shaquille O'Neal, Bill Russell, Bill Walton, Larry David, Mickey Mantle, Herbert Hoover, General Custer.   Just for starters."
"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).

"&gt; Restricted free agency exists only on a limited basis:  &gt; * Following the fourth year of rookie ""scale"" contracts for first round draft picks (see question number 47).  &gt; * For most veteran free agents who have been in the league three or fewer seasons. One exception is a first round draft pick following his second or third season if his team does not exercise its option to extend his rookie scale contract for the next season. Such players are unrestricted free agents rather than restricted. The other exception is players coming off a Two-Way contract (see question number 82). For Two-Way players, the years of service is ignored, and instead the days on the NBA roster is the determining factor (see below). &gt; * Following a Two-Way contract, if the player was on an NBA active roster or inactive list for at least 15 days in the preceding regular season.  [Source](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q42)  To answer your question, they would be unrestricted because of 4 years of service. If Carl Brown had signed a 3 year contract he would be a RFA at the end of their deal.   To use real examples, Nikola Jokic was #41 pick and signed a 3yr/4m contract and so was an RFA at the end of his deal. Lu Dort was undrafted and signed a 4yr/5m deal and will be a UFA at the end of his deal."
Throw him some extra points in for doing it against Nikola Jokic!  Edit: I spelled Alperen Sengun wrong my bad.
"Definitely in the conversation in terms of pick and roll chemistry, maybe not overall talent. [Zach Lowe did a great breakdown from last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/zachlowe29949405/nba-playoffs-genius-jamal-murray-nikola-jokic-lakers-doing-it)"
Yeah only other guys to do it as his age are Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic. So not a great track record
Nikola Jokic/Monte Morris/Facundo Campazzo love to run PnR thankfully!
"1. LeBron James - I‚Äôm not quite ready to move LeBron down yet. I want to see what he does this season and how his health looks. He‚Äôs just been so dominant for so long.   2. Kevin Durant - He is just unstoppable. He can score from anywhere and nearly beat the Bucks by himself. He‚Äôs just as good as he was before his injury and doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down.   3. Stephen Curry - He just had an amazing season, maybe the best of his career. It will be interesting to see him this year with Klay back. Obviously a worse defender than Giannis, but he‚Äôs just so dominant on offense.   4. Giannis Antetokounmpo - It‚Äôs hard having him at 4 after how dominant he was in the Finals, but he‚Äôs in the top tier. Just a monster on both ends.   5. Nikola Jokic - There‚Äôs a clear drop at this point, in my opinion, but Jokic just had an incredible season and is still young enough to continue improving. He‚Äôs also much healthier than guys like Kawhi, Harden, and Embiid."
Did he not bring the ball up for you guys like he thought he was prime Boogie Cousins or Nikola Jokic? He loved doing that here
1. Cade Cunningham is not the next Luka Doncic. 2. Alperen Sengun is not the next Nikola Jokic. 3. The clippers will be a lottery team next season.
So it's obviously hard to compare eras but Alex English and Willis Reed seem like they could make any starting 5. And reading some lists there are a few other older names that are probably being overlooked as well. Jokic is really the only one I'm struggling to replace. Obviously Draymond is great as well  PG / SG: Hal Greer  PG / SG: Dennis Johnson  Small Forward: Alex English  PF: Willis Reed  C: Nikola Jokic
"First of all, I already stated why Ben isn‚Äôt a passing big. I literally stated passing bigs, like Nikola Jokic don‚Äôt give up free dunks. Plus did you just answer your own question? Yes Simmons is being traded not only because his style clashes with the Center‚Äôs but because when it‚Äôs finally time to take the shots he‚Äôs been clogging the lane for, he‚Äôs passes or gets fouled and misses FTs."

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.

Came here to say this. Put Your faith in Nikola Jokic. He‚Äôs the only real thing.
I would say make a trade during the 2014 NBA Draft so you could draft Nikola Jokic in the second round.
"Steph Curry, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball and Ja Morant are probably must watch too. Charlotte is going to be fun as fuck to watch this year. Gonna try to watch them and the Nuggets in addition to the Warriors.  Jordan Poole is lowkey an amazing watch too. He's got a nasty handle, flashy passes, acrobatic finishes, and some footwork to get off difficult shots. He's in that Nick Young/JR Smith category where they aren't all-star caliber, but give you all-star highlights."
Nikola Jokic.
Nikola Jokic. He looks so awkward but it's so consistently effective.
"Barnes does not have a high offensive skill ceiling. He has a very low starting point and his style of play isn‚Äôt that of an offensive star, he also won‚Äôt be given that kind of role with any team.    That just isn‚Äôt how he plays basketball. What‚Äôs so hard for you people to understand    I keep going with this comparison because it shows how flawed your logic is. You may as well say Kai Jones has Nikola Jokic potential. Who cares if Jones isn‚Äôt close to having that skill set and dosent play that style of basketball   ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs young and can develop so it‚Äôs possible‚Äù"
Nice non argument. People always gotta resort to lazy insult like that when they have no point.    You think a dude is gonna drastically change his style of play and gain a whole new skill set to magically fit your ideal version of his potential and you are calling me the moron.    Hilarious    You might as well say Kai Jones has Nikola Jokic potential and Josh Giddey has Larry bird potential
Jarrett Allen is not Nikola Jokic
"That playoff run is kind of underrated because of the other story archs surrounding the 2020 bubble playoffs as well as the highly injured playoffs this year. To me Jokic solidified himself to be in that S Tier of players that will win you championships if you put the right personnel around him as well as the outside chance to upset better opposition. He got there before Giannis this year, Nikola has been incredible Everytime the post season started. He's in the even rarer group of people that elevate themselves and their team come playoff time like Bron Kawhi and KD. He'll get his eventually, were watching an All-Timer that will even be viewed as elite among all-timers once his career played out."
"Most of the current top NBA players are from the US. The list is subjective, but I would say about 14-15 of the current top 20, or 19-20 out of the top 25 are from the US. If we were to make a team from these players, then the US team would have more depth for sure.  &amp;nbsp;  If you want to list them, in no particular order: LBJ, Durant, Curry, Harden, Leonard, AD, Lillard, Beal, Tatum, Butler, KAT, Chris Paul, PG, Booker, Irving. To 25: Holiday, Adebayo, Mitchell, Randle, Zion.  The European players are Jokic, Antetokounmpo, Doncic, Gobert. The remaining players not from the US or Europe are Embiid and Simmons, and Kyrie Irving has dual US-Australian citizenship.  &amp;nbsp;  Just some lists from media outlets for comparison: [[1]](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/5/4/22416337/top-25-nba-player-ranking-lebron-james-nikola-jokic), [[2]](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/2021-ranking-top-20-nba-players-right-now), and [top 100 if you want a larger sample size](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/14/top-100-nba-players-2021-daily-cover)"

Nikola jokic has decided to ask for a trade from the Denver nuggets as mpj dies from lack from chicken pox due to a failure on taking the require precautions
"Higher on: Monte Morris (top 5 PG in the league potential), Matisse Thybulle (future DPOY if he gets minutes), Nikola Vucevic (literally a 25/10 guy), Melo (too many bad takes of people thinking he's trash due to efficiency)  Lower on: Deandre Ayton (he's good, but people were acting like he was in the Embiid/Jokic tier during the playoffs), Draymond (he's become Dennis Rodman tier offensively), and then for younger guys, Lonzo went from underrated to overrated again, and Siakam had one breakout season and has looked otherwise eh."
"He‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt even shoot as consistently well as Nikola Jokic. I mean, it looks nicer coming from KAT for what it‚Äôs worth."
"He‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt even shoot as consistently well as Nikola Jokic. I mean, it looks nicer coming from KAT for what it‚Äôs worth."
"He‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt even shoot as consistently well as Nikola Jokic. I mean, it looks nicer coming from KAT, but you don‚Äôt have to go very far into the distant past to just realize Jokic is better in that regard."
"Another 41st overall pick? Nikola Jokic.  *Don't go drafting an MVP with this pick now, ya hear?*"
"Serbia could roll out:  Milos Teodosic  Bogdan Bogdonovic  Nemanja Bjelica  Nikola Jokic  Boban Marjanovic   Not sure if it‚Äôs better, but they could definitely compete"
MVP: Luka Doncic  ROTY: Cade Cunningham   6MOTY: Derrick Rose  DPOY: Nikola Jokic  MIP: Lonzo Ball  COTY: Steve Nash
"Nikola Jokic is definitely a white man, no argument here."
I don‚Äôt think skill set overlaps matter between 2 superstars. And I also don‚Äôt think anyone is gonna hesitate pairing Nikola Jokic with Stephen fucking Curry because of ‚Äúdefensive concerns‚Äù
Harden was not MVP level last season.  Didn‚Äôt even finish in the top 10‚Ä¶..   But Luka did. He was 6th in voting  https://www.nba.com/news/nikola-jokic-wins-2020-21-kia-nba-most-valuable-player-award
"Nikola Jokic:  When he was young, his coaches at Mega Basket junior team, his professional team in Serbia, did not let him practice because he was overweight.  Jokic used to drink three liters of coke per day and his strength coach declared him obese after he could not do a single push-up. At one point he was 6-foot-11 and over 300 pounds.  According to one scout, ‚ÄúThe guy had no muscle definition. He couldn‚Äôt really jump.‚Äù  Denver Nuggets still ended up selecting him in the second round of the 2014 draft with the 42nd pick during a Taco Bell commercial while he was sleeping in Serbia.  Jokic wasn't initially planning on playing in the NBA for a few more years, was about to sign with FC Barcelona, but then they backed out after watching him play one last time where he had four points and three rebounds and zero defense, and so in 2015 he joined the NBA as a rookie.  Flash forward to 2021 and he's the league MVP."
"MVP, Nikola Jokic?"
Have you ever seen Nikola Jokic with his shirt off? Same thing
I live in Denver. Jokic won MVP of the entire league last year. I asked a girl at work today if she knew who Nikola Jokic is. She said no.  Stay anonymous Big Honey
"You said he's ""more recognizable"". Which I actually agree with. The issue is ""miles ahead"" as in not even close. I'd say Kobe is ""miles ahead"" of Kevin Garnett, Nikola Jokic, or even Dwyane Wade.  There's no basketball player living or dead that is miles ahead of Lebron's global reach EXCEPT for MJ."
"&gt;[""When i came to Denver i said that i would love to be Denver's Tim Duncan, because he played his whole career in San Antonio.

But still interesting."
Nikola Van Jokic
"My name is Nikola Jokic. I'm 26 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Denver, where all the villas are, and I am married. I work as an employee for the Denver Nuggets basketball team, and I get home every day by 10 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to play basketball I wouldn't lose to anyone."
"Wait until the media start discussing about "" Should Nikola Jokic demand a trade"" if the Nuggets can't get over the hump. Same with Jamel Murray."
Not according to Jokic.  &gt;Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic said Friday that he is at a playing weight between 275 and 280 pounds to give himself a strategic advantage.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834484-nikola-jokic-likes-playing-at-heavier-weight-to-avoid-being-pushed-around   Prime Shaq was about 350. So thats a 70lb difference.  Shaq would move  him around pretty easily.
Who is Nikola Jokic? Never heard of the guy.
Nikola Jokic gonna have a Nikola Jo-kid.

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Obviously the harden trade.  Then stop Beverly from taking out Russ' knee while he's calling a timeout   Or  Draft Nikola Jokic in 2014 instead of Mitch McGary lol
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
Example answer:  PG: Patrick Beverly (6th on Wolves)  SG: Buddy Hield (4th on Kings)   SF: OG Anunoby (3rd on Raptors)  PF: Jonathan Isaac (2nd for Magic)  C: Nikola Jokic (1st on Nuggets)  6TH: Eric Gordon (5th on Rockets)   Bench: Lauri Markennen (7th on Cavs)   Xth/nd would be there rank on there respective team. The player doesn‚Äôt have to be that exact number like Kyrie is the bird best player on the nets but you could take him as your first best.
The Nikola Jokic *‚Äùoppression‚Äù* continues...
"It's weird seeing those facts like ""Kevin Garnett played in the league with Magic Johnson and Nikola Jokic""."
"Impact in basketball terms, is objective on a season to season basis. It‚Äôs pure math. How your team is with you present vs when you sit. When that‚Äôs not all that matters when gauging offence because that can be circumstantial. With defence, there‚Äôs nothing else to evaluate,it‚Äôs far less circumstantial and in my point, I was looking at a sample over multiple years. You can‚Äôt say I have no point when I raised 3 points you were either too lazy or too incompetent to refute.  Plus even with your very stupid attempt at a strawman, it‚Äôs incorrect. Nikola Jokic would be the standard as the most impactful offensive player, not Trae young."
"It‚Äôs always hilarious how people claim that the league today isn‚Äôt immensely more talented than it ever was when guys like Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Damian Lillard are lower top ten."
"I think it's the way that Nikola Jokic makes all these touch passes, flips, and hand-offs that draw the comparison. He's naturally going to be different because he's more ball-dominant and a big but I can see similarities in their passing style, I guess?"
"I find your reasoning interesting until you said that his closest comparison is Nikola Jokic .   So for you Jokic is : an off ball scorer, secondary playmaker and a sharp shooter ??"

Worst eFG% in clutch situations (last 5 minutes; game within 5 points) in the playoffs from 2011-2021 (min. 40 FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|eFG%^| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|42|156|.292| |2|DeMar DeRozan|17|54|.324| |3|John Wall|16|48|.354| |4|LaMarcus Aldridge|15|45|.356| |5|Kyrie Irving|13|42|.357| |6|Klay Thompson|20|66|.371| |7|Zach Randolph|25|64|.398| |8|Paul George|22|67|.403| |9|Jayson Tatum|16|42|.405| |10|Manu Ginobili|18|49|.408| |11|Dirk Nowitzki|19|50|.410| |12|Bradley Beal|17|46|.413| |13|Khris Middleton|27|75|.413| |14|Mike Conley|27|72|.417| |15|LeBron James|84|224|.429| |16|Joe Johnson|31|79|.437| |17|James Harden|50|130|.438| |18|Tony Parker|35|83|.446| |19|Chris Bosh|18|43|.453| |20|Kevin Durant|78|186|.460| |21|Tim Duncan|23|50|.460| |22|George Hill|17|43|.465| |23|Nikola Jokic|18|44|.466| |24|Rajon Rondo|21|46|.467| |25|Stephen Curry|49|131|.473| |26|CJ McCollum|26|64|.477| |27|Damian Lillard|36|90|.478| |28|Danny Green|16|44|.489| |29|Marc Gasol|25|53|.500| |30|Dwyane Wade|54|112|.504| |31|Chris Paul|40|87|.506| |32|Jimmy Butler|27|60|.517| |33|Draymond Green|24|50|.520| |34|Donovan Mitchell|19|40|.525| |35|Al Horford|33|65|.531| |36|Kawhi Leonard|49|107|.533| |37|Jeff Teague|23|50|.550| |38|Kyle Lowry|31|59|.576| |39|Giannis Antetokounmpo|27|48|.583| |40|Paul Pierce|30|59|.585| |41|Jamal Murray|25|51|.598| |42|J.J.

Not the actual best center in the league Nikola Jokic tho. Teams don‚Äôt like doubling Jokic for a reason.
*Nikola Jokic has entered the chat*
people forget Nikola Jokic is a BUCKET
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."

C: Nikola Jokic  F: Tobias Harris  F: Klay Thompson   G: Anthony Edwards   G: Luka Doncic
"Nikola ""above the rim"" jokic"
"We really drafted Michael Jordan and Nikola Jokic, Draymond Green and Jrue Holiday in one draft"
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
Rockets got both the next Zach Lavine and the next Nikola Jokic in the same draft!
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"Nikola Jokic right now is a top 3 center of all time offensively, behind Shaq in LA and 50 ppg Wilt."
Magic Johnson  Micheal Jordan  Lebron James  Kareem-Abdul Jabbar  Nikola Jokic
I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
Idk Nikola Jokic and Nikola Jovic might look basically the same to a dyslexic person
Every tall white player who can pass the ball is the next Nikola Jokic
This isn‚Äôt true at all. Nikola Jokic won MVP and was the best player on the floor against the suns and they lost. LeBron was the best player on the floor against the Mavs and they lost. Durant was the best player against the warriors and they lost. Teams matter and putting the blame on one player shows you don‚Äôt understand the concept of a team.
"On a related note, if you want to watch a modern day version of Larry bird (in a 7 foot body) who also routinely has people saying ‚Äúhow did he even see that guy?‚Äù check out the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic.  The comp gets made so often that [there are even photoshops of him with Larry‚Äôs hair and stache](https://i.imgur.com/0og8irg.jpg). A friend of mine also is trying to make the nickname ‚ÄúBig Bird‚Äù happen, and every time I just think ‚Äústop trying to make fetch happen‚Äù"
Ever hear of inflation? Convert those stats to how they‚Äôd play in the modern era and you get something like Nikola Jokic
Replace Grayson Allen with Donovan Mitchell and Claxton with Nikola Jokic on a vet minimum
Nikola Jokic in the post
"Nikola Jokic was the most effective player in the league by advanced stats and MVP, so this proves nothing about Murray or Beal"
End of the 2015 season when they decided to start building around one Nikola Jokic by trading Nurkic
"Ben Simmons allowed 63% at the rim this season.  1.1% higher than the league average.  For reference, Embiid, Poeltl, Gobert, Capela and Turner all allowed less than 54%.  Sabonis allows 59%, Nikola ""worst rim protecting starting center in the league"" Jokic allows 63%.  Kanter, Towns, Wiseman, Jokic, ....  The only true bigs that are even in the same vicinity as Simmons are the infamously poor defensive ones.  Defense is the only thing Simmons is actually good at in the half court, and you want to run him as center to force him to protect the rim, a role in which he's barely on par with the worst defensive centers in the league ?"
"yep, defensive perception rises and falls with narrative. When a shit defensive player gets offensive accolades or has a great offensive season, suddenly people say, actually he's much better on defense than people think. See: Harden, James; Irving, Kyrie; Lavine, Zachary; Booker, Devin; Westbrook Russell; Jokic, Nikola, etc etc. Not all of those guys are equally bad, but what they have in common is their were suddenly considered improved defenders after monster offensive seasons. Do we really believe that's true? C'mon."
"this does not appear to be a very exclusive club. i looked through 1973-74 (the first year steals/blocks were recorded) and last season, found a bunch of names (ppg/rpg/apg/spg/bpg formatting)  Rick Barry (1973-74: 5th, 31st, 8th, 5th, 34th)   John Havlicek (1973-74: 9th, 35th, 9th, 28th, 42nd)   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1973-74: 3rd, 4th, 18th, 24th, 2nd)   Dave Cowens (1973-74: 23rd, 2nd, 22nd, 35th, 10th)   Sidney Wicks (1973-74: 10th, 21st, 23rd, 36th, 21st)   Bob Lanier (1973-74: 11th, 8th, 25th, 25th, 4th)   Sam Lacey (1973-74: 47th, 7th, 31st, 16th, 7th)   Rudy Tomjanovich (1973-74: 6th, 22nd, 48th, 47th, 22nd)     Nikola Jokic (2020-2021: 10th, 9th, 6th, 21st, t-50th)   Giannis Antetokounmpo (2020-2021: 5th, 7th, 23rd, 14th, 5th)   Bam Adebayo (2020-2021: 37th, 15th, 28th, 25th, 24th)   Pascal Siakam (2020-2021: 27th, 28th, 41st, 42nd, t-50th)    like 6 or 7 guys from last season gated by blocks alone, draymond gated by points."
"Nikola Jokic isn't the cleanest player in the game, he regularly fouls hard to stop fast breaks. That said this play I'm torn on whether it's dirty or not.  Nuggets fans say no, blazers fans say yes, so let's hear it from neutrals."

Nikola Jokic nearest comp: K. Leonard üòÇ
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"Robert Williams.  Sounds crazy, but I'll explain...  &gt;  Lebron James, James Harden, Nikola Jokic, and Luka Doncic are all triple double machines as well.  Problem with all these guys is they'll never get the blocks.  Lebron and Jokic, for example, have career highs of 5 blocks.  And 10 steals is bordering on impossible - it's only happened about 20 times in NBA history total - it's more flukey than anything.  So if we accept the next quadruple double is coming from points/rebounds/assists/blocks, you're really limited to big men who are terrific blockers, and specifically ones who can pass.  That's where Williams comes in.  He's hit highs of 9 blocks and 8 assists in separate games playing 22 minutes.  Most people realize he's an elite blocker, but they don't know how good of a passer he is.  He'll get the points and rebounds regularly, and I believe he'll triple double numerous times with either blocks or assists - so all it will take is one big game where he throws it all together.  Note I'm not saying this *will* happen - I just think he's got as good of a chance as anybody in the league right now."
"Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.   Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league.

Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)   And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.   Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.   Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.   So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"

"I define superstars as players who are capable of being the #1 option on championship (caliber) teams, which makes it Giannis, KD, Steph, LeBron, Kawhi and Harden. So for me the worst superstar is Harden, since he‚Äôs the only one out of those 6 I do not consider a top 5 player (when healthy). But with a more expanded definition my answer would be different.  Best non-superstar: Nikola Jokic. I believe he‚Äôs better than Luka, AD, Embiid, Dame among the rest of non-superstars."
"Oversized players for their position age really well.  Lebron's strength game + passing ability will make him approximate Nikola Jokic long after speed is gone.  Jokic is probably a better pure scorer independent of athletic ability though, but even a Walmart Jokic is really good."

If we‚Äôre considering Kyrie a PG and James an SG now I hold heartedly believe Kyrie is probably the best SG in the league (yes over Bradley Beal)  He had an absolutely amazing season this year, 9 in points per game, 11th in PER, and is the 9th player to make the 50/40/90 club, he also was having a good playoff run before he went down, and yes I do think Nets take the chip if Kyrie is healthy.  The Nets are a top heavy team that prides themselves on having 3 players who can go off at any moment and are borderline unstoppable when they do, I‚Äôve seen you say it‚Äôs best they trade Kyrie, and no offense, that‚Äôs BS too.  There aren‚Äôt 15 players in the nba better than Kyrie"
"Nikola Jokic, he is the league MVP however I have seen people try and claim he is better than guys like James Harden, and before these finals Giannis"
You know this will just result in people seeing less Nikola Jokic on national TV than they already do.  I'm surprised though that the Pistons with the #1 pick in the draft only have 5 nationally televised games.
"What does ""pack it up"" mean?  I think there's a tendency especially in the analytics side to think that teams are either rushing toward contention, rebuild, or mediocrity and sometimes fail to acknowledge incremental improvement is possible.  I think some of the teams on that list have gotten a little stale, like the Pacers, and could stand to shuffle the deck by dealing either Turner or Sabonis but that doesn't necessarily portend to an entire rebuild. But it should always be remembered that guys like Rudy Gobert, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and John Collins were taken outside of the lottery, so its not like those teams couldn't just try to continuously gain talent.  And some of those teams are in smaller markets which may not have the stomach to willingly break up an alright team and start from the absolute beginning again"
"As a brit, it seems like this is a bigger thing in the states? Anyone I've spoken to about basketball has no difficulty with the names but it seems really common in USA.  Even NBA journalists, ones who are spending a lot of their time with the players will pronounce Nikola (Jokic) in a different way from Nikola (Vucevic)... THEY'RE THE SAME NAME  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqZmK078WYI"
"They played 87 minutes together their last season in Denver, basically nothing.  18-19 they played 500 minutes together so &lt;1/3 of Plums minutes, but that lineup also got murdered in the playoffs leading to them abandoning it.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm exactly reinventing the wheel by pointing you probably shouldn‚Äôt put a non-floor spacing/non-perimeter defending big next to Nikola Jokic."
How is Nikola Jokic considered an unserious name? Can someone explain?
"You guys have done stupidly well with lower draft picks, so I'm inclined to agree that it's on Bol Bol.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Malik Beasley at 19.  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
"Utah has been straight-up sloppy these first 3 games. Mitchell tried to dribble out of traps and turned it over on 2/3 attempts. People keep praising Whiteside but I am seeing an alarming disregard of effort from him considering it's only the 3^rd game of the season; his recovery after a bad closeout on Jokic in the first half was... nonexistent. He didn't even try to come back into the play. I'm glad that he's a fake tough guy for the team because Utah was lacking one ever since Crowder left, but something to keep an eye on.  Denver has a great ""next man up"" mentality. They lost because they couldn't score as easily once Jokic went down (which is a big ""duh"", he's the MVP), but they really did still make it hard on Utah. I mean, Utah only had a 1 point lead at the end of the third quarter, and they played the whole second half without Nikola.  Glad they held out Jokic for the second half, both as a Jazz fan (for the win) but also because they'll need him in good shape if they want to make noise this year. He's so freaking good. Seriously."

So you've failed a third time to summarize what I said. I didn't say a complicated thing. I know you can. You just can't admit being wrong.

"Oh, you must have forgotten OG finished with 32 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists with 7 steals on 12/16 from the field, 3-6 from three, 5-5 from the line and 87.9% True Shooting. All while defending Jamal Murray through to Nikola Jokic. When Miles Bridges has a season better than OG's last season, then we can talk.  They are both basically splitting it so far. FVV is the primary ballhandler but in terms of shots against the Celtics it was 18 for OG vs 10 for FVV, against the Wizards it was 17 vs 20 and tonight against the Mavs 17 vs 15. Pretty much even, and that comes with FVV chucking up a couple of shots that he shouldn't such as trying to lay it in through two defenders of a drive or getting the ball off an offensive rebound and immediately throwing up a deep three with a defender in his face."

"I simply can't put a 5-time All-Star above any MVP, except for Derrick Rose and mayyybe Nikola Jokic (but he just needs a couple more elite seasons under his belt). Also, Drexler was flat-out a better two-way player than Miller. He was the Jordan Light and deservingly a much more accomplished player with accolades. Mikan was the OG Center, Cowens was one of the most dominant players in the 70s. Cousy-Havlicek-Pettit are historical legends.

That means the voters had him as a top 5 player in the league that year either way.
"List of players Paul Pierce was competing with for All NBA Forward position:   - LeBron James  - Tim Duncan  - Dirk Nowitzki   - Kevin Garnett  - Tracy McGrady  - Chris Webber   - Carmelo Anthony    List of players Anthony Davis is competing with for All NBA Center positions:    - Joel Embiid  - Nikola Jokic      That pretty much sums up the difference in All NBA selections right there for ya   Everything besides that is pretty self evident. More All Star appearances, FMVP, could actually consistently carry a team to the playoffs etc"

"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"

"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
"1. Anthony Davis, $32,742,000 2. Steven Adams, $29,592,695 3. Nikola Jokic, $29,542,010         3. Joel Embiid, $29,542,010         5. Kristaps Porzingis, $29,467,800         5.

"""As you know, the big Game is on Wednesday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants, our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest."" - Nikola Jokic"
"It's not all about what he currently is. That rookie contract extension is also what he will be for the Suns. This man is only in his 4th year in the league but has shown tremendous talent and fit with the Suns. We just saw his first playoff run, where he was one of the main guys on the team for both sides. He has a wide array of finishes in the post, and he has seriously improved defensively since his rookie season. He went from bad at defense to being able to handle his own against MVP big men like Nikola Jokic, as we saw from their series against the Nuggets. He deserves to get paid because he is the best bet the Suns have on a future center, and he will get better as time progresses and people will see that the contract will be worth it. Also, its not that he can't shoot, Ayton has above average stats for a big man. I mean, in a team with Devin Booker and Chris Paul, you don't need to shoot a lot, although he is capable of making shots from 3 - 16 feet. This contract should not only be banking on who he is right now, but also on who he can be for the Suns."

"Honestly that‚Äôs always the most amazing thing about Embiid to me. He has the passion to be that good in such a limited time frame. Like I remember hearing how he had only played basketball for a couple years before his time at Kansas and that just shocked me. He was so clearly insanely talented skill wise that I was floored he could be so good in such a short amount of time. He didn‚Äôt even seem ‚Äúraw‚Äù to me as a lot of people like to throw around regarding how he looked around the time he was drafted, he looked athletic as hell and just as if not more polished than almost every top big man I‚Äôve seen drafted since 2010.   The way he looked combined with the fact that he had such little experience just told me that 5-10 yrs down the line he was going to be playing insane MVP-level ball almost guaranteed if he could stay healthy. It was like watching the next incarnation of Hakeem or something, like you just knew he was going to be insane one day and I just knew both the Cavs and the Bucks would regret not picking him despite picking what looked like to me two almost guaranteed great players in Wiggins and Parker. Wiggins looked like the most interesting athletic prospect since Lebron and Parker looked to be the next Paul Pierce in my eyes, which made it even more nuts how good Embiid with basically 2-3yrs of basketball experience looked next to them.   It‚Äôs a big reason why I hate seeing the 6ers struggle with this Simmons thing. I honestly think Ben is the best ceiling raiser they can have compared to the most likely trade packages I‚Äôve seen for him, which absolutely kills me to see how he hasn‚Äôt been able to quite put it together (and to see how hard some fans have turned on him, but that‚Äôs a completely different conversation lmao) I really think if Ben and others on the 6ers would go in fully on Embiid being who he can really be we‚Äôd see them post an awesome regular season record and see an Embiid MVP winning year. Crazy it hasn‚Äôt happened yet, but not playing so many games per year doesn‚Äôt help his case.   Which also makes it so goddamn nuts that Nikola Jokic is our reigning MVP. Selected the same year in the deep 2nd round, basically completely unknown coming into the draft and not striking a single impression on anyone except Nuggets fans really paying attention (and arguably unknown his first couple of years in the league) and now he‚Äôs easily one of the most offensively skilled big men we‚Äôve ever seen and the reigning MVP. Such an absolutely insane time we‚Äôre living in for big men in the NBA, so many people say the era of the big man is long gone but IMO it‚Äôs just insanely evolved into the most nuts version of basketball big men we‚Äôve ever seen."
"&gt;He literally played again Nikola Jokic the reigning MVP and Giannis what more do you want?  I dunno, probably some more meaningful data than 3 preseason games.  I'm not a Giddey hater (I'm Australian, not sure I'm allowed to), I actually think he's gonna be pretty damn good, but c'mon bro, literally everyone falls into these traps every preseason/summer league. Probably wait at least half a season before you call him legit."
He was seen kinda like Nikola Jokic or Giannis. Under the radar a tad but still won mvp back to back because of team success. His 2003 playoff run was when people saw him in a different light and  he started being considered an all time great.

"If you love basketball, Nikola Jokic will get you paid."
"Well the Wolves also drafted OJ Mayo the pick right before Russel Westbrook in 2008,  Wesley Johnson the pick right before Demarcus Cousins in 2010, Shabazz Muhamed the pick right before Giannis in 2013, and Glenn Robinson III the pick right before Nikola Jokic in 2014. So I think the Wolves have this one."

"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
"Do we include Hakeem?  If we are, this isn't in order but my top 10 would be: Hakeem, Giannis, Manu Ginobili, Steve Nash, Yao Ming, Pau Gasol, Nikola Jokic, Dirk Nowitzki, Toni Kukoc, and Luka Doncic."

Nikola Jokic: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always nice to play in Miami‚Äù
Jokic bros may be some tough guys but they're definitely not mobsters.   Read into who Nikola Pekovic associates with these days to get a real run down on the organized crime in the region. Jokic bros might be involved with some shady stuff but they definitely are not mobsters when you consider theres actual mafia in the area.   Northern Serbia/Vojvodina (where Sombor is located) is tame compared to the other parts of the Balkans.
Nikola Jokic. Showed glimpses in his first few seasons with the low post passing but now he‚Äôs blossomed into one of the most talented passers in the league. Maybe even the most talented ever for his size
Young socialite Nikola Jokic
"Yeah the only great players we've missed on in the last 15 years or so are Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, DeAndre Jordan, and Marc Gasol. And the year we passed on Butler is the year we drafted Kawhi."
"Nikola Jokic on getting booed in Miami: ""I played in Serbia, brother. I wish you guys could feel that."" (via  @nuggets )"
"&gt; then stole their girls  You [mean](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/10/01/nikola-jokic-brother-charged-with-assault/) choked them, stole their phone, and locked them in a bedroom?"
"Congrats to the new owner of the Miami Heat, Nikola Jokic"
Why is red star's stadium so shitty in the first vid you posted? Also I didn't realize the NBA prospect Nikola Jovic also played for the same team that Jokic came from. The similarities are endless. Gonna watch that full game and check him out.
"Idk why people pretend there's clear-cut difference in quality between KLove's and Jokic's outlet passes. All the comments saying """"Love did insane passes"" holds true just as well for Nikola. I particularly remember a pass where he snatches a rebound one-handed, turns around 180¬∞ while catching the ball and pin-points an outlet pass from the baseline for easy 2. There aren't outlet passes that require more skill than this showcase by the Joker. I think Love has longevity going for him since he's been doing this since the early 10s but Jokic is just as skilled and accurate."
"14th? That‚Äôs bad to you? Just, middle of the road for a first option?  Yeah I‚Äôm sure playing basketball did ‚Äúcontribute to his demise‚Äù, it‚Äôs also what he got paid for. That‚Äôs his job. He wasn‚Äôt James Harden or Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic in this bitch."

"Grant wanted a bigger role with more usage. Nuggets wanted that role for MPJ so Jerami found a team that would give him what he wanted. Denver offered to match the deal but he said no.  Nuggets mismanaged that whole affair.  &gt; Jerami Grant on leaving Nuggets: ‚ÄúMy growth as a player is extremely important to me‚Äù &gt; In their sales pitch, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant to help develop him as a player, a source said. It didn‚Äôt matter. After Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr., **the best the Nuggets could offer him was a fourth option in a budding offense**. They believed that was compelling enough, in addition to the opportunity to play for a title contender."

"With Nikola out, I‚Äôve been watching more so to see if there is anything positive to take away from these games instead of watching for wins. The 3-point shooting of late has been encouraging. Monte and Jeff Green had good 3-point shooting games today and the last couple. AG has looked really, really good with an increased offensive load, which is something to watch when the big man comes back (18-7-4 on 63% from the field in the last 3 without Jokic). Free Zeke movement continues to build up steam with his great defense and his 3 point shooting has been good. With JMyke looking like a disaster on both ends, Nnaji might play himself into the backup 4/5 role soon. Hopefully, a lot of this stuff can carry over when Jokic returns and we can make a run. The hellish part of the month is over after Miami on Monday and a relatively soft schedule in the next couple of weeks despite 7 straight on the road."

"Year when Orlando drafted Bamba there was so many silly talks about how Mo is gonna seriously eat into Vuc's playing time and that Magic now gonna trade him, I drafted him in like 50 ish spot to pair with Jokic and Nikola's duo was blasting other teams away(also want to mention Nikola Mirotic, who was terrific that season but I couldn't get him nor on draft day or through trade)."
"That‚Äôs fair, I just think he‚Äôs gonna have a tougher time than some of the other guys ranking that high. He‚Äôs already defied expectations, but does he do that on a Jimmy Butler level or a Nikola Jokic level?  I think 5+ guys on that list will be better than Jimmy, but not Jokic. If he‚Äôs as good as Jimmy though, that‚Äôs a fantastic outcome. All of this is basically to say, he can be great and defy every expectation and still not crack the Top 5. I think the potential is there to be that high, but his current trajectory has him a little lower."
Proof? Says here it was taken outside of the Nuggets locker room: www.si.com/nba/2021/11/09/jimmy-butler-challenges-nuggets-bench-nikola-jokic-foul-video

"Whenever you devise a metric, you always want it to spew out like 90% what you'd expect and 10% you didn't.   Unrelatedly, the top 6 in EPM are   1. Nikola Jokic  2. Steph Curry  3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kevin Durant  6. Gary Payton II  Who would have expected Durant to be up there?"
Nikola Jokic
Nikola Jokic is a good basketball player and makes the Denver Nuggets a better basketball team with him on the floor
"[‚ÄúI hating you, Nikola, I hating you so much!‚Äù](https://downtobuck.net/2017/02/04/nikola-jokic-triple-double-20-pts13-rebs11-asts-full-highlights-232017/)"
"We all know its Nikola Jokic, but in all seriousness he has some of the most skill for a big man.  Since I know this thread will have mostly guards and wings mentioned like MJ, Kobe, LeBron, etc."
"Someone explain to me how Nikola Jokic gets 1 game for the hit on Morris, while Stew gets 2 games for hitting no one"
"It‚Äôs almost like the nuggets look like a completely different team without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji. Who could have predicted this?"
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
Too much positional overlap with Tobias Harris? Grant played with Michael Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic and was an absolute stud. I‚Äôm sure he could coexist with another great shooter and another great center
List is pretty funny if you only focus on one attribute at a time:   Nikola Jokic - the MVP is not winning the 100M dash any time soon  Nikola Vucevic - has the vertical leap of your favorite pet turtle   Zion Williamson - forgot that appetite was part of ‚Äúbody control‚Äù  Kevin Durant - your grandma can out-bench press him‚Ä¶ [seriously](https://hoopshype.com/gallery/kevin-durant-players-bench-press-nba-draft-combine/)
"[Nikola Jokic just walked to the tunnel and left the court. Might've been holding his wrist. But he also winked at a kid wearing his jersey, suggesting it's not too serious. Will follow up during post game. This one's over.](https://twitter.com/msinger/status/1461546641584914432)   From 11:07 PM ET, under 3 minutes left in the game. Hurting his wrist right before the game ends doesn't explain his total lack of effort the entire 2nd half against a team that was missing 55% of their roster payroll due to injury."
In terms of pure passing I would go: Chris Paul Trae Young Ricky Rubio Nikola Jokic Josh Giddey - I know heaps biased but in terms of pure passing I genuinely reckon the man is very much up there. Watch some thunder games if U disagree.

"Prime Harden is clear above AD. Jokic at this point is honestly above him too  Dame is a step below tho when both are healthy but even he's atleast had CJ and Nurk and LMA before those two. AD's best teammates were Jrue, 50 games of Cousins, and then like Nikola Mirotic lol"
"He is not that good. Talented at scoring but really weak build, and is getting pushed too much on defence, and cant defend paint at all. We will see, what people dont know is that all talents from Mega(team Jokic played for) are just padding stats, they play with extremly young line ups, and always play through one or two guys(uncharacteristic for Europe), so for every Jokic you have Bitadze(drafted by Indiana), Simonovic(drafted by Bulls), Luwawu(used to be your guy), ƒåanƒçar(Nuggets). Right now they have Nikola Jovic who seems legit pg and center Belcerowski who to me seems another stat padder.   Mega is club owned by Jokics manager and its purpose is to develop or sell players so the owner can get those sweet provisions. Im not saying it is bad the thing he is doing, but it is a scam a bit as you see players with even crazier stats than when Jokic used to play so he creates noise around them and they are not really nba talent at all or not nba ready, btw Jokic was crazy good when Mega used to have 4 veterans in the team."

Nikola Jokic
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
Nikola Jokic is the best C of All Time
"While I agree, there definitely is a thick, bold-face line between Lebron stans and people who are smart enough to know that Nikola Jokic is not a better player than Lebron lol  At their best, yeah KD and Giannis can probably edge out Lebron currently, and if you want to include Steph, I‚Äôm still picking LeBron over Steph to do everything but shoot a 3. But that‚Äôs the end of the list."
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard:¬†.277 ws/48¬†3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.¬†  I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt;¬†Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.¬†  Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.¬†  As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts¬†per hundred when he checks in,¬†that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.¬†  &gt;¬†Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.¬†  I don't know what your point is here with the¬†whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team.¬†Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.¬†  &gt;¬†And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here¬†because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient¬†scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.¬†  3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.¬†  I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.¬†  Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.¬†  The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.¬†  If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.¬†  [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"
"Nikola Jokic, for one."
Yeah bro it‚Äôs the difference between offensive and defensive ratings which are aggregations of how well a team scores or is scored on per 100 possessions while a given player is on the court. AD net rating is -6.1. This means that on average the Lakers are going to have 6 more points scored on them than they will score while Anthony Davis is on the court. Real plus minus takes away the per 100 possessions piece that removes pace of play as a component in the equation. His RPM is -4 this year. For comparison Nikola Jokic Net Rating this year is +14.

"&gt;What do you think Denver thought when they drafted Nikola Jokic? Or what Utah thought when they drafted Gobert and Mitchell. What do you think Spurs thought when they reloaded with Ginobili, Parker and Kawhi?  These are all perfect examples of good scouting, but a huge amount of luck.

"What do you think Denver thought when they drafted Nikola Jokic? Or what Utah thought when they drafted Gobert and Mitchell. What do you think Spurs thought when they reloaded with Ginobili, Parker and Kawhi? Tanking that's more then using an occasional opportunity (star gets hurt, local super talent comes up) is just a cover up for lousy management and destroys any winning culture and some young careers. Just to be celebrated to take no-brainer at 2 or 3. Lame. You don't tank for a Khris Middleton or Fred Van Vleet but those have rings on them.  GMs can't be celebrated for their success via tanking when others had even bigger success without tanking in the meantime. It only makes their lack of sportsmanship more obvious."

"Nikola Jokic has a shot to be in the same tier as Bird when it's all said and done.  Maybe better, who knows.  Can't wait to watch and see."
You know who is about that life....Nikola Jokic and the Jokic brothers straight out the warzone üëä
"I'm from the same town as Jokic. He's a couple of years younger than me and I moved away when I was young, just after the war. All of my cousins still live there. Some grew up with Nikola, the older ones with his brothers.  By all accounts Nikola is a real nice guy, but his brothers are absolutely not to be fucked with.   Sombor was never a battleground no. But I have memories as a child of artillery fire in the distance, the border of Croatia is only about 80 or so km away. And there are towns near the border on either side where buildings still have bullet holes, left as a reminder I suppose.  Military service was compulsory until 2010. That means that most adult men I know or he would have known would have served, and many would have seen action in a bloody civil war. In 1999 Serbia was bombed by NATO. My cousins hid in bunkers. Some of them would go to rallys/parties on bridges/air strips and other infrastructure because the attitude was fuck got nothing anyways.  Not your comment but someone mentioned how their parents were engineers and cops. This might mean something in the west/EU. To shed a little insight one of my cousins is a pharmacist. She makes 150 euro a month. Another is a trucker, he makes about 100 to 200 euro a month. Another is sales rep of some sort for a major international company he is lucky because he gets 500 euro a month and a car. My wifes cousin is a doctor in the capital of Belgrade, she makes about 500 euro a month. Average police salary is about 500 a month.   This is currently, 20 years after the last conflict when things are ""good"". In the time during and after the conflict most people just went to work and didn't get paid for months at a time because there just wasn't money. Some got wealthy by taking advantage but most were dirt poor and many remain dirt poor.  They didn't grow up with grenades blowing up in the streets but I can assure you that they did not grow up in some idyllic picture perfect setting.   Take what you will from that, I'm just some guy on the internet."

nikola jokic repeat baybee
Nikola Jokic is the best player in the league
Nikola is definitely a Jokic brother
Nikola Jokic would eat four hotdogs at half-time.  Wait that one is an actual Wilt story.
"Nikola Jokic has had over 20,000 liters of Coke"
"Because everything about the eye test with Nikola Jokic is wrong.  Slow lumbering unathletic center who won't challenge you at the rim.  But he is arguably the smartest guy on the court. He knows what a good shot is and a bad shot. With his quick reflexes, great positioning, and knowing what the other team is doing he doesn't need to ""body"" people instead he can swipe at the ball.   In my opinion his career will last longer since he won't be doing poster stuff. His biggest downfall is either his temper or his teammates.    Here's a breakdown of why his defense works.   https://youtu.be/nJTOX7QkXkg?t=2038"

"&gt;A forearm shove across the shoulders is just about the least dangerous way to hit someone.  - /u/Otherwise_Window   &gt;This hit that Nikola Jokic put on Morris is one of the most dangerous plays I've seen this season and in recent history.  - The first words in his video on the topic by Brian Sutter, MD  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR5c7gGOmIs&amp;ab_channel=BrianSuttererMD"
Nikola Jokic
KD has a 62% eFG% which is 20th in the league but is second  among players averaging at least 15 FGA/G with Nikola Jokic first at 66%. And Kevin Durant has a 65.5 TS% despite career low free throw shooting.
"&gt;The NBA has suspended Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic for one game,...    &gt;   &gt;Morris has been fined $50,000 for initiating the altercation, and Miami forward Jimmy Butler was also dealt a $30,000 fine for attempting to escalate the altercation."
Nikola Jokic.
"Nikola Jokic. Lol. Dude takes a beating every night, he‚Äôs strong as fuck, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him let cheap move go without retaliating. Lol."
Nikola Jokic is the offspring of Big Country and Larry Bird
"If Nikola Jokic continues doing what he's doing (he gets better every year) he has a real shot at being one of the best centers of all time not just second rounder. He needs a chip and mvp for the spectators but just looking at his stats, Big Honey is in a league of his own!"
"While I'm at it, here's who I think for the West:  * Nikola Jokic * Paul George * CJ McCollum * LeBron James * Brandon Ingram * Mikal Bridges * Anthony Davis * DeMar DeRozan * James Harden * Luka Doncic * Steph Curry * Kawhi Leonard"

Nikola Jokic is a very talented basketballer. A very rare mix of size and all-round ability. His passing is phenomenal. I would love for him to pair up with Luka and play for the Bulls.
"Nikola Jokic this season:  ‚úÖ 244 PTS ‚úÖ 112 REB ‚úÖ 104 AST  He joins Oscar Robertson (1961-62) as the only players in NBA history to record at least 200 points, 100 rebounds, and 100 assists through their first 10 games of season."

Yes. He possibly the greatest athlete to ever play in the NBA. He basically went up against Hall of Fame centers every other game for most of his career. Think of Nikola Jokic skills with Giannis athleticism.
"Why not?      Please don't tell me this subreddit is going to pretend that Ben Wallace was better than Jokic. Nikola is also definitely better than Vlade, Big Z, Jermaine O'Neal and Old Shaq. Stoudemire maybe had one or two seasons where he was better, Yao always missed like 30 games a year too. Dwight is probably the only debatable one."
"I‚Äôm going to get crap for this, but Nikola Jokic. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad passer, but he‚Äôs not as great of a passer as people make him out to be. I think that it‚Äôs a system thing. Any center can stand in the high post and link up with diving wings, it‚Äôs just a weird system by today‚Äôs standards. He‚Äôs an amazing ball handler for his size."
Nikola jokic the type of player to emerge a mutated and elevated superstar after the Vid.
"Nikola Jokic hasn't done so much to eclipse Dwight, Mikan, Bynum and Ewing."
"How bout a big stretch 5 that can set screens as well. Steven Adams for Nikola Jokic, who says no though? /s"
"Nikola ""1 revolution around the sun"" Jokic"
Nikola Jokic is your favorite player's favorite player.
"Luka and Nikola are my two favorite players, man! With Luka it's like watching MJ, Kobe, Lebron, Bird, great white sharks attacking, king cobras striking, etc., where you can feel the killer instinct through the screen. He wants to win like nobody else and he got the skills and the confidence to get that W, against anyone on this planet. It's a thrill to watch him every time! Nikola hits different, tho. He's more like a combination of a bear catching salmon and Mozart writing his greatest works. Jokic creates beautiful poetry through his passes, thinking outside of the box, while looking so unbelievably calm and cool. His vision, his creations, is far beyond anything I've seen since Magic. It's fucking art, amigo. You should watch more Nuggets games or atleast hit some of his youtube combilations up!"
I like nuggets and they taste good so I kept eating them - Nikola Jokic
Nikola Jokic is my hero
So with data we can safely say Nikola Jokic is the most clutch player of all time
"Luka is literally more clutch rn - this season 7/10 in the clutch, jokic is 9/16..numbers dont lie  Ok i was joking a bit, i know what you mean i just took you answer very literally...nikola is one of the clutchest players in the nba"

"Nikola Jokic is just the second player in NBA history to record at least 120 points, 60 rebounds, and 60 assists through his first six games of a season.  Jokic joins Oscar Robertson, who did so three times, the last occurring in 1963-64.  He was leading the league in assists per game prior to tonight.  A post on r/nuggets points out that he is the single best midrange shooter in the game since last season.  He is on pace to have the most assists as a center ever.  He is averaging a triple double and has 4 triple doubles in 7 games.  The Nuggets are off to a slow start with a new roster but are settling in and will be a top Western Conference playoff seed for the third season in a row.  His defense is better than you suspect.  He has one of if not the highest points for/points against differentials in the league.  I rest my case."

"Idk what the fuck people are smoking in here.  *Passing has nothing to do with ballhandling*  and  *""ballhandling"" is synonymous with ""handles/dribbling skills"" in this context.*  Nikola Jokic *does not* have better dribbling skills than Bam. Just stop it. Bam legit looks like a fucking SF with the way he moves with the ball. Jokic passes like a PG, but still moves like a big with the ball."
A) MVP - James Harden  B) MIP - Christian Wood  C) ROTY - James Wiseman  D) DPOTY - Anthony Davis  E) FMVP - Nikola Jokic  F) FINAL 2 TEAMS - Nuggets vs Nets  G) CHAMPIONS - Nuggets
"Luka ""Pre Bubble Nikola Jokic"" Doncic"
LMAO bruh when did Randle become Nikola Jokic. Dude was incredible tonight
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
" Ill name more than 5 better than him Gobert, Embiid, Jokic, Kat, Nikola Vucevic, Ayton, Brook Lopez, Aldridge, Porzingis    Need more?"
I would admit it.  But Nikola Jokic seems like he literally cant miss in the clutch
"&gt;Through five games, the Nuggets have a 120.1 Offensive Rating with Nikola Jokic on the court and an 88.5 Offensive Rating with him off the court.  In addition to this, he is seriously playing really good defense."
yeah it's just wildly exaggerated. There are like 2 teams in the league that were capable of playing Gobert off the court and 1 of them doesn't exist anymore and it's anyone's guess if the Rockets will either. You know who's at the top of the West now? Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. And Gobert is the best shot in the league at defending them.
"He is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic  In football terms Spida is like a flashy wide receiver. Gobert is the entire offensive and defensive line.   Remove gobert and we are the 2017-2018 Suns, (Mitchell being our Booker), 15 more losses a season and never cracking the playoffs"
Referring to Nikola Jokic as‚ÄùNJ‚Äù from now on
I mean Nikola Jokic and Anthony Davis just had so little impact on the playoffs last year.
Nikola Jokic and Steve Nash
"Yes I referenced his one game when telling the original commenter to calm down, I could have gone more in depth he‚Äôs gotten 24 points while being inefficient a couple times. ( guy is a extreme weirdo btw he‚Äôs in my inbox cause of this).    Besides that tho Did you not see my second comment where I put down the stat lines for all his games? He hasn‚Äôt just had one bad game he‚Äôs had a couple bad ones a couple average ones and then one good game. And no that‚Äôs not true if you took away Nikola jokic top 3 performances from last year he still looked great. The thing is that this is a ‚ÄúEXTREMELY SMALL‚Äù sample size but that goes over pistons fans heads. I guess when jerami grant is all you have to be excited about it‚Äôs dark times."
" Nikola Jokic is definitely the most skilled big man in the game . He‚Äôs all skill actually . For Embiid it would need to be something like 30/15/5/2/1 (PGs/rb/ast/blk/stl) to be a surefire MVP . I think the Sixers winning 55+ games comes along with that, and a top 2/3 seed"
Guy who spammed /r/NBA with how this random rookie center on the Nuggets named Nikola Jokic was going to be one of the best players in the league. He was eventually banned but he ended up being totally right lmao. We called him a madman...

Nikola Jokic: Certified Clipper Killer  Luka Doncic: Certified Clipper Killer  Serge Ibaka: Certified Clipper Killer
Calm down... They have Nikola Jokic.
"Trying to find a clip of a Jokic interview from a few years back talking about how to pronounce nikola. Hes like ""its nikola not nikola"""
"PG - Steve Nash $5  SG - Drazen Petrovic $4  SF - Detlef Schrempf $3   PF - Nikola Jokic $2  C - Yao Ming $1   We'll somehow make Jokic a PF, lol."
"""I love good passing, probably cause i‚Äôm a playmaker myself""     Can I interest you in one Nikola Jokic?"
&gt;Nikola Jokic 4.2   &gt;   &gt;Joel Embiid 3.7  Jokic has had two games of 0 free throws in like the past week and a half.     Embiid has had one game of 0 free throws his entire career.
The other version is the dude who elbows his own teammates in the head to steal rebounds and jacks up shots like he thinks he‚Äôs Nikola Jokic.
"So Nikola Jokic averages, got it."
Nikola Jokic
"Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  LeBron James  Giannis Antetokounmpo(imo, Zion is also great)   Nikola Jokic"
Lmao Greg popovich himself has said jokic is a reincarnation of Larry bird but all these internet GMs are acting like the comparison is invalid.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2903302-gregg-popovich-nuggets-star-nikola-jokic-is-a-reincarnation-of-larry-bird
"Yeah, that Nikola Jokic might be a star someday if he keeps on improving..."
"Marcus Smart, Steph Curry, Tyrese Haliburton, Zion Williamson, Nikola Jokic  A lot of great passers lol. No idea how good it would be but any team with Curry and Jokic would be insane."
"He has a 50%TS, he shoots below 55% at the rim (which would be mediocre for a 6'0 guard), he turns the ball 3 times per game, the only thing he was good at as a scorer (rim running) isn't even a strenght because has lost athletism since 2016 (his dunk rate has fallen off since then). He doesn't provides any spacing even vertical because he'd rather ask for a post up on every possession taking away any opportunity to drive.  He is the worst offensive center in the league this season, worse than Biyombo, worse than Baynes because those guys at least know they suck and don't waste 10 possessions per game trying to be Nikola Jokic"
Ever heard of um Nikola Jokic?
Steph Curry   Chris Paul   Nikola Jokic
"In no particular order:  1.	Lebron 2.	KD 3.	Harden 4.	Kawhi 5.	Giannis 6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Joel Embid 8.	Steph Curry 9.	Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Paul George 12. Chris Paul 13.

Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid
Nikola Jokic
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
Watching Nikola Jokic plays
Nikola ‚Äúhe ain‚Äôt Kanter‚Äù Jokic the 2nd worst defensive center in the league
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
"Jimmy Buckets,  Nikola Jokic, Lavine"
"what you talking about, if you are talking about lakers, i didnt want to mention davis because if i did you will find excuse in his injury, and i didnt write them in order, so your argument is stupid, best player in the world right now is Nikola Jokic, guy from Serbia, he plays for Denver, i dunno if you paid attention to that guy..."
"So by your logic, are we ready to crown Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid the #1 and #2 spot in the league just because they‚Äôve had statistically better seasons? You know better than this"
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry   5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetounkounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Damian Lillard   9. Luka Doncic   10. Joel Embiid   11. Jimmy Butler   12. Jayson Tatum   13. Bradley Beal   14. KAT   15. Bam Adebayo  16. Kyrie Irving   17. Paul George   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Anthony Davis   20. Chris Paul   21. Klay Thompson   22. Jaylen Brown   23. Devin Booker   24. Trae Young   25. Zach Lavine  Named 25 players I‚Äôd rather have, just for you champ. There‚Äôs more too."
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
It would have to be another Nikola Jokic because this one ain‚Äôt anywhere near good enough to do that
I refuse to believe that Nikola Jokic doesn't average a triple-triple.

Imagine thinking NIKOLA JOKIC gets a favorable whistle lol
Kinda wonder what Jamal Murray's career would be like if he didn't play with Nikola Jokic.  Has to be the worst second option ever in the NBA.
"Shout-out to the mvp frontrunner, tied for the 6th seed Nikola Jokic!"
back to Nikola 'Despite the L' Jokic ü•≤
Nikola Jokic allows 68.5 and 12.4 FGM a game at 35.9 mins per game.   Rudy Gobert allows 60.8 and and 10.2 FGM at 30.7 mins per game.   So essentially Jokic allows 2 more made FGs at the rim per game in 5 mins more of game time against what is generally considered the best rim protector in the NBA not insignificant but the reason why advanced stats love jokic it so much is the things he does do on defense including the most important part to actually winning the game rebounding. People overrate rim protection.
Lockdown defender Nikola Jokic how could I even forget
"Nikola Jokic, elite rim protector"
The best player is nikola Jokic and he hasn‚Äôt played for 8 years

"**TEAM TRIMMED GOLDEN STATE**  Prized rookie James Wiseman heads down to the team bus, only to see it roll off without him. New coach Shoddy Collection has decided to roll with Kevon Looney and not look back, leaving Wiseman on the sidelines.  Right away, there appears to be a method to the madness. With Looney working as a garage man glue guy, Steph Curry is able to shine even more. Curry averages 33 points per game through midseason, earning some MVP buzz in the process. Wings Oubre and Wiggins have some good games here and there, but still show their inconsistency from time to time.  The Warriors end the regular season with the 5th seed out West, and some lingering hopes of a deep playoff run. However, that won't be easy in the Western Conference, as they draw Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets in round one.  There, Looney and Draymond Green have a big test on their hands, as they try to cage up the Honey Bear. Jokic has a big series regardless, roaring to 25 points per game with 8 assists to boot. Curry does his part to fight back, scoring 37 points in Game 2 and 35 points in Game 4 to keep the series even at 2-2. Still, the lack of a signature and reliable second scorer leads to some gaps in their offense. The Warriors fall 4-2."
The floor spacing 5 is a myth   All these Myles Turner serge ibaka al horford Nikola Jokic types nobody guards regardless of what % they shoot. Teams let them shoot.

"**TEAM INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION**  The NBA is thrilled to announce a new franchise, particularly one chocked full of international talent. TV rights are through the roof throughout Europe, particularly in tapping into the Indian market.  While some pundits are skeptical that it will translate to the success ON the court, Team I.E.T. looks quite strong early on. The 1-2 punch of prime Dirk Nowitzki and Nikola Jokic proves nearly unguardable down low, particularly given their complementary skill sets. Dirk leads the team with 24 points per game, while Jokic adds on 17-11-7. Goran Dragic is no slouch either, picking up the playmaking slack when Jokic sits. The team ends up with the # 3 ranked offense in the NBA.  Defensively, the team has some issues, particularly in terms of the athleticism of the modern wings. Inexperienced Bavid Blatt struggles to come up with a system to stop the bleeding, leading the team to be ranked # 28 on that end. All in all, the statistical profile projects as a near .500 team that fights tooth and nail to make the playoffs.  With a 39-40 record, the playoffs looks like it may be out of reach. However, Dirk Nowitzki goes supernova in the final week, scoring 33 points, 37 points, and 35 points to finish up 3-0 and get the team into the playoff field with a 42-40 record.  That said, the playoffs doesn't go according to plan. Matched up with an offensive juggernaut in Brooklyn, their defense gets exposed and I.E.T. loses 4-1."

All you need to know is that Nikola Jokic is easily the most athletic player in the league
1. Nick Van Exel  2. Nick Anderson  3. Nicolas Batum  4. Nikola Jokic  5. Nikola Vucevic
"I'll go with current players.   1. Joe Ingles: Large part of Jazz's success. Great playmaker, defender, shooter.  2. Nikola Vucevic: Probably the 4th best Center behind Jokic, Embiid, Gobert. His current season is not being noticed with season averages of 24.6/11.6/3.7 including 40% from 3 and 85% from the line because his team is not doing well with 4 of their rotational players out for the year."
"[‚ÄúNikola attempts to win favor of superior Bosnian by sayings the flattery words. But I very much wary of Serb deceptions, and my hating of Nikola cannot being soothed just by words from mouth.‚Äù](https://downtobuck.net/2019/05/13/nikola-jokic-29-points4-blocks-full-highlights-5122019/)"
I'm gonna steal the ~~Declaration of Independence~~ Nikola Jokic
"[Check these stats from Joel Rush](https://twitter.com/JoelRushNBA/status/1369102106855018496)  &gt;If we can call 36 minutes per game a standard minutes load for NBA starters, then based on minutes this season, Nikola Jokic has played 36 games and Joel Embiid has played 27.5 games.  &gt;Btw, if this projects out to the end of the season, then Jokic would end up playing all 72 games, while Embiid at 55 would play 17 fewer than Joker -- nearly a whole quarter of the season."
"James Herbert and Sam Quinn have some sense about them, good to see.  &gt; and if you're punishing Jokic for his low seed in a brutal Western Conference, you're ignoring the mountain of statistical and visual evidence that screams ""no individual basketball player has been better than Nikola Jokic this season!"" Does a weak bench and injury prone set of teammates really make Jokic less valuable than anybody else?  Preach it Sammy boy!"
"No he doesn‚Äôt lol. The only thing Wood has on Capela is scoring and unless you‚Äôre Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, or Nikola Jokic, teams are far better off with strong defensive bigs."
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."

"Listen man I‚Äôm the biggest Michael Jordan fan in the world despite him tearing my Utah Jazz heart out in the 90s, so I get that we should appreciate the greats. But we are gonna raise a generation of kids that don‚Äôt know who the fuck Nikola Jokic was despite him playing in their day. You know how much I would have loved to see prime Arvydas Sabonis? They have that chance and these networks are taking that away so they can watch more LeBron. There is so much fucking talent in the league today it‚Äôs just depressing that the masses care about one player only."
Because LeBron James is more marketable than Nikola Jokic...
There was a fun [New York Times article about Jokic and waterpolo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/sports/basketball/nikola-jokic-nuggets-water-polo.amp.html)
Plumlee taught Nikola Jokic everything he knew
"I don't know how many times I have to say it. Not every person who picks someone else as an MVP is personally attacking the existence of Nikola Jokic. Some people still think Embiid is the MVP despite the missed time.   Not nearly enough of them are actual voters for it to matter Jokic won the award weeks ago when Embiid and LeBron went down and he will win easily in the official voting. It's not disrespectful to Jokic that the entire world doesn't think he's MVP, he has more than enough votes."

[You lost to Nikola Jokic](https://youtu.be/Xn1xG8ovc4c)
Depends on the team. MPJ is almost perfect to slot with Jokic. Where his limited shot-creation is offset by one of the best passers in the game. Also MPJ can provide weakside rim protection to assist the uh...leaping challenged Nikola out.  &amp;#x200B;  Most teams would probably want a guy who can distribute and create his own bucket though.
"Yeah tbh I don't understand the complaints about Knicks fans. You guys have been the ""lolknicks"" punching bag for years and aren't even that annoying rn. Like Nuggets fans were convinced of a literal conspiracy by Adam Silver to undermine Nikola Jokic, give Knicks fans some time to stoop down to that level of idiocy"

https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31250764/nba-mvp-media-straw-poll-anyone-catch-denver-nuggets-star-nikola-jokic
"Nikola Jokic: ""The injuries are all around the league. I don't know what's happening. I think we need to, first of all, protect each other on the floor, because we are eating the same bread...We can play hard and compete but I think we can play kind of safer."""
"AG is a big, athletic wing with some real foot speed, which is right now the best defender against Luka, but pretty much only when paired with another really long player to double team him. That way he can't just throw a (for him) easy pass over his defenders and I don't really like Denvers options for the second guy, because I don't trust MPJ yet to do it smartly. AG would probably do a fine job, but Luka gets his.  Denver has a better way to beat Dallas, than trying to slow down Doncic and that is to kill the Mavs with Jokic owning the post. With his passing, scoring, offensive rebounding, nobody on the Mavs roster seems like a reasonable option against Nikola, except maybe a Boban surprise, but that wouldn't work for a full series.  I've seen Murray in the playoffs, but that doesn't change my opinion very specifically on his effectiveness against the Mavs, he has struggled against Dorian Finney-Smith and even Tim Hardaway Jr a lot. Denver is obviously better with Murray, but they would miss him more against pretty much every other team in the West and even without him they are imo a slight favourite against a fully healthy Dallas roster."
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
"Nikola Jokic, on teams choosing not to double him all game: ‚ÄúIf you want to stay on –∫–æ—ö–∞ with me, I‚Äôm going to be one to get —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ –º–µ—Å–æ first ‚Ä¶ whatever hell that means.‚Äù"

"&gt;Why does team seeding affect the individual MVP Award? This is a genuine question, no one explains why it does only say it does.   it's almost like winning = good  &gt;Currently I believe Steph Curry is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Warriors from being the worst team in the league. (Source 1-7 with him injured).  Currently I believe DeMar DeRozan is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Spurs from being the worst team in the league.  Wait, no... that doesn't work. I forgot you have to score more ppg to be eligible and 21 aint gonna cut it.  &gt;Everytime his name arises everyone shoots it down because 9th seed.. Why?  because they are the 9th seed.   Bradley Beal is averaging virtually the same stats and is sitting at the same seed and nobody is bringing his name up in MVP conversation.  I wonder why?  &gt;Leading the conversation however is Nikola Jokiƒá who is putting up amazing stats but is also on a better team.  hmm... almost like Jokic is giving a very compelling reason to be at the top of MVP conversation.  &gt;This leads to another question, why is there no Offensive Player Of the Year Award when there's a DPOY award?  there is. it's called the MVP (or 6MOTY if you're on the bench).  it's not that Curry isn't valuable to his team, it's that other players are having a more impressive season and largely the reason they are in the seeding position they're in.  the Warriors are in the position they're in and aren't a better seed because Klay is injured, and if Steph was as valuable as you say he is, the Warriors should still be comfortably in the Playoffs.  i didn't see LaMarcus Aldridge be given an MVP in 2018 for carrying the Spurs to the Playoffs was Kawhi was out essentially the entire season."
You‚Äôre right like nikola jokic? Who is that guy?
"Steph time of possession is actually higher than Nikola, but anyways different playstyles. Jokic makes quick passes to reorganize the offense and Curry is more involved in finishing the plays often as a shooter.  I still think their offensive seasons are comparable."

"&gt;	and no it is not ‚Äòrecency bias‚Äô as i watched both earvin and nikola play lul. teh former is a sorcerer with the ball, while the latter is a sage.  Not here to debate who is a better playmaker, but having seen magic play in no way means you don‚Äôt have recency bias. In fact you couldn‚Äôt have recency bias in comparing the two if you didn‚Äôt see Magic play. Recency bias is the tendency to overvalue things you have experienced recently over those you‚Äôve experienced in the past. A common example is that juries are more likely to find defendants guilty in the US (and presumably other countries with courts that do this) because the prosecution gets the last word. The jury has seen both the prosecution and the defense, but they saw the prosecution more recently, so they side with them out of recency bias.   The bias experienced by those who haven‚Äôt watched Magic but have watched Jokic is exposure bias, not recency bias."
"Mine‚Äôs DWade, his speed and ability to shift the direction and finishing ability. Then Tony Allen, Andrei Kirilenko, KG, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Ben Wallace, Nikola Jokic all tied for second."
"1. John Stockton 2. Tyler Herro 3. Rick Barry 4. Kevin Love 5. Nikola Jokic  Hard working, lunch pail type of guys who are always first in last out. Not the flashiest players, but constant performers."
"Both Steve Adams and Nikola Jokic are farm boys, they are both amongst the strongest guys in the NBA, they have endurance, and have farms (worm farms and horse farms). Is there much of a difference - they play the 5. They do their job day in and day out as centers."
"*rings doorbell*  Hi there, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and MVP savior Nikola Jokic?  I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre familiar with him, he is rarely talked about, but here is a pamphlet on his stats this year.   Yeah, as a Nuggets fan I love seeing all Jokic love but my god has it turned up to another level recently. Super excited and hopeful he wins it this year, but man I don‚Äôt need to see his splits every Embiid thread."
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."

"I'm super high rn so imma just make my own pitch and hope the NBA adds me to their writing team:   A little kid keeps manipulating their parents with the best fake crying anyone has ever seen, but the crying is tiring out the parents just too much. One day the kid falls in the street and the parents are too tired to hear the kid crying this time. A bus is about to hit the kid when they're saved by a passing Nikola Jokic. The reigning MVP just came off not getting a single free throw in a 7 game 2021 WCF loss to the Lakers, and was out doing some long distance running to clear his head. After this meeting they bond and the kid goes on to show Jokic how to emotionally manipulate the refs and get free throws. Jokic then averages 20 FTs and 50pts a game through the 2022 regular season but right before the playoffs the kid gets suspended from school for cheating on a test and both Jokic and the kid have a shared growth experience learning some life lesson about honesty. Jokic goes on to try to win the playoffs without manipulating the refs for foul calls and has a miraculous journey through the WCF where he narrowly loses to James Harden and the Nets. Existentially content despite losing, Jokic then retires early to start a summer camp for kids where they teach honesty, basketball, and horse back riding. The end."
Nikola Jokic die or something?
one of those games was a game suspension because the NBA decided he came off the bench to join a fight https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/01/25/nuggets-star-nikola-jokic-suspended-for-leaving-bench-during-altercation/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILboRgUR6w0

Unless your first name is Nikola and last name is Jokic then no.
Nuggets play at close to a league slowest pace during the Jokic era. Probs not as big a difference as you presume. Particularly with Nikola on the court.

"Not saying he's some defensive stud but he's always in the right place and making everyone else on the team go to the right place. That type of stuff definitely gets overlooked. He messes up opposing offenses.   I guess I would say it as: Jokic isnt a good defender, but he makes it so the Nuggets have a good team defense when he's on the floor.   Nurkic was a better defender than him. Plumlee was a better defender than him. But the Nuggets always got worse on defense when either of them replaced Nikola. There's value in having a big strong guy with long arms always in the right place who's forcing the offense to reset regularly. It's just not exactly quantifiable by any current metric."
They just keep winning. Incredible. Nikola Jokic is really about to win MVP.

LMAO  If Nikola Jovic puts on 30lbs he will look identical to Nikola Jokic too
Not many thought Devonte' Graham could make the leap that he did. I don't know if even Nikola Jokic thought he'd be at the level he is today. It's not unreasaonble to say that it's possible. Embiid is 26 and could be a totally different player by 29.  I agree that it's a very rare level to achieve but I don't think it's stupid to say Embiid *could* do it. The injuries are troublesome but it's not like he's 34 and didn't achieve anything yet.
I didn‚Äôt realize it was a different name until now. I thought the 2nd guy was also a Nikola Jokic.
"I think the question is ‚Äúare you more scared of the nuggets than the blazers or mavs‚Äù not ‚Äúare you scared of any of these teams.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt really care how anyone views us in these discussions, but it does feel like each side is talking past one another here.  I will say one interesting thing that I‚Äôm looking forward to watching as a nuggets fan regardless of who we play...the nuggets have a history of playing up or down to their competition. Plenty of ‚Äúbad‚Äù losses (swept against the kings this year) but also plenty of resilient wins with our backs against the wall (both 3-1 comebacks, last year winning b2bs against bucks and then flying across the country to beat the jazz with only 7 active players). This team inexplicably seems to do *better* at times when they are short handed or their backs are against the wall. Part of that is sometimes because it forces Malone to play better rotations because his hands are tied (and rotations are *easily* his biggest weakness as a coach) but i think another part of it is that Jokic - and by extension the team - tend to play a bit more loose and carefree, which leads to our best style of ball which is the free-flowing ball movement offense that we have all dubbed ‚ÄúJokic ball.‚Äù There are times when the team tightens up and there‚Äôs no movement, lots of bad isos/ball watching etc. This team plays better on both ends when it‚Äôs more wild and free. Their defense feeds off of the offense in that regard - everyone is more engaged and switching etc.  After the 3-1 come backs last year, someone asked Jokic about the pressure and everything and he just said [‚Äúfor us there is no pressure. We just go out and play and have fun.‚Äù](https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2020-denver-nuggets-vs-la-clippers-nikola-jokic-says-pressure-is-on-clippers-after-forcing-game-7/60xs046zzyl61fsl26ll1c8zx). It‚Äôs a really interesting way of looking at things, and definitely jives with his comments this week after Murray went down about how being an underdog is nothing new to him.  If the nuggets get bounced in their first round series, sure it will be disappointing. But it won‚Äôt be that surprising given we would be without Murray and the majority of the chemistry that AG had generated in his short time here was playing off of the Murray-Jokic 2 man game turning it into a 3 man action with Porter and Barton as lethal spot up shooters. Especially if it‚Äôs against the Lakers, who most would consider the favorites if healthy (at least the favorites to take the west, if not the title favorites). Given that, the pressure might be on the other team to close out the nuggets without Murray."

"Are Shaq and Wilt playing currently in this era which is way different than the 90s? Like I said just take the easy example. Wilt played 48 mins a game when he was playing (and 40+ constantly). Just because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs Wilt‚Äù, there is NO WAY any coach would allow that to happen in today‚Äôs game. They don‚Äôt even allow LBJ to do that. So saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs Wilt‚Äù is meaningless when trying to put him in the modern game, which is my point.   There are only two great Cs that teams are building 100% squarely around and that‚Äôs Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. As I said, he would only average that many if he had Jokic like skills where he could also play on the perimeter/shoot 3s/pass facing the basket. In Embiid‚Äôs case, he could never average that many since the ball is in Ben Simmons‚Äô hands too much. For someone like KAT, they have a ton of younger players like DLo or Ant that get the ball too much."

Nikola Jokic (9.4)"
*Nikola Jokic
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
It's not even a hot take.  Theringer just put out a list of the best nba players and had embiid at #3 and Luka at #10.    https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/5/4/22416337/top-25-nba-player-ranking-lebron-james-nikola-jokic
"If that player were Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons, Giannis or Bam Adebayo I'd give them a chance, if it has to be someone else from their roster that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.  Also the Celtics need a 6th player on offense, preferably Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic or Damian Lillard"
"Okay yeah, Gasol as the bench 5, either Thad or Chris Boucher as the bench 4. Gasol isn't known for scoring on offense anymore but he's still got probably the best vision for a 5 out of any center not named Nikola Jokic."

"Nikola, what about my mental health as a blazers fan? my anxiety is through the roof everytime you touch the ball. i just know it's going in the basket.   as an aside, jokic always looks like he's battling through a cold to me. wipes his red nose on his jersey, puts hands on knees as if feeling exhausted, then scores 40."
"Maybe Nikola Jokic...  He's just 26 years old, getting his first MVP and his game will definitely age well.  Top 10 is huge of course, he needs a lot of success, so this is just a maybe..."
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"

I think prime demarcus cousins utilized more as a point center would have been awesome. He started to playmake more in New Orleans before his unfortunate achilles injury. He's an excellent passer and had a solid jump shot. He could have been a lot like Nikola Jokic but worse passer and better scorer.
I HATING NIKOLA JOKIC!!
"I so very much believe this statement in almost every instance... Except Melo. Hes moldy-watermelon soft. His entire career has been grabbing guys by the junk and then running scared if they get mad after the whistle blows.   His face last night after he pushed down Jokic and Nikola got up all quick? Priceless. He ran off the court too right after so I honestly think he literally pissed himself.   He even threw some words at lil ol Facu in between periods later in the game and bolted when Facu did the classic ""back up or step up"" quick step in response.   Like physically he's a specimen who could kick so many trashy fans salty asses. In reality he's as soft as they come and would back down scared from a fight with a preteen if we're being honest."

He might take the Nuggets matchup personally but he definitely doesn‚Äôt hate Jokic.    They said [some really nice things](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/jusuf-nurkic-says-nikola-jokic-deserves-mvp-if-damian-lillard-doesnt-win-it) about each other not even 2 weeks ago
"They definitely played like absolute ass tonight. But to be fair the Blazers have lots of solid to good players in general. Nurkic is one of the best all-around centers in the league not named Nikola Jokic, McCollum is normally a great second option on offense, Melo is an all-time great coming off the bench, Kanter is a solid backup at 5, Powell has been great. The only real issue they have is at the 4, Covington is easily their worst starter and the depth at the 4 is also their worst position. Although I guess they technically list Melo as a PF... Not a typical one though."
"Nikola Jokic postgame: ""I think (the officials) have the toughest job. They make a good call, a bad call, somebody‚Äôs going to yell at them. I don't know why anyone wants to become a ref to be honest."""
"‚ÄúFollowing the 2010-11 season, Kenyon Martin, J.R. Smith, Marcus Camby and possibly Chauncey Billups were going to be free agents that were likely to go elsewhere. With Denver planning to go younger, Anthony decided that he did not want to be a part of a rebuilding process.‚Äù  Here‚Äôs an article which tries to see how Denver would have fared if he stayed: https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/4/29/21240429/what-if-carmelo-anthony-doesnt-leave-denver-nuggets-2011-nba-offseason-nikola-jokic-masai-ujiri  So, no, they wouldn‚Äôt have had the personnel to go deep into the playoffs. Specially in the West.  So boo him all you want but boo the rest of the Blazers just as much as you do him..or at least all the other previous Nuggets in the team."

"Yeah, pretty much, except the reason they don't call Jokic ""Nikola"" isn't that it's hard to say, it's just that there's more than one good player named Nikola in the league right now."
"God I can‚Äôt stand Nikola Jokic. He‚Äôs such a stupid arrogant asshole. I just get so frustrated every time I see his stupid manly jawline, and dumb perfect goofy smile, and idiotic beautiful blue eyes.  Seeing him run around on the court and hit these ridiculous floaters, I just get so angry that it makes blood rush to my penis and it gets little bit hard from sheer rage. I just wish I was out on the court so I could run up to him and foul the shit out of him as hard as I can, tearing his jersey a little bit while I knock him to the floor. I'd look directly into his stupid, beautiful face as I rub my crotch on his muscular leg. I‚Äôd get as close to his face as I could and whisper in his ear softly ‚ÄúI got you, you fucker. You‚Äôre not as good as you think you are.‚Äù  Then for good measure I would put my lips on his face so that I could taste his fear and I would smell his hair so that I knew what it was like to dominate Nikola Jokic. Oh how I want that. I think about it at night sometimes when I am in bed with my girlfriend. I just want to know what it‚Äôs like to be on top of Jokic like that.  Stupid, beautiful Nikola Jokic. I just hate him so much."

"This take is getting old and boring. Rudy Gobert struggles vs elite pick and role players and Dame is near the best.

Almost every traditional centre struggles in the pick and role vs elite pick and role players.   According to synergy which has the video data of every pick and role every big has guarded all year Jokic grades out in the 71st percentile, and Nuggets as a whole were the 7th best in the league at defending such plays along with the 11 best defence overall.   https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nikola-jokic-nba-mvp-odds-analysis-matt-moore-2021  The Nuggets defence was bad all around game 1. Blown rotations when they brought a 3rd guy. Guards died on every screen. And, Portland shot the lights out and were crisp with their passing. They shot 50% during the competitive portion of the game from 3, and were 1 made 3 from a franchise record.   Portland will get buckets, but a little cooler shooting, and better defence will help."

Murray is an imbecile who don't know how to run good (and of course, he tears his own ACL all by himself)  Morris is (still) a g-league.

"Nikola ""Bruce Lee"" Jokic"
Nikola Jokic is the best player in the league are you kidding?
"On a scale from one to ten, how embarrassing is it that nikola Jokic is like a top 10 best thing to happen to me in my life"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"Tell me lol. Look at this statement from Zach Lowe from this year ROY against 2016-2017 ROY.

Nikola Jokic and Bill Russell can be connected the world is complete.
"Sheesh, hope he doesn‚Äôt call Blazers/Nuggets.  Although I guess the matchup between Nikola Nurkic and Jusuf Jokic might be interesting‚Ä¶"
Nikola Jokic is the most humble athlete in the history of professional sports ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Shaq said teams don't gameplan for Rudy Gobert's defense. They do.  Shaq spoke (I think) Russian to Serbian Nikola Jokic.  Shaq called Julius Randle Zach Randolph.  Shaq said that the Utah Jazz aren't playoff contenders.   At the very least, I'm convinced Shaq doesn't watch."
Close but between Nikola Jokic and Kawhi
"No awards show according to the ESPN article  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31479904/nikola-jokic-stephen-curry-joel-embiid-named-finalists-nba-mvp-award  &gt;The NBA is reverting to its longtime tradition this year and announcing the various award winners during the playoffs, as opposed to the recently created end-of-season awards show. The league did the same thing during its bubble at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, last year."
I‚Äôll leave this here   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10003320-stephen-curry-nikola-jokic-joel-embiid-finalists-for-2021-nba-mvp-award
Three degrees of separation between Nikola Jokic and Magic Johnson. Nice
"You‚Äôre free to come to Portland anytime, Nikola. Continue the Portland legacy of ginormous, white, elite passing big men   (But for real, is dame / jokic the most fun hypothetical duo possible?)"
Listen guys. I think Steph was the best player this year. But y'all underestimating how good of a floor raiser jokic is himself. How do you guys not remember the disaster that was the first 20 games of the season where we were outside the Playoffs. We had one constant.   Nikola Jokic. Dude carried us so hard and we were the best team in the league after March or April idk which month.
I don‚Äôt know if him getting more gassed playing the 5 is actually true against certain teams like the warriors. It‚Äôs not like Joel embiid or nikola jokic is on the other side this game and either way he would probably still be guarding Draymond (either because Draymond is the 5 or because they put the the power forward on looney).
Guys Nikola Jokic is still the MVP
Have you ever heard of Steph Curry? Or Nikola Jokic? Or maybe you‚Äôve heard of Damian Lillard?
"Nikola ""Joker"" Jokic would captain the supervillain team."
"Draymond guards AD pretty well.  Now a guy like Nikola Jokic, that's a losing matchup for Dray."
nikola jokic disagrees üòÆüëé
"Blakes situation is strange because they didn't have to do it. Those type of buyouts usually happen in the last season, not the year before. Obviously it was a favor to his agency. Excel Sports management. Tiger Woods is their biggest client.   I'm going to freak you guys out. They have a very interesting name as a client.   Nikola Jokic."
"People should be worried about Nikola ""Light Jog"" Jokic."
"&gt;Acting like MPJ Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokic are incapable of scoring on the offensive end is silly  Lot easier to guard them when you aren't worried about Facu and have a non-factor on offense in McGee dude. Not like Gordon is much of a threat outside of the paint either.  Which, you know, would be clogged with McGee there  &gt;McGee will force Nurkic down in the paint and off Jokic or he‚Äôll feast  That's the point dude. Nurkic gets to hang out in the paint. Just throw Covington on Jokic and you double him any time he gets in the paint with Nurk  MPJ ain't gonna beat us himself Can always just throw in DJJ if Powell is struggling. The point is that the Blazers guards would fucking exploit the hell out of McGee and Jokic in the PnR. That lineup is flat out too slow to be running around chasing these Blazers guards. You want Jokic running around the perimeter on defense? Or McGee?"
Terrible clickbait headline.  CBS Sports [published their writers ballots](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2020-21-nba-awards-picks-nikola-jokic-unanimous-mvp-experts-dont-agree-on-rookie-of-the-year-dpoy-winners/).  Jokic got all 8 1st place MVP votes. Curry got just one 2nd place vote and two 3rds.   Lamelo got 7 of the 8 ROTY votes.
"Nah dude he‚Äôs been miles ahead of everyone this season, it‚Äôs a crime if embiid gets votes with how many games he missed. It‚Äôs okay if curry gets some votes, but he really shouldn‚Äôt get any 1st place votes being the 8th. Nikola Jokic has been more of an offensive force, Stephs just been a more exciting show with his shooting. It‚Äôs cool everything he‚Äôs been doing but Jokic has a much better case given his stats, advanced stats, record, and playing in every game this season."
"Blasphemous?!?! Are u fucking kidding me? I dont think people understand how fucking good Nikola Jokic is. Not better than Dirk? Comparable mid range and scorer similar defender and a fucking 10 times better facilitator. Jokic has the playmaking ability of Nash and the scoring of Dirk in fucking one body. I understand if you would choose Dirk or Nash over Jokic but to say Blasphemous is downright stupid. You say not the entire career so you are just talking about their MVP years, its funny though because all 3 of the MVPs between Dirk and Nash werent even in their best years."
Paul Millsap on what it‚Äôs like playing next to Nikola Jokic:     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheeseburgers. He‚Äôs throwing free cheeseburgers. I don‚Äôt eat cheeseburgers ... but if they‚Äôre free...‚Äù
"sure but you know we're also living in the time of LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, quite possibly Luka Doncic and Chris Paul and we also saw Kobe Bryant.  Fuck if Steph weren't around Klay Thompson would be getting discussed as the GOAT shooter."
"If Nikola Jokic wins, he'd be the first MVP from Serbia. It would be the second time that consecutive MVP winners are not born in the continental United States. First time that happened was Steve Nash (2005, 2006) and Dirk Nowitzki (2007).  Nikola would also be the 6th MVP not born in the continental United States, joining Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria), Tim Duncan (US Virgin Islands), Steve Nash (born in South Africa to British parents but raised in Canada), Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), Giannis Antetokounmpo (born in Greece to Nigerian parents)."

"When's the last time a top 10 RPM on high total minutes was a total fluke?  I remember when people use to say ""don't listen to RPM, Jahlil Okafor is better than Nikola Jokic"".

I‚Äôll rewrite my original comment if you didn‚Äôt like the wording here we go:  Chris Paul is playing well on a winning team. He beat the team the best player alive (LeBron) who is on the Lakers with his team the Suns. They are now eliminated from the playoffs. He and his team are now up 2-0 in the second round of the 2021 playoffs against Nikola Jokic (the MVP).
I HATING NIKOLA JOKIC!
"Dude no way in the Alabama fuck did you just utter Jason Williams‚Äô name in comparison to Nikola Jokic  Do agree Jokic is a far cry from top 5 when you have lebron, CP3, magic, bird, Stockton, nash and other greats"
Nikola Jokic can't play 1 vs 9 forever.

Bullshit.  He's *a lot* like Bird.  Celtics announcers gush about it every time they play.  Even Popovich has made the comparison:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2903302-gregg-popovich-nuggets-star-nikola-jokic-is-a-reincarnation-of-larry-bird
Nikola Jokic. 41st pick in 2014 nba draft
The revenge year of the Spurs is the best basketball I have ever seen and it isn't close. That entire team was on fire. The ENTIRE FUCKING TEAM. Even the fucking towel boys were catching sweat as it dripped from Tim Duncans body. Boris Diaw was looking like Nikola Jokic that series.
This brings a smile to my face. Nikola Jokic is pure talent and a joy to watch play basketball. Congrats and lets keep digging for Nuggets!

"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed.

"Yeah, remember the guy who said that If he were to win the award, Nikola Jokic would be the worst mvp of all time. I believe that He admitted to doing it for the clout.   Also, Skip Bayles has built his career off of insulting good players. Media thrives off of clout and controversy."

"Nikola Jokic is the first MVP born in Serbia. Nikola joins Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo in the group of MVPs not born in the continental United States.  With Nikola (2021) succeeding Giannis (2019, 2020) as MVP, it's the second time that two MVPs in a row were not born in the continental United States. The first time was when Dirk Nowitzki (2007) succeeded Steve Nash (2005, 2006)."
"""*To be honest, I didn't even think about being in the NBA.*"" - Nikola Jokic"

"I am a lifelong Mav fan. My friend has mavs season tickets. I told him ""ya know, Luka might never catch Jokic""(as far as just pure fuckin skill; Jokic does crazy shit for a big man) my friend did not disagree.  That's how good this man is.   Props Nikola. Now win the west"
"After the AG trade, if you actually watched us play, you‚Äôd know that our entire starting 5 was balling on both ends of the floor.  AG did a ton to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù some of our guys. It allowed flexibility and fluidity between him and Porter at the forward slots. And it also allowed 6‚Äô6‚Äù will Barton to slide up to his natural position of SG. So with Murray/Barton/Gordon/mpj/Jokic we were basically switching everything 1-4 and occasionally 1-5 as well. We had a ton of length and flexibility.  Additionally, he helped unlock offensive sets that were just near impossible to guard. We are all familiar with how deadly the Jokic-Murray 2 man game is, but we were actually able to incorporate Gordon and his rim pressure into that with Barton and mpj spotting up on the outside.  [This article goes into some depth on what he brings and some clips of what I was talking about](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/6/22369360/aaron-gordon-trade-denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic)   [Another action with Gordon‚Äôs gravity unlocking MPJ](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1376563611712229382?s=21)  [Here‚Äôs some defense](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1376559673093062657?s=21)   The team was playing with such energy and focus. They were dialed in on both ends and turning defense into offense consistently. It‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever seen the nuggets look. It was beautiful basketball. Pure poetry in motion to watch.  Anyway, Murray and Barton were a big part of that. Losing them hurt us across the board, including defense"
Nikola Jokic is good at basketball.
Harvard grad MVP Nikola Jokic. What a man!
"Some of his past submitted posts:  &gt; Comparing Porzingis and Jokic to rookie Gasol and Dirk. The generation of great European big men.  &gt; So far Jokic has the highest PER from any rookie drafted in 2014. (He was picked 41st that year)  &gt; If the Grizzlies called and offered Mark Gasol straight up for Jokic, would the Nuggets consider it?  &gt; Nikola Jokic 16 Points Full Highlights. Next Dirk?  &gt; Could we trade for Blake Griffin in 2016?  &gt; Cousins to the Nuggets trade, Is it possible?  &gt; Are Kyle Lowry and jeff Teague better than Ty Lawson? If so, why?"
"Nikola Jokic has won the 2020-21 Most Valuable Player award, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. Jokic, born in Serbia, is the third European player to win the award, following Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) and Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), and the fifth player to win it from a foreign country, as Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria) and Steve Nash (Canada) are prior winners as well. In addition, Jokic also became the lowest-drafted player ever to win the award. He was the No. 41 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, making him the first second-round choice ever to be named MVP. Antetokounmpo and Nash, both picked No. 15 overall, previously held the distinction of lowest-drafted MVP"
"If there's one player you don't want to join a super team, it's Nikola Jokic. Dude has legitimately never played with a second star in his life and has carried them to decent records and playoffs series wins for consecutive years. Denver's championship chances are heavily dependent on pairing him with another superstar or multiple all stars"
"Congratulations to Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets and their fans. We all knew it was coming for months, but it's basically official now. Well deserved."
Nikola Jokic upon hearing that the NBA voted him league MVP: ‚ÄúThey said that? That‚Äôs lit.‚Äù Said he loves being Jokic that‚Äôs the MVP of the league.

If you honestly don't think gobert made jokoc work harder than anyone ever has last playoffs idk what to tell you.  To be clear jokic still had a great series and he will again when they match up next but gobert does make it hard for him and it is the most difficult match up in the league for Nikola.
"It's more of roster construction tbh. They played well, especially how they handled Jokic. They just didn't have another serviceable big that can body Nikola when Nurk had to sit."

For win or lose, Nikola Jokic will rip your heart out over and over. He is a relentless, pasty trickster god of basketball. His size, complexion, clunkiness and (total lack of) speed combine to create an optical illusion where your brain sees this enormous bumbling man and all of your experiences in life to this point have conditioned your brain to believe that surely this enormous, weirdly shaped snorlax of a human is about to fall to the ground because he forgot where his feet were.   But no, instead he‚Äôs going to dance through your entire defense like they‚Äôre fucking cones and drop 50 on you and assist on his teams other 70 points by telepathically moving the ball wherever the fuck he wants.

I'm not gonna defend what he did with China. It was dumb and it was selfish. But the vast majority of people who hate him already had an irrational hatred of him for like a decade before that and simply use that as an excuse. If Nikola Jokic had said the same thing there wouldn't be millions of people spamming posts saying pretty gross stuff about him.

"&gt;&gt; To be a center you just have to be born tall  I mean tell that to Nikola Jokic. Hell tell that to Jahlil Okafor or any of the host of other 7-footers who can't cut it in today's league. The skill level required to play center in the NBA is extremely high, higher than it's ever been. There have been really tall people in Europe for a long time - better player development is driving the emergence of all these foreign bigs.

Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there‚Äôs a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
"&gt; Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid and Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic -- right on his heels.  So Jokic was right behind him and Jokic‚Äôs 2nd half of the season was more impressive than his 1st half.  Not to mention, that ranking is subjective and not a true representation of NBA voters. It was something ESPN put together to imitate the MVP voting.  Not to mention their was multiple points prior to embiids injury where Jokic had better odds."
"So nice to see Cam Payne miraculously come back from what was supposed to be a devastating season ending injury when Serbian gangster Nikola Jokic grazed his ear and hit the ball hard.  So inspirational, don't give up on your dreams boys and girls and people of all genders!"
"Username checks out.  According to DBPM, Nikola Jokic is the 6th best defender in the league. And Luka Doncic is a better defender than guys like paul george, richuan holmes, capela, and smart. And Duncan Robinson is a better defender than Lugentz Dort and Jaylen Brown."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12. Seth Curry 13. Pascal Siakam 14. Fred VanVleet 15. Zach Lavine 16. Nikola Vucevic 17. Jarret Allen 18. Colin Sexton 19. Jerami Grant 20. Domantas Sabonis 21. Malcom Brogdon 22. Giannis Antetokounpo 23. Khris Middleton 24. Jrue Holiday 25. Trae Young 26. Clint Capela 27. Lamelo Ball 28. Jimmy Butler 29. Bam Abedayo 30. Russel Westbrook 31. Bradley Beal 32. Nikola Jokic 33.

LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
"How about MOVING SCREENS?   Guys like Nikola Jokic and Draymond Green NEVER set legal screen ever, because they know they won't get called for it, and it's a huge advantage on the defender."
"Jokic, Gasol, Kat, Sabonis, and Bam are the top 5 for play making centers. Embiid is not nearly as good as any of these 5 players as a passer.   Al Horford - 4.5 assists per game over the last 7 seasons. Better assist to turnover ratio than Embiid  Nikola Vucevic - Pretty self explanatory here. Could be in the top 5 honestly.   These two are also better so that‚Äôs 7 right there. There aren‚Äôt many good centers in the NBA. It‚Äôs easily the weakest position.  So back at 8th-10th he‚Äôs competing with players like Nurkic for play making.  Being 8th-10th among centers isn‚Äôt that good compared to being 8th-10th among PGs or Forwards.   He‚Äôs better than average for the current lineup of centers in the league but as a player compared to the rest of the league, he‚Äôs a mediocre play maker."
"The NBA markets big stars. Luka, Giannis, Jokic are marketed pretty heavily. Booker was plastered everywhere as the next Kobe after his 70 point game, the Suns prolonging their rebuild and losing out on that hype is solely on them. Trae is the league's favorite young villain right now, he's gonna be on national tv a lot more now that his team is winning. Hell, this sub has been fuming because the pelicans were being overadvertised despite being a bad team all year thanks to the league being in love with Zion.   The Pacers and the Jazz were marketed in the 90s because of Reggie Miller and Malone/Stockton, not to run some small market charity. Get a generational talent, your team will get air time. The league not exuberantly advertising Nikola Vucevic or Kemba Walker isn't a wild anti-small market conspiracy lol."
"Unless that center is Nikola Jokic, then you're alright."
"2011-2021  PG: Trae Young SG: Kyle Korver SF: Kobe Bryant PF: Blake Griffin   C: Nikola Jokic   Lobs, threes, pretty passes, and *vibes*."
"Think about it this way. You play 82 games in the regular season. 7 months of the entire season. That's by far the majority of the NBA season. I don't know about you, but I think the player who's perceived to have performed the best 7 months of the entire season should count a big deal.  Let's look at this season for example. Nikola Jokic. He performed better than anyone for 72 games of the entire season. By far the majority of the season. But then he got swept in the playoffs. So should his entire season be swept under the rug because he performed bad for 4 games although he played better than anyone for 72 games?  So yes, the mvp is opinion based. But come on, if you are perceived to have played better than everyone for 82 games (7 months) in the season, that should count a  big deal."
"You know, I wanted to come at this comment because on its face it seems absurd, but let‚Äôs go to the numbers. Jokic was picking his shots and scoring in Aytons face, he had that nice triple double in game 3, and he did nicely overall in that series. Let‚Äôs look at the stats.  Jokic points went 22, 24, 32, and 22 (granted he fouled out in the last one)  Ayton had 20, 15, 10, and 20.  Jokic had 9, 13, 20, 11 rebounds.  Ayton had 10, 10, 15, 7 rebounds.   Even just looking at the stat lines, its clear Jokic had a leg up on Ayton in those games. But that‚Äôs without seeing the reaction from Ayton himself: https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/nba-playoffs-suns-nuggets-watch-deandre-aytons-hilarious-reaction-to-nikola-jokics-stat-line  &gt;‚ÄùYup, he‚Äôs the MVP‚Äù  I think it‚Äôs clear Jokic is a better player than Ayton, right now. But why wouldn‚Äôt he be? He‚Äôs got tons more experience, he‚Äôs the MVP, he knows his game. Ayton is just starting.  I think what‚Äôs clear from looking at the stat lines is that, aside from game 3, that‚Äôs not the performance I‚Äôd expect from an MVP in a playoff series. Ayton clearly had enough of an impact that Jokic was not simply having his way on the court. Jokic isn‚Äôt averaging 35 points a game.   Give the man his due. Ayton did. Can‚Äôt we all just get along and get back to what‚Äôs important: making fun of Ben Simmons?"
"It would help his chances oh, and I just want to reiterate Nikola jokic 100% deserved the MVP this year but if Greek Freak get the finals MVP in the title and get that monkey off his back , I'm sure he's going to play with a shit ton of confidence next year and maybe even get the number one seed again with ridiculous numbers so it's very possible yes"
No particular order: KD. Kawhi. Lebron. Steph. James Harden. Joel Embidd. Giannis. Luka doncic. Anthony Davis. Nikola Jokic.  Who you replacing?
"Because he was a really good offensive player, great even but he was not incredible.  I'll shock you even more.  You ready?  Nikola Jokic right now is a better offensive player than Duncan was."
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Nikola Jokic  That's a championship team.
"He forgot about his 2 sons, Nikola Jokic and Anthony Davis"
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in ‚Äúic‚Äù just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You‚Äôd have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
Nikola jokic would like a word
"lol jeez Demarcus ""Nikola Jokic"" Cousins"
"Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic would murder Dwight, he struggled like crazy to guard Pau and Jokic is Pau's skills on steroids, plus bigger."
"-Draft that fat kid, maybe his mom packs him some cookies  -MAYBE HIS MOM MOVES IN WITH US AND BAKES US COOKIES EVERY DAY  -Brooo  *And with the 41st pick, the Denver Nuggets select... Nikola Jokic!*"
Nikola Jokic and the MVP award
I got shit on in the Jokic thread talking about how Booker wasn‚Äôt really about that life with a 7 footer when he was chirping Nikola. Meanwhile Tre is out here really trying to body Embiid.   *There‚Äôs levels to this*
"Nikola Jokic, literally that‚Äôs it. A bunch of 4s when they play the 5 too like Kristaps, JJJ, or small ball guys like Gallo or Portis, etc.  And Jokic has to be contested because you have to try to limit the passing angles, not just the shot.  other centers who take 3s don‚Äôt get really get contested, so the defense isn‚Äôt being stretched.  Myles Turner makes between 1-2 3s per game. That‚Äôs 1-2 extra points vs a more efficient 2 per game. Whoopdie do"
"It‚Äôs just the appeal of the unknown. Every 15th pick COULD be Kawhi Leonard. Every 2nd round pick COULD be Nikola Jokic. But more often than not, those picks just end up being dudes you‚Äôve never heard of."
"I feel like this says everything that needs to be said about this metric  11 - Nicolas Claxton  12  - Dorian Finney-Smith  13 - Nikola Jokic  tie 17 - Kawhi Leonard, Ben Simmons"
Nikola vucevic. Rim protection might be ass but on offense you got budget jokic and zion. Naisu
"&gt;You literally have no clue what I‚Äôm talking about. A unanimous MVP is when a player gets every single first place vote for MVP.   Yes, and there was no better player than Nikola Jokic this season. [Here's the argument](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nikola-jokic-nba-mvp-odds-analysis-matt-moore-2021), if you care to educate yourself."
"[https://www.insider.com/ranked-best-centers-nba-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic-2021-4](https://www.insider.com/ranked-best-centers-nba-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic-2021-4)   Not my list, but I find it easy to rank Theis firmly behind every name on that list.  I think Horford is a big step up from the Centers you've had in his absence."

"Under the radar on the whole Wiseman development thing is that the Warriors have brought in a new assistant coach to replace Jarron Collins this offseason: Dejan Milojevic, a guy who's coached several eventual-NBA-level big men with Mega Basket in Serbia--Goga Bitadze, Ivica Zubac, and most notably Nikola Jokic. While Jokic's passing isn't something that can be taught, Milojevic is apparently an excellent teacher of footwork, which is quite promising."
&gt;Luka is younger than Nikola  Age doesnt necessarily matter as much as people think though. Because you can loose luka at the end of his contract. And jokic has probably 8 more years in the league at a top level wich means his age doesnt matter much.
&gt;Who are the 11-15 players in the NBA?  Nikola Jokic
guard with center skills = ben simmons   center with guard skills = kevin durant/nikola jokic???
So do I want Nikola Jokic or Shabazz Muhammad?  Wow tough choice
ESPN: Does Nikola Jokic hate playing basketball?
Does anyone genuinely think Luka Doncic or Nikola Jokic are attractive?
"KAT is the perfect big for this generation of bbal, I would call him a generational talent. Nikola Jokic is the perfect big for this generation of bbal, I would call him a generational talent. Joel Embiid is the perfect big for this generation of bbal, I would call him a generational talent."

A team of -ics would be nasty tho  PG: Luka Doncic SG: Bogdan Bogdonovic SF: Bojan Bogdonovic PF: Nikola Vucevic  C: Nikola Jokic  6th man: Goran Dragic   A bit wonky in the frontcourt but great shooting from all 5 positions and great passing overall.

"Reminder that just 2 years ago, a 39 year old Luis Scola put up 28 and 20 points respectively in wins over France and Serbia while going head to head against 3x DPOY Rudy Gobert and NBA MVP Nikola Jokic"

Nikola Jovic (Yes that's his actual name) skillset aligns up as a PF Jokic

"&gt;When, and by whom?  The entire league is only 75 years old.  Therefore, it's easy to understand that most numbers have been retired in a more timely fashion than the 42 years that elapsed between Jim Pollard's retirement, and Rick Fox donning #17.  So, to answer your question, almost every player with a retired jersey that you can remember watching, had that number retired in a more timely fashion.  &gt;By 1983, Elgin Baylor had already played and retired, and the #22 jersey was very likely more synonymous to the Los Angeles fanbase with Elgin Baylor than with Slater Martin.  This is irrelevant, as shown by the examples I already provided.  &gt;Until then, nobody ever retired a number for two players, and even in your example, the New York Knicks first retired the #15 jersey for Earl Monroe in 1986 then for Dick McGuire in 1992. The only time a franchise retired a number for two players at the same time was in 2008, when the Blazers retired #30 for Bob Gross and Terry Porter.  Are you trying to argue against yourself?  If not, what point did you think you were making here?  &gt;Even at the earliest possible date, it would have required the Lakers to do something that would not be done until 35 years later.  You are talking nonsense here.  All they had to do was retire these numbers when number-retirement became common -- in the early eighties, basically.  Or, they could have retired these numbers at literally at time since then, utterly regardless of who has worn those digits since.  Just like other franchises already have, repeatedly.  &gt;It would also have required a completely different mindset from what was likely held at the time.   Again, are you arguing against me, or yourself?  My point is precisely that their mindset was wrong, and should change ( meaning they should properly retire these numbers ).  &gt;The franchise had their first three retired numbers and it was for contributors the highest degree: Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West (they retired West's number a few days after Wilt's and Baylor's). They didn't retire Goodrich's number at the time; why would they retire the numbers of players who played a long time ago, who meant less overall to the fanbase than Goodrich? (with the exception of Mikan, I presume, but even then I'm not sure)  Basically none of this is accurate.  Pollard, Martin, and Mikkelson won 4+ rings for the Lakers.  Goodrich did nothing remotely close to that.  Hell, Chamberlain, Baylor, and West didn't, either.  If you think winning 4+ titles, and being 4, 4, and 6-time All-stars respectively -- not to mention being Laker Lifers in two cases -- is not ""contributing to the highest degree"", then you simply don't understand the words being used here.  And that's disregarding Mikan, whose case is utterly beyond argument.  &gt;Sure, the same way the Nuggets are totally gonna retire Melo's number despite current MVP Nikola Jokic wearing it?  As has already been done by many NBA franchises.  Anthony didn't win a damn thing in Denver, so it's their option to retire his number or not.  That said, the Anthony/Jokic case is completely different and not applicable, because Anthony did not retire before -- never mind 42 years before -- Jokic began wearing his old number."

"Do you think advanced stats ruin the NBA? Because it doesn't sound like you do.  Rather, you're complaining about some fans who (you claim) rely entirely on advanced stats.   Personally, I'm not convinced those fans exist, any more than teams who rely entirely on advanced stats exist. Advanced stats are just another tool in the tool box.  Also it's not necessary to be a statistician in order to use them. It's just important to understand what they were designed to measure, what they weren't designed to measure, and what weaknesses are inherent in their design.  There are plenty of explanations out there designed for non-statisticians.   Sometimes statisticians will argue about minute details that a non-statistician won't understand. But for the most part these arguments about how to refine stats don't need to concern the rest of us. We just have to realize that no stat is perfect, and that it's important to use all the tools available to evaluate a player.  My biggest complaint about non-statistical criticisms of advanced stats is the tendency to point to unexpected results as proof that advanced stats are entirely useless. Sometimes unexpected results can be explained by incomplete data -- for example, small sample size.  But other times unexpected results actually reveal that conventional wisdom is wrong -- for example, contrary to popular opinion at the time, young Nikola Jokic really was a unicorn player with MVP potential."
Giannis was a 15 pick...Nikola Jokic or Marc Gasol would be better comparison.
convince Lakers to trade up 5 spots from 46 to 41. Nikola Jokic might be a little better than Jordan Clarkson

"Diamonds in the rough happen but talent will typically coalesce in the draft near the top which we see most years.  All stars this year  Beal (3), Irving (1), Durant (2), Giannis (15), Embiid (3), Brown (3), Harden (3), Simmons (1), LaVine (13), Randle (7), Sabonis (11), Tatum (3), Vucevic (16), Curry (7), Luka (3), LeBron (1), Kawhi (15), Jokic (41), Booker (13), Conley (4), Lillard (6), Mitchell (13), CP3 (4), Davis (1), PG (10), Zion (1), Rudy (27).  Top 5 - 14  Not top 5, but in the lottery - 8  outside lottery first round - 4  second round - 1  Having all star talent in the second round is such an oddity (and half any given second round won't even finish their rookie contract) that ever since 1989 (when the draft resembled what we see today) those 32 drafts have produced 20 all stars in the second round. How many of those guys have made multiple all star games?  10: Marc Gasol, Paul Milsap, Manu Ginobili, Isiah Thomas, Khris Middleton, Nikola Jokic, Carlos Boozer, Gilbert Arenas, Rashard Lewis, Green"

"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let‚Äôs see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He‚Äôs averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he‚Äôs not super-efficient, his numbers don‚Äôt contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren‚Äôt great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don‚Äôt hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year‚Äôs trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that‚Äôs it. He can‚Äôt pass the ball at a high level and he‚Äôs a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."

He'll be joining Nikola Jokic in Denver by 2023
"Yeah I think, obviously, that all aspects of his game could use incremental improvements given his age, and he will make that happen. But his defense was already pretty solid; good enough for *league MVP* and certainly top-3 big man in the NBA Nikola Jokic to say he ""gave him a hard time.""  But his hands though. He dropped so many passes that would have been layups or dunks."
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown üçÄ, Jayson Tatum üçÄ, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."

"Giannis at 3 you have issues, boy can't shoot and (also) takes him away from things he does well (paint points / rebounding / rim protection).  You don't want Giannis at 3 for long, trust me. Playing him alongside Nikola works because Jokic can man the perimeter. But Jokic *and* Sabonis? No sire. Find another 3, preferably a shooting one, slide Giannis at 4."
"You're the one who kept moving goalposts. First it was ""there isn‚Äôt a single European that‚Äôs a face of the league though"". Then it became ""If you don‚Äôt watch basketball you have no idea who giannis, Luka, or Jokic are"". And now it's ""People who do not watch basketball do not know who Nikola Jokic is"".  I'll concede that last one, though if he keeps playing at this level I doubt it will be true for much longer. However I'm pretty sure two players who currently are in the top 5 in jersey sales are definitely among the faces of the league."
"Yeah, people are somehow shocked that when there are more possessions in a game, players score more. It's almost as ridiculous as being surprised that your favorite player usually has more points at the end of the game than at the beginning of the 4th quarter. Unless that player is Nikola Jokic, in which case the surprise is warranted."
"Sources told me that while cleaning out his kitchen drawers, next to the guacamole maker he has scarcely used, Simmons found an old mixtape from Embiid that Embiid made for Ben after he was drafted first overall to the Sixers. The mix was an ode to Philly - Rocky theme song, Meek Mill, even some Hall and Oates, and of course capped off by Boyz II Men‚Äôs I‚Äôll make love to you. Well, it appears as if this is the end of the road, as Simmons tossed the mix in the trash, confidently dunking it in since he‚Äôs been working on his game all summer.   And talks stalled as Daryl Morey requested Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, six first round picks, a statue of John Elway, and six pounds of indica from the Denver Nuggets."
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"At one point in a scrimmage, sources said, Malone turned to MVP Nikola Jokic and screamed, ""You (bleeping) need me. You can't win without me."" Malone left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the gym in every way. Mikey's back."

"Nikola ""MVP"" Jokic got hard swept by the Suns ü§£ what's your point?"
"Media might as well have said ‚Äúwe want to give this award to someone else, but to maintain a semblance of integrity we reluctantly give it to the deserved MVP Nikola Jokic‚Äù with how they treated him  It‚Äôs baffling how little coverage the fucking NBA MVP received."
"""In your face"" - Nikola Jokic"
"Nikola Jokic. His whole game inspires me, there‚Äôs a calmness to it"
"I see a lot of people getting confused between Nikola Jokic, Nikola Jovic, and Luka Jovic during the next couple of years."
Sam Merrill is 25 (2020 draft)   Nikola Jokic is 26 (2014 draft)
You left Nikola Jokic off the J team.
"I really want everything you say about Butler to be true, but I think calling him a top-5 draft steal of the decade is kind of pushing it when this decade also has players like Rudy Gobert (27), Draymond Green (35), Jimmy Butler (30), Nikola Jokic (41), Malcolm Brogdon (36) and Pascal Siakam (27). That's five all-stars, four of whom are on a trajectory to being in the Hall of Fame, and a *very good* starting PG in Brogdon who is right on the cusp of being like a 15th or 14th all-star in a weaker conference.   I really want Butler to be that good, and I think he definitely *can* be, it's clear he's extremely talented, but I also think that saying he's ""already"" a top 5 draft steal of the decade is **very** premature, especially when you consider that we haven't even seen the first few years of guys who were drafted late in the 1st or mid into the 2nd round in the last couple of years. There might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now, and making a comparison with Butler to those guys who haven't had much of a chance to emerge is somewhat of a leap imho."
"This is probably gonna be wildly unpopular, but I think Sabonis is a lot more Andre Drummond than Nikola Jokic.  He bogs down the offense, is a liability on defense, isn't a shooter (although he's shown some promise) and he can pass but I don't think he makes his team better as a result. The key guys (Turner, Brogdon, Levert, Warren*) all put up better numbers when Sabonis was off the court.   *(Warren the year before since he barely played last season)  Last year was a bit of a mess with Bjorken, but the Pacers as a team were significantly better with Sabonis on the bench, and while they were better with him on the court the 2 years before that, the plus-minus was a lot smaller than you'd expect for an All-Star player.  He's a very productive rebounder via counting stats, but has one of the lowest percentages of contested rebounds for a starting center despite being near the top for rebounds per game. If you watch him play, he often fights for rebounds over his own teammates. The Pacers have also been a horrible rebounding team since he's gotten big minutes, ranking near the bottom of the league consistently.  They have also given up a ton of offensive rebounds, and led the league in opponent offensive rebounds last year when Sabonis played career high in minutes per game. He has one of the lowest boxouts per 36 of any starting center because he just goes for every rebound to pad his stats.  I don't think he's a *bad* player, but I think he's pretty overrated and IMO the Pacers are better off keeping Turner and trading Sabonis to take advantage of his value being high."
Nikola Jokic. Let me know when he can play championship level defense and stay out of foul trouble.   Having a defensive liability at center in today‚Äôs NBA is exploitable. Give me AD and Embiid over him 10/10 for that reason.

"All time favorite player: Michael Jordan, I was a young kid growing up in Chicago in the 90s who got to see a few of those games in person , so that's fairly obvious combined with just loving his game and his mentality      Current favorite player: Kevin Durant, I relate to him from the standpoint that even though I'm not 7 ft tall I've always been really skinny (6'2, 164 pounds as of this morning) , so his appearance was always very striking to me, combined with just loving his game as well to be 7 ft tall with that skill set, he's probably the most effortless looking scorer I've ever seen the guy will have 28 to 33 points and it doesn't look like it and he's only taking like 15 shots throughout the game lol, and I understand that his personality is not for everybody, which is fine, and I'm not going to feel sorry for a multi-millionaire in the prime of his career because he may not feel like answering questions, but personality wise I can understand where he's coming from, the man just likes the hoop, and play video games, invest his money and allegedly bang pornstars  Jimmy Butler and Nikola Jokic are Runners up though lol        Least fav: for the longest time I'd say it was Chris Paul but right now it's Kyrie Irving , I'm just so fucking sick of this dude lol"
That's a dangling participle if I've seen one. Should have been Nikola Jokic to Michael Malone after Jokic's first child was born.

The only official team captain in the NBA right now is Nikola Jokic  In the past, guys like Kobe, Duncan, Mutombo, Fischer were their team captains, and Miami pronounced Wade/Lebron/Bosh as their collective team captain  Basically just leaders of the locker room"
"If you‚Äôre going to bring up what he does well as justification for the contract, none of which I disagree with, then you have to bring up the other side of the coin as well.  He doesn‚Äôt guard a stick. In 10 playoff games last year, opponents shot 54% on two-pointers, and 56% on threes when guarded by him. Opponents purposely run all their actions to single him out on that end, coupled with Nikola Jokic, means they have to be almost superhuman on one end of the floor to make up for their deficiencies on the other end.   As a fellow small market, non free agent destination, I‚Äôm hoping the contract works out and the Nuggets can have success. But both ends of the floor matter."

Nikola jokic has his own documentary called a Serbian film. You guys could watch that together
"Trae will have more career success than Luka early on, then Luka will go to the Hawks in free agency 2025 to team up with him. They‚Äôll make the finals but lose to a tough Nuggets team led by Nikola Jokic, who gets his first ring and has an alltime great playoff performance where he knocks off a solid Blazers team, the prior year champion Lakers, and an on the rise OKC team led by young studs Emoni Bates, Josh Giddey, and Amari George. Luka and Trae then proceed to win the next two finals, but fail to threepeat due to the poetic basketball of the Warriors which serves as the last hurrah for Steph, Klay, and Draymond but is a coming out party for young stud Jordan Walsh. Luka then returns to the Mavs, forming an intense rivalry with the Celtics who have added walking mismatch and former MVP Zion Williamson to their already all-NBA core of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bob Williams. The Mavs somehow triumph against the Celtics in Luka‚Äôs second year back, making him a Dallas legend. After a few years, he goes to the Lakers where he wins another chip and cements himself as a potential GOAT. By this point, Trae has retired largely due to recurring ankle injuries but is considered a top 10 PG of all time."

There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area.

"Jokic's reaction is very clearly a fight or flight response. He expected to be fouled, but he didn't expect to be elbowed and kneed at full speed. When those kinds of things happen to you your common sense goes out the window. It's easy to sit on the internet and talk about what someone should have done or shouldn't have done, but when it's actually happening to you your evolutionary instincts take over.  I'm a very non-violent person, but there have been two incidents in my life where I was in situations like this and I reacted in a similar fashion to how Jokic did. I don't think it's reasonable to put the onus for non-violence on someone who is being attacked.  If you look at the alternate angle of the ""hard foul"", you can see Morris run across the court at full speed to throw an elbow into Jokic's ribs and knee his (injured) knee. That isn't him reacting to a fight or flight situation, that's him deciding to try to hurt an opposing player.  Morris turning his back on Jokic was a stupid, stupid decision. He full on attacked someone and then made it so that he couldn't defend himself afterwards. This isn't victim blaming, because Morris was the aggressor in this situation. It was his own decision to go after him the way he did, and the only reason he ended up worse off than Nikola was his own decision to turn around afterwards.  Obviously I would prefer that Nikola was able to keep himself from responding the way he did. From his comments in his full post-game presser, I think it's obvious that he feels the same. However, when someone's fight or flight response is triggered, they don't have nearly as much control over their actions as they would in any other situation."
It‚Äôs because Jokic is is the back. I think nikola is like 3-4 inches taller iirc
"The point here is that Johnson has actual training and years of experience. That‚Äôs more than enough in this scenario. This is Nikola Jokic, not his trained fighter brother."

Only reason Morris was dumb enough to try that cheap shot on Jokic is because he never in a million years thought Jokic would throw down.  I doubt there's anyone in the NBA who wants to legit go with Nikola. Dude might actually be part grizzly bear.

"He was bad as half a season of 19-year-old rookie big who'd played 3 games since high school and not had a preseason training camp at all who was the absolute central focus of the entire team when he was on the floor, to the detriment of quality play for the team as a whole and everyone else's stats.  Warriors started out treating last season as a season-long training camp.  But Wiseman did show significant improvement, they've had months to give him film sessions for theoretical understanding, he apparently works his ass off, and the Warriors have hired the coach who taught Nikola Jokic how to play basketball to come and coach Wiseman.  It's not crazy to be optimistic about his future. It's not crazy to think he's still not going to be there yet. It's crazy to say you know for sure how good he'll be this year."
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."

"Defense is the answer to your question.  I love Nikola Jokic, but I'd take Giannis over him because of Gianni's ability to rim protect. KD can similarly lock in on a defensive end when needed and might be the easiest scorer in NBA history. Kawhi, when healthy, is also the best two way player in the game.  So Jokic is top 5, but not quite top 3 because of defense."

*cries in Nikola Jokic
thank you!! i would love if the playoffs rolled around and all of the sudden nikola jokic is the greatest perimeter defender of all time or if kawhi starts smiling and laughing a lot. everyone would be thrown
First I read Nikola Jokic and was like what? Are they insane? But on a serious note they gonna have to give up a lot for either of them
"[Nikola Jokic](https://youtu.be/uKv_EforLIc) also posted a perfect triple double, albeit with one missed free throw if you count that (perfect on fg though)"
"Ahh yes, a good game by &lt;put Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, or Luka Doncic here&gt; always brings out these questions and the Giannis haters such as /u/gunter_grass"
"This rivalry between Embiid and Jokic is nice, only the conditions are not the same. Just look at how many problems Miami, Boston, Toronto had, even Durant doesn‚Äôt play for the Nets. New York is better this year than before, but again far from a serious playoff team, even though they are fifth in the East. They would literally have no chance in 7 games against the eleventh New Orleans in the West. I don't think thay win against Sacramento in 7 games either. A much easier conference gives Sixers and Embiid a much better chance for MVP. Literally everything matches them, ideal conditions. And despite the ideal conditions, Embid still has 7 games OUT. A lot of Sixers fans think Embiid is the best player in the league.. Honestly i like Embiid but there are certainly at least 6 players i would always take before Embiid. At least 6. Embiid has better teammates, easier conference and much better defenders. He literally has all the conditions better and again Jokic has better games and better numbers. Russ was the MVP while Jokic has far more efficient numbers but Nikola is not an American, to be honest.   I agree that at this moment Embiid is the MVP looking at the positions but Jokic is literally a better player, currently the best in the world with LeBron and Durant and Harden."
There has only been one other center who can do that and his name is Nikola Jokic.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Cameroonian legend: Nikola Jokic."
It's because Gobert is the best defender versus anyone not named Nikola Jokic or Joel Embiid when it comes to defensive metrics.

Nikola Jokic is averaging 32.14 PER and 12.14 BPM this season which puts him at #1 and #3 of all time.
When I saw Nikola I was hoping it would be Jokic
Nikola Jokic is the fastest player in the NBA
"He's a very smart player.  Honestly if Saric was athletically gifted he'd be fucking Nikola Jokic or something. He's slow, can barely jump, not particular strong but has that old man strength and great footwork, that plus his iq makes him super valuable."

"See, you think I am trying to discredit him.  I am from Brazil. I _know_ Manu. I also learned to support an NBA team with the Spurs. David Robinson. Before Duncan. The reason I became a Nuggets fan was Nene. He went there in 2002, and eventually became a Nuggets fan. But I still have some old Spurs gear.  I am _not_ trying to discredit Manu. He is a legend. He was instrumental in all the Spurs titles.   I'm just stating that Nikola Jokic is in a different tier."
I have nothing else to say other than Nikola Jokic is good at basketball
Nikola ‚ÄúRussell Westbrook‚Äù Jokic  (For legal reasons this is a joke)

Nikola Jokic is the best player ever
Imagine we made titles like this for every player   ‚Äú26 year old Nikola Jokic splashes a mid ranger in the eye of 28 year old Rudy Gobert‚Äù
"He could have a long time left in the league. Seems like the whole point of retiring a guy's uniform is that nobody else will wear that number after them.  Carmelo Anthony wore #15 for 7.5 years for the Denver Nuggets and *should* have had his jersey retired, but they waited and now Nikola Jokic has it.  I'm sure they can find a workaround for that (I'm guessing either Jokic changes numbers or gets grandfathered in), but the Rockets move makes things a lot cleaner."
So Nikola Jokic?

"Wait, can we say three names? I will go Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic and Adam Sandler. I mean, if we get the other four guys, we can just have Sandler making funny stuff while the others destroy the rivals..."
"Only 4 players in the league average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists a game:   Nikola Jokic (All-Star)  Giannis Antetokounmpo (All-Star)  Julius Randle (All-Star)  Domantas Sabonis (All-Star)"
"Trust me, as a nuggs fan we were all screaming at the tv at that point.  But I also feel bad for MPJ because he said he‚Äôs specifically coached to go out to the 3p line as the first on a fast break. Now it‚Äôs entirely possible that is just general rule of thumb and not a hard rule (and this situation would almost certainly be an exception to the rule) but he‚Äôs also in a really fucked up headspace right now.  Malone has basically been jerking him around in regards to his minutes. He would pull him after the slightest defensive fuckup instead of letting him play through them. If he hoisted up a contested 3 out of rhythm of the offense, he would pull him almost immediately. Which, I kind of get the tough love thing (though other players don‚Äôt get the same treatment, which I could see rankling him).   But at the same time, you have to understand what that does to a player‚Äôs mentality. If you want him to ONLY do *exactly* as the coaching staff says and he‚Äôs so afraid of going off script and getting pulled, then you can‚Äôt really blame him when he....does exactly what the coaching staff asks him to do instead of going off script.  If you want another example, about a possession before that (maybe 2), he had a wide open 3 and passed it up to Jamal for a semi-contested look. Why would he do that? Might have something to do with [this quote](https://twitter.com/hpbasketball/status/1364456574505213952?s=21) from two nights ago where he‚Äôs trying to be the good teammate and say the right stuff about recognizing the crunch time is for Nikola and Jamal. Contrast that with his comments in the playoffs last year where he got ROASTED for saying that maybe we should do something besides the Jamal-Jokic 2 man game if they are getting smothered by the clippers D (which is correct - it just came off badly to the media). You don‚Äôt think that wasn‚Äôt in his head? I guarantee he wanted to shoot it but was thinking ‚ÄúJamal is hot right now and it‚Äôs crunch time, I‚Äôd better pass to him or I‚Äôll be in coach‚Äôs doghouse.‚Äù"
"Yet somehow people find a way to throw him into MVP discussions in years were there is no debate OR he doesn't deserve it, i.e 2018, 2020 and 2021.  Kawhi Leonard averages more points, steals, blocks, shoots a better percentage from the field, 3-PT and FT, has a higher PER and WS/48 while winning more games, but he is 6th while LeBron is 2nd.  Nikola Jokic averages more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, has a higher FG%, 3-PT% and FT%, but he is 3rd while LeBron is 2nd.  LeBron shouldn't even be Top 5 in MVP voting so far yet people are trying to put him into a two way race with Embiid. Last year he should've gotten zero votes when compared to Giannis's record breaking season, but his stans still found a way to put him there.  Embiid, Kawhi, Jokic, Giannis and Steph/Dame should be the Top 5, but let's put LeBron at 2nd when he is 5-5 without Anthony Davis in the starting lineup while putting worse stats than all of them."
Is that guy a center? Or a big? Does Miles guard centers  on the Pacers? I have no doubt the Pacers have two bigs that can guard centers and PFs the question was can Miles Turner and Nikola Jokic play together. Basically Sabonis is a PF to me and guards PFs. Is Jokic doing that?

"He played big. I don't think he ever had his wingspan properly measured but it had to have significantly surpassed his height (6'11'').   This will sound cliche but... he played the game the right way. He could dominate with an array of post moves (and sweeping hooks) but could just as well operate as a passing threat. His outlet passing ability is one of the gold standards for outlet passing.   It's always hard doing these new school/old school comparisons, but maybe there's shades of Walton in a guy like Nikola Jokic? Savvy, multi-faceted center who thinks the game and dominates without leaping 13 feet above the rim? Obviously not 1:1 but I think some similarities could be observed. Jokic has the range that Walton didn't; Walton may have had a more overbearing post game and intimidating defensive presence. Both had an understanding of the game that many centers do not."
"Why does every single lineup with Curry and Draymond outperform any combination of Curry-Klay-Durant without Draymond?   &gt;	The warriors defense was elite during the title run, but they definitely were not one of the greatest defenses of all time  You realize the 2017 warriors are the best team‚Äîdefensively and offensively that fell apart in their respective ends when Draymond and Curry were absent‚Äî*of all time?*  This isn‚Äôt even a simple stay lol they‚Äôre a *historic*‚Äîas in top 10 of all time‚Äîdefense that were dogshit the moment Draymond left the court? Keep dreaming.   &gt;	Driving the offense?  Ya you know: according to touches, dribbles per possession, passes completed, etc‚Äîstats that show the time the player has the ball. Funny how Draymond comes in second only behind Curry then Durant as a tertiary creator. Wonder why steve Kerr couldn‚Äôt trust eithe Klay or Durant to initiate the offense deep into the post season but relied on Curry and Draymond?   &gt;	Also how you gonna say ‚Äúif not the best‚Äù playmaking big as if Nikola Jokic doesn‚Äôt exist. Just say you a Ben Simmons hater and move on  Draymond has a better track record than him albeit him probably ending up being better. If you don‚Äôt think a DPOY and 3x champ and the second most important player on a 73 win team is better than a WCF appearance idk what to tell you nephew other than you are a nephew lmao"
"I mean yeah Ben doesn't anchor the defense because he doesn't have to. Not sure how that's a negative against him. Have you watched the sixers when simmons doesn't play? The whole team is a mess. The warriors defense was elite during the title run, but they definitely were not one of the greatest defenses of all time. Driving the offense? Dray was passing to 3 hall of famers lol. Also how you gonna say ""if not the best"" playmaking big as if Nikola Jokic doesn't exist. Just say you a Ben Simmons hater and move on"

"I've watched every game Nikola Jokic has played since entering the NBA outside of maybe 20 or so.   There is a moment, and you can see almost see the lightbulb go off where about midway through the 1st quarter he has this weird sparkle appear in his eye when he realizes that he can absolutely work over a center and has the defense figured, and then he proceeds to make it look fucking effortless. Whether it be by scoring or passing."
"Does Jokic have range from out there? Why the fuck would you cover him way out there? To make him give up the ball? Brother, Nikola Jokic does not give up the ball"
Allow me to introduce you to a beat and cut-up 4 FT attempts per game Nikola Jokic.

'Why the fuck are you laughing at me?'  -- Nikola Jokic
"Nikola ""CrazyRussianHacker"" Jokic"
Looking like another Nikola ‚Äúdespite the loss‚Äù Jokic game
"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
Nikola Jokic: ‚ÄúAm I a joke to you‚Äù
"Well if we‚Äôre talking about European sport culture we might as well talk about soccer, and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs apples to oranges because they view teams and levels of play differently. In terms of European/foreign stars in the NBA, i haven‚Äôt seen a pattern of them demanding they leave when things don‚Äôt go well. Nikola jokic isn‚Äôt asking to leave, giannis isn‚Äôt ring chasing even tho his team has failed (by their standards) the last 3 years, Joel embiid screaming trust the process at every turn. Hell, nikola vucevic chilling down in Orlando and look at them. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really a trend, no evidence for it."
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."
"Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic"
G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
He‚Äôs a great offensive coach that helped Nikola Jokic have his breakout season by designing their offense that still exists now.

"Im from serbia and for my whole family basketball is like a 2nd religion so i have love for the game as long as i can remember, but i never  cared too much about the nba. I was following the euroleague and the Adriatic league, mainly my favorite team ( red star belgrade)... 7 years ago my team played vs an outsider team (MEGA) in the serbian cup finals , MEGA VIZURA( name has changed since) actually only tries to develop players not really to compeete so i have not payed close attention to them earlier in the year but they made it to the finals. As the game progressed i could not take my eyes of a player of the opposing team, he was so unusual so skilled so REFRESHING, his potential mesmerized me emidiatly, he played the game as neismith intended it to be . That player was Nikola Jokic. He did not play particulary well that game( cant find the stats to save my life) and was the tragic figure for his team beacuse he missed the shot for the win , the game ended 81:80. However, the Denver Nuggets drafted him shortly after with the 41st pick and decided to stash him another year , i admitt i did not believe at that time he will have a chance to get any role in the nba and did not think about it further...just another of our guys who gets drafted and never makes it over the pond. The next season begun, i started watching every Mega game and jokic improoved a LOT, so much that he actually became the MVP of the adriatic league. The nuggets invited him to come over for the summer league and i was like naah they dont apprecite players like him in the nba...but i still tuned in to watch his summer league games and got hooked emidiatly , i have not missed many games since than . Now i cant live without NBA basketball ( even tho i hate the refs) and i love every nuggets player . The rise that my man expirienced in this league, the way he prooved( and still prooves) doubters wrong ... is the most incredible sports story i have expirienced in my life. Sorry if this was too long, i hope its understandable."

"It's cyclical,   * Euros started off being underrated * Dirk paves the way becoming the first major European star. Pau Gasol soon follows as does Peja Stojakoviƒá. * GMs in the early 2000s want the next Dirk, spend high picks on players who are not good (e.g. Darko Milicic, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Yaroslav Koralev etc...)  * Euro players are now all busts again. * New Euro player makes it big (e.g. Tony Parker, Marc Gasol, Mehmet Okur) and the Euro hype begins again.  * GMs want the new international superstar/hidden gem. Instead draft busts like jan Vesely or not living up to their potential stars like Ricky Rubio, Enes Kanter or Jonas Valanciunas (all top 5 picks who failed to live up to the hype).  * Euros are back to being soft/not good again. This is why Porzi≈Üƒ£is got booed on draft night by his home ""fans"".  * New crop of Euro talent makes it big guys like Nikola Jokic, Giannis, Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Gobert and Luka dominate.  * Now GMs take a chance and take guys like Poku high in the draft.   Euros because there aren't as many are compared to their peers way more than an american player. The boom/bust scrutiny is 10fold it seems."

"Crazy how he is even in the discussion tbh, it's totally media fabricated. Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry all have played better during this season than LeBron, heck, even Kawhi in his own city when you consider his defense and his efficiency is more deserving."
It's a list of big men and assists aren't a traditional big man stat. Doesn't really seem dishonest to me. Anyone who knows a fart about basketball knows the rankings on this would be like Nikola Jokic - 5th and most everyone else ranked around 100th.
point nikola jokic
"He wouldn't it's not that clear cut, he's not even leading the betting odds       LeBron James +180  Joel Embiid +450  Nikola Jokic +500  Luka Doncic +1000  Giannis Antetokounmpo +1200  Steph Curry +1200  Kevin Durant +1400  Damian Lillard +2500  Kawhi Leonard +4000  Donovan Mitchell +6600"
Yep.

"Here's my attempt.

"Actually, they are both pronounced Nikola. The difference is that when the Denver media mispronounced Nikola‚Äôs name (and Mike Malone is probably at fault there as well), Jokic didn‚Äôt feel the need to correct them. When they caught up with Vucci Mane at the ASG last year, he did correct them."
He‚Äôs playing great but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs way ahead in the mvp race. I‚Äôd probably agree as of now he deserves it over Lebron but there‚Äôs a lot of season left. Nikola jokic probably deserves it over both of them right now.
And that someone told Drummond he's the American Nikola Jokic
"Murray is not the first Nugget to score 50 points in a game this season.¬†Nikola Jokic¬†did so earlier this month and needed 33 shots to get there. They are the third duo under the age of 25 to accomplish the feat in the same season, according to¬†[ESPN Stats and Info](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1362957237690466305), joining Jerry West and Rudy LaRusso along with Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson.  It's a fitting honor for Denver's two young¬†"
"As of today, Nikola Jokic has played 760 more minutes than Joel Embiid"
"It's just too unprecedented in the modern era to win the award with a play-in seed. As long as the media votes for it, it'll be too narrative-driven to win it with such historical anomalies.  Moreover, as incredible as Curry's been this season, Nikola Jokic has outperformed him‚Äîand not-so-coincidentally has led his team to acceptable playoffs-seeding.  No one's denying his MVP-level impact; it's just that he doesn't have a strong enough counternarrative to his team's record to transcend the historical criteria."

"If we disagree on Stephen Curry playing at an MVP level, then I guess you could make that argument. Though like I said, I don‚Äôt know how you could argue that he isn't (or wasn't).  As for the Stephen Curry vs Nikola Jokic argument, no.  I didn't even mention Jokic in my original comment. Come on dude. You're the one who started comparing the two players in response to a comment strictly talking about a single player's level of play.  I then joined the argument."
"Jokic is literally having the best BPM season since Curry's 2015-2016 season and with more performances like tonight he could jump above Curry. Steph is great, but don't diminish this season but Nikola. He's having a historic year.

if theres one person I dont mind overshadowing Curry its nikola jokic.
"Recency bias aside, Nikola Jokic is the MVP."

What about your eyes is telling you that Stephen Curry is more valuable than Nikola Jokic? And what makes your eyes more important than everyone else‚Äôs?
By what metric is Stephen Curry playing better than Nikola Jokic this season?
"Steph literal MVP  Jokic figurative MVP  I‚Äôd vote Nikola if I had a vote, unless by some miracle the Warriors catch Portland and get the 5th seed"
"His offensive ceiling would be like if you averaged out Dwight Howard and Nikola Jokic. Elite athleticism and build but not a dominant force like Howard. Good isolation scoring potential, so in the middle between Howard and Jokic. Already a way better shooter than Howard, but I‚Äôd be shocked if he was ever at Jokic‚Äôs level there. Not a defensive menace like Howard, but still elite there. His passing is great but not game breaking.  Its weird to compare a player by averaging two completely opposed players, but I think it‚Äôs the only way I can really describe Bam‚Äôs potential. As for statline I‚Äôd say a likely prime statline would be like 20/12/6 with 2 blocks."
"KAT has made strides on defense in recent years, he is a pretty average level defender right now with elite offense. I don't agree that your center must be an All-Defense guy to win, look at Nikola Jokic."

"Steph is great but people go way overboard and disrespect Magic frequently in this comparison. If Magic played today, he'd be a monster point forward/centre. He'd basically be a nikola jokic with an insane transition game, he'd be fucking unstoppable."
"I can't give you a source for it being lower. Only about the same:  &gt; It‚Äôs impossible to say whether Murray, and those other players, was more likely to succumb to injury because of the fraught nature of a season conducted under the weight of a global pandemic and the protocols adopted to navigate it. Injuries on the whole are not up this season, according to Jeff Stotts of the injury-focused site In Street Clothes, and while Monday‚Äôs game against the Warriors was the Nuggets‚Äô sixth contest in nine days, it was Murray‚Äôs first in seven days after sitting for four games to rest a sore right knee‚Äînot the one he injured on Monday.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/13/22382551/jamal-murray-injury-denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic"

To be honest man I don‚Äôt follow the NBA to closely so don‚Äôt take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he‚Äôs my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that‚Äôs why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
"Experts from ESPN just gave Jokic 90 first place votes from possible 101,so he's good. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31250764/nba-mvp-media-straw-poll-anyone-catch-denver-nuggets-star-nikola-jokic"

Is it just me or does Nikola Jokic look like the type of guy who doesn‚Äôt know how to use a phone
"All the respect to Wilt, but it ain't close.  &gt;Nikola Jokic currently has the most ever games with 10+ assists in a single season by a center with 25. In second place is Nikola Jokic with 21. Third is Nikola Jokic with 20. and Fourth is Nikola Jokic with 13"
Embiid has played 36% less minutes than Nikola Jokic.
he's leading the MVP race by an internal poll at espn. by a ridiculous margin to where no one else basically has a chance.  y'all are fucking tiring with complaining about jokic not getting his credit when he's on the path for the mvp award.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31250764/nba-mvp-media-straw-poll-anyone-catch-denver-nuggets-star-nikola-jokic
"Nikola Jokic is 25 (3 years younger than Drazen at the end) and already more decorated. 3 time All-Star, likely MVP."
"No it's actually Rich Paul who pays everybody, but he specifically only pays them to sabotage Nikola Jokic for being fat to distract the people from the truth of the world being flat"
Nikola Jokic and Giannis.

Sabonis. A good defensive big (even if he isn‚Äôt quite DPOY tier) will almost always be more valuable than an offensive one unless the latter is absolutely elite like Nikola Jokic.
So this is dumb. The argument that Nikola Jokic has played more games is obvious and makes sense. But to use the gap in minutes is straight up dumb. Embiid is playing 32 mpg because he dominates when he's in the game and sits out a bunch of fourth quarters. The fact that he is putting up the numbers he is in three fewer minutes per game is actually a point *in Embiid's favor*  And it's also just straight up unnecessary. If the voters don't care about the games played gap this won't change their mind and vice versa.

He is the next Nikola Jokic? Idk from what I've seen the guy can pass pretty well for a big.
"If the Nuggets stay in the 4 seed, ESPECIALLY if Nikola doesn't miss any games, Jokic should win MVP and the gap between him and second place should be massive.      As for title odds, I mean our chances have gone waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay down. As long as Jokic is healthy, I'm not counting us out, but realistically it's going to be as close to impossible as you can get while still having a shot at it."
He's the white Nikola Jokic
"PG: Chris Paul 16 PPG  SG: Marcus Smart 13.4 PPG  SF: Mikal Bridges 13.2 PPG  PF: Draymond Green 6.6 PPG  C: Nikola Jokic 26.2 PPG  Fantastic ball movement, elite defense, and overall solid enough shooting to make up for Draymond's complete lack of it."

Mason Plumlee and Nikola Jokic
Giannis will request a trade to Denver to be with his bff (since asg) Nikola Jokic. In which the Nuggets trade future Hall of famer Bol Bol for Giannis.
Nikola Jokic takes offence.
Yes if Nikola Jokic improves his defense he will easily be the most complete NBA basketball player of all time.....  /S
Don't forget that guy who needs blazers to win or he loses his house. They might do him a favor.  Nikola Jokic - DNP (Economic Bubble)

"I'm actually a big Kawhi fan and the guy has had a great career. But your Jokic takes are garbage.  Want to know what Nikola Jokic has in common with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, David Robinson, KG, Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Jordan and Lebron James? None of them won an NBA title by age 26.   Stupid judging his leadership and ability to affect winning now, especially considering he's done nothing but perform extremely well in the playoffs so far in his young career. Jokic being great doesn't mean anyone else is less great, doesn't have to be an either or."
Ummm have you seen how intense Strahinja and Nemanja Jokic are?  Or heard the stories about what they used to do to their little brother?  Nikola would be fine playing with KG.
  Nikola Jokic is an all-time great playoff performer. No shame in losing to him.
If Nikola Jokic wasn't a pro basketball player he'd probably just hang around pool halls and would absolutely just rake in the cash.
imho the Pelicans should try trading Steven Adams for Nikola Jokic
"Baseball is definitely a poor comp for this, and I‚Äôll explain why. In baseball, even though the pitcher is technically playing defense, he dictates what happens. The batter‚Äôs swing doesn‚Äôt dictate where the pitcher‚Äôs ball goes, the pitcher‚Äôs throw dictates the batter‚Äôs swing. In that sense, the pitcher will always hold a natural advantage over the batter. Shifting outfield coverages is the cherry on top for sure though.  In the same regard, in basketball can choose what he wants to do, and the defender must react to contain. A defense can dictate what a player does by sending a double, but in that case the option is simply to pass so that the ball finds the open man. This is all to say that like the batter is at the mercy of the pitcher, the defense is at the mercy of the offense. As a result, similar to the improvement of pitchers, we‚Äôve seen a boon in offensive rating.  Of course, coaches and analysts are trying to adapt defenses to match new offenses, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre building systems and schemes as we speak, but the reality is that there are some things that you can‚Äôt plan for. Step-back and quick trigger threes are essentially unguardable due to the limits of human reaction time and our ability to cover space. Effective ball movement can break any scheme for the same reasons. The ball moves faster than the defender, and it can change directions in reaction to defensive movement. If defense can step up, it will not be solely because of the improvement of coaches, but because of improvements in technique and athleticism in defenders. We‚Äôd need a league full of Matisee Thybulles to keep up with today‚Äôs game.  It‚Äôs an interesting problem, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not doing it justice, but I also think your take is a little lazy and failing to respect the realities of what basketball is. Basketball is and always will be offensively slanted; if it weren‚Äôt then a lot of games would end with 0 points scored.  In the same regard it‚Äôs a lot easier and a lot more consistent to win games by contributing more points to your team than limiting points for the other team‚Äôs total. Furthermore, defense is more of a team effort than offense. You can be the best wing defender in the league but if Nikola Jokic is your center then you‚Äôre defense will hemorrhage points anyway. If you‚Äôre the best offensive player in the league, you‚Äôll contribute points even if you‚Äôre team is comprised of 4 Andre Robersons."
Nikola Jokic is actually...  The **fastest player** in the NBA.

Or a foul being called on anyone guarding Nikola Jokic
"'.. and Nikola Jokic scores 38 points.'  He scores 38 points, 11 rebounds, 9 assists, 1 steal and 4 blocks.  Put some respect to this man's name ffs."
"The team game won. Basketball is not just shooting for 3 points. Lillard was insane but what a point when he chilled the others. The other players were chilled and missed almost everything. Jokic cleverly included other players in the game. The better floor general won. You can't win with just a crazy shot from 8 meters. Basketball is a team game, other players have to get involved.   The Refs were terrible for Denver. Lillard got such soft fouls while on the other side Melo hits Jokic on the hands and refs nothing.  Denver without 3 players and especially without Murray leads 3-2. I don't believe that anyone without 3 of the 6-7 best players could do that. That says enough about Jokic' s greatness. Of course, the media will praise Lillard, but Jokic wins without Murray. LeBron loses -30 without Davis and that shows how great Nikola Jokic is. He survived the craziest shooting for 3 I've ever seen.  I respect Portland as a franchise, and so does Lillard but simply you can' t not win with just 3 points.   Malone made some mistakes during the game, but in the end he made the right decision with Monte instead of Facu. An amazing gameüòéüî•"
I think Nikola Jokic and Damian Lillard are both underrated foul-baiters/floppers
I‚Äôd still take the performance against the 67-15 all time great team over the game where Dame was guarded by known defensive stalwarts MPJ and Nikola Jokic
Insane game by Dame and Nikola(j) Jokic. Fucking hell....at least this OT was won by Nuggets

WHen you have Nikola Jokic . The other guys on the team do not have to  be stars. Jokic is a floor raiser. He brings the whole team up. You have a chance to win every game.
Top 3 in career playoff box plus/minus (min. 1K minutes)  1. Michael Jordan (11.1) 2. LeBron James (10.2) 3. Nikola Jokic (9.5)  And he has leaped this season. Could be close to 10 after this postseason run is over.
"All good, gotta get your eyes checked though.  Its also Alex English with 18, not Melo.    Also it was displayed as a list like this  1. Alex English 2. Carmelo Anthony 3. Nikola Jokic  How did you mix that up lol."
It's called Nikola Jokic. You should try it some time.
It might be bur he‚Äôs a Coca Cola guy  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nuggets-nikola-jokic-used-to-drink-three-liters-of-coca-cola-every-day/
"Nikola ""No OT Tonight"" Jokic"
"Norm, CJ, and Dame are 8-29 from deep having missed a ton of open looks, yet Austin Rivers and Nikola Jokic are 9-16. Can't make this shit up"
He crushed every Western conference frontcourt player that wasn't either:  1. An All-NBA player in LA  2. Nikola Jokic pulling international votes and playing MVP level ball  Not bad for a 20 year old on a small market 11th seed.  Not sure how you think he should have gotten more than those guys.
I wonder what the default name is when referring to a player?  Doncic vs Luka?  Porzingis vs Kristaps?  Jokic vs Nikola  Ibaka vs Serge  \#28 vs Aerial Powers :O)
"*The following is a transcript of a call made between Nikola Jokic and Luca Doncic when the news broke*  Helo Luka  Helo Nikola  We wil play on basket ballteam together  Yes, I'm am egzited"
"Normally I‚Äôd have Jokic above Lillard but Dame is missing CJ and Nurk who are basically the only people on the team for more than a year (I know, chill)  And they shot up to 4th seed with a nutty win streak.  I 100% have Dame over Nikola right now"
"The stats mean nothing when you‚Äôre relating it to game script especially in regards to best and most consistent teams in the league. The Nets have underperformed since the Harden trade. I find it easy to look at stats and prove the narrative you more pushing but a Lebron/Joel Embiid have had a better year and bigger impact, as has a Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry, or even Paul George when he‚Äôs not busy dealing with COVID issues. So those stats are impressive for sure but you‚Äôre not gonna tell me that Domantas Sabonis hasn‚Äôt meant more to his team than Harden has at this gesture which is what MVP awards are mostly tailored around."
Nikola Jokic without a single doubt in my mind.
Chris Paul  Joe Johnson  Lebron James  Kevin Garnett  Nikola Jokic
let me try my team division  Damian lillard   Donovan Mitchell  Shai gilgeous alexander  Nikola jokic  Karl anthony towns
"There is 0 way the Celtics give up a Jay for Beal so this is the best package I could think of. You get Timelord who is a promising young player, Langford who‚Äôs already an Elite defender and one of the greatest finishers in college basketball history, and Nesmith who over the past 3 games (he‚Äôs been getting real minutes lately) has been playing very very well with infinite energy and the highest plus minus on the team in those games. Kemba is for Salary matching purposes and it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a terrible player. He‚Äôs been averaging 22 on 50 40 90 over the past few games. The picks will definitely be late 1st rounders but it‚Äôs not like those picks won‚Äôt convey into good players. As an example look at Payton Pritchard, Timelord, Keldon Johnson, White, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and more. The real question is if another team would put forth a better offer to beat this one. They‚Äôd need to give big salary pieces that are still young and those big salaries are the Fox‚Äôs, Tatum‚Äôs, and Brown‚Äôs of the world and I don‚Äôt think the teams will be willing to give them up."
Is he better than LeBron? No.  Is he better than Kawhi? No.  Is he better than Nikola Jokic? No.  Is he better than Paul George? No.  Is he better than Anthony Davis? No.  Is he better than Luka Doncic? No.  Is he better than Rudy Gobert? No.  Is he a guard? No.  Is he an All-Star? Only as an injury replacement.

"Just because I looked this up the other day, and was surprised -- and others might be, too.  The current leading scorer in the Euroleague is... Mike James.  And not the one who played a dozen years in the NBA, and once averaged 20 ppg there.  The ""other"" Mike James, the 30 year-old from Oregon, who signed a couple two-way contracts, and eventually played 36 games in the NBA in 2018, averaged 9 points per game, and then was waived by New Orleans.  Yeah, he's 'the best player in Europe' by at least one very limited statistical measure.  Which makes me wonder if, say, Nikola Jokic couldn't go back to Europe and be the Wilt Chamberlain of his continent."
Steph Curry   Kevin Durant  Joel Embiid  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic
"Just because it's not the typical big man defense doesn't mean it's bad. He can cover more ground, has great hands and get more steals than the average center.       According to this [site](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/2/10/21131100/stat-of-the-week-nikola-jokic-defensive-impact-nba-rim-protectors-are-overrated)\- he is in the 93 percentile when it comes to defense plus minus."
"Only guy who have won the MVP outside the top 3 (in his conference) is Westbrook for 40 years now. If you put the whole of the MVP history in consideration, KAJ is the second such guy (in his first year with the Lakers IIRC).  So while seeding it is not a requirement per se, it is **increeedibly** rare and odds beating to get one without finishing top 3 in your conference, heck even being outside the top 2 (and winning) is incredibly rare.  Thankfully (for Jokic) they are a run, away, from such a high seed. Less thankfully if Murray does not pull his weight , uncle Nikola has no chance."
"Players who are top 20 in both qualified PPG and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Zach LaVine. That‚Äôs it."
"Jarrett Allen has the highest TS% in basketball, and is therefore better than Nikola jokic."
Embiid ducks lockdown rim protector... Nikola Jokic?
"""He's like Nikola Jokic if Jokic was a shitty passer"" killed me."
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
Dude played as a small ball center for two years straight.  Every other night it was Anthony Davis or Nikola Jokic or Joel Embiid.
I wouldn't say he is Nikola Jokic without a pass I think he sees Nikolas highlights and says to himself oh I can do that
I have noticed one thing whenever i comment during day time something which criticises there favourite player i am bound to get downvote. But at night I usually get less hate.               Nikola Jokic is horrible at defense

Nikola and Rudy Jokic
"Players in top 20 in scoring and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Paul George, Zach LaVine.  that‚Äôs it. Insane how disrespected he is"
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De‚Äôaaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he‚Äôll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn‚Äôt good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
"Translation: Nikola Jokic finishes the game with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 15 assists, in the 112-150 loss against the Lakers"
"Seriously, and *even if* he turned it over less and shot better...one of the 3 is Nikola Jokic. It is actually not even close."

''Nikola Jokic''  ''he needs to win more''  nuggets 12-11   nets 14-12  the fck
That‚Äôs why Jokic is 5th. He and Curry are close but I‚Äôm giving the edge to Nikola this year so far.    Curry has had some bangers but has also put up way more stinkers than Jokic has
"Bro every comment on Jokic doesn't have to turn into a Joel/Jokic pissing match. I said if Jokic is going to play the level of defense he plays then he needs better defenders at the 2,3, and 4.   I didn't bring up Joel but yes, he and Gobert could play good defense behind those players. Trust me Embiid played with some turnstiles at guard and still had a majorly positive impact on that end. Belineli, Redick, freaking Bayless' trash ass. But we were always a good defense with him on the court.   If you say Jokic is playing better on defense then I'll take your word for it, but a center has to be a difference maker on that end imo. Not just slightly below or above average. But again that's just my opinion, surprise, surprise, this sub agrees with you lol. But there's no need to bring Joel into this and turn this into the 1,000,000th Joel/Nikola debate."
Nikola jokic got a triple-double in 14 minutes in 2018. Still blows my mind that players never get one in their careers.
