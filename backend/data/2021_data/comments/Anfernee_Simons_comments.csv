Anfernee Simons is just that good of a player
"The area where we draft well is hitting on second round picks.  Consistently nabbing guys in the second round that are at least of rotational value is definitely noteworthy.  GTJ, Will Barton, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton and Allen Crabbe were all second round picks that have had at least stints or more of decent rotational value.  These were all picks made under Neil Olshey.  Yes, you can definitely argue that our first round picks are not very successful.  Obviously Dame and CJ as first round picks were both A+, but as of recent, we've had some less than stellar picks.  The Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan first round picks both in 2017 probably being the worst.  Anfernee Simons as a late first in 2018 is still up for debate, but he's starting to look like a good player as of late.  Overall though, grading the Olshey era of drafting, I'd say the Blazers have been slightly above average."
"What gets me is refs just blowing their whistle when they can't even see shit, superstar calls are a thing -- you think Anfernee Simons would have gotten that whistle?  The other piece thing that became very apparent the past year or two to me is that if you reverse that score, no way Dame is getting that whistle up 6 with that little time left.  Refs have a STRONG bias to be whistle-happy for the losing team late in the game."
"Stotts has had several good defences in his reign in Portland. Our biggest issue this season is that we were having to compensate for Nurk not being 100% and for Enes Kanter being Enes Kanter  Our bench is the worst defensive unit in the NBA. There isn’t much you can do to compensate for Kanter, Melo, an injured Rodney Hood and Anfernee Simons being terrible defenders"
"It was the Nuggets, they attempted to get vs. the Blazers in round 2 instead of HOU/GSW.  It required the blazers to win a game where we rested our stars, but our rookie Anfernee Simons went crazy and scored 30 something to beat the Kings.  It was a good plan, but we still beat then in round 2"
I like how Maxey had one low efficiency 39 point game and everyone thinks he’s a top rookie. You guys remember Anfernee Simons? He scored 37 and is still trash.
Is Anfernee Simons still a thing? Lol
Shitposting aside I still think they have enough depth to survive for the time being.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons   SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little  SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm kind of high on the bench but that's still a serviceable 10-man rotation. The idea of Kanter holding down the defense is frightening but he did it during the playoffs when Portland made the WCF a few years ago.  I'm excited for Giles to get some consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest link in the rotation but hopefully he can step up with some consistent minutes. Gary Trent Jr. is ready to take the leap imo.
"The Blazers got murdered by injuries this year and its happening again this year. But honestly, I still think they have the depth to go further than they did last season.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons  SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm admittedly higher on the bench than a lot of people but I think there's decent depth through the roster and that's even with CJ, Nurk and Collins out. I'm happy to see Giles getting consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest guy in the rotation but maybe he just needs the opportunity to step up."
Anfernee Simons is gonna be 39 with a baby face. He looks almost the exact same as when he got drafted
"Probably, but they won’t do it. They stagger Dame and CJ for basically the entirety of games. Anfernee Simons is their young guard that they can give some minutes to here and there as well"
FINE BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE ANFERNEE SIMONS FOR TATUM
Shoutout to Anfernee Simons who scored 37 and hasn’t even scored 30 in a game since then.
Anfernee Simons type beat
Yeah no shit it's not relevant. Just like those players being out of the league 5 years later isn't relevant. That's my entire point man.    Lmao someone hasn't watched mario Hezonja   And man we also had anfernee Simons - statistically a bottom 5 player in the entire league last year - on our top 5 minutes played
"He nearly jumped over Anfernee Simons... like, casually. Without ""pushing off"" from the defender's shoulders like most do, including the infamous Vince dunk in the Olympics."

Can I interest you in Anfernee Simons and one lightly used Zach Collins?
Slam Dunk Champion Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons it is.
Doesn't matter ~~had sex~~ won dunk contest  -Anfernee Simons
"you right,  anfernee simons both dunks were absolutely not boring or basic. the slow mo really captured how he didn't kiss the rim or do anything other than...  bro grabbing the ball and dunking it in the air is actually easier than bringing the ball up to dunk, its why people catch ups to dunk when they first start out because they get more lift *without* the ball"
"If *looking basic* is the metric to judge by, then anfernee simons should have scored a 35 on his first dunk"
Anfernee Simons
Bruh why would the NBA care enough to rig the freaking dunk contest in the favor of Anfernee Simons of all people?
That Anfernee Simons dunk was cool. All Dwight did in his Superman dunk was “jump high.” It’s still awesome to see a human do that.
BREAKING: Dunk contest winner Anfernee Simons has been robbed backstage. The thief approached as if to congratulate him but instead stole his dunk contest trophy. Security is actively looking for what is being described as a 6’8 big black mouse. More to follow.
"He was better than the last Anfernee dunk and he also had the best dunk in the whole contest with his first one. Whatever i guess, I won money on Simons"

Narrator: “and this is the last we ever heard of Anfernee Simons”
Anfernee Simons is a dunk contest champion in the same way that Aljamain Sterling is Bantamweight champion.
Holy shit that’s terrible   Obi won that shit  Fuck Anfernee Simons
#ANFERNEE SIMONS
"fun fact, Anfernee Simons is named after Anfernee Penny Hardaway"
Anfernee Simons looks like a sobered BI
Anfernee Simons reminds me of [Bucky](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/85/63/44/8563444e75aa8cdf1cf109cda80d2bce.jpg) from Fat Albert show
Anfernee Simons fined for saying he wants to go to the Raptors
that dunk is older than anfernee simons
Anthony? No anfernee. Simmons? No simons
Why does anfernee Simons look like brandon Ingram
Anfernee “Simmons” Simons
Anfernee Simons looks 14 yrs old my guy has such a baby face
Anfernee Simons looks like he’s 15
Cassius Stanley? Anfernee Simons? Really lol?
"Ah yes, now to watch Obi Toppin, Anfernee Simons and Cassius Stanley in the all star weekend dunk contest."
That thing?  Be Anfernee Simons in the NBA Dunk Contest.
People wanted Anthony Edwards but instead are getting Anfernee Simons (both nicknamed Ant)
"No mention of the Blazers who have been playing without their 2nd and 3rd best players for most of the season? Plus another potential starter (Zach Collins) out for the season?  Blazers depth is the only reason they remain in the playoff hunt despite being the most injured team in the entire league. They will have a full 10 man rotation available again after the All Star break:  PG: Lillard, Anfernee Simons SG: CJ, Trent Jr. SF: Derrick Jones, Rodney Hood PF: Covington, Melo C: Nurkic, Kanter  And that's not including fast improving Nassir Little and out for the season Zach Collins. Little may be good enough to fight for the starting SF spot next season."
It's all up to Anfernee Simons and Cassius Stanley to carry this dunk contest now.
"Tell me who he deserves to be better than. Really. Because I've heard y'all say this same stuff about Anfernee Simons too. I understand overhyping your young guys, every single fan does that. But it's like a Blazers tradition to really overdo it.   Trent looks like a fine young player. But to pretend he's some superstar potential prospect is just disingenuous."
Lavine.   I'll throw anfernee Simons in there though   Current shooting 41% from 3 and easily has dunk contest athleticism
Anfernee Simons' shoe.
Anfernee Simons needs to be.
Anfernee Simons
"Anfernee ""Jesse Lingaard"" Simons"
i feel like anfernee simons should be really good by now idk he's still young
Anfernee Simons and 2 seconds should get it done
Okpala kinda looks like Anfernee Simons
"from what I can tell they're all like this.  Putting the ""fan"" in fanatic.  I also subscribe to r/ripcity since I live in Portland and they're all convinced that Zach Collins &amp; Anfernee Simons will be all-stars, that Neil Olshey is a top 5 GM (or that he's the worst in the league) and that Terry Stotts should be fired because he can't make a line-up that features Dame, CJ, Melo &amp; Kanter good on defense."
Lots of hype because of that big scoring game he had. Reminds me of when anfernee simons had 40(?) late in his rookie year and there was lots of hype about him after that
he is still tier above Anfernee Simons
"I would've kept it at Ant, but we've got an Ant of our own on the Blazers in Anfernee Simons. Safe to say Anthony Edwards will be running away with the nickname soon though!"
"The Blazers roster around Dame for most of this season has been Robert Covington, Gary Trent, Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Jones, Anfernee Simons, Rodney Hood, and Harry Giles..."
"Except for the fact they now have Anfernee Simons to match up with who is the worst defending guard on our team. Losing our two other playmakers has hurt the team a lot, and we are overperfomlng against a relatively easy schedule so far.   I think the matchup point is moot when Simons and Kanter are getting big minutes to compensate and they are some of the easiest players in the league to matchup on."
"Free Dame? He wants to be in Portland. Our team is stacked with young talent. Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Harry Giles. We were in the Western conference Finals two years ago you talk like we didn’t win any playoff series in the last five years. We are 18-10 with CJ and Nurk out. If we need anything it’s a new coach. Dame wants to stay and Portland would only trade him if he requested it. CJ has been on fire all season before his fractured foot. Portland led in the fourth quarter of every game in the West Finals but Golden State came up big. These were close games even though it ended in a sweep."
So what Dame does every year?  Last year we had to give minutes to Anthony Tolliver and Mario Hezonja.  This year Anfernee Simons and Harry Giles are playing significant minutes.
Gary Trent and Anfernee Simons grew into gods on my 2k career mode last year.   I foresaw this coming.
Anfernee Simons with NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
Why does Anfernee Simons have the nickname Ant? Anthony Edwards being called Ant atleast makes sense
"His shooting was pretty poor early on in the season, but the past couple weeks he has been hitting 3s much more consistently. He has had a few decent nights of scoring, but nothing crazy. But we don’t really need him to score loads when we have Dame, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons and CJ when he is healthy.   I’m no expert, but in my opinion his defense has been massive for us. He has had some very very clutch steals and pokes, not many blocks. The combo of him and Derrick Jones Jr. has been a much needed boost all around defensively compared to last season. Those big wingspans get their hands on everything lol.   Overall I would say just about any Blazer fan you talk to would be very happy with the RoCo signing. We’ve always lacked defensive ability, but it’s been a lot better than last season imo."
"Teenager drops 30 in one game and everyone thinks he's a future superstar, he's the new Anfernee Simons"
"Yeah but it’s not like it’s insurmountable to get the 2 seed, with AD hurt and the Clippers liking their rest. If Lillard can continue to play lights out, the blazers hold serve, and they get their starters back? They could potentially grab that number 2 seed. You’re telling me that a guy averaging 30 and 7 on the 2 seed in the west, with key starters missing months, that guy doesn’t get MVP chatter? Not saying it’s likely, but there will only get deeper as players get healthier, assuming no setbacks. Anfernee simons went from a bum to a certified microwave, and Gary Trent is pushing us further into the luxury tax with his future contract every game lol. The 2 seed isn’t out of reach of the Blazers just keep up the good play while everyone is banged up."
"Two of Gary Trent, Anfernee Simons, and Nassir Little improving to the point at which they're legitimately good players who can be traded as the centerpiece for the next disgruntled star is really our only hope."
Just pieces from the same athletic article. Anfernee Simons will be the next news
"Blazers when healthy has a bench of   - Anfernee Simons - Gary Trent  - Carmelo Anthony - Zach Collins - Enes Kanter  As well as Rodney hood, Harry Giles and Nasir Little"
Honestly think that’s how Gary Trent Jr built his reputations with the refs as a strong aggressive defender. He was so explicit in showing every ref that he was physical but not fouling because he would shift his hands behind his back so often and exaggerate the fact that his hands weren’t fouling. Eventually refs just started to buy in to his aggressive ball hounding. No Blazer fan thought he could be a plus defender because of his lack of lateral quickness. Anfernee Simons even said that he wants to learn GTJ type of aggressive defense because Anf got tired of getting called for fouls so he tries to plays D passively. So he ends up getting scored in every-time or still ends up fouling.
"I’ve watched them both play. Steph would not do better than dame, unless he got to take draymond green with him. The blazers have no secondary playmaking, even when McCollum isn’t hurt. I was definitely exaggerating but there’s a reason Jones jr, Enes Kanter, and and anfernee simons aren’t playoff starters on other teams haha. Lillard might do worse, but I think Steve Kerr is a good coach, and he would have draymond, so maybe not."
"Anfernee Simons, Gary Trent Jr, Nassir Little"
"pre-injury Nurk was much better, even so his touch was always kinda iffy and he's always been pretty methodical with everything he does.  I think the RoCo trade was decent process when they made the move, unfortunately it hasn't panned out well.  My biggest criticism of it was that it was probably 2 years too late to get him (I thought the same thing when they finally traded for Ariza last year, he'd have been the ideal fit next to Dame &amp; CJ like 4 years ago but instead the Blazers had ET &amp; Harkless).   Trust me, I am driving the ""Neil Olshey is culpable"" bandwagon.  He's extremely high variance and I don't trust his process/strategy much at all.  Drafting Dame &amp; CJ=excellent.  Deciding that the seemingly frisky playoff team was worth paying &amp; they were one ET away from truly contending=cripplingly bad.  Nurkic trade=home run.  Drafting Zach Collins &amp; Anfernee Simons=kinda bad.  Drafting Gary Trent Jr.=good.  Dude is all over the map which is equivalent to shitting the bed in a small market."
"Wanamaker, Shamet, Olynyk, and Anfernee Simons stand out to me."
For some reason anfernee simons tends to play better than his avg too
I’ll give you anfernee simons for lavine
"Donte DiVicenzo, THT and Anfernee Simons."

Also a reminder that there's a clip on Youtube of Freshman LaMelo Ball making RJ Barrett and Anfernee Simons look bad.
"Did Giannis get owned by CJ Ellerby, Anfernee Simons, and the corpse of Carmelo Anthony this week?"
can't believe we spent 3 years gherk yerking to Anfernee Simons and gave up on Wenyen in 6 months.
"Same thing happened with one of our young guys over on /r/ripcity   Anfernee Simons sat on the bench his entire rookie year, the sub hyped him up as a 6th man candidate prior to last season. He didn't play well enough and a bunch of fans were basically convinced he's garbage and that we should trade him. It just boggles my mind that some fans expect a 20 year old kid who didn't play at all besides garbage time his rookie season to magically ascend to a 6th man candidate the next season. I ate many downvotes trying to defend him on /r/ripcity"
"Anfernee Simons, the only thing he does is shoot 3s and when he tries to playmake when Dame/Cj sit it's so tough to watch"
"Anfernee Simons is my choice, but you know that being a Blazer fan."
"Not that difficult. Lillard has has an outstanding season, leading less a than stellar supporting cast to a good record, largely on the strength of clutch heroics. The Blazers have had to play Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, and Anfernee Simons for significant minutes this year. They are known defensive sieves. Lillard is not a great defender himself, so he just makes sure that his team scores more than the other. Now that they are getting more healthy, their defensive rating will go from historically bad to just bad, and their offensive will stay the same. Their net rating will improve, and they will climb slightly in the standings."
"GTj, Anfernee Simons, and Jake Layman all played 48:00 that game. All 240 minutes were split between 6 players. Wild."
"Because you've never seen him play this year, and you only look at defensive rating.  RoCo is having a phenomenal year, as good on that end as his last all-defensive team season.   Literally no player could individually make a team with Kanter, Melo, CJ, Dame, Anfernee Simons, etc a good defensive team.   Also, in the small sample size of having Nurkic in the lineup, we have been average.   And in clutch time over the whole season, we've been average+, even with injuries"
"It's frustrating watching these Anfernee Simons minutes at times, but he really needs to develop now that GTJ is gone."
"ha ha, what's unfair is making 1.2 mil for the same production you had on the Pistons with a better team.  Anfernee Simons is making 2.2 million this year and was a deep second round pick on his rookie sheet.  ""Ha ha, you said I was washed before I took a deal to be a competent starter on a championship team for less money than a second round pick! haha you guys are so crazy!"""
I think Anfernee Simons kept trying to score in one of those games that was already decided too lol
"Yes they would. We know, because Dame had a worse team this season for 31 games and we did way better.  The Blazers went 18-13 with Gary Trent Junior as our 2nd best player because Nurkic and CJ were both out. Dude is 22 year old. We gave big minutes to Anfernee Simons (21) and Nassir Little (20). Steph isn't the only one with bad and young teammates  Wiggins is literally scoring more a game *and* scoring more efficiently than Trent.  Think Oubre's 52% TS% is bad? Try Rodney Hood's **league worst 43.6%**  Harden and Dame are flat out better at carrying a team than Curry is (and Harden is just a better player at this point). Dame would kill to have someone like Draymond on this team to beat traps and an actual defense around him instead of **the 29th ranked defense in the NBA** because Enes Kanter was our rim protector and only big on the roster."
Remember when Blazers fans said Anfernee Simons was untouchable? 💀
"When you have to add a disclaimer about how they’ve been struggling without Davis, then it furthers the point that he’s not the MVP.   Dame has been without CJ and Nurk. He’s been carrying that team with the likes of Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons and Derrick Jones Jr (when he’s healthy).   I hate to even say it, but I’d put Harden ahead of LeBron as well given the fact that I think KD’s knee is a wee bit more problematic than the team is letting on."
Anfernee Simons
"Yeah the fire stotts crowd points to the fact that we’ve almost never had a top ten defense under him, and usually it’s closer to bottom third. The stotts stans point to the fact that we had a decent defense when we had batum, Matthews and Aldridge, and again when we had Nurkic for a full season, and we are always near the top offensively. I will say that I find it difficult to believe that even Frank Vogel or Thibs or anyone else could take this current roster and do much better. Enes Kanter is our starting center, and our backup center is our starting power forward, who’s 6’9” Also Melo and Anfernee Simons play significant minutes."
Obvious: Zach Lavine  Hot takes: Jaylen Brown or Anfernee Simons.  -Simons already won the dunk contest (controversy aside) and is a great shooter. Still young and should improve.  -Jaylen Brown has been a great shooter the last 2 years (and trending up) and is crazy athletic  Skills challenge is a crapshoot
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
Nassir Little may end up being the best of the Zach Collins/Anfernee Simons/Gary Trent Jr draft pick group.
Anfernee simons and Brandon Ingram
Anfernee Simons and a protected pick for Gordon? Is that even close to reasonable? IDK Eric Gordon's real market value at all
"I wasn’t aware that these teams ran through their stars, up until today I thought Dwight Powell and Anfernee Simons led the Mavs and Blazers respectively"
Try to find Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons looking like a stalker hiding in the bushes in those photos lol
Want Anfernee Simons and a second?
I think Anfernee Simons might end up as a Jordan Clarkson/Lou Williams type player. 6th man scorer who can shoot with bad defense.
Blazers tried to avoid Russ that year too but Anfernee NBA Dunk Champion Simons dropped 37 on the Kings for the W
I don’t know if there’s anybody in the nba who has worse awareness defensively than Anfernee Simons
"Anfernee ""Almost kissed the rim"" Simons"
"We were already super lucky to get that 1st pick with Martell Webster on the team. If we had Chris Paul he might have bumped us into the playoffs and no lottery pick at all. Chris Paul was that good that early. Considering how much Paul Allen loves drafting PGs (all the way up to Anfernee Simons), I'm surprised they went for Martell."
Yup this is my whole thing. If people want a coaching change then fine but if we run it back with this same roster we’re going to run into the exact same issues unless Nassir Little or/and Anfernee Simons take unrealistically huge leaps
"I’ve wanted Thad Young on the team for the longest time, maybe since LMA left. Aaron Gordon would also have been perfect but apparently our GM didn’t want to give up Anfernee Simons for him"
Hopefully Anfernee Simons gets playing time
"I once saw a scouting report describe a guy as ""The next Anfernee Simons"" and I don't know how that's supposed to help"
Anfernee Hardaway + Ben Simons
"Harold Miner  Back when you could attend games, Simons was known for his [dunking](https://www.blazersedge.com/2020/1/12/21062556/moms-favorite-anfernee-simons-keeping-games-interesting-portland-trail-blazers) and he had some spectacular misses as well when he resorted to showboating.  As for his hot three point streak, how 'bout [Derick Rose](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01.html)? Career average around 30% then got hot for a few games with the Timberwolves from 3 during his comeback season before reverting to his mean."

Anfernee Simons wtf
"Thank you Anfernee Simons, very cool!"
"You’re right, but Anfernee Simons is 100% off the table."
Anfernee Simons is honestly lowkey on his way out of this league.
"Statistically, Anfernee Simons is last in defensive RAPTOR, second to last in defensive LEBRON, and would be tied for fourth worst in DBPM if he qualified in minutes.  He's pretty bad."
Anfernee Simons no doubt
"It is very easy to score on that dumpster fire of a bench unit with Enes Kanter Carmelo Anthony and Anfernee Simons. Like, comedically easy layup lines. The starting lineup of Dame Cj Norm Roco Nurkic is shockingly 19th in defensive rating but that bench unit has the two worst frontcourt defenders in the league"
You would think this is an easy Blazers loss but it's actually about to be a 20 point blowout behind Anfernee Simons' 40 point new career high game!   ^let ^me ^dream ^please
"&gt; No serious playoff team is giving heavy minutes to Enes Kanter, Melo and Anfernee Simons.   Hey it's like my team!"
"Yup, our roster has so many flaws. No serious playoff team is giving heavy minutes to Enes Kanter, Melo and Anfernee Simons. Our starting 5 when everyone is healthy is mostly fine, our bench might be one of the 5 worst in the entire league"
"Anfernee Simons  and Kanter balled out in this game, props to them"
"Anfernee Simons is another talented guard who's gotten a lot better in their developmental system. Just sucks that younger guards in Portland are usually stuck behind Dame and CJ, so I'm happy GTJ got his opportunity to shine in Toronto. Ant is next up for sure"
"Anfernee Simons but i guess my description would fit him as well, althought MPJ is 10000x better"
"While that's true, this same point applies to players like Carmelo Anthony and Anfernee Simons on the blazers, THJ on the Mavericks, Maxey and (to a lesser extent)Dwight on the 76ers, etc. all of them have horrible +/- numbers which hurt the MVP candidates like Luka, Dame, and Embiid when they play."
"It is absolutely not.  The only worse defensive point guard than Trae is maybe Anfernee Simons, and he isn’t a starter.  Even if he has “improved”, he’s still the worst."
"Nah our GM never wants to let go of dudes he drafts in the first round. He gave Meyers Leonard 40 million dollars, apparently refused to include Anfernee Simons in trade packages for Aaron Gordon"
"CJ McCollum, Anfernee Simons, and Carmelo Anthony all hit over 40% from 3 and 80% from the line.  Portland can also throw in a 2037 2nd round pick.  Who says no?"
"I doubt any current player has the potential maybe, Anfernee Simons? But, I pick Jamal Murray's bubble version. He also shot over 40 from 3 this season despite a very slow start. He has the potential to be somewhat close to Curry as a shooter."
I've already told you dude. Read the comments and ingest the information instead of just waiting for your chance to word vomit inaccurate negativity.  Kanter's minutes would've been replaced by Zach Collins. This is neither a Terry or Neil (roster construction) problem since he re-broke his ankle during preseason training camp. It was on Terry to play Kanter over Rondae Hollis Jefferson and Harry Giles at the 5.   Melo's minutes could've been replaced by Derrick Jones Jr and/or Nassir Little. DJJ was our max MLE free agent signing and Nassir Little was a promising 2nd year 1st round pick.  Dame sits for a whole 8-10 minutes a game. During that period we played Anfernee Simons at guard who's a deadly scorer (way more efficient than Carmelo fucking Anthony).  You're just speaking straight nonsense right now. Go away.
"can we stop with applying the same nickname to multiple players, ant is anthony edwards on the timberwolves, if you’re referring to anfernee simons there isn’t even a T in his first name lol"
"Basically yeah, said that this team shouldn't be bad defensively, dude created a roster with Dame Lillard, CJ, Melo, Kanter, Anfernee Simons and Norm Powell a 6'3 guy playing the 3 and was like ""We have Covington and Derrrick Jones, we should be a good defense"""
I'm gonna throw anfernee Simons name out there. He's got the jumper down now  He just needs to figure out how to use his athleticism
"Meanwhile, Anfernee Simons is a career 50% from three in the playoffs."
Anfernee Simons!!
"Terry and MDA run similar defenses in that they play conservative basic schemes playing percentages and aiming to be a solid but not incredible defensive squad with an elite offense   The Blazers defense was awful this year without Nurk and part of that was trying to implement a more aggressive scheme but not fully committing to it and just getting the worst of both worlds for a month or two. Other parts of it were just having Dame playing through injuries and carrying the offense so he would get caught conserving energy on defense a lot, CJ constantly leaving his man open, Melo playing okay one on one D (he was probably one of the five best defenders on the team this year which should tell you something), Kanter getting murdered at the rim (he does give it his all though so I can't help but love him, this also forced us to leave shooters open when Nurk was out for two months because we always had to help down to prevent easy layups and leave shooters), Anfernee Simons weighing 90 pounds. Roco, Derrick Jones and the few weeks Nurk and Norm were finally on the court were the only good defensive players on the entire roster  Fans were criticizing Terry for not using Harry Giles for his defense, which if that is the proposed solution should tell you that it was also a major roster construction issue not just a coaching one"
Campazzo and Rivers would make our rotation. Anfernee Simons is the only bench players from our roster that would make Denver’s rotation  Our bench is arguably the worst of all the playoff teams
Last 6 seasons he’s a 83% ft shooter   He shot 50/40/81 this year   Soemthing to consider.. without Dame his efficiency dips. BUT.. you aren’t replacing dame with another talent or above average replacement level player.. anfernee simons isn’t it... so if he didn’t have Dame but had A creator for him like Rubio or rondo for instance or if he played pg and had a respected shooter replace dame for his spacing I think his efficiency improves marginally. Which puts him pretty close to elite offensively.
"Johnathon Simmons, Ben McLemore, Ben Bentil shaking. Anfernee Simons formally withdraws."
"Yeah, I’m definitely overvaluing Anfernee Simons. I just don’t think that the Blazers firsts are worth that much, especially because we already traded this year’s."
"This looks like a good place to repeat my somewhat-popular trade idea  Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 2 Blazers 1sts  * 2 Heat 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline. BI is the greatest asset in the trade so the Heat pay the most. They can build around a BI/Bam duo for the next decade.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as four first round picks to help with their rebuild. That leaves them with 8 picks they can trade if needed! Can upgrade PG and/or SF  -- maybe they package picks with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams. Or maybe offer the Cavs Bledsoe and 4 1sts for Colin Sexton. Etc."
Anfernee simons for Ben Simmons. Let’s fuck with that.
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * OG Anunoby  Raptors get:   * Eric Bledsoe  * Anfernee Simons  * 3 Pelicans 1sts  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  Blazers flip CJ, for a SF, a desperate need -- and OG is a top 3 perimeter defender in the league. They contend with Dame/Norm/OG/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans pay up to flip Bledsoe's useless contract for a great shooterwho helps space the floor for Zion.  Raptors pick up assets and a young player to further help them retool"
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as three first round picks to help with their rebuild -- maybe they package those with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams"
"&gt; Although I’m not convinced that snagging CJ for long term (albeit less money) is any better, financially.  Yeah I would agree - it isn't any better for them.  &gt; The reason I think the trade could work is that we can attach picks and promising young players to it. The Heat also fizzled out early, so they may want a change.  Jimmy is the perfect Miami Heat player. I don't see a world where MIA values some late 1sts (which POR 1sts will be late with Dame, Jimmy, Norm &amp; Nurkic) and Anfernee Simons (who will be a RFA next summer) or Nassir Little.   I think MIA is fine rolling the dice with their current core and internal growth of homegrown players + future free agency. I mean they signed Butler to a max contract when they had negative cap space lol"
"The 2018 draft is making bank this year. Multiple TRUE superstars at the top, and 20+ picks of incredible long term starter caliber and rotational depth. This is gonna be a hell of a redraft to mock in 10 years.  Some of the guys who just showed FLASHES this year... Alize Johnson? Hamidou Diallo? Anfernee Simons? On top of the established talent from the draft.  What a draft..."
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as three first round picks to help with their rebuild -- maybe they package those with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams"
"this team had a coach who made kanter and melo (2 players that were either out of the league or were given away for free) major rotation players. 20+ minutes a night for each of em. That more than anything sank this team since they're so awful on defense and they had a coach who was committed to playing them, which created an accountability problem (if you were to watch nurk's post game session, this was obvious).  Keeping a core of Nurk/RoCo/Norman/Dame (and hopefully trading CJ + FRP's for a SF of some sort) is really nice. Zach Collins/Nassir Little/Derrick Jones Jr/Anfernee Simons are much better options to come off the bench than guys like Melo/Kanter, who just brick your entire team.  The org just needs to get this coaching hire correct, re-sign Norm and find a decent trade package for CJ (doesn't need to be a star, just need a better fit - like a Harrison Barnes type). And obviously move on from Kanter and Melo (who are FA's).   I just don't understand why it's so hard to picture fixing Portland."
"Write a 500 word essay on how you'll fix a defense with Kanter, Anfernee Simons, CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard"
"Yeah having Dame, CJ, Melo, Kanter and Anfernee Simons should produce an elite defense, especially with Nurkic out half the season.  Honestly pretty classless, I guess Olshey is as mediocre as a human being as he is as a GM"
Anfernee Simons winning MIP this season
"CJ, Anfernee Simons and a pick for Ben Simmons. Make it happen"
"Idk the unknown players on other teams, because they're unknown  But if it's a Blazer, it'll be Anfernee Simons"
3 way trade:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler   Mavs get:   * CJ McCollum   Heat get:   * KP   * Anfernee Simons  * 1 Mavericks 1st   * 2 Blazers 1sts
"All traded except for Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, and Nassir Little"
A lot of them were traded away  We picked Ronde Hollis Jefferson in 2015 who was traded for Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton who we developed into an NBA player  Didn’t have one in 16 I don’t think   2017. We picked Zach Collins at 10 and Caleb Swannigan in the late 20s which considering the talent available in our range in that draft is a franchise altering disaster   18 we picked Anfernee Simons at 24 or 26 which was a good pick  19 we picked Nas Little who has shown flashes of being good but needs time  20 we didn’t have a pick
"I don't think Olshey is the problem. The problem is Portland has had to build from the draft. Lillard, McCollum were both drafted by Olshey. And this is exactly why he's paying max to two score first guards. Portland has never had the luxury to construct a roster like 20+ other more attractive markets from free agency.  As a Blazer fan, he's overachieved. Olshey also drafted Gary Trent Jr. (late 2nd) and Anfernee Simons (late 1st)."
Lmao what? We developed GTJ and Anfernee Simons after he left
"what about CJ McCollum, Derrick Jones Jr. &amp; Anfernee Simons to the Pelicans for Brandon Ingram &amp; Eric Bledsoe's terrible contract?  Maybe some draft compensation has to also go to the Pelicans in this scenario?"
Anfernee Simons   Who says no.
"It wasn't even that lol. Portland didn't want to give up Anfernee Simons in an Aaron Gordon trade, which is so dumb"
Anfernee Simons to Orlando. I mean the dude is even named after Penny
"We traded two firsts for RoCo, so I think that we only have one first in the next five years that we're even able to trade. You'd need to flip CJ for another guy who has a big contract, but isn't in a good fit. People were bringing up Tobias Harris but he seems to be working in Philly recently.   Honestly, I was hoping CJ would light it up in a few of the recent games so that his trade value would increase going into the summer but it didn't happen. Zach Collins is always injured and Anfernee Simons was given a few chances to really break into the team but never really earned it.   We almost need to get lucky next year with Ant or Nas Little lighting it up for a few months to create a young guy with value, then swap them for somebody who fits better."
"2018 has just some solid ass players all around whether they in the playoffs or not right now:  Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr., Trae, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Divencenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen. A lot of quality picks."
"I think their front offense sucks. Neil Olshey is too precious with ""his"" guys. He has kicked and screamed anytime cj trades or anfernee simons trades come up. He drafts well, but terrible at all other aspects of GM. Don't forget Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard contracts..."
I like Anfernee Simons. He kinda reminds me of Art Garfunkel
Anfernee Simons saved my crops
"When Dame sits, the guard rotation is CJ and Anfernee Simons, both of whom are even more sorry on defense than Dame, while not even offering half his offensive production"
You forgot my boy Anfernee Simons! Hitting big 3s off the bench
Give anfernee simons a bigger role.
"I think Covington is a great defender and a good 3 point shooter at this point... but if he can’t operate out of the dunker spot and makes fucking DUNKS... get him a blow and let’s see Derrick Jones Jr.   Or GET Anfernee in there, no one else was making anything OR stopping anyone. At least Simons will make shots...  Ugh bad loss"
Anfernee Simons is my MVP too
Was roommates with a dude named Anfernee so I've always liked Simons
"It's not Jokic, it that Anfernee Simons + Melo with no Dame on the floor = free buckets all day and zero play making"
"Portland owns all of their draft picks (after this upcoming draft), and still have Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little on rookie contracts as asset sweeteners. Gary Trent Jr trick y'all, dudes about to be overpaid relative to the value he provides on the court after this summer. The RFA is a curse, not a blessing."
"Easier said than done. Portland's got all their money tied up in Dame and CJ (next year almost 75 million just between them TWO!!!). Everyone else is on really good value contracts really. Nurk is on 12 million. RoCo is 13 million. Melo is on a vet min, and he is gotta be the most productive vet min contract in the entire league. Rest are rookie contracts.  There is no cap space available. Only thing Portland can try is to trade CJ, but firstly he's Dame's best friend, and secondly probably can't get an equal value return for CJ.  Firing Stotts may well turn into the same scenario like Indy where the new guy won't do any better.  I think Portland most likely goes with the same players next season (maybe new coach), and hope Zach Collins is healthy and good, and the rest of youngsters like Anfernee Simons and Nas Little make a leap."
Hot Take: Anfernee Simons
"I feel for him because Blazers just don’t have the kind of personnel where he can really be as flexible as people want them to be. Anfernee simons hasn’t panned out like they wanted him to(still rootin for the kid, but he hasn’t).   There’s just not a lot of choices to make with that roster."
"Dude this gets called all the time. Ref may have missed it, but I can tell you Anfernee Simons gets called for that 100% of the time. Melo maybe 20% of the time.. its a foul, but certain players get away with it more than others.   You'd expect the ref to give the call to the superstar, not the rookie. We were called for 10 fouls that quarter (3rd), you were called for 1."
I *wish* we had Anfernee Simons and Melo in our playoff rotation right now.
"According to NBA stats, Harrell is the 13th ranked defensive center based on defensive win share, whereas Zeller is ranked 46th.   ""Players Defense | Stats | NBA.com"" https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_WS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=C  Though, I don't disagree with the website you posted ranking Anfernee Simons as the worst defender in the league."
Brb I need to go delete my preseason prediction of Anfernee Simons winning MIP
the new anfernee simons? lol simons is like 21   actually just looked it up simons is 11 days older than poole
The disrespect to anfernee simons
Put some respect on Anfernee Simons.
"Imagine not mentioning the dunk champion himself, Anfernee Simons who ended up going 5/6 from the field including 4/5 from 3 for 14 points along with 4 rebounds and 2 assists in only 23 minutes of play."
"for someone who's said ""bye"" more than once you still seem to be hanging around an awful lot.  You acknowledge that my comment was a joke &amp; yet you are taking this awfully seriously, as if highlight threads on r/nba have been a bastion for civil &amp; enlightened discourse at any time in recent memory.  The point is that perhaps you should lighten up and feel free to scroll on at any time.  Despite trying to attack me for being a ""casual"" and for somehow stereotyping you based on your flair, you seem to be more than willing to do the same thing back to me.  It seems like really you have an axe to grind &amp; took offense to me not living &amp; dying with the Bucks, which is insanely weird.  Did you ever stop to think that my comment about cellar teams in the NBA was pointed more at the Kings/Bulls/Hawks years of Jabari's career?    Since you want r/nba to be a shining beacon of intelligent discourse, how do you feel the Nuggets did tonight against the Blazers?  Do you think Jokic will be able to score enough to punish the Blazers &amp; force them to double so he can pass &amp; really unlock what makes Denver dangerous?  Do you think that MPJ &amp; Aaron Gordon can create enough offense to make it easy on Jokic and draw enough attention to even up the series?  Does Denver have anyone that can help Jokic punish Portland's PnR defense and expose Kanter?  To me, isoing Jokic against big bodies like Nurkic &amp; Kanter may not work, getting those guys moving &amp; into rotation and hitting the smaller Portland guards with screens seems like a recipe for success.     At face value it seems like Facu &amp; Austin Rivers won't have nearly enough to offset what Dame &amp; CJ can do, but maybe if Will Barton comes back they'll have a better shot.  The real X-factors will likely be whether or not Monte Morris can be healthy enough to give the Nuggets anything and how long Portland can survive with Anfernee Simons on the floor.  How do you feel about his development in general?  Do you think he's worth extending this summer?"
Anfernee Simons
"He'd probably be a more effective Anfernee Simons in that he can run the offense when Dame sits. He doesn't fit within the current starters, though, as Portland already starts three guards and they're all better than Ball."
Anfernee Simons
Did anyone have Anfernee Simons and Markus Howard playing meaningful playoff minutes?
"Lol excuse me? The last time we played you we started al faruoq aminu, moe harkless, and Meyers Leonard.   Last year we made the playoffs with a team whose 3rd, 4th, and 5th most minutes being Hassan whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and anfernee simons(who was arguably the worst player in the league last year)   Look at those world beaters! Not to mention you had a top 5 defense lol. You trying to tell me g leaguers did that? Or you think Steph carried that defense"
Anfernee Simons
"Yep, bet your ass in our series there will be a game Anfernee Simons hits 5 or 6 threes"
Anfernee Simons doesn't even have a T in his name. Find a new slant
Very cool how quickly Anfernee Simons has improved as a defender. Well deserved nomination for him.
"You could say the exact same for the Blazers last year.   Nurk out until the bubble, Hood and Collins out the whole season basically. And all three were starters.   Had whiteside as our starting center and this season he was the backup for the Kings and only played 36 games.   Meaningful rotation minutes to Hezonja, Tolliver, Labisierre, Swanigan and all three are out of the league.   Hoard and Gabriel started games and the two of them played a combined 40 games this season.   We had 20 games of Trevor Ariza. Half of a season of Bazemore who’s on the warriors now and half a season of Melo who was out of the league for a year.   GTJ didn’t break out until the bubble. Nassir Little was a rookie and extremely raw. And Anfernee Simons was statistically a bottom 5 player in the league.   We don’t have Dame we would’ve struggled to break 10 wins. CJ is better than anyone Steph has offensively but you could argue Dray, Wiggins, Oubre are all better than anyone we had defensively last season. Not to mention covid fucked our schedule. When the season got postponed we had around 20 games left and the easiest sos. But in the bubble we ended up having the second hardest."
"LOL.   Top 10 in Mins played on Blazers last season: CJ then Dame, Hassan Whiteside, Melo, Anfernee Simons, Gary Trent, Baze, Hezonja, Ariza, Hood  Top 10 in mins played on Warriors this season: Wiggins then Curry, Dray, Oubre, Baze, Looney, JTA, Damion Lee, Jordan Poole, Wiseman  That's Dame with a supporting cast that has a 22ppg guy in CJ, then secondary scoring from Melo, Hood, Whiteside, Ariiza all average &gt;10ppg  This season Curry had only Wiggins, Oubre, Poole, Wiseman average &gt;10ppg  Lillard did a crazy carry last season but still Curry this season has been a few levels ahead."
"Let me just go down the roster. There's a lot of unknowns.   Dame - definitely staying  CJ - if we make it out of the first round, I'd say he's definitely staying. If we lose in the first round, who knows. Total wildcard  Norm - another total wildcard. Will he want to stay somewhere he's the 3rd best guard? If he does, how much are we willing to pay a 3rd 6'3 guard who we'll have to play at SF? Repeater tax is an issue as well  RoCo - definitely staying  Nurk - definitely staying  Melo - likely upto him if he wants to play another season. I don't see us not signing him if he wants to come back  DJJ - has a PO for 10mil so he could leave for a bigger role, but idk how much money he'll find. I think he stays  Anfernee Simons - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Enes Kanter - likely gonna re-sign him, but definitely possible that we let him walk  RHJ - unless he gets a better offer from somewhere else, I think we'd keep him on a min  Nassir Little - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Harry Giles - probably going somewhere else where he'll either get more than a minimum or will get more mins  Zach Collins - another wildcard. How do you come to a fair contract value with someone who essentially hasn't played in 2 years. Gun to my head, we re-sign him even if it's just the QO  CJ Elleby - staying"
Why would the genie want to make Anfernee Simons worse?
"Yes, unless this genie also gave Anfernee Simons the combined defensive ability of 2016 LeBron and the 2004 Detroit Pistons."
He didn't bypass any rule. He was a year removed from high school which is when you can legally enter your name in the draft. There's tons of unconventional paths. RJ Hampton played pro a year after high school and entered the draft. Anfernee Simons went to IMG academy as a post-grad route to the league. Bazley and Mitchell Robinson straight up skipped going to any team after high school and trained for the draft. Even before those guys Mudiay and Jennings played pro one year after HS before entering the draft.
"Where do I find the full list? Anfernee Simons jumped from 33.2 to 42.6, so based on this, he's somewhere between 2-9"
"Sure, Oubre's better than replacement, and probably better than Anfernee Simons or Derrick Jones. But not a great starter. But yeah, probably useful in the 18mpg range.   Wiseman I think was negative himself. Even with Looney the Warriors play much better. I think fundamentally, having a center who runs to the block on every possession and calls for a post up is not a good fit next to Steph on offense. Likewise, defense is valuable for the Warriors, they are generally better off with a center who tries on defense and isn't a deep negative there."
MVP: Damian Lillard  DPOY: Robert Covington  MIP: Carmelo Anthony   6th Man: Anfernee Simons  ROTY: CJ Elleby  COTY: N/A
Or when we tried to lose to Sacramento and Anfernee Simons and Gary Trent played 48 minutes and won the damn game.
"Ah yes, he Anfernee Simons syndrome"
"I mean, we tried in 2019 vs the Kings, but Anfernee Simons decided to lead the comeback of all comebacks, drop 37 and win the game anyway. And it worked out just fine."
From memory the Blazers didn’t want the 3 seed because they didn’t want to play OKC first round but their 6 man rotation led by Anfernee Simons won the last game to force it
"Hope other teams rack with injuries, and other teams are desperate to trade with Portland. That CJ contract is bad contract, and Blazers don't have trade assets. Unless there team out there who want Nassir Little, Anfernee Simons, and injured Zach Collins."
"Ok Ok, You got me, I'm taking Anfernee Simons over Cade."
All aboard the Anfernee Simons train. Toot toot
Nah CJ along with everyone else not named Nassir Little and Anfernee Simons are gone
"huh lol.  Like I don't think we're going to be able to contend but this is just wrong.  We have every single pick besides this years late first.  Anfernee Simons is 22, Nassir Little is 21, and whatever people's thoughts on CJ he's definitely still an asset."
"Ok NBA trade machine accepted this:  Portland Receives: Jrue Holiday, Donte Divencenzo, Pat Connaughton  Milwaukee receives: Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons, CJ Elleby"
Which was 95% on Olsheys ridiculous roster construction  Him forcing Anfernee Simons into a PG role  His contingency plan for Enes Kanter becoming unplayable was Rondae Hollis Jefferson  Him paying 9 million dollars per year to Derrick Jones Jr who is barely an NBA player  Every issue the Blazers have had over the last 6 years has been at its root because of Neil Olsheys incompetence
Blazers have Anfernee Simons?
I'm still not off the Anfernee Simons hype train.   All time: Greg Oden was going to bring us a chip.
"Anfernee Simons will turn into Anfernee Penny Hardaway, he will grow 4 inches and also become good at defense, Dame will turn into Tacko Fall and Nurk will be 5'11. Portland goes undefeated and Eric Bledsoe will drop 55 on the bucks in the finals to win in 4.    Those are my BOLD predictions."
Nah even that isn't as lopsided as it this trade is. It would be like Anfernee Simons and a bunch of protected picks for Embiid.
Honestly portlands fate all depends on how well anfernee simons grows this off season. Because theyre not really making any real changes. Yea stotts is out but they still have roster issues that arent being addressed.
"Portland had two shooting guards and no small forward, they could really use Ben. Their top needs are defense, rebounding, and secondary playmaking, which is literally Simmons. CJ, Anfernee Simons, and 2-3 1sts should get the convo going imo.   Sixers could flip Simons, the picks, and maybe young guys and picks of their own for another useful player, a guy who could be in an 8 man playoff rotation."
Yuta Watanabe  Xavier Tillman  Anfernee Simons
Spida Bad take but I think if billups can try to help anfernee simons score in diffrent ways other then 3s he could be similar to dame shot selection.
The difference between Dray and Ben is like the difference between Steph and Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons.
"NBA Slam Dunk Contest Champion Anfernee ""Ant"" Simons"
"&gt;	Zach Collins as the lottery pick  &gt;	Trading away Gary Trent Jr  &gt;	Traded 2021 pick to Houston   &gt;	Only young people on the team are Anfernee Simons (good), Nassir Little (eh) and CJ Elleby (no)  If the Blazers don’t win it then we’re not going to have a good time"
Lol if you think anfernee simons and nassir little are significantly higher ceiling players than the guys I mentioned there’s a massive disconnect here
"Ja Morant, Zach Lavine, and Anfernee Simons have crazy jumps."
"Jalen Green, Kuminga, Emoni bates decommitted to potentially go pro, LaMelo, Daishen Nix, RJ Hampton, Anfernee Simons, Darius Bazley"
Anfernee Simons is the only remaining one from recent times that I can think of
"This alone wouldnt change anything.  They need to trade all their future and current draft picks with some young players like Anfernee Simons for a 3rd Star.  Then we can talk also about trading CJ for another Star. If Tobias Harris is the right one, i dont know."
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"I think the point of this move was a swing fir the fences. Keeping Norm makes a CJ trade much more palatable, as Anfernee Simons won't be the next man up for the starting 2 spot.  If Norm stays then CJ is traded for a wing/forward making a potential lineup of: Dame/Norm/CJ trade/Roco/Nurk which feels like a contender to me (depending on the cj trade)"
The correct answer is Anfernee Simons and anyone that says otherwise is wrong  He's a fucking ridiculous athlete who can put his head over the rim and just won a dunk contest.... And does nothing but shoot 3s in game.
"Anfernee Simons, dude could get his shoulders over the rim and jump out of the building. He won the dunk contest this year (Ik it was a weak one) but he is basically a spot up shooter. He shoots it over 40% but it would be a lot more exciting if he had some driving in his game and postered some people"
"Yeah I mean to a certain point, defensive stats are noisy especially with such a small sample size. Lou’s numbers are pretty clear outliers based on his career and, as you said, don’t match the eye test. So it’s one of the times where you can reasonably say, there’s context we’re missing because this guy is almost certainly a negative.   But Trae’s regular season numbers make it way harder to argue the postseason ones are mistaken. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes for 2nd to last in d-raptor of 395 who played at least 350 minutes (R.J. Hampton is 395th). He’s tied with Beal, Anthony Edwards, and Lonnie Walker for 165th out of 179 qualifying guys in dbpm. And he’s 4th worst in the league in Bball index’s d-Lebron behind  D’Angelo Russell, Anfernee Simons, and Lonnie.  And listen Trae’s so fucking talented anyway that being a negative defensively doesn’t mean he isn’t still a clear net positive overall. You can see that in the advanced stats with offensive and defensive parts because the combination of them is a net positive due to just how high Trae’s numbers are on offense."
"In this season's roster, we're saturated at guard.  Dame, CJ, Norman Powell, Anfernee Simons.  But Powell is a FA with no guarantees he will return, and CJ is more than likely to be traded.  Even if we retain Norman Powell, if CJ is gone I'd like to have THJ over Gallo."
"Welp portlands gonna suck again, hope they trade anfernee simons so he can get a fair shot instead of playing behind cj hero ball."
I had Anfernee Simons winning MIP this season
"A few more solid players to add to that list: Okogie, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Melton, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn… yeah that draft class was really solid all around."
Anfernee Simons went from the worst rotational player in the NBA to an elite shooter whose defence improved
Anfernee Simons
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
"Can't tell if youre being sarcastic or not, because people do think he sucks at drafting somehow.  Dame and CJ were amazing picks.  Plus, basically every second round pick he's ever made has become a rotation player, if not a starter. His first round picks are hit and miss, but for the most part, he's hit, especially considering we pick in the 20s every time. Anfernee Simons, Nassir Little, are great picks at 24 and 25. Zach Collins was a good pick, if he could ever be healthy. Yeah there were much better players picked after him, so it's not a *great* pick, but for the average 10th pick, it was solid. Swanigan was a bust though"
not great logic. random players pop off at the very end of the regular season every year. should the blazers have played anfernee simons heavy minutes in the 2019 playoffs just because he dropped 40 in their last game?  docs rotations had issues but using that game as evidence to criticize him for not playing mann isn’t smart logic
"He has CJ/Norman Powell/ Melo who can all score very well and somewhat initiate the offence if Dame wants to play offball. Nurkic is a good big, just very injury prone. Robert Covington is a good wing defender who can knock down some 3s. Anfernee Simons is a great spark off the bench and is a very good shooter, he is only scratching his potential. Zach Collins was good, no idea what he's like now after the injuries.   All in all, Portland have a good roster. It's just very unbalanced because of their lack of defensive stoppers. They would literally need maybe 2/3 trades and their team, on paper anyway, can be 1-4th seed in the west."
"Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, plus picks for Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons and Zach Collins. Who says no if Dame demands a trade?"
"I think given more shots and looks, Anfernee Simons has another big jump in him personally.   Dudes impressed me every time I’ve watched the Blazers"
Normal Powell? Anfernee Simons? Enes Kanter?
"it's a sensitive subject for sure, and it's not easy for Blazer fans since the team does get overlooked and there's a regular trope about Dame wanting to leave (it's louder than it's ever been lately but it's been persistent), so it's natural to want to stick up for the franchise.  And Neil has made some good moves, I've always described him as incredibly high variance, he either hits a home-run (drafting Dame, getting Nurkic AND a first for Plumlee) or brutally strikes out (paying $200M for Meyers, Crabbe, Harkless &amp; ET; trading up to take Zach Collins ahead of Mitchell/OG/Bam/John Collins, drafting Anfernee Simons when the team needed help immediately).  Olshey can't change gears, and that will kill you as a small market GM, the margin for error is as slim as it gets.  Bring on the rain, if for no other reason than to keep knocking down all the pollen in the air!"
The hope is that Norman Powell will resign. Melo and Anfernee Simons are also good shooters and ball handlers. And you would have to try to find another capable shot creator who could come off the bench.
At this point I’m thinking more like Ben Simmons for anfernee simons but that is feeling like more of an overpay.
I also imagine it’s to eventually grow Anfernee Simons into that 2 guard spot with maybe Powell sliding to the 3 in that future timeline. CJ’s a good player but he’s a godawful fit for Portland bc of how redundant his skillset is with all the shot creating guards they have.
I’d prefer to keep him around because my ideal starting five would be Dame-Norm-Simmons-Cov-Nurk with Seth getting significant time off the bench.   Maybe Nassir little or Anfernee Simons? (or both for that matter).
"Anfernee Simons out here doing groundbreaking anthropology on Baudrillardian semiotic recursion in the heart of Debord's spectacle, a real gentleman and a scholar"
"Penny was given the name Anfernee but it was misspelt, Simons was named after him. I guess he just took the short form of the original name"
Anfernee Simons has a sugar momma
We just saw him go 4/14 from the line. Ask about Anfernee Simons instead.
I like that for both teams simmons could be your playmaking 4. Portland would just need to find a 2 guard but a dame maybe anfernee simons Covington Ben Simmons and nurkic lineup sounds pretty nice
"Let's see... Meyers Leonard, Evan Turner, Mo Harkless, Al-faruq Aminu, Wade Baldwin as the starting five..    With Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, Caleb Swanigan, and Jake Layman coming off the bench.   Basically the 2016 Blazers without Dame &amp; CJ."
"They jump the spurs because they lost essentially all of their vets (mills, derozan, Aldridge, gay) and don't have any one standout player. There are a few decent ballers but no stars imo.  They jump the Pelicans because I don't think zion is capable of pulling a team to the playoffs by himself. They have 3 starting caliber players (zion, Ingram and valanciunas) and there's a pretty big drop-off in talent from there. They also have a ridiculously weak guard lineup so they will likely be starting devonte Graham and Josh hart which is not a recipe for success. Also how will they be defending other teams? There's no above average defenders to speak of on their roster from what I've seen.  They jump the timberwolves because they just have more depth and more defense. They are in a similar tier to me where they will be in the play in, not necessarily getting into the playoffs. I think the wolves have a bit more star power with dlo kat and Edwards but I much prefer the kings supporting cast and depth wins out for me.  I think that questioning the blazers drop is totally understandable. It's hard for me to really explain but my trust in the surrounding pieces for the blazers is super low. Nurkic has had a hard time staying healthy lately and so has CJ. RoCo I think is a bit overrated as a defender because he has had the benefit of playing with great defensive units in the past (76ers and Rockets). He's not bad but he's not this dominant ballstopper that some would tell you he is. Anfernee simons is fine but not great. I just feel like the wheels will fall off this year. I could easily see the blazers in the 7 or 8 but my gut told me to drop them"
"Derrick Jones Jr, Anfernee Simons, Greg Brown. Wow."
I'm a blazer fan and I forgot about Anfernee Simons winning that dunk contest.
"Derrick Jones Jr, Anfernee Simons and now Greg Brown. We've got some DUNKERS on this squad. Sure would be nice to utilize them correctly."
They’re talking about Anfernee Simons
Blazers have Dame CJ and Nurk. Anfernee Simons was drafted in 2018 if that counts
Does Anfernee Simons count? Dunk champ but I think he’s practically unheard of outside of Portland.
"Lonzo Ball, Kelly Oubre, Anfernee Simons"
RJ Barrett  Malik Monk  Cole Anthony  Kevin Huerter  Rui Hachimura  Christian Wood  Keldon Johnson  Justise Winslow  Pat Connaughton  Malcolm Brogdon  Anfernee Simons  Spencer Dinwiddie  Immanuel Quickley
anfernee simons
"Yeah I’m gonna have to go with both of the blazers picks in that draft. Gary is gonna be a bonafide stud. Reminds me somewhere between Wesley Matthews and Patty Mills type of play, but somehow even more aggressive.   And then there’s Anfernee Simons, dunk champ. Absolutely spring loaded, fast shot, just young and just coming into his NBA body. If Billups focuses on more team ball movement, Simons will thrive. He’s not a great ISO player, but he can find ways to get open."
"I get what you're saying, than most NBA Caliber guards can drop 30+ in a game. For example  * Anfernee Simons dropping 37 * Corey Brewer scoring 51 vs the Rockets * Brandon Jennings pouring in 55  But taken at face value this statement ""he could probably average 20"" is objectively wrong. More importantly it's insulting to the guys who can actually put up 20 a game, day in and day out, being the focal point of NBA defenses.  Like Rookie Kevin Durant 20.3 and Rookie LeBron James 20.9 barely put up 20 a game. 20 a game is borderline all-star level, like i hope he improves too"
Anfernee Simons
SCottie and anfernee simons look similar? anyone see this?
For some reason I think Anfernee Simons. Not great me considering I'm a CJ Stan if it happens but good for Portland
I'll give you the opposite of mellifluous. Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons!
"Anfernee Simons, Terrence Mann"
"Unfortunately they lost to the 82-0 Blazers in the finals 10 times in an row, Damian Lillard is 45 and has just won his 6 straight mvp alongside Bron Jr, Nassir, Anfernee Simons and Luka Doncic, etc. Simons is best 3pt shooter ever, Luka is still great even though he is very old. Blazers Are coached by Brandon Roy and Aldridge, Cj McCollum is the owner of the blazer after retiring in 2029."
What about Anfernee “Dame’s teammate who is 22 and came out of high school like Bron but is a 50 pounds and 6’3” Simons
"Well Honestly Pop is washed. He was arguably the greatest coach in nba history but those days are behind him. Dame is playing like anfernee simons, he isn't a catch and shoot guy. My points are valid."
Do you watch him play? Pop is using him like anfernee Simons.
"Dame isn't even trying. He looks like he has turned into Anfernee Simons. He isn't a catch and shoot guy but that's what his role on this team, honestly Pop isn't a good coach anymore and this shows."
"Damn, you're right   2012 Pick 6 Damian Lillard - Home run pick  Pick 11 Meyers Leonard (career backup and heated gamer)  Pick 40 Will Barton (traded third year with others for 35 year old Marcus Camby)  Pick 41 Tyshawn Taylor (traded)  2013 Pick 10 CJ McCollum - another good one  Pick 39 Jeff Withey (traded)  Pick 40 Grant Jerrett (traded)  Pick 45 Marko Todorovic (traded)  2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace  2015 Pick 23 Rondae Hollis Jefferson (traded to Brooklyn)  2016 (first round pick traded year before for Arron Afflalo who left at season’s end)  2017 Pick 15 Justin Jackson (traded)  Pick 20 Harry Giles (traded)  Pick 26 Caleb Swanigan (traded halfway through season)  2018 Pick 24 Anfernee Simons (honestly, doing fine for being the 24th pick)  2019 Pick 25 Nassir Little  2020 Pick 16 Isaiah Stewart (traded)  Pick 46 CJ Elleby"
Anfernee Simons.
Anfernee Simons
"Anfernee Simons? His nick name is ant, is that who your talking about?"
"I still think a trade will be happening and CJ will be moved. Norm is locked up for 5 years, signed other guards and have anfernee simons. A Philly deal still makes the most sense for both teams."
Hot take: Anfernee Simons and Gary Trent make it.
Anfernee Simons depending on if Cj is moved.
I won't give up on Anfernee Simons. Dude has the makings of a great player he just can't put it together.
"you know the answer... Neil Olshey had plenty of draft picks in 2017 and he traded them all for Zach Collins.  Then the next year he drafted Anfernee Simons, who was 2 years away from being 2 years away."
"Ha anfernee Simons is younger then Duarte by an year and was drafted 4 years ago. Simons was drafted in 2018, 2019, 2020, Duarte was drafted into 2021."
"Genuine question, if it were cj + nassir little/anfernee simons and whatever picks we have, could that get a deal done on siakam?"
Anfernee simons - probably doesn't deserve last name only status. His jumpshot is similar and he's a baby face too. Haven't seen the rest of his game honestly.
"1993: Chris Webber &lt; Isaiah Rider, Terry Dehere, Sam Cassell  2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West   2010: John Wall &lt; Demarcus Cousins, Ed Davis, Damion James  2011: Kyrie Irving &lt; Jonas Valanciunus, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson  2018: Deandre Ayton &lt;&lt; Trae Young, Jerome Robinson, Anfernee Simons   I'm not sure at all about those"
"the Dunc'd On cast traded Simmons for McCollum, Anfernee Simons and a pick swap lmao."
"Anfernee Simons, CJ, two lottery protected picks"
&gt;Simons  I'm pretty sure Anfernee Simons is on the Trailblazers.
look at OP's flair.  Probably got used to typing Simons for Anfernee.
Anfernee Simons had a 37 point game at the end of the 2019 regular season. He's had a couple of 20 point games since and is now a free agent. I think whatever contract he gets will be a good estimate for your hypothetical Andre Maxwell free agency
Mirotic is not a usable player? Anfernee Simons?
I would say PG13 but he is hated but he is still entertaining for most people.  Anfernee Simons.
"Sounds like you graduated with really good grades, helping small market nba teams make it in this competitive league.  This is such a good idea. Do you think Anfernee Simons would sign the exact contract that dame has if he had to change his name to ""Damian Lillard""?"
"Anfernee Simons, Steph Curry, Booker, Spud Webb, Glen Davis"
Lmao you want Toronto to trade Siakam for bad picks and Anfernee Simons???
Whoops. I meant Anfernee Simons
"Anfernee Simons, 4 first round picks, and RoCo for Jaylen Brown and Marcus smart and 3 first round picks."
"Dude, every team has a young guy that *could* one day be a great shooter. On our team you got [Ant Simons](https://twitter.com/StevieCozens/status/1393042743518105606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1393042743518105606%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fripcityproject.com%2F2021%2F05%2F14%2Fportland-trail-blazers-anfernee-simons-5%2F), for instance. But none of those guys don't belong in this discussion right now."
Sixers will ask for Anfernee Simons and trade him to another team that is asking for a surname that sounds alike 🤣
"  Anfernee Simons/Nurk. Oh, that ben simmons guy is also ok when you surround him with shooters."
"I wanna say it would be Anfernee Simons because I think he's ready to make the jump, but I don't think he'll get the minutes behind CJ and Dame to have the raw stats"
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
In what universe is Anfernee fucking Simons giving you “a very efficient 16-18 a night”
We don’t have an actual small forward  Our defence is still going to be below average  Our 2nd most important player is an inconsistent malcontent who gets in his own head too much  Our bench is relying a lot on Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little taking leaps
You also didn’t mention that Anfernee Simons had one of the highest 3pt% and was the best catch and shoot shooters in the league last year
"Does Ben himself or any other package they can get for him win them a chip ? No. They’re in a situation where they have no leverage, and with Ben they haven’t even made the conference finals. If they’re expected to be in an even better spot after trading Ben than they were before, they’re delusional. Their hope should be to break even.  And why would Portland ever entertain the idea of Ben for dame ? Bens already low value would more than likely even more by the deadline, and either way if they trade dame they’re gonna wanna rebuild from scratch. There’s no reason they’d trade dame if they still wanted to compete. And considering Portland’s team is basically anfernee Simons and veterans, they’d be rebuilding from scratch via the draft. At 25, Ben doesn’t fit that timeline so he’s not very desirable. The Warriors for example could outbid philly in their sleep"
"i think youre 100% right. i hope hes gonna break out midseason for us, and be the hidden gem missing piece. anfernee simons is a 2 guard anyways, so i cant wait for dsj to take that last spot. hes a winning player when he plays with confidence."
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
Snell is *probably* fine   Our bench is relying a lot on Anfernee Simons becoming more than a shooter and Nas Little becoming an NBA player  Our lack of front court depth is also not ideal. Our only two centres are injury prone  I think there is potential for it all to crash and burn in spectacular fashion
"Nah this is a finals contender. Dame Beal Bridges Dray Nurkic as a starting unit is legit,  and they still have CJ, DeRozan, and Anfernee Simons on the bench. The offensive firepower on the team is elite."
I think Ant is referring to Anfernee Simons. Not Anthony Edwards. They share the nickname.
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There’s a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
"Anfernee Simons nick name on the blazers is ant, when he had 9-9 3s he was fire ant."
"Damn you managed to list ZERO people that were used to acquire Lebron, good work!   Not to mention shockingly you managed to ignore Gary Trent Jr, who is arguably the best prospect of all of those players and was drafted in the second round.  And lastly, if you think Nassir Little or Anfernee Simons suck and or busts, it just goes to demonstrate your ignorance even further."
Wait Anfernee Simons is Ant too? I was like where did Anthony Edwards come into this lol
What about Dunk Contest Champion Anfernee Simons?
Here I was wondering which one was Anfernee Simmons (now realize it’s Simons)
"the concern is if their young core plateaus in development and they turn out to be good role players instead of a second star next to trae young. You need at least 2 stars to compete in the league. Blazers over committed to a flawed dame and cj core while overvaluing anfernee simons and zach collins, both of who now has no trade value. Celtics chest of first round picks ainge refused to trade for stars turned out to be mediocre role players like grant williams, semi, and langford."
Anfernee Simons is an underrated asset. However I don’t see the sixers giving up maxey under any circumstance
Anfernee Simons. I think he'll end up having a Lou Will type career.
"They're no Carmelo, Anfernee Simons, Nassir Little though   #1 in the league baby"
Anfernee Simons  I just ate a combo of ayahuasca and peyote with a crack chaser though so I might be on a vision quest
Portland. Anfernee Simons is a natural SG not a PG
Derrick Jones Jr. and Anfernee Simons. Duh.
"Dame, CJ, Powell, Covginton, Nurkic  Neil Olshey would 100% protect Anfernee Simons thought"
"one of Warren &amp; Brogdon along with Lamb is probably about right, if the Blazers want both they likely need to include picks + Anfernee Simons.  I actually think that LeVert + CJ would be fine together in the back-court. LeVert has good size, both of them can create their own shot and Sabonis still does so much of the play-making for the Pacers it wouldn't hurt too badly to be without a ""traditional"" PG.  Also McCollum is under contract which is something the Pacers value since it's about as hard to draw free-agents to Indiana as it is to get them to come to Portland.  On the flip-side, pairing Dame with TJ Warren would be great, the Blazers have always needed a wing that can get their own shot and a back-court pairing with Brogdon would be a nice fit as well since Malcolm plays good defense and can ease the play-making load for Dame."
Anfernee Simons looks really aggressive creating his own shot
I’m going to throw a homer vote out there for Anfernee Simons. He looks more confident out there and is playing with poise. He’s continuing to shoot really well but now he’s improved his handles and his ability to finish at the rim with better decision making overall. He’s not gonna be an all star but it’s been a nice improvement.
"Damian Lillard too. Right now Lillard is arguably the 4th best guard on the blazers after CJ, Norm Powell, and Anfernee Simons."
"While you can think he’s overrated, but I’d have disagree When it comes playoff time and big moments, dame can defend, he played great D last playoffs, and great D against Westbrook in 2019. And has taken several game saving changes over the last couple of years from good help side D. He dived on the ball on a clutch steal in the nets game in the bubble. So he does make big defensive plays.   Dame is also a pretty good playmaker. He is one of the deadliest pick and roll players in the league, largely cuz of his passing to the roller through the pockets. He averages more assists then Steph and Kyrie, in a system that has much less ball movement, spacing and generally lower assists.   I’m sorry, but the players that come through Portland have the best years of their careers for the most part. His leadership allows for a lot of players to play their basketball. There is very little examples when a player comes into Portland and doesn’t play their basketball of their career. We revived Melos career, players like aminu, harkless, Plumlee, Nurkic, batum, Matthews, layman had their best years here. Cj blossomed into an all star next to dame. A second round pick of Trent jr blossomed under dames leadership. Even late round guys like nassir and anfernee Simons, look like promising young talents and I largely think of dames Portland culture"
"Trailblazers need to be sold if they want to ever win another championship.   When I say sold, that does not necessarily entail moving a team. They have a great fan base, located in a decent location along the west coast (better if Seattle or Vancouver had a team), and the business operations side of the team seems to be pretty successful.   On the other hand Jody Allen, Paul Allen’s sister and executor of his estate, is pretty apathetic when it comes to the team. It is a $1billion investment in a portfolio of $20+ billion. Paul was obsessed with the blazers and Seahawks and was at almost every game, Jody not so much.   She continues to rely on the GM Neil Olshey who has turned out some of the worst contracts in league history ($40mil to Meyers Leonard, $70mil to Evan turner, $40mil Allen crabbe, $8mil festus ezeli who never played a single second) and for a executive who lauds himself for draft prowess has so far only produced one good pick, CJ McCollum (What about Dame? Olshey showed up June 4th, Dame was drafted June 28th. That pick was already decided). He has also dug a whole of no money and no draft picks that has led the blazers to be a continual first round exit (2019 WCF run was cool, but a lot of lucky circumstances were involved.).   Dame is gonna be entering the tail end of his career when his contract expires and their second best player CJ, will be right there with him. The only young talent they have, anfernee simons and Nasir little have been riding the bench behind Terry stotts’s 7 man rotation for the last 3 years, so if they break out this year they will really be in their 4th to 6th year before really getting legit playing time.   The complacent attitudes of the organization lead me to believe that the only feasible option for the blazers to be competitive in the coming decades is for the team to be sold. There is never going to be a major shakeup without an outside influence tearing it down and building it back up, and the blazers are an organization held up by toothpicks right now and it’s just a matter of time before it all comes falling down."
Luke Kennard vs Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons looking good
"Anfernee Simons, MIP conversation. Got mildly downvoted for this a month ago for some reason."
"Well did you see Lillard's smile on then bench when CJ was going off, and then at the end of the game when he was congratulating Chauncey? I don't think the Blazers are that desperate to go for Simmons anytime soon, especially if Norm is going to be banged up for a bit. Although with how Anfernee Simons looked so far, CJ is theoretically expendable."
"I was referring to Anfernee Simons as Ant, not Anthony Edwards. But yeah Edwards is incredible too"
"Anfernee Simons goes by ""Ant""."
"Plus the 2 young guys Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little look like legit rotational pieces this year. Simons especially looks like he picked up an extra gear or 3 compared to last year, when he was mostly a catch and shoot 3 point shooter. Pair that elite 3 point shooting with some of the cuts he made into the lane tonight ... hoo boy."
"Warriors have a proven championship core. Blazers have a team whose ceiling is losing decisively in the WCF. Not a parallel situation. Only way they compete for anything is with a surprise nuclear breakout from someone like Anfernee Simons. Otherwise it will be another middle of the pack type of season where they get a playoff spot, maybe win a series, and then get bounced. They're relevant, but not really.   Simmons would be an interesting project for them to repair and his skill set synergizes better with CJ or Dame than they do with each other. He's also a lot younger, and could be part of a long-term rebuilding project."
After this practice they would should be grateful for an Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons and a top 55 protected 2nd round pick should do it
"okay so if that’s true, it doesn’t matter to anyone that isn’t specifically an anfernee simons or a portland trailblazer fan.   this is a subreddit that discusses the nba as a whole, so yeah with so many of the same first names and nicknames, it’s completely reasonable to think it’s unnecessarily confusing to casually apply the same nickname that a more famous player goes by to some rotational player.   FOH with your ‘taking it personal, gotta defend these nba players feelings’ energy.   in the sense of curating a place to discuss players, which r/nba is, my point makes sense.  sorry your guy isn’t the more famous or talented “ant” and that got you in your feelings"

"The image of tank commander Ben Simmons playing with a roster of Powell, Nurkic, and… Anfernee Simons(?) sure is something"
Anfernee Simons wins MIP/6MOTY.
Anfernee Simons is awesome.
I'm really excited for how Anfernee Simons plays this year. He looked confident driving to the rim and was doing a pretty decent job of playmaking.
Give me a break.   Dame made the playoffs the year before when our 5 highest minute players were:  Dame  Cj  Hassan whiteside  Carmelo Anthony   anfernee simons  Mario hezonja played the 8th most minutes for us. He’s about the 10th best player and you’re telling me the BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD can’t make it with draymond Andrew Wiggins and Oubre?   Nahhhh
"Anfernee Simons is ready to go, man. He wont be a star, but I bet he'll end up our main contributor off the bench. I'm expecting 13-16 a game."
"The most threes hit in a regular season game by any Blazer last year? 9 by Anfernee Simons. Oh, and he missed 1 three the whole game."

anfernee simons and (more controversially) nassir little
Anfernee Simons is a star in waiting; and I am convinced this is the year he breaks out.
Anfernee Simons.
"That's an interesting thought experiment.  Portland has Anfernee Simons (Slam Dunk winner), Dennis Smith Jr (contestant), Larry Nance Jr (contestant), Ben MacLemore (contestant), and Dame Lillard (contestant). Though I don't think MacLemore and DSJ are guaranteed to make the team.  Still, a surprisingly large collection of good dunkers (in their primes)."
For players still in the league that get signifcant minutes who is the:  * *Best player purely by size/physique*  * *Best player purely by skill/that can't rely on physique*  * *Worst player purely by size/physique*  * *Worst player purely by skill/that can't rely on physique*  IMO I think it's  Rudy Gobert  Steph Curry  Bismack Biyombo or Alex Len  Anfernee Simons
Anfernee Simons is called Ant.
"I'd have to imagine Wolves still are willing to offer Beasley, McDaniels, Prince or Bev and two unprotected firsts, that is hardly nothing.   Definitely not the value he would've gotten a year ago, or two years ago, but its probably only going to go down from here on out.   Ideally, the Sixers would've done this all behind closed doors, but they didn't and hindsight is 20/20.   The Wolves, seemingly, want Simmons the most and have one of the better offers on the table, but they also have two timelines going on right now. They have the Ant/Jaden timeline and the Kat/D'lo timeline. If they start out hot, like 10-5 in the first 15 games, (which seems unlikely), then the Wolves offer might be going down and they may not want to include Jaden, and Jaden is the real prize in that deal.   If the Wolves are healthy and suck and start out 5-15 the thought process could definitely shift towards trading Beasley, D'lo and Kat to buy into the Ant and Jaden timeline. This means they wouldn't be in the market for Simmons at all.   So, Wolves being too good or too bad could mean them no longer wanting Simmons or their offer changing substantially. Meanwhile, Simmons is sitting and either not showing up or faking an injury to not play, his value would only be slowly going down.   I suppose if I were Morey I would try to get RoCo and CJ from the Blazers and go all-in on the next two years, and hope to flip Thybulle down the line. But at this point Jaden is the better defender between him and RoCo, and has more promise on a cheaper contract.   If Morey does go with the Wolves offer, Beasley would feast next to Embiid, sure he sucks on defense, but he is an elite high volume 3-pt shooter and on a good contract, assuming he stays out of prison. Beasley is the type of guy who could shoot his way into an all-star game, even while being average or below average at pretty much everything else.  Embiid, Jaden and Thybulle would have to cover for his defensive lapses though.   Jaden could slide next to Harris as a 3/4 option, his numbers dont really reflect his impact, he's been very impressive so far, and within a year could be packaged with the Wolves picks and Thybulle for a star to pair with Embiid. Jaden's value should increase. He's like 6'10 and 195 lbs or something, but is above average on man and team defense, can guard the perimeter and in the post with above average rim protection. He also has a pretty decent 3-pt shot and has been working on his handles.   Plus they would get either Pat Bev or Taurean Prince, and Bev would fit what they needed a lot more.   If Morey goes with the Blazers, those guys will just be losing value over their contracts as both are getting up there in age. If he goes with the Wolves offer he'll have to work to improve value of guys to then flip for someone around Embiid's age, or someone like Beal.   I wonder if the Blazers would offer CJ and Anfernee Simons with RoCo, and a pick? That'd probably get me to slide more towards the Blazers offer, but everything i've heard is they won't offer RoCo.   Either way, didn't get Harden, so that is what all this will be compared to. Would've been a great combo, Harden and Embiid."
"I don't think the 6ers are really in a position to demand that they don't get worse defensively though? Like you're going to be losing this trade, that is the nature of having a guy willing to sit out a season and mortgage a full year of Embiid's contract. Trying to dictate the terms so the trade solves all your problems just kind of seems like misreading the room.  The Blazers wouldn't mind having Seth Curry but don't really need him either, we have Anfernee Simons off the bench in that role shooting at a ridiculous clip, and we need to develop him further + we've got 3 starting guards currently (2 if we trade CJ). I can see the Blazers throwing in Anfernee or Nas, or some picks, but I don't see why they'd give up 2 starters for Simmons when the 6ers clearly don't have leverage.  CJ would play incredibly next to Embiid on offense, and Ben's defense is irreplaceable but despite what ppl might tell you, CJ isn't such a terrible defender that he can't be hidden as your worst guy. Blazers one year had like the ~10th best defense with Dame AND CJ starting. 6ers have better defensive pieces than that Blazers team did by a lot. You've got a spare elite perimeter defender in Thybulle like... I just don't see how the 6ers can afford to be this picky."
"Honest guess;  Kevin Knox, Obi Toppin, Jalen Brunson, Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons"
This is a similar but crazier one.  Anfernee Simons scored 37 points in the last game of the season his rookie year. His previous career high was 9.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201904100POR.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201904100POR.html)

"Anfernee Simons had 37 with his previous high being 9. That was his rookie year, last game of the season, vs. Sacramento. That's the closest I've ever seen."
Dude Anfernee Simons exist. He could win us like 5 more games than cj.
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
...Anfernee Simons was good.
"It has to be demoralizing getting smashed by two of the West's contenders, and I don't mean that in some type of mean-spirited way. I would like to see Portland do well, but I think the writing is on the wall with this team. Their core has invested a lot in this ""project"" over the years and you can probably only grind for so long before it becomes apparent that you're never going to get over the hump. Does anyone in that locker room really believe they can win a Finals this year?   I would trade Dame, back up the Brinks truck for Simons (Anfernee), and try something different. I've taken heat for suggesting that Portland is a good fit for Ben Simmons, but really I do think he could be an interesting piece there. Meanwhile it would be doing Dame a solid to get him to Philly with a legit chance to make a Finals before his prime is up. Tough to lose your talisman and icon, but a long-term win-win for all sides potentially."
"Fun, much better in terms of rule changes.  Love to see Milwaukee hanging in there despite injuries. Love to see Anfernee Simons come out of his shell.   Overall just a great season of basketball."
The Anfernee Simons dunk contest was super trash regardless of era. The dunks werent good compared to the past and they all were incredibly underwhelming.
A genius defender. We’ll give him up for a small price of Anfernee Simons.

Anfernee Simons is gonna be a problem in future!
Anfernee Simons. Sheesh.
Anfernee Simons is a problem
"yeah this comment is terrible for a bunch of reasons.  &gt;The rest of the roster aside from Dame and CJ isn’t very good.  Yes it is, but even if it wasn't, you judging our role player's talents based on their ppg is beyond idiotic.  1) None of those guys you listed except for Powell are expected to carry a significant load. Even Nurk, while expected to score, is not needed to score more than 12-15 as a 4th option.   2) Powell at 17ppg as a 3rd option is great, how many 3rd options do that? And how many of them do it at his efficiency?  3) How can you say scoring is our problem when we're one of the best offensive teams in the league  &gt; Having lost Melo’s scoring makes a CJ trade less likely because who are you replacing his production with?  This is how I know that you haven't watched a single Blazers game last year or this year.   1) Melo is inefficient, we don't really need anyone to replace his scoring in the first place  2) Anfernee Simons and Norm Powell MORE than make up for Melo's scoring  3) Trading CJ just gives more touches to Simons and Powell, who can absolutely replace his production sufficiently between the two. Late game situations might be the only time we might miss CJ, but when you have Dame, late-game situations is not something you'll lose sleep over.  4) Once again, scoring is not our issue by any means, not for our starters and not for our bench  &gt;Get mad at the GM for not getting Aaron Gordon when he was available   1) We literally gave the Magic a better offer than what they ended up taking from the Nuggets   2) Aaron Gordon isn't even that good, i'd rather have Larry Nance. Which we do"
Anfernee Simons. Pretty sure he just doesn’t talk or express emotion in general.
"Predicting the next SUPRISE superstar is an act of futility. Everybody is naming players who are either top talents drafted with superstar potential, or guys who are young and looking very stud like.  People also have to remember that superstar means that if you put this guy on a team with players like PG/Dame/Kyrie they’d be the first option.  There’s no player than I can foresee getting to that kinda level. I can see a guy getting close to that level though, and my selection for the next surprise almost superstar level player is Anfernee Simons.  He has a very nice bag, good size, good athleticism, and a few games this year I’ve watched him go crazy, but be reeled back in because it’s dame, CJ, and Norms show. He works hard, and adds to his game every year. I expect him to explode into the scene in like 2 years."
"My dear hope is Anfernee Simons, I will take no criticism on this take"
Didn't Anfernee Simons almost do this last year? He hit his first 9 and then missed his last one to end up with 9/10.
You mean Anfernee Simons right? You spelled it right anyways
The Dennis Smith - CJ McCollum - Anfernee Simons - Damian Lillard - Jusuf Nurkic lineup gonna take the league by storm.
"I get flamed every time I suggest this, but they are one of the most logical destinations for Simmons *if they believe he's salvageable*. Send Dame to Philly for Simmons + a lot of extras. Ben would pair well with CJ in the short-term and give them a nice starter to develop for the long-term. They can kick the tires on Simons (Anfernee) and see if he can develop if forced to shoulder more of the workload. He's somewhat blocked right now with Dame and CJ there.   I just think they're in a spot where they're clearly not going to win anything and their star is aging, so it makes some sense to explore their options. I view a Dame/Simmons trade as intriguing for both sides, though I understand that many may not share that perspective with the recent downturn in Simmons's perception and value."
Y’all been watching the blazers?  Anfernee Simons and Nasir Little could put out a dunking mixtape of their own!
"Who's your favorite KAT? Karl-Anthony Towns, or Anfernee Simons?"
Nobody is referring to Anfernee Simons for anything
Which Ant? Anfernee Simons(blazer fans call him ant) or Antony Edwards. Both are super athletic.
"Mitchell Robinson, Anfernee Simons, Nas Little have to be up there"
"Yeah it's very inconsistent right now. I like the general direction of the rules changes but it's virtually impossible to say whether something is a foul or not right now, there's no clear threshold and I imagine it's frustrating as a player who draws a lot of contact both inside and outside the bounds of the new rules.   The Blazers recently suffered a very consequential no call when Darius Garland literally attempted a take foul to stop Anfernee Simons on a fast break bucket in a close game in Cleveland with a minute left. Last 2 minute repot confirms, and like, Garland literally wrapped him up on thee break. It was a no call that resulted in a turn over, Blazers ended up losing narrowly. At times the refs just seem hesitant to blow the whistle on obvious fouls and that's not good.   Obviously bad calls happen every year, but these types of no calls are a new variable and I don't think would normally happen. The foul baiting is one thing but that's not all that's changed, they're calling fewer fouls everywhere and there needs to be a much clearer line in the sand than just ""blow the whistle less"" which is what it seems to me rn."
Anfernee Simons has been scorching hot but still behind 3 other guards
tbf i would take Anfernee Simons 3 pointer shot than Dame atm
anfernee simons is a 6moy candidate?
"Anfernee Simons has never even been close to being the worst player in the NBA, sure he hasn't ever looked like a contender for 6MOTY until now but I'd say he was always middle of the pack for his class. Dude's always had a great 3 point and jump shot. His learned court vision this yeah might be why people perceived him as being ""bad"" in the past. He's certainly making himself look like he went from garbage to great."
&gt; anfernee simons  Really?  Every game I’ve seen he is a high volume chucker / professional brick layer
Simmons........Anfernee Simons
"Nailed it.  Shoutout to Desmond Bane, Anfernee Simons &amp; Grayson Allen too.  Grayson’s giving us 15 PPG shooting 40% from 3 making 3.5 3PM a game."
I would take Anfernee Simons over him any day of the year.
Ant(Anfernee Simons)
"Might be the worst Anfernee Simons spelling ever, as a portland fan I’m happy he is being noticed but spell his name right."

"Just looked this up, it’s true, mom gave him the nickname since no one could pronounce his full name. Slightly ironic since Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway (Simons’ namesake) went by Penny to avoid this exact situation. Simons also says he gives fake monickers at restaurants since no one can comprehend his name, pretty interesting all around."

Imma go with Anfernee Simons. Hes balling.
its crazy when ur best player is Anfernee Simons
definitely true. we do have the most depth this year that we've had in a long fucking time especially with anfernee simons playing way better than at least I expected him to and
