"This was a good game and the Nets absolutely earned the win but I love what I saw from the Clippers. You have to figure that if this were a seven-game series, PG is getting more than one free throw attempt in any given game and that alone could be a difference maker.  I think it's also worth noting that despite how much he's memed here, the Clippers really missed Patrick Beverley's defense tonight. Would Kyrie still drop 39? I mean, he most definitely could. Would they be a lot harder against Beverley than it was versus Reggie/Lou/Kennard? No doubt.   Oh, and would everyone stop trying to post up James Harden? I get that you are supposed to attack him on defense but not there. That's the one spot he can actually defend."
"&gt; Same with Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, etc  Except Lowry puts up all-star numbers lol. Back in the day when the Cavs used to be a thing, I would constantly say Lowry is better because he's Dellavadova if he put up Kyrie numbers (back then)."
Patrick beverley has a rivalry with everyone but he is out with an injury today
&gt; “great offense beats great defense”  People don't understand that this only is true on an individual level. A great offensive player (like KD/Harden and even Kyrie to a certain extent) will generally score against a great defensive player. Patrick Beverley hasn't and won't ever shut down James Harden.  But a great defensive team can do absolute work against a great offense.
I was imagining just how bad a team would be if Patrick Beverley was their best offensive player.
Patrick Beverley and Marcus Smart
"&gt; steph underperformed so they threw everything at stopping KD  Steph AVERAGED 25-7-5 on 71% TS in that series, 71%. They threw ""everything"" at KD, i guess everything was 9 inches shorter Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams.  &gt; steph also underperformed in the HOU series  Steph underperformed so much that when KD went down he carried Golden State to back to back wins and a 4-2 victory.  &gt; it was KD winning them games, hate to break it to u  KD was the best player on a team that without him still went to the Finals and was a Klay Thompson injury away from beating the Raptors. He was sensational, probably the best player in the league, but to act like there was no comparison between his 2019 version and Kobe in 2013, it is laughable."
"Uh? This is not ""little know"" at all.   And this is part of the reason that Patrick Beverley is so hated around here."
Unfortunately I’ve already voted for a Grayson Allen/Patrick Beverley backcourt
Fuck Patrick Beverley
patrick beverley would be receiving death threats if it were him
"Patrick Beverley, 1 PTS, +23... and y'all say he run around and do nothing??? because it's true. and he's *damn* good at it."
"Maybe if we were more of a running team but this team is too good in the half court to consider that. I wouldn’t want Eric Bledsoe with the ball in his hands making decisions in our offense, and he’s not well utilized at all as an off ball guy. He’s not a good enough shooter and the Clippers don’t have room for another on ball scorer. He needs to go start for a young athletic team or convince SVG to run again.   In a vacuum Eric Bledsoe is a more talented well rounded player than Patrick Beverley but that trade would 100% make the Clippers worse for sure."
The move to be made IMO is move one of Lou or Kennard for a defensive combo type guard if one is available. The problem with this team is that Patrick Beverley for example missing a game could lose us a series because there’s no capable guard defender outside of the starting lineup. Lakers have reinforcements in that way we don’t.
"I don't think the worry for the Clippers is Kawhi Leonard leaving. He's almost certainly gonna stay. Their problem is that Paul George, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Patrick Beverley are all 30+ and likely to get slightly worse with each passing year."
"Same, it used to be mostly just hate, but when you consistently put forth this much effort for years it becomes obvious that you are real.  He's what Patrick Beverley should aim for."
"Kinda crazy how Harden, the SG, is a better playmaker than Kyrie, the PG.     And Kyrie is a great offensive player too, it’s not like a Patrick Beverley type situation."
"He's 1st in the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100).  His defensive rating is [102](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747) which is better than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embid, aka literally every other player except Rudy Gobert listed on Op's all-defense teams.  &gt;He's actually not in the top 20 for DBPM  Wrong he is 17th. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html"

fuck i love patrick beverley
OP’s trade idea makes zero sense but can we stop shitting on Patrick Beverley for no reason? He’s arguably playing like an All Defensive first team player this year
patrick beverley
Until the playoffs where he had to deal with Patrick Beverley and Eric Gordon as the only other people who could handle the ball (both asswater at it)
I distinguish between burning hatred and mocking hatred. People mock Westbrook but they don't hate him like he is Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley. He is not as good on defence as people make him out to be. Hes a good but nowhere near All NBA defensive team level last year.
"That was a fun season. Harden playing with Moreyball with Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, Carlos Delfino, Omer Asik, Patrick Beverley and a bunch of rookies and 2nd year players.  IIRC, he got traded to the Rockets four days before this game."
"I am pretty sure i came to your sub once and they weren't unbiased when i asked them about how unfairly Patrick Beverley is free to hit players on defense, and how Doc Rivers wasn't actually a good coach late in 2019/early in 2020."

Is Patrick Beverley a nice guy?
Patrick Beverley is Tony Snell with confidence
Obligatory Fuck Patrick Beverley
"Lets not forget how Patrick Beverley said to Steph Curry how ""the next five years were his"" at the start of last season before their epic meltdown in the bubble."
"I feel like he's going through a prolonged case of the yips, this offense is so much different from what he was at in Washington and Phoenix and it seems like he's up in his head every time he gets the ball, if he doesn't see the first pass open then he panics, if it's rotated to him unexpectedly he doesn't reset the offense, he gets tunnelvision. Idk if its him having a tough time learning it, but I think the shooting will come as far as open looks, and hopefully he realizes the offense is created to give you kick out options if you drive, you just gotta look up.  Gotta say also, I love his defense, he crowds and tries to be like a patrick beverley but with more wingspan. He has all the tools to fit into this system and hopefully he puts it all together."
Patrick Beverley is now 32 years old.
"What about Defensive Anchor Patrick ""Next five years"" Beverley?"
"2017-18 Harden, 2016 Draymond Green, 2018 CP3, 2019 Ibaka, 2015 Iguodala  Bench: Steven Adams, Patrick Beverley, Kyle Kuzma"
"KD and Kyrie are weirdos, but they are good dudes. Idk how people think the Nets are more unlikeable than the Clippers for example, who have scumbags like Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris"
"Unless they’re about Patrick Beverley, Paul George, or Kyrie in which case you may proceed."
"Individual defense for guards doesn't have much impact on the game. Gobert could average 8 points a game and still have an all-star impact. Patrick Beverley, on the other hand, will never be that impactful.  &gt; everyone values offense over defense  Look at how Paul Millsap got paid. OG Anunoby. Robert Covington. Jonathan Isaac. Thaddeus Young.  Don't compare a shooting PF to a defending PG."
They forget that this dude had PATRICK BEVERLEY on him
fuck Patrick Beverley
I wish I didn’t know the name Patrick Beverley
"&gt;there are lot of assists out there where the point guard pounds the ball for 18 seconds and then passes to a shooter coming off a screen, and he'll get an assist that's worth next to nothing.  Eh even the ability to do that is worth something. There are point guards in this league who average 2 assists (eg. Patrick Beverley, Colin Sexton), and point guards who don't make basic passes (like Jeff Teague not making entry passes to KAT)."
"Patrick Beverley and Grayson Allen deserve career ending injuries.  Normally I’d never wish an injury on a player, but fuck these two. They’re out there giving Zero fucks about others’ careers and health."
I'd like to see Patrick Beverley go up against the Bad Boys Pistons.
Imagine CP3 and Patrick Beverley fused into one person and squeezed into a pair of short shorts.  That was Stockton on defense.
So apparently the clippers get one review and Patrick Beverley gets one as well
I can laugh at this now that we won but goddamn Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley doing Patrick Beverley things at the end there
Goddamn dumb refs. Fuckin reviewing it just cause Patrick Beverley is whining
Fuck patrick beverley. You can clearly see him shove Patty.

"From the latest ringer article.   Doc Rivers was loyal to Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, and Montrezl Harrell, and kept them in roles that fit their games. But all that is out the window under Lue. Beverley is averaging the fewest shots (5.7 per game) he has since his rookie season, Williams is down to no. 6 on the team in touches (35.7), and Harrell is on the Lakers.  (Lou was second in touches. More than PG last season)"

"So the worst Harden team was the 2016 Rockets, they finished 0.500 and barely squeaked into the 8 seed.   That team had Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley, and Dwight Howard. While that's not a great supporting cast, that's not abject trash.   The 2nd worst team (by win percentage) was the 2020 team. They also had Tucker, Gordon, and Covington. That's not trash, that's a solid sample of decent 3 &amp; D players."

Lebron has far more lovers too though. You have to look at the whole scale. Lebron has more haters than Patrick Beverley but that doesn't mean he's more hated.
"Oh please. Dragic was more significant to the Heat's structure than Kyrie was. The Heat need Dragic's production more compared to Kyrie to the Cavs because Butler isn't LeBron's level of playmaker and Dragic was more integral to the Heat getting to the Finals than Kyrie was since the Heat had less of a cushion as their other stars were offensively inferior to the Cavs' other stars. Bam came back and helped the defense while Love was MIA yes but it's highly doubtful that KLove returning wouldn't have a negative impact on the 2015 Finals Cavs becoming a defensive oriented team, which is a completely bad fit for Love. In fact, Kevin Love in general is a horrible matchup for the Warriors. You're looking at it in a vacuum where the Cavs would be flat out better with Love against any team, which isn't true, especially against a Warriors team that's built to exploit a player like Love. Lillard was out in Game 5 but was injured since Game 4. Even Conley or Holiday weren't out for the whole series vs. Golden State, and the Rockets didn't have Patrick Beverley, who's a really good player but hardly the difference between a gentleman sweep and a series win. Westbrook had COVID-19, which if you argue players underperformed in the bubble then sure, but you're really understating the effects of the virus on a player's health. I'm not saying that the 2020 Lakers had worse problems than 2015, but to argue that 2015 is just so flukey in its injury luck is just a bad argument.  &amp;#x200B;  Dynasty dominant is a stretch. I'm just comparing the 2016 Warriors to one team, the 1996 Bulls. Not the whole run of it, just that one team."
"I really hate when the ball handler goes around a screen and immediately flails into a jumpshot resulting in three free throws. Obviously there are exceptions and obvious fouls but some of it is just bogus.   [Patrick Beverley Gets Rocked By Steven Adams' Screen! Thunder vs Rockets R1G1 April 16, 2017 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3m0te_Tdc)  Things like the tail end of this play which was called on Roberson. Lillard tends to do this a lot as well I find. Half the time they are not even trying to score."
"I just took ""real"" to mean good, as opposed to washed/injured/near retirement. Ibaka, Zubac and Morris fit, but yeah, they're not exactly All-Star level.  About the PGs, that to me is a matter of skillset. This Clippers team would really benefit from having an actual, classical point guard, someone who can be trusted to be the ballhandler if necessary, because Reggie Jackson, Lou Will and Patrick Beverley definitely aren't that."
"Keep this same energy if Paul George, or Patrick Beverley ever get dunked on that bad and say some shit like this. Would bet the mortgage these comments would be so different lmao"
"Same people crying about Yuta getting postered will eventually be clowning a player they don't like who does get postered. Let Patrick Beverley get postered and watch all of the ""the effort was better than the dunk"" comments go away instantly."
TJ McConnell is what people think Patrick Beverley does.
Huh? Beverley literally got ejected with two techs within 5 seconds in the playoffs last year for complaining about a call.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/patrick-beverley-ejected-clippers-nuggets-technical-fouls/wfco6y0xodvo1ug1i99cmkz6t
Patrick Beverley
He's playing amazingly but he's still has a limited offensive skillset unfortunately. Basically a 3&amp;D guard with amazing vision/passing rather than an All-Star caliber PG he was initially projected as.  A bigger &amp; more talented version of Patrick Beverley if you will rather than a Jason Kidd prototype.  Wonder how much money he'll command in free agency.
Patrick Beverley is a dirty player
"Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, and reggie Jackson are great for running point in the regular season for running point, but yall need a point gaurd in the playoffs"
"My man, you know how they say there are players that you'd love on your team, and hate if they were not?  Patrick Beverley is the guy that breaks that rule. The thought of him being on my team and havind to defend his bitch ass sounds exhausting."
"What? I'm not talking about bench. I'm talking about the 2nd option on offense, which for a couple years was either like fucking Patrick Beverley or Eric Gordon. CP3 got injured, Westbrook was hurt and sucked balls. He's had some damn good playoff series when he's had adequate support, but some really bad ones when teams could throw 2-3 guys on him with little impunity because there was no way to punish them for it."

 Patrick no-nose Beverley
Plenty of dudes play hard without being the monumentally distended asshole that Patrick Beverley is
Damn a reasonable take in a Patrick Beverley thread on r/nba??
Patrick Beverley really is a huge piece of shit
Another Patrick Beverley hate circle jerk
"Andddd, I’m no longer a Patrick Beverley fan"
"Over time, I've come to expect that the level and style of play from guys like Patrick Beverley is sometimes what they need to do to claw their way into the NBA so I begrudgingly accept it.  But making fun of a guy's shoulder injury is really uncool. Injuries absolutely can derail anyone's career in a matter of moments. He should know better"
Patrick Beverley is an elite shooter and rebounder and does all the little things for our clippers team that helps us win. Our team genuinely looks worse when he's off the floor. Either you're not a true fan or you don't watch clipper games if you hate him.
"Let’s get a “Fuck Patrick Beverley” thread started, shall we?"
You're only getting tired of his antics now? Patrick Beverley has been a certified clown since he was a rookie. What could have even possibly led you to like him at any point in time?
"Not my favorite player (that's Paul George) but certainly one of them. The reason I wear this flair is because it gets a lot of people really tense and it's funny lol, since I never took any criticism of his as valid, a lot of it is arguable, just like today's accident. As for why I like Patrick Beverley? Dude makes everyone around him play better, he's a great emotional leader and probably the best locker room guy the Clippers have. I like how he worked his ass off, from playing to a shitty European clubs (except Olympiacos, which was the best European team at the time) to being a good NBA player. Dude knows his role on the court and doesn't do what he can't. What he does is play tough defense that gets you going (he always makes me stand up and clap, say ""Let's go Pat!""). I also like his trash talk, makes the games more fun and plus he definitely can say some funny shit 😂. He's also a great dude that can take a joke and gives back to the community a tooooon."
Oh that Patrick Beverley....that rascal
And clippers fans pretend like /r/nba hates Patrick Beverley for no good reason
"I have never liked Patrick Beverley, from interviews he seems less than half witted, an annoyingly loud breather and has this lazy, kind of drooping dumb facial appearance. Some people just physically radiate their inner world."

That’s because the media will vote for notable homeless man Patrick Beverley on an 8th seeded Clippers squad before Lowry gets consideration.

Patrick Beverley has made an NBA career out of being a dirty player. That's it. He's not a good shooter who plays dirty. He's not a rebounding machine who plays dirty. He just plays dirty. That's his whole thing.
My favorite was probably when Patrick Beverley got his skeleton rearranged by Steven Adams
Kemba for Lou Williams and Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley is a player who has a tremendous amount of drive and I appreciate that.  But he should learn that this kind of trash talking tends to overmotivate great players like LeBron James.
who is patrick beverley? doesn't he play in russia?
"They should look toward Patrick Beverley, he’d be pretty solid for them with Simmons playmaking"
5 of the top 20 (qualified) 3 point clips belong to Clippers players:  Marcus Morris - 48.4  Paul George - 47.8  Nicolas Batum - 45.6  Luke Kennard - 44.4  Patrick Beverley - 43.6
"They were not good at the time either. People always mention Brewer's and Smith's game 6 as an example they were good, but that game is memed for a reason. Those guys were terrible all season.  Josh Smith averaged 12/6/2 on 50% TS, Brewer averaged 12/3/2 on 51% TS, and both were ass defensively.  The only ""good"" players on that roster were Howard (41 games of him) who averaged 16/11/1, and Ariza with 13/5/3. Both were great defenders still.  The rest is a bunch of nobodies and the Rockets' 4th best player, Patrick Beverley, who had 0 value offensively."
"I love seeing Patrick Beverley Haters CRY, it's my daily medicine, my weekly energy, my monthly inspiration and my yearly motivation. Their loss is the only reason i'm still alive, i was born to love and enjoy the failure that they have achieved."

"Yeah, lead by harden. Unless you’re implying Patrick beverley was icing games for us"
"Yes, because seeing Patrick Beverley in 8k is safe for our youth."
"Just for clarification, I wasn’t ranking the best point guards. Just ranking the PGs I named. I believe Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, and most Starting PGs are better than Patrick Beverley + Kemba Walker"

"So Kawhi is their best defender, a first team all-defense player, yet the Clippers are the 15th ranked defense because Patrick Beverley is out? LOL"
"Rockets had a contender when they had Harden, Dwight Howard, Patrick Beverley, Josh Smith, and Jason Terry."
We're gonna act like Patrick Beverley won games for his teams in the playoffs?  My point is Ricky is a good teammate and a good leader.  Both players have their warts.
It's time to be worried about Patrick Beverley
"The headline of this post is just straight up wrong.  &gt; Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well  According to the unsourced Bleacher Report article... there's just one person who's ""ready"" to move on from Pat Bev?  Also it's strange to see that it's ""widely known"" Lou Will is available when that article is the only source saying that, sort of the opposite of ""widely known.""  Call me crazy but I don't know if a site called AHN Fire Digital quoting a speculative trade article from Bleacher Report is the best source for info..."
"&gt; “Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there’s a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well,” Fischer wrote.  Setting aside the source is a Bleacher Report article with little credibility, saying ""there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on"" is not even close to the Clippers making widely know Bev is available. Y'all stupid as fuck."
Lol fuck Patrick Beverley.
"&gt; he can shoot better than Rubio and plays decent defense  What's the argument then for why the Clippers suddenly get ""insanely dangerous"" if they downgrade at shooting and defense with Rubio instead of Beverley? Also, keep in mind that because of the hard cap a straight swap of Rubio for Beverley doesn't work, the Clippers would also have to add either Lou Williams to the trade, or both of Patrick Patterson and Daniel Oturu (while being unable to spend any money to replace those two empty roster spots because of the hard cap)."
"&gt; The whole basis of the trade is this quote: ""Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well."" No sources were cited.  You know this is the same language as all the Woj tweets right? Nobody second guesses him because everybody knows Woj is legit. So the question here is, do you trust BR?"
"Because of the hard cap the Clippers would either have to send Lou and Patrick Patterson (along with probably all their 2nd round picks), or they'd have to trade Beverley for him. Lou for Hill straight up doesn't work as it puts the Clippers over the apron."
I think the Clippers would have to add more because:  1) Those two only add up to $21 million   2) That’s a pitiful return for Lowry (although I like Patrick Beverley and he could get flipped for something else)
"as bad as ricky rubio has been, I really don't want patrick beverley instead"
"&gt;	there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley  Imagine him saying the, *""next five years are mine""*, and then getting traded."
"Players shoot 39% when guardes by Patrick beverly, according no nba.com. Teams switch and run plays all the time. If not like those players scored every one of their points on beverly. In fact, it's more likely that the majority of the points they scored were scored when not guarded by Beverley"
at this point any ref who gives Patrick Beverley the benefit of the doubt is genuinely suspect
"Yeah. There's plenty of dudes who play hard, but don't set out to injure other players. Pesty motherfuckers who don't quit.  Patrick Beverley talks shit but he just doesn't have it in him to play hard but clean."
"my dude, maybe take a look at Patrick Beverley specifically and consider why people might say it about *him*.  If someone said it about any other NBA player I can think of, I'd be right on your side on this. Because the only reason to say it about most NBA players is pure racism.  However, Patrick Beverley, specifically, is a widely-hated individual who looks sketchy as fuck. People are gonna say this shit, because they hate him, and *he look sketchy as fuck*.  He's not hated because he's black, he's hated because he's *fucking dirty*. He has deliberately attempted to injure multiple other players. His actions in the clip under discussion here are, at *best*, extremely reckless, because what he does in this very clip risks significant injury to Chris Paul.  The combination of *is hated* and *looks sketchy as fuck* is gonna end here, and in this specific instance, it's not a race thing.  Personally, I'd have said *meth*head, because in my city people who look sketchy as fuck are usually on meth. They're also, usually, white. It's not a race thing.  It's a *fuck Patrick Beverley, who looks sketchy as a fuck* thing."

"It was cool seeing Beverley get ejected, but ultimately, it hurt us more than the Clippers. They were no longer handicapped by having to play Patrick Beverley.  Can't speak to the first half since I missed it, but we definitely started showing our exhaustion from the OT last night. And unfortunately, we got Perfect P instead of Pandemic P tonight. Dude was feeling it (which, if we had to lose, at least PG gave me 37 points in fantasy). Hell, even Rondo was making his three's tonight. Nothing much you can do when the other team is shooting so hot from deep.  GG LA. Wish we could have gotten this game with fresh legs, but it is what it is."
"Don't get me wrong, I almost made the joke:  *Dirty as fuck, fuck that guy.*  *But also Patrick Beverley is even dirtier and should be ejeceted.*  But opted for the more straightforward approach.  But yeah, don't like CP3 when he does dirty shit, but also fuckkk P Bev forever"

This is why Patrick Beverley is a great defender. He makes you miss the easy shots and takes you out of rhythm.
"Paul George, Patrick Beverley"
Yeah but not if it happened to Patrick Beverley. Schroeder isn't considered dirty on the same level but he bothers a lot of people by playing a little on the dirty side.  Also important that it was so gentle and there was no real risk of injury. Therefore not dirty.
&gt; if this were Patrick Beverly people would be saying off with his head.  Are you really surprised people would treat a player who has never done something dirty before differently then Patrick Beverley? Lol wtf.
Honestly that's cool and all but the thing I love the most about Luka and Jokic is that they're so classy unlike Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley

I love this"
"harden had him beat on literally every stat on the way worse team. and no, durants defense wasn't ""far"" better, both were matched up with eachother quite often during the series.  yeah durant was able to dominate patrick beverley and lou williams, harden struggled a bit against the #1 jazz defense who guarded him from behind. give harden the warriors team and give kd the rockets team and its not even fucking close who wins, atleast harden made it a dog fight"
Patrick Beverley
"Harden had a better team, which is the main reason for the better record. Russ would've killed for backups life Eric Gordon and Lou Williams, not only that Harden had great pieces like Patrick Beverley and Clint Capela to fill out the squad.  People act like the Rockets won 55 games because Harden was that much better than Russ, when in reality the difference wins was due to better coaching and a better roster"
"Sure you can. /r/nba criticises Lowry all the time. He plays hard and when you play hard sometimes you toe the line of being dirty. I don't think Lowry is going out trying to hurt people on purpose and I don't think that he's unacceptably dirty in the way Robert Horry or Patrick Beverley play. He's in that Goran Dragic, Marcus Smart tier of guys who play a hard game. As for flopping, another criticism of Lowry's, that seems to be the way the game is going. Most teams have a player or two who are similarly bad. This is an issue with the officials and how offensive players are rewarded for flopping.  You are talking to me, not my fan base. Some people get sensitive when it comes to their stars, but you can't generalize entire fan bases. I genuinely believe Ben Simmons is overrated and that his game won't translate well to playoff success. This is a matter of opinion and whenever I express that I'm met with a flood of downvotes from people who refuse to even engage in a discussion with me. Are they all Sixers fans downvoting me? Maybe. Does that mean that all Sixer fans have a sus amount of affection for Ben Simmons? Probably not."

Outside of Kawhi who is the definition of ""minds his own business"", the Clippers fielded a line-up of Marcus Morris, Patrick Beverley and Paul George, three players who get some of the most hate in the league. They endlessly talked shit and acted like a team that had won multiple rings, then came up staggeringly short when it matter most."
"Russell Westbrook: ""If I could come back, in the NBA, I want to be Patrick Beverley. I don't want to be a superstar because I want to keep my knees good and all that. I want to be Patrick Beverley: come off the bench, foul anytime I want, ultra green light for injuring, fly when hit by a screen, just running around doing nothing &amp; chill."""
"Unironically yes, of course he's limited because he's really short but he's basically Patrick Beverley but without being a piece of shit. He can give you 20-25 minutes of elite defense on the opposing best guard. You can stick him on them full court and annoy the shit out of them. Even when he gets switched onto wings he can still get some steals or force a bad possession just by being turbo annoying."
"Lol that’s a load of bullshit, harden made the WCF and was 2nd in the west in 2015 with Trevor ariza, Terrence jones Josh smith, Corey Brewer, patrick beverley, tarik black, Joey dorsey, Jason Terry, 41 games of washed howard, taking up all the minutes lmao  He’s a great fit with green, harden and green screen and roll would be lethal.

Not only that, but they might be a *better* team.  They could make up for:  1st in the league in assists  Top 10 in rebounding  Top 20 points per game  By getting Bledsoe? Getting the third 30/20/10 game in history didn't help them beat the pacers?  Sheesh. Westbrook is worse than I thought I guess. Here I was thinking he was some kind of Hall of Famer!"
"Hand checking rule in 2004 didn't change anything the same way gather step rule didn't change anything in 2000s. Hand checking was already called in the 90s when impeding a driver's movement, it's also not effective against quicker players - there's a reason why guys like Kyrie are given space rather than someone like Steph Curry who gets hand checked every single game as they have big differences in quickness. If you want actual proof go check out RiggedBA's youtube channel on how hand checking was called in the 90s. There's plenty of hand checking in today's league that surpasses what the 90s had, watch any Patrick Beverley clips."
Patrick Beverley.
So do you think Shaq and Chuck give good takes too? Do you think Westbrook's take on Patrick Beverley is right?
Bold words coming from Patrick Beverley
It’s really not. Marcus Smart at his best is a slightly better Patrick Beverley. No advanced stats back up the assertion by a diminishing subset of your fan base that he’s a winning player who’s invaluable to the team.
"&gt;We pretending Klay/Dray didn't exist? A team of 4 all-nba players in their prime is unprecedented. Three max contracts on the same team, plus a DPOY-level anchor.  Sorry if I worded it wrong. What I meant was that Curry was the top engine behind what made them a superteam. Him and KD were unequivocally the top 2 players on that team, and were the main drivers of that success. It's different if Steph was the #3 on that team because it'd be fair to wonder if he really was that good without a superteam. But it's hard to discredit Steph considering his status on that team.  &gt;Out of \~1000 GSW playoff minutes, only 260 had an opposing starting PG. And yes, I'm counting Jrue and Conley's minutes in full even though they were notably injured. Then you have other starters out, such as Montiejunas and Kevin Love in full.  Fair point. But look at the context of that too. The Pelicans whether Jrue played or not weren't 2015 Jrue Holiday away from avoiding a sweep. So were the Rockets. They're not a Patrick Beverley away from a gentleman's sweep. Conley and the Cavs were really the only instances of injuries actually making a possibly decisively different result. And the Grizzlies were more so undone by playoff adjustments.  &gt;Not to mention the biggest threat in the West had injures to both superstars to barely miss the playoffs. Show me another year that even comes close.  It's not like they got healthy the next year and lost.  &gt;Sure. Except that I keep hearing about KD's rings not counting while Steph's do. That Kobe was carried by Shaq due to FMVPs, but Curry made things easy for Durant's FMVPs.  Considering that this thread only has me and you on it, it's unfair on my end if you keep bringing up other people's opinions on the matter because I'm not those other people.  &gt;You're using SRS to discredit Lakers being a 4-seed early in the season, so I'm saying the Warriors should be higher due to easy SRS after allstar break. Keep the same energy.  And the Lakers ended with a 37-45 record. The result wouldn't have been that bad if they weren't so shafted with injuries, but that's also a hypothetical on how good they would have been if they all played healthy. The Warriors ARE a better team once the schedule turned. They were 4 games below .500 at one point and are 3 games above .500 now. They went from like 22-27 to 36-33. You don't think the schedule had anything to do with that? I'm keeping the same energy man, unless you expected the Dubs to be a top tier team in the West. My preseason predictions had them as a 6-8 seed and it's averaging out now.  &gt;The entire discussion around 2019 Lakers vs. 2021 Warriors is a clusterfuck.  YOU started this. My original comment was:  &gt;And everyone would agree Bron and Curry makes their teams a lot better. Lakers without Bron in 2019 or Warriors without Curry in 2021 are bottom feeders rather than playoff/fringe playoff teams.  These are facts. These teams without their superstars would be shit. That's all I was trying to say. And yet you replied with:  &gt;LeBron's core was baby Ingram/Lonzo/Kuzma while Curry's is Draymond/Wiggins/Oubre. Curry has the better core who are all healthier, yet his team is an 8th seed.  Where the fuck in my comment did I ever start the comparison of the two other than they both elevate their teams, which is a fact btw? You're the one that started comparing those two even though they're completely different contexts outside the fact that they have 2 superstars who did/are doing their best to get them to the playoffs.  &gt;They're not similar situations and you're trying to pigeonhole the discussion as a told-you-so on LeBron's biggest disappointment since 2011 finals.  YOU'RE the one who brought it up, not me. And since there's no way to accurately compare them since they're so different, I even mentioned that:  &gt;but that's a moot point either way.  As in comparing them is moot other than saying that Steph and Bron elevated these really bad teams to playoff level heights. How the fuck was I supposed to compare them then since YOU brought it up? Using end of season stats was imperfect, but considering you chose to compare them then there was no other way to do so. Then you came guns blazing arguing how Steph has been lucky and how he was on a superteam.  &gt;SRS nitpick already covered above.  What nitpick? Those are facts.  &gt;I say Lonzo is a rookie, you say bullshit (he's a sophomore). The point is LeBron was running with an inexperienced core with significantly more injuries. All of this should be obvious.  And the point is he was also surrounded by vets. The injuries are what really make this an uncomparable situation. This should be obvious, yet you started bringing up supporting casts after all I said was Bron and Steph made their teams better."
"Yes, some of the more notable scrubs James Harden played with include Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and Russell Westbrook.   Those were supposed to be his “sidekicks” - truly pathetic. And you had losers like Trevor Ariza, defensive turnstiles Patrick Beverley &amp; PJ Tucker, and chuckers like Eric Gordon.  It’s a miracle Harden was able to win a playoff series, a testament to his greatness."

"The Clippers were anointed by the media lmaoo  No, Patrick Beverley being Patrick Beverley and saying ""We won a championship"" is not the Clippers anointing themselves."
"Patrick Beverley? Dude isn't good, y'all are probably better without him"
But really why does Patrick Beverley look like Paul Giamatti?
"Not did that injury ruin the OKC's playoff chances, but took a lot out of one of the most explosive and exciting NBA players ever entering his prime and someone who never missed a game in high school, college and the NBA up to that point.  Seriously... Fuck Patrick Beverley."
Fuck Patrick Beverley
"Let me follow on from this point. A lot of people's history of the Thunder goes like this: Young Promising Team - Harden traded - KD Leaves - Westbrook never gets out of the first round. The reality is so much more nuanced than that.   People fail to understand that the Thunder were ran to make a profit in the franchise's early years, OKC did not have a billionaire on board who could stomach financial losses. The billionaire came later in 2014/5 in the form of George B Kaiser. It is one of the reasons why the Thunder were so risk-tolerant in the Westbrook-PG era, they had the muscle to deal with losses.   You can debate whether the owners are right or wrong to run the team like this until you're blue in the face but the fact remains that the NBA retroactively applying the Rose Rule to Durant's extension hurt massively. The increased max meant that the Thunder would hit the repeater tax year after year if they chose to pay KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka. The Thunder could have amnestied Perkins but getting to the Finals required an elite interior defender who could match up with Duncan. It is not as cut and dry as it is made out to be.  Furthermore, the Harden trade was not solely about money. Money was a big factor but the Thunder held concerns about Harden's partying habits. Harden partying during the NBA Finals was not a good look and did not benefit the team against a tough, veteran Heat team. Moreover, Harden wanted a bigger role and this would have been unlikely in OKC. Harden would have hit RFA in 2013 and posed serious questions about the Thunder's ability to retain his services. It is still a stupid trade but you can understand some of the justification of the decision to trade Harden.  Post trade was an injury-ravaged spell. The 2013 team won 60 games and looked to be a better side that the year before. Patrick Beverley inexplicably ran into Russell's knee in the playoffs and that was a year gone. In 2014, Ibaka was injured against the Spurs and those fine margins make all of the difference. In 2015, KD suffers a Jones Fracture and OKC miss the playoffs entirely. 2016 was the only time that the Thunder were fully healthy and we saw what the Thunder were capable of.   The Thunder's failure to win a championship was pretty poor in the last decade but the team went to 3 Conference Finals, an NBA Finals and made the playoffs nine times. The reality is that the ceiling for small markets is lower than big markets. The Spurs are the only small market team in the last 20 years to win a championship.   When you look at all of these conditions, the Thunder were pretty successful.   I haven't even mentioned the failed Chandler trade in 2010 which would have changed the calculus for the Thunder. Tyson Chandler would have meant no Perk and Jeff Green staying.   OKC could have blown it up after Durant left, Presti did field calls for Russ and was close to a deal with the Celtics. The paperwork was filed with the league office but he got cold feet and worked on a max extension for Russell. That trade was something like Jae Crowder, Olynyk and the Celtics' pick in 2017. If that trade happened, the Thunder would have been in a painful rebuild.   The Thunder and Russ did the best with the hand they were dealt. He probably won't win a ring but that's life."

Norman Powell just showed up, but hasn't been here most of the season. The schedule has been grueling for every team, these guys bodies can't take it. It's messed up. But I guess what I was trying to say was that when the Lakers didn't have AD, they had Bron. When you didn't have PG, you had Kawhi. And vice versa. We had 2 of our 3 best players out for most of the season. At the same time. And Damian got us where we are, effectively single handedly.  And Patrick Beverley is trash, you guys not being able to play him does the entire league a service."
"Marcus Morris, Patrick Beverley, Zara while he was playing."
I’ve never seen a player bully another player like how Patrick Beverley did in Lonzos first game
Patrick Beverley getting All-Defensive Second Team over Jrue last year was/is a travesty.
Hi there Patrick Beverley
Campazzo is Argentine Patrick Beverley
"The choking was pretty embarrassing, I get that. The cockiness, I don't. The clip of Pat laughing on the bench last season came after Dame was talking alllll game. All game Dame was initiating everything, but of course Patrick Beverley is gonna get laughed at more than Dame on this sub. The drama that happened in the bubble was also pretty exaggerated. Marcus Morris trying to injure Luka was a really bad look, but again, Luka and KP were talking a LOT that whole series. The double standard is really impressive. A lot of hate stems from bandwagon Raptors fans who were upset that Kawhi left (although most Raps fans that I know aren't toxic and appreciated the ring for what it was) and Lakers fans who 1. don't want Lebron's legacy tainted by a team that's easy to make fun of and 2. are salty Paul George and Kawhi didn't sign with their team. Doesn't help that the media actively post things to rile people up and zero in on one team even though other teams act similarly. I think you'll find that most Clippers fans are more than humble."
"It’s iffy. We haven’t missed any games due to COVID protocols which is nice, but the injury bug as of late has really taken its toll. Feels like every time Patrick Beverley returns, 2 games later something happens (fractured hand, sore back, sore foot, etc.). I know Pat is a meme on here but he’s really important to our team; rebounding, setting the tone defensively, communication. Serge has been out for what feels like the whole season, whole team is undergoing lots of resting. On the flip side, our offence is pretty spectacular when it’s hot. Lots of jump shooting, drive and kick outs, less emphasis on defence which personally is not my favourite play style. We essentially live and die by the 3 and when it works, it works. Chemistry this year is noticeably better, Ty Lue has done a great job managing the team. It’s not as forced as it was last year, our guys actually look like they enjoy playing together most nights. We’ll win really great games that look out of reach, and then turn around and get blown out the very next game. Lots of great vets on the team. Rondo, Batum, Mann have been key. Right now, I’m nervous that if we don’t click and get on a little bit of a roll these last few games, the first round will be tougher than it needs to be. Trying to stay positive, but who knows. I just pray that we don’t choke any more leads. I’ve been through two 3-1 leads, I can’t take it anymore. Future looks a little bleak if we fizzle out again. Could’ve clinched playoffs today but Kawhi’s still resting. It is what it is.  How’s Denver? 7-1 without Jamal so far has to feel good. Do you think Dozier and MPJ have what it takes to help in the playoffs? Is there a real chance to take down the Lakers?  I hope yall taking care of JaMyke, he was such a great role player for us."
"It feels like it's got to be KD or Kyrie, amongst players though it might be somebody like Patrick Beverley or Grayson Allen"
"Patrick Beverley is a “hustle guy” he was the top player in Chicago averaging 38 ppg on the top level. Everyone you see playing in the nba, g league or any top league in a first world country was the man on virtually every team he was on. It’s why guys have a tough time fitting in roles, they’ve been the man for most of their basketball lives"
"Weird how he could carry Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry to a championship but not Paul George and Patrick Beverley, hmmm..."
Yeah glad you pointed that out because that’s what influenced me including Westbrook here. Danny has been low on him for years but to basically rank him as $5 million player below guys like Patrick Beverley was head scratching. There entitled to there opinion of course but I could never agree with that.
Mike Scott  James Johnson  Patrick Beverley  Kawhi Leonard Rajon Rondo
"Absolutely, no question about it if Paul George plays anything like he did against Dallas last year, I'll go as far as to say the Clippers will be out in the first round         And of course their health, Ibaka is out, I don't know what's up with Patrick Beverley and if Kawhi Leonard still has this foot injury then they're done"
"So what you're saying is you think Jrue Holiday was the difference in the Pelicans series and with him, the 45 win Pels were going to beat a 67 win Warriors team? Patrick Beverley (who didn't make an All Defense team that year and shot a whopping 38% from the floor) was the difference between a sweep and a Rockets win?"
"I saw a perfect example of this with Patrick Beverley contesting a Zach lavine 3 point jumper.  It's as if the defender has a disruptive gravity where danger of getting injured is the force applied.   Like when your playing defense and you know, okay I can't reach in because my face will get to close and my nose will get bashed.  Offensive players know like okay I can elevate in this crowded space because I might get hurt.  But the defensive players can feed on it.  It's a, ""make em think they might get hurt, and then they won't pull that move anymore.""  So Zach lavine elevated for the jumper, and Patrick Beverly ran up like he was going to get underneath his landing space.  Zach saw this out of the corner of his eye and gave an oh fuck hesitation and then double clutched the shot. Still a close shot but fuckes his rhythm.   Patrick k Beverly was no where near blocking the shot. His entire defense was startling Zach by making him think he was going to sprain an ankle when he came down if he attempted a clean shot without correction."
Patrick Beverley and Fred Van Vleet should both be on that list.
"It's crazy to me when people act like good defenders don't get a lot of no calls that help them. Like Chris Paul, Patrick Beverley, Draymond Green, etc. all get away with fouls that would almost certainly be called on lesser defenders pretty often."
"I am patrick beverley without the passable scoring. I will drop dimes, steal balls, block shots, dive at loose balls, dive at knees, but if you want me to put the ball in the basket I’m sorry, I can’t do that."
Ok Patrick Beverley lmao what a weirdo having to look me up what a freak
Out for the Clips   Patrick Beverley (left hand fourth metacarpal fracture)   Paul George (rest)   Serge Ibaka (lower back tightness)   Reggie Jackson (rest)   Kawhi Leonard (right foot soreness)   Rajon Rondo  (right wrist inflammation)\]
"Your snarky attitude aside, I never said I don't see anything wrong with him.  There's a difference between light-hearted banter and being pompous like Patrick Beverley. Embiid was willing to admit that there's no rivalry between the 76ers and Celtics because ""they always kick our ass.""   I get you may not like Embiid for whatever reason but he's not pompous and would not be insufferable after winning a championship."
Go watch Patrick Beverley and Draymond play every night if you're craving some good old handchecking.
"We know what we've gotta do. I hear Ray Allen is trying to assemble a team in Seattle consisting of 2016 Kevin Love, Patrick Beverley, Prime Tony Allen, Seth Curry and St Jude herself. That should do the trick"
https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/11/clippers-patrick-beverley-says-steph-curry-is-like-a-brother/
"It's obviously semantics, but PG and Kawhi aren't just stars, they're superstars/undeniably top 10 players. To me, if you've got two superstars and a solid supporting cast, that's a superteam. I think most NBA fans considered the Clippers to be the far and away favorites going into last season (and so did Patrick Beverley)."
"I thought it was Patrick Beverley making the comments lol, the Cancún comments"
They don’t give Frank any room to play defense. Patrick Beverley would get away with 10x more aggression
Patrick Beverley
"There were also a number of solid players they could have chosen over Hasheem. Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Patty Mills, Brandon Jennings, and Patrick Beverley to name a few. Hell, even Ricky Rubio would have been a better pick."
"may i suggest... Patrick Beverley??????? Or Grayson Allen, the man who puts his pants on one toe at a time?"
Was texting someone the night before the game and we were so excited for it since we were convinced Harden was gonna put up at least 60 points. The Laker/Clipper matchup where Patrick Beverley sealed the win by blocking LeBron totally made up for it
Disliked him ever since that game against memphis this season (when he was a wizard) where Jonas nearly (understandably so) killed him. Trading him for Theis is like trading Smart for Patrick Beverley if he had no legs and only a shitty personality
Patrick Beverley is the first player in NBA history
"Both of these articles reference the event, I've seen a couple of beat writers for the clippers mention it as well. Reggie was not playing well early in the year, and there was already a log jam at point guard. Ty Lue told Reggie to stay ready and when some injuries happened Reggie stepped in with whole new energy to how he played.   I remember those days with him on the Pistons, and even during his days on the Thunder when he would complain about his role versus Westbrook. He's come a long way in a short time; it's impressive to see. Playing on a veteran team probably helps too.  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-04-10/clippers-reggie-jackson-patrick-beverley-injured  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/ty-lue-met-with-lou-williams-reggie-jackson-and-luke-kennard"
Patrick Beverley is such a punk ass bitch. The fuck is he even doing lol then throws up his hands like “what? foul? Me???”
Patrick “Passenger” Beverley
Patrick Beverley is Ben simmons if Ben simmons was a midget and can shoot a little bit
I don't want to live in a world where Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris experience success
"[This was the first result when I googled Pat Bev Westbrook’s knees. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2018/10/31/patrick-beverley-crashes-into-russell-westbrooks-knees-again-westbrook-was-hot/amp/) Crazy how he happens to collide with the same player’s knees multiple times after already ending his season once. It’s one thing to go for the ball and having it happen once, it’s another to have it happen multiple times. Defense is one thing but you can’t be recklessly diving after the ball like that without regard for other players."
I mean also a very good game from Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley didn’t let the jazz even scare em at the end.  Coulda been a 15 pt game again
I'm pretty sure everyone hates Patrick Beverley the basketball player.
Patrick Beverley is such a little bitch oh my god
That moment when Patrick Beverley is running around doing nothing but has more stats than DPOY Rudy Gobert
That's why guys like Patrick Beverley will keep getting votes until they retire. Someone needs to hold these voters accountable and actually take away their vote if it's terrible.
PATRICK BEVERLEY?????
Campazzo really is Argentinian Patrick Beverley lol
If that was Marcus morris or Patrick Beverley everyone would’ve agreed with the call.   This series was over whether Jokic was here or not stop crying about it.
The difference after game 2 was Beverley wasn't able to be physical at all and couldn't be primary defender getting into foul trouble. KD wasn't taking more than 12 shots for an entire month on that Warriors team so he wasn't going to score much but every time he tried over Patrick it did not end well.
"Haha by that logic, you should not blame Zaza for injuring Kawhi, since he single handedly beat the Spurs in 2017, right? And you shouldn't blame Patrick Beverley for fucking up Westbrook's knee by football tackling him. Right? They played ""tough championship basketball"" right?  I bet people like you don't blame these guys but you would give a pass on what Giannis did. This is why you guys are a bunch of fkin hypocrites."
Patrick Beverley isn't capable of containing a super star
"1) Pat Beverley  2) Beverley, Pat  3) P. Beverley  4) Beverley, P.  5) Patrick Beverley"
I feel like patrick beverley is the type of guy that talks to himself in the mirror as his own hype man.
"Ty Lue is still mad at some those reckless turnovers by Rondo in Game 1. Anyway, Patrick Beverley and Terrence Mann bring a defensive intensity to the game that Rondo can't"
DPOY bites on a Patrick Beverley 3 point pump fake  Bravo
Patrick Beverley has the worst hairstyle in the NBA except for Gallo's Taxi Driver mohawk.
Patrick Beverley
"""I just won the fucking championship!""  --Patrick Beverley, shouting while standing on a table in Vegas, when he heard about Kawhi and PG joining the Clippers in July 2019 🤡"
No problem. It's Patrick Beverley. [Send Rafer Alston at him.](https://youtu.be/f3OuzKpQ3jM)   I remember watching this live. Such a satisfying slap. The way his headband spins. Couldn't have been more perfect
"Their only actual floor general on the whole roster is Rondo, and he’s jut not that good to be playing significant minutes, so their offense just devolves into individuals trying to make a play. And that will never work for any team trying to go deep in the playoffs. Defenses are too strong at that point to rely on that. With Utah, Donovan is their primary creator right now, but once he passes out Ingles and Bogdon can handle the rock some and attack close out, and can be trusted to find the right man. Once Kawhi passes out, Morris will pump fake, then jab step, then will back down his defender and try a fadeaway. Batum will stand there and wait for Kawhi to come back and get the ball. Patrick Beverley, sucks."
More like marcus morris and patrick beverley locked up Kawhi
"If that were Patrick Beverley hitting Ingles in the neck, they would want him kicked out of the league. Did he flop? Yes, but it’s still a clear flagrant foul based on how they have called it this year."
This is a dangerous time in the game with Patrick Beverley out there. Watch your knees
I mean Patrick Beverley
"Patrick ""The Grope"" Beverley"
"Draymond, AD, and now Patrick Beverley?  Must be a California thing"
I hate watching Patrick Beverley play basketball
patrick beverley is so fucking bad at basketball lol getting exposed on defence as we speak
Patrick Beverley being terrible warms my heart.
"""*Ready for all this defense?*"" - Patrick Beverley  ""*I don't even see you.*"" - Donovan Mitchell"
"Better than Patrick ""next 5 years are mine"" Beverley.  At the very least, PJ is humble enough to admit he's not stopping Durant and is just trying to makehim work and not claiming to shutting him down."
"I’d stop watching if I had to root for Patrick Beverley, genuinely"
"I hate guys who intentionally try to injure other players. Like, majorly hate it and I think the penalty for it isn't nearly enough. Zaza Pachulia, Bruce Bowen and Patrick Beverley would have gotten a serious lesson, like suspended 20, 30 games at a time or worse if it were up to me. That s\*\*t is the opposite of everything sports is about and I would stop it instantly."
The Patrick Beverley special.
They should really try Patrick Beverley on Mitchell. There is nobody else that can guard him 1 on 1 and Utah's quick movement punishes every overplay they try on him.
the jazz's mvp so far has been patrick beverley
Ben Simmons is a glorified Patrick Beverley
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2860163-report-patrick-beverley-told-warriors-steph-curry-the-next-5-years-are-mine
nah a rich man's patrick beverley
"True, and Harden had way better teammates than Klay and Draymond that series. Elite NBA legends like Patrick Beverley and Donatas Motiejūnas."
"Yep, in terms of season turnarounds, that was it.  Shit was looking bleak as the Clippers were doing okay, but PG had just been diagnosed with some weird bone edema. Lou was clearly not his self all season. Patrick Beverley and Serge were now out AGAIN with injuries.  And then we were getting blown out by the Hawks. Luke came in with Mann and led the huge comeback, that I think solidified in the FO's mind to move on from Lou Will. Mann has been fantastic as a spark plug this year"
"Thats ridiculous. Wade played an enforcer role on Miami, every time he shoved someone or had a dirty play, there was something that precipitated it. Indiana had a rough foul on the Heat before he shoved Collison (or whoever it was, I cant remember) the Celtics series in general was very physical on both sides. The only reason people think he's the dirtiest is because superstars dont usually try to be enforcers for their teams. Morris has had intentional dirty plays for no reason other than losing a game, where he either did or could've actually injured someone. Patrick Beverley intentionally injured Westbrook. Outside of just on court incidents, both Morris twins have several off court controversies including actual fucking crimes, and Patbev has the biggest mouth in the NBA.  Im not saying JR and Wade dont deserve hate, im saying that you really cant compare them to Patbev and Morris. Even if you wanted to equate their dirty plays (which you cant) Morris and Patbev are simply much more unlikeable off the court as well."
"Nah people hate the Clippers cause of PG, Morris and Patrick Beverley lol. Right or wrong, because I thought for sure Clippers would be fan favorites last year cause they were a threat to the Lakers but I was dead wrong."
 Patrick Beverley being unplayable makes this win for the clippers much more satisfying than if that dickhead played
You mean it's a bad idea to let Patrick Beverley and Reggie Jackson switch onto a 6'7 superstar with forty pounds on them without even remotely attempting to avoid it!?
It's because they were so confident the 2020 title was theirs at the beginning of the season. Patrick Beverley is obnoxious
"If the Clippers get bounced first round then their duo isn’t proving to work, I could see them wanting to switch things up. Paul George is 31 and aging fast. Nurk, Covington and CJ next to Kawhi imo is an overall roster upgrade for the clips.  Patrick Beverley, CJ, Kawhi, Covington and Nurkić imo is a better overall team than Patrick Beverley, PG, Kawhi, Morris and Zubac."
“The next 5 years are mine” - Patrick Beverley
Remember how he was laughing at the Clippers on Twitter after they went down 2-0 against  the Mavs. Him and Patrick Beverley are complete frauds
We can offer you one Patrick Beverley and a Halo themed Zune
"I'm an LA guy. Lived here my whole life, and have always supported my local teams. It just so happens that I'm a Laker fan first, but as long as they aren't going head-to-head I'll always support the Clips. That being said, Patrick Beverley has made me actually want them to lose in a way. I think the robot Leonard has something to do with it, too, not entirely sure. If I were working that night, I might have let a few ""5 years"" comments slip."
I don't hate the Clippers I hate super teams and Patrick Beverley
Mann has graduated from the Patrick Beverley school of basketball
"Cj’s issue is that he compliments dame by just being a store brand version of dame. That’s mot even meant to be hate, but it’s true. The thing is at the end of the day you don’t have a lot to throw at people.   I think you need a player like Marcus Morris, who can both start and come off the bench and get you value, OR you invest in getting a very deep guard rotation that compliment dame differently. Like maybe move cj for someone like Marcus smart. Someone named marcus for sure.   Alternatively, you can keep cj and try and make a move for someone like Patrick beverley(this would be low key pretty funny.) if you want to live or die by your guards, you can still do that, but dame and store brand dame aren’t going to be doing you too many favors."
"If that's all it takes then CP3 ain't makin it through the playoffs, have fun with Patrick Beverley guarding that shoulder, have fun beatin us tho Suns fans, you earned some fun"
"I imagine Luka scoring over Patrick Beverley, he's screaming obscenities ""TOO \[dolphin noises\] SMALL!!!!"""
"I mean, Ariza, RoCo, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Patrick Beverley, PJ Tucker... all guys who were pretty solid in both aspects in their primes (some of them still are), and I wouldn’t really call any of them “stars.” The only really “star” I think of when I hear the “3&amp;D” label is Klay Thompson.  Edit: I misunderstood what you were calling “overrated”; that’s my bad."
"""Hello, my name is Patrick Beverley. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""
Pretty sure Patrick Beverley is like 75% of the reason.
"Tobias goes in the post against anyone who is even a centimeter smaller than him and this dude who is like 7""12"" won't take Patrick Beverley to the post. It's wild man."
"[Patrick Beverley] ""Coach told me he was going to sit me tonight, I told him 'hell yah' """
"Ayton is the top of the list FOR SURE  Booker Trae and Ja are 100% showing up in their first playoff games so they’re looking good  Tatum and Luka are already high but they’re playing insane ball so they have to be on the list   Cameron Payne  Monte Morris  Dillon Brooks  Thybulle   Everyone on the Blazers, specifically Nurkic though. Yes Jokic is feasting but honestly how can you stop him lol. It’s just impressive that they’ve managed to hold him at 5 or less assists each game (2x 1 assist, 2x 5 assists)  Everyone on the Hawks  Hate on me all you want but Paul George is DOING IT. Make all the Playoff P jokes, but he’s balling tf out  I’ve always been SUPER high on Jrue but no one can say shit about him after this series  Andre Drummond made this really weird IQ jump after the first game of the series so why not   Caruso is proving that he’s what Patrick Beverley pretends to be"
Play Patrick Beverley you cowards
Patrick Beverley is huge impact too
Patrick Beverley is so annoying hahaha
Patrick Beverley probably
the results would be no different if julius kissed him on the cheek to send a message of brotherly love. the team isn’t good enough.   it’s no different than patrick beverley supposedly controlling games because he “gets in their head” he’s mediocre and has to resort to gimmicks because he can’t beat anyone playing basketball
"Burying this comment here for posterity.  My suspicion is that the Clips gave Luke Kennard the extension because they needed a tradeable contract down the road.  The Clips are over the cap.  They're limited in the ways that they can acquire significant talent.  One way is to take on other team's unwanted contracts like they did with Rondo.  You need tradeable contracts for that.  One example of a move that could be made possible by Kennard's contract is Patrick Beverley, Luke Kennard, and the player taken with the 25th pick in the 2021 draft for Al Horford.  The salaries match.  There's a chance the Clips won't have Nic Batum and/or Serge Ibaka next season.  Both can become unrestricted free agents after this season and Serge could possibly miss time due to his health.  Al Horford could slot in neatly as a PF/C who could start or come off the bench at either position, provide shooting, passing, and defense.  The structure of Kennard's contract and the incentive language basically makes it a 3 year $43 mil contract for a team like OKC.  It's not that bad for player who can get his own shot and hit over 40% of his 3s as long as you don't need him to play defense.  His defensive limitations make him a bad fit for teams with championship aspirations but he's a good fit for a rebuilding team that doesn't expect to make deep playoff runs right away."
This mf only saw the clipped version that made the front page 💀💀💀  Luka literally ran into an idle Patrick Beverley. Like full on ran into him. Come on now.
"No doubt. If you compare their statistical projections it’s not unlikely that KP could follow Andrea’s footsteps of being woefully average over the next few years to just being a rotation player or out of the league.  If you want to shoot jumpers fine. But if you get switched onto Patrick Beverley on the post and you decide to take a turn around fadeaway jumper that becomes a serious issue. You can still be a shooter and play with FORCE.   People were crucifying AD for playing like shit vs GS and G1 @ PHX. Every shot was a perimeter one or fading away from contact, being unengaged on offense, and just being plain lazy on defense. Yet Porzingis has been playing this way for the entire year and just now people are truly seeing what he’s become as a player. He’s basically decided that I’ll just stand here until Luka passes me the ball and then I’m going to immediately shoot the ball regardless of defensive matchup, shot clock, or flow of the game."
Luka just had his best game of the series? 44/9/9 on 15/28 5/10 from three. This is literally the “Patrick Beverley after holding Luka to 40” meme
He really went to Patrick Beverley for basketball advice 🤦‍♂️
"Hey that's Patrick ""the next 5 years are mine"" Beverley"
Hi  -Patrick Beverley
[Luka when Patrick Beverley hits him.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYQkF_SX0AA9485.jpg)
I dislike Patrick Beverley as much as the next guy but you can't just walk into his chest and not expect a response lol
Because he's Patrick Beverley.
Patrick “More Techs than Points” Beverley
Fuck Patrick Beverley
"""Aye P, they said they I gotta come off tha bench!""   \-- Patrick Beverley"
"I hope the Mavericks are preparing for Patrick Beverley to try and injure someone, because he's gonna, and I'd hate to see him do to Luka what he did to Russell Westbrook"
"Cp3 has never injured a player.  Dwayne wade, Gerald Wallace, Patrick Beverley all done shit that actually hurt guys badly"
fuck patrick beverley. lets go mavs
He and Patrick Beverley should see if they can get a group discount at the therapist after the first round.
Campazzo is who Patrick Beverley thinks he is
"One time I was at Oracle with my friend. The Warriors were playing the Clippers and we bought some pretty sweet tickets for my birthday. It was easily the closet we’ve ever sat at a professional sporting event and we were juiced.   We were progressively getting more and more hammered. At the time, I absolutely loathed Beverley and all of his shenanigans. Besides all the Westbrook antics, he always targeted the Stephster to start some funk and I was worried he was going to hurt him.   All of a sudden, Patrick fuckin Beverley started a fight with Steph under the basket we were sitting by.   In the heat of the moment, I almost catapulted my $17 Coors Light at Beverley’s noggin. The thought of Beverley beating the ever living shit out of me, getting arrested, and getting banned from the place where my best childhood memories have been crossed my mind.   I’m thankful everyday that I didn’t do the deed."
"Patrick Beverley is great when the stakes are low. If you want a solid defensive performance against a rookie point guard in his first game, or maybe some cheerleading off the bench in a random regular season game against the Blazers, he's your guy.  A great troll but a medium player."
[Donovan Mitchell talks about how good he is](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/donovan-mitchell-calls-patrick-beverley-first-team-all-defense)
"Before the season started, I thought something centered around Marcus Morris and a pick would work, Timberwolves need some big man/wing depth while the Clippers need guard depth. Maybe Patrick Beverley instead of Morris, Beverley hasn't played great but at least he would be able to get some personality and grit into that Timberwolves team."
"Is there really no way to keep Patrick Beverley off the floor? He's one of the most limited offensive players I've ever seen. It's insane that you have Kennard, Jackson and Rondo over on your bench, but you have Patrick Beverley forced to switch onto Luka every possession, which ends up being a layup or an and-1. Just really confusing stuff."
"In the playoffs, I'd argue that your defence is as strong as your weakest link. Them dudes still playing Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverley."
"The fact that Luka is torching a team with Kawhi, Paul George and Patrick Beverley should qualify him as a generational talent by itself."
This is so bad on so many levels. First off that was a weak screen you didn't need to switch. Than PG comes to double with Patrick Beverley playing 3 feet away from Luka. If you wanna double you have to press the ball handler and the man doubling has to cut off the easy pass to his man so his teammates can rotate.   After that 2 Mavs players are sitting in the corner right next to each other with one Clipper guarding them. Why does Kawhi jog with his back to KP? There are 2 Mavs players on top of each other so you just need to rotate to the block opposite of ball side.  I think after the double they wanted to rotate PG to the back end but Kawhi has to hold the weak side so his man can get back. This just seems like a lack of practice
Patrick Beverley got 5 years of early playoff exits
I blame Patrick Beverley for that.
"How is this the first time they’re actually watching the Suns this year when it’s Game 5 of the Finals? You mean they didn’t see a single Suns game before this? The most dirty play by Booker came when he shoved Dennis in game 3 of the first round, but when he went crazy in game 6 of the series there was nothing but praise for him.  Exactly so CP3 has always been known as dirty for the majority of his career, but the majority of this sub wasn’t complaining daily about how dirty he is during the WCF like they were for Patrick Beverley. People loved the Suns a week ago when they looked like they were going to win the title easily and now this sub is on an Anti-Suns circlejerk now that they’re down in the series."
"Which fits in with the Clippers curse. If you think that's just relegated to only affecting Chris Paul, [you need to look at their history](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090624&amp;sportCat=nba) and everyone else associated with them. Look at the injury issues Blake Griffin has had, which all started for him literally in his first pre-season with the Clippers and have continued after they traded him. Look at what Kawhi is dealing with right now. Look at how often Patrick Beverley gets hurt, how he missed a full season injured as a Clipper. Look at Serge Ibaka out with back injuries all year and now may miss all of next season with back surgery. Look at Zubac fucking up his knee. Look at Paul George's shoulder issues and his persistent hamstring problems. That shit is real."

"I stg bro, I didn’t start watching NBA constantly until literally Bucks vs Nets Game 7, before that I would just watch a few games every now and then. Because of that I didn’t know who Patrick Beverley was but in one of the Suns vs Clippers games can’t remember which one, that’s the first trait I picked up on of him, there was like 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter and it still took like a half an hour for the game to finish because on literally each play Pat Bev would whine to the refs causing them to have to review for like 5 minutes lmao"

"Smaller players generally are more dirty, that's not a coincidence. They are smaller and (generally) weaker than everyone else on the court, due to that they feel like they need to go a little extra to be in an even playing field.  People that talk about Patrick Beverley today need to watch some highlights (or lowlights) of Stockton and Isiah, they were way worse. Isiah routinely took people out of the air and threw them into the ground."
"Absolutely sickening how this sub voted Chris Paul,  Patrick Beverley, and Grayson Allen to the NBA all non-dirty team."
No one fears CP3. Being dirty doesn't mean you're a force to be reckon with. Look at Patrick Beverley. Guys treat him like he's a fly on the court and he's a really dirty player.
"Entitled millionaire in their 20s with shit intelligence acts happy when winning and like a punk when losing.  It's honestly annoying how frequent this happens. The Suns are the worst team at this, but this happens across all sports and many teams (not all).  Patrick Beverley is like this too. He is probably the worst of all offenders individually and just has such a punchable face. It only compounds how easily hateable he is.  Why can't athletes just act fucking normal? They look like a 12 year old who's trying to blame everyone else for their shit KD ratio in Call of Duty. It's a terrible look when you act like you're still a stuck up teenager."
It’s not the same thing but Giannis pulling someone down midair is still a dangerous play. But Reddit doesn’t care because it’s Giannis. Had someone like Patrick Beverley do something like that it would hit the front page

I’m completely biased but Patrick Beverley is 5x dirtier than Paul. You can dislike Chris Paul without trying to defend the dirtiest player in the NBA.

"By that logic, has Lebron played Point his whole career?  Harden played the 2-Guard almost entirely when he was in Houston. Just because he has the ball in his hands doesn't make him a point guard. For the Majority his time there he had Mix of Patrick Beverley, CP3, and then Westbrook.   I think that the Suns would have been a Playoff team this year simply based on other roster improvements. CP3 sure helps with development of the team but I think they would have been able to get a 5 seed at least.   Whoever has the ball in their hands tends to be that star, Which I think Booker would have been this year with or without CP3."
"I disagree. Dennis Rodman, Draymond Green, Patrick Beverley-- all superstars, all great defenders, mediocre scorers. Green is one of the league's best passers, but those other two are useless on the offensive end. Which is fine, because you don't need 5 scorers. Ben Wallace was a superstar in his day, and his presence in the Hall of Fame underscores that."
Donovan Mitchell was just as bad when he was guarded by Patrick Beverley.  Doncic and Don were actively seeking screens to get off Kawhi.

Patrick Beverley
Many of these guys were the best player on their team for their entire life until they got to the NBA so it's understandable. It's not something they just decide to start in the NBA.   I just looked it up and in high school Patrick Beverley averaged 37/6/6 and 8 steals lmao. I'm sure it wasn't against the highest competition but I can certainly imagine why he has experience with trash talk.
"Reminds me of the Western Conference Finals. There was a series of plays where Devin Booker tried to back down Patrick Beverley with his shoulder, and Bev flew backwards and got a charge. Very next play Marcus Morris did the same thing to Bridges except it looked like he was much more forceful. Bridges however stood his ground, got forced back, and Morris got an easy bucket. Only difference was Bridges didn't throw his body on the ground and it was a 4-point swing."
Patrick Beverley didn’t get shown at all!

"This year, Patrick Beverley was also the first player in NBA history"
As Jayson Tatum progresses I don’t think there’s a need for a playmaking PG. Having Smart at PG is what I imagine the Clippers thought they were getting with Patrick Beverley.  And for all the talk about “Clippers need a real PG! Clippers need a PG!” they finished top 5 in offense each of the last two seasons.
I think Patrick Beverley does:
*2015-2016 rockets*:  Patrick Beverley   Harden  Corey Brewer   Ariza   Dwight Howard  *2016-2017 rockets*:  Harden  Patrick Beverley  Ariza   Ryan Anderson  22 year old Clint Capela   Both of those teams are worse than the current Mavericks.

Patrick Beverley-  Oh no  Anyway
"Fuck Patrick Beverley and all the other goons on the Clippers.  Everybody hates your team for a reason, and it's definitely not because you guys are good."
Patrick Beverley to Paul George: “Watch this.”  *Pushes Chris Paul down from behind*  CP3: “What the heck are you doing!?”  PG: “That’s what I’m talkin’ about!”
"Bosh made All Star 11 times. Stop with this idiotic take. He is a lock for the hall of Fame. He was the best player on a playoff team. He made All NBA. His career stats are 19 points and 8.5 rebounds. Ibaka is 12 points and 7 rebounds. Ibaka never sniffed All Star, All NBA, and won’t be in the Hall of Fame. Ibaka is the classic role player. While Bosh was the #1 option on a playoff team.  All Defense isn’t as valuable as All Star.   Patrick Beverley made All Defense.  Andre Roberson made All Defense. Their value is small compared to All stars"
"No. Jaylen Brown, contrary to what some people think, has been a great defender in the postseason. Last postseason for example, he had more total defensive win shares (4th in the league behind Tatum, Lebron, AD) than Butler or Bam despite playing 4 less games.   His d-bpm was 1.1. Guys who had lower ones last playoffs include Dort, PG, Gobert, and Embiid. In this playoffs, that includes Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, and PG.  He had a plus 3 d-raptor, tied with Tatum. Guys with lower ones last year included Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This postseason, the following guys have a plus 2.5 at most: Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG."
"Lol I don’t care if people want to troll about it. They can think what they think. And I’ll even agree that if klay and KD were healthy the raps chances of winning would have been lower. But in the end they weren’t healthy and we won so who cares.   If the suns win y’all are definitely gonna hear a lot of trash talking with this playoffs being historically injury riddled. Just gotta embrace it. If lebron, AD and kawhi were healthy do y’all make it this far? Nobody knows because the reality is they weren’t healthy so who cares. If I grew a foot and didn’t have the athleticism of a sloth maybe I’d be in the NBA. But I’m not so nobody cares and that’s why I’m just a homeless mans patrick Beverley in pick up games just running around throwing cheap shots and calling it “defence and hustle” lol. If y’all win just enjoy the chip and don’t pay no mind to the trolls. Even if the suns don’t you guys went from a franchise that looked hopeless to making a finals run with DBook and Ayton finally showing the world that they can play winning basketball"
"Jaylen’s an underrated defender by this point. He struggled this season (like everyone on the Celtics but advanced stats still mostly had him as neutral or a slight negative defensively) and some cherry picked clips that could be found on almost any player made people focus on his offball defense, often criticizing him for a defensive lapse that I’d later see an actual analyst fault someone else for.  He’s still a great on ball defender - while he’s in the top sixth of the league for shots attempted against him, opponents shoot 2.2% worse than their average when he defends them. That’s better than Ayton, RJ, OG, PG, Lonzo, Capela, Jrue, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges and a lot of others. There are some defensive advanced stats that put him above Tatum though I think Tatum’s definitely better.   He’d consistently raised his defense in the postseason and was fantastic last year while also also averaging 22 ppg on 58.6% ts. He tied Tatum in defensive raptor with +3  above guys like Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This year, guys with at least a .5 lower d-raptor include Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG. He also had a 1.1 dbpm which was better than Dort, PG, Gobert, Embiid, Danny Green and more last year and this year would be more than players like Mikal Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, PG. Most impressively, he had the 4th most total defensive win shares with 1.1 only after Tatum, Lebron, and AD. Part of that is him getting to the ecf but Butler and Bam got to the finals and still have fewer defensive win shares."
Hard to imagine Patrick Beverley being anything other than Patrick Beverley.
The key for whoever we play next is that whoever we play next won’t have Patrick Beverley to pester him so I have faith he’ll remember
Patrick Beverley and CP3 would be proud
Too bad this isn't an announcement for Patrick Beverley and his reckless play.
Charles felt personally offended with that comment.  Patrick Beverley is a bum who wants to injure players.  Nothing more.
"How stupid can you be to think you can get away with misquoting someone in text, when the original comment exists.  You even omit the part that comes before the last thing you quote that addresses your “disagreement.”  What are you doing? You’re not trolling, this is almost as unhinged as Beverley. I’m tempted to ask, are you Patrick Beverley? Are you a friend or family member?"
"""Dennis Rodman-esque in his basketball skills is Patrick Beverley"""

"I hate Patrick Beverley so much.  What if he had caused CP3 an injury? Apparent he's got a form ligament in his wrist right now, what if he braces his fall with his wrist at an awkward angle and fucks it? Not that we needed any confirmation but his play on Westbrook in 2013 is undisputably dirty"
Patrick Beverley would pause the game for 2.5 minutes when he’s about to lose at 2k I bet

Fuck Patrick Beverley
"Patrick Beverley is the fucking worst, makes me cringe to tell people I watch NBA when you have him doing bitch shit like that"
Patrick Beverley looks like if Draymond Green started doing crystal meth.
Real shit fuck Patrick Beverley. Only way he has a chance of winning is playing a dirty bitch. May Westbrook’s knees live forever
And I hope the league takes this very seriously and punish Patrick Beverley accordingly.
"Ya'll done fucked around and made me say something reasonable about Patrick Beverley. I just wanna say this: to anyone saying his actions are out of line is correct. However, you'd be a fool to think it can't or won't happen to you. Not saying you'll push someone, but just being a victim of your emotions. EVERYONE is culpable to this. Just keep living life, and you're going to find yourself in a situation where you will do or say something in the heat of a moment that you will come to regret. It shouldn't need to be said, but Patrick Beverley is human just like the rest of us. I hope instead of being vilified at a terrible time in your life, someone shows you instead grace, kindness, and forgiveness when you show your ass in one of your worst moments. ✌🏽"
It’s cuz Cp3 needs Allstate to protect himself from mayhem like Patrick Beverley.
"Just a shove lmao I know Chris is known for flopping and I can’t defend that at all, but saying “just a shove” is ridiculous. Fuck Patrick Beverley. Could almost guarantee his agent or or staff told him to do this to save his image. Players that really apologize contact the individual not over social media"
https://streamable.com/uif88v  Full replay. It kinda looks like pat walked towards Cp to do like a shoulder bump and misread Chris’s angle and CP also moved his shoulder to avoid contact. When Chris realized Patrick Beverly tried to initiate he gave him that look as they walked away. Realizing his attempt to be chippy was noticed but unsuccessful Beverley had to double down and shove him  Edit tldr pat bev is a big ol bitch
And Clippers fans wonder why we hate Patrick Beverley
"I didn't step into the post game thread, but by god was this a cathartic ass beating.  After going up 9 and then double digits in the 3rd, the refs were gifting the Clippers free throw after free throw -- and that was while the Suns were far behind on the FT and foul disparity. We went up 17 and then Monty failed to call a timeout until the 10-0 run and thank god we have Chris Paul.  I have only respect for Reggie jackson -- and some respect for Paul George (He abused the fact that nobody calls his off arm extension to the extreme this series) -- but I am so happy that we will never again see Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris, Demarcus Cousins this season, almost so much that my relief of not playing against them and risking injury is greater than the happiness that the Suns are in the finals for the first time in my life.  Noticing the tides turning after game 5 on this sub and hten immediately flipping as Bev gets ejected was amazing."

I saw the Jazz have a huge lead by halftime, said to myself ""Okay it's getting late I'll stay up for game 7 though"" and turned off the TV.   Wake up next morning to check the box score, Terence Mann has 39 points, and apparently along with Paul George, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Beverley they 3-pt barraged the Clippers to victory and abused Rudy Gobert"

"&gt;We had Parsons and Patrick Beverley  They're not scrubs. They're the only reason this wasn't a sweep for Harden.

"The Thunder had Reggie Jackson, Kevin Martin and Serge Ibaka. We had Parsons and Patrick Beverley. The Thunder were significantly better than us even without Westbrook, especially accounting for the fact that Harden was just a lower tier all-NBA guy at the time."
Patrick Beverley is still almost a full Michael Jordan career away from matching or surpassing Michael Jordan in terms of accolades
"The fact that it's Patrick Beverley makes me believe literally any internet or sports personality over him. This dude has been flopping, cheating, trying to hurt people and lying about it for 10 years and I'm supposed to believe him when he says ""Never said this ever""? Fuck outta here."
Fuck Patrick Beverley.
"I'm just saying that everyone will romanticize their perspective in some way shape or form. I'm sure that everyone believes that they came from nothing in some way. Harden's dad spent most of his time in jail, and Harden had to grow up in Compton. LeBron came from nothing. Haliburton's mom was killed. Curry struggled with injuries and inadequacy early in his career. Seth Curry has to keep up with Steph. Patrick Beverley had to fight for a bench spot. If you look hard enough, you could probably find a reason for anyone. LaMelo has to compete with his brother and has been scrutinized his entire career since highschool. Lonzo was part of the young core that had a chance to play with LeBron but got traded right off the bat. Everyone has a chip on their shoulder, and some are obviously bigger than others, but everyone has a chip nonetheless."

BREAKING: The Minnesota Timberwolves are trading Patrick Beverley to OKC for a 2057 first round draft pick.
"In the games that the wolves have had D'lo and Towns available, they've played about 0.500 basketball. Towns missed 22 games, D'lo missed 30 games, and Beasley missed 35 games last year. Also Patrick Beverley is a good fit for them, much better than Rubio who was not good last year."
"Honestly, I didn't really like Patrick Beverley that much. I probably still don't like him that much. But I have nothing but respect for his attitude and the way he is handling this off season.  The guy is a real one and will bring a lot of culture and positive vibes to the locker room wherever he goes."
Well Patrick Beverley said he’s excited to play with a young team so he’s definitely getting traded tomorrow

"It’s not assumptions man I’ve just read these same comments a million times from people who just want to hate for the sake of hating.  Pat Bev and Steph were roommates during multiple youth basketball camps before the nba. They are friends.  And the janitor thing is bullshit because people pretend like he was talking down to a worker when that’s not how the story was written originally at all. Here’s a direct quote from Haynes’ article:  &gt;	In the Clippers’ locker room, Patrick Beverley was having some fun with some of the arena staff workers who help tidy up the facility. “Y’all a little different without KD, I see,” Beverley playfully jabbed."

And while I’m sitting at the table (a little bit more intoxicated than I should have been admittedly), the news that all three of these guys had been traded to Memphis drops. And seeing Patrick Beverley jump on top of the table, at a five star Italian restaurant, screaming at the top of his lungs “I JUST WON THE F-ING PLAY IN GAME!” Over and over and over again was enough to make me sick."
RIP Patrick Beverley
"I hate this dumbass quote because it simply isn't true. Is Patrick Beverley a reckless player? Sure. Does he deserve hatred for his past actions and behavior? Sure. Is he a negative defender? Absolutely not. In the playoffs, he was locking up Mitchell and Booker whenever he was guarding them, and got a few blocks in. The only person who he didn't halt in his tracks was Luka, and he's a bona fide superstar."
"Yeah, but by trading away JV, they got Adams plus:  * Move up from 17th to 10th * Move up from 51st to 40th * 2022 first round pick * Patrick Beverley * Rajon Rondo * Daniel Oturu (prospect)  Which helps fill out their depth a bit and starts getting them up above the cap so they can eventually trade for larger salary contracts to pair with their young stars (if they want to go that route)."

Patrick Beverley proclaiming that the next 5 years were his was pretty bad..

“Who stabbed Patrick Beverley”
Patrick Beverley is underrated as a basketball player because people don't like him as a person. Bring it on.
So how many more years belong to Patrick Beverley after this?
patrick beverley
I like Patrick Beverley
"I would enjoy Patrick Beverley injuries way more, but he just plays way more than Street Clothes."
Patrick Beverley doing a dance about Chris Paul’s weird flop got us here
"Every playoffs series that involves Patrick Beverley usually goes like this :  \- ""Oh look he's playing super hard he's bothering the opposing star"" - Game 1  \- ""Oh man Pat Bev has fouled out that's a problem"" - Game 2  \- ""Oh it's weird Pat Bev does an awesome job but the star is having better numbers than his usual numbers"" Game 4  \- ""bench Pat Bev, other defenders (Ariza, Gordon, George, Kawhi, Mann....) are doing a better job on the star actually"" end of the series  &amp;#x200B;  Kudos to him tho, this wasn't the case against the Suns he was very good against Booker"
Never had to play a team as bad as the pacers? He had steph Klay and Dray and got taken to 6 by Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams lmao
Not really. They traded Covington for a guy in legal trouble and made some bad draft picks. They just traded a lottery pick for Patrick Beverley.
"If there is a trade, the package would most likely be something like  Ben Simmons to Timberwolves  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, and either Patrick Beverley or Taurean Prince, and 2-3 first round picks (with some initial protections) to Sixers  Salaries match. No way Sixers do this unless they are desperate. I don’t think Sixers are that desperate. I think they are actually hopeful to give Maxes/Thybulle/Reed some of Simmons playing time to see how they do, even if he sits out."
"“Hey Morey, how about you step Ben over here for Patrick Beverley and a first”"
Also Patrick Beverley vs Beverly
"&gt;	Five years later, when Paul forced his way to Houston, Morey merely surrendered Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverley and a future first-round pick.  the author should learn what a free agent is"
KD warriors got taken to 6 by Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams    Dang it’s almost like it doesn’t mean Jack shit
is that patrick beverley running at draymond green? yea i’d rather him pass it out to an open ariza tf
Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley
Can Patrick Beverley guard Jayson Tatum?   He did a pretty good job on Devin Booker.
"Russ was an absolute iron man before Bev dove at his knee and took him out of the playoffs, which by the way in addition to the 3 knee surgeries it required and the future constant injury problems, that KD-Russ team seemed destined to march to the Finals, which obviously ended when Patrick Beverley performed that dirty move.  I’d hate him too if I was Westbrook."
Marcus Smart is the version of Patrick Beverley I respect. 👍
Preach.  I’ve got Chris Paul and Patrick Beverley as 1A and 1B on my list of players I can’t wait to see retire ringless
The next five years are mine- patrick beverley
"Lonzo Ball? James Harden? Marcus Smart? Patrick Beverley? PG is the weakest position defensively but ""no PGs play defense"" is ridiculous lol"
"It’s more about his position and size   If he was at least 6’6, yeah sure.   He’s not.   But also fuck Patrick Beverley."
Why are you arguing against a [literal fact](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/02/27/steven-adams-named-one-of-the-9-dirtiest-players-in-nba-by-complex/) by bringing up Patrick Beverley to a LAKERS FAN
[he denied saying it](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/08/23/patrick-beverley-denies-telling-stephen-curry-the-next-five-years-are-mine/)
"You are gonna be insanely dissapointed when the trade is Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and 2 firsts"
Double figures??? Fucking Covington or Patrick Beverley have probably scored in double figures at one point in their . Who cares
"Chris Paul  Smart/Schroder  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons   Kyle Lowry  Harden (or Kyrie)  Lonzo  Conley  Dejounte Murray  Devonte' Graham  Jamal Murray  Patrick Beverley  Brogdon  Rubio  Terry Rozier (or LaMelo)  Lillard  Westbrook  Luka  Sexton  who here is Curry objectively a better defender than?  because if he's not better than at least 4 or 5 of them, he is below average.  that is how average works lol"
"Patrick Beverley and Chandler Parsons switching in Game 6 2014 vs Portland, which allowed Dame to get free and hit the series-winning three."
"I think after 2012 it was pure jealousy and being mad at dudes who were all in on the Lakers in 09 wearing Clippers shit. Then I hated Patrick Beverley, obviously. Now I just hurt when Paul George was supposed to be a Laker.  All that said I just want to watch local games on local channels holy fuck."
"Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and Jaden McDaniels are worthless?   Okay chief ✌"
"Russell Westbrook: Patrick Beverley 'Running Around, Doing Nothing' on Defense. ... ""Pat Bev trick y'all, man, like he playing defense,"" Westbrook said of Beverley while noting Houston's James Harden dropped 47 on the Clippers in a 102-93 victory. ""He don't guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing."""
Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley.   &gt;!Sike! fuck Patrick Beverley!&lt;
Patrick Beverley. I thought it was like getting Bill Laimbeer but he's awesome. Just from his attitude alone. And he may never even play a game for us!
PATRICK BEVERLEY WOKE UP FEELING DANGEROUS 😳😳😳😳  2 pts💦💦💦  3 turnovers💯💯💯  0 brushed teeth😈😈😈  Plus/Minus -19🐐🐐🐐
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"No, they wouldn’t. The rumors are that the Timberwolves are offering draft picks, Malik Beasley ($14 M), Jaden McDaniels ($2 M), Naz Reid ($1.7 M), and one of Patrick Beverley ($14.3 M) or Taureen Prince ($13 M). Those contracts combined match Simmons’s contract of $33 M.   Neither of those trades can be completed today though, so we don’t know if the 76ers would accept that offer. Taureen Prince can’t be traded till September 27th and Patrick Beverly can’t be traded till October. As a result, we won’t see any deal accepted until then at the earliest."
Fair 😂  Until you guys swooped in for Nance the Wolves and Blazers were fighting for most uninspiring offseason. At least you've got *something* to point to this offseason to be encouraged by now.   If the Wolves don't get Simmons their biggest acquisition is a fight between Patrick Beverley or Taurean Prince.
Fuck Patrick Beverley
PG: Patrick Beverley  SG: Kevin Porter Jr  SF: Marcus Morris  PF: Jae Crowder  C: Bobby Portis
"4 Team Trade  Minnesota Out: Malik Beasley, Beverley, McDaniels, three 1st round picks  Minnesota In: Ben Simmons   Sixers Out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: CJ McCollum, McDaniels, 1x Timberwolves 1st round pick  Blazers Out: CJ McCollum  Blazers In: Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons Out: Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons In: Patrick Beverley, 2x Timberwolves first round picks"
What about Malik Beasley + Patrick Beverley + picks. I didnt realize this but Beasley averaged 19 pts with good efficiency this season
"I'll start,  Philly:  Malik Beasley   Wolves 1st 2024  Collin Sexton  Ricky Rubio  Cavaliers:  Jaden McDaniels  Patrick Beverley   Philly 1st 2022  Wolves 1st 2022  Minnesota  Ben Simmons"
Fuck Patrick Beverley
Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * McDaniels  * Prince  * Maxey  * 2 Wolves 1sts  * 2 Sixers 1sts
"With the additions of Patrick Beverley and potentially this dipshit, Minnesota's deservedly gettin all the hate."
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman

"&gt; Hasn't regressed on defense or as a passer/playmaker. Just lost faith in his shot. &gt;  &gt;   His AST per 36 has regressed from 8.7 in 17-18 to 8.1 in 18-20 to 7.7 in 20-21. His Defensive Win Shares has regressed from 5.0 in 17-18 to 3.3 in 20-21. His VORP has dropped from 4.5 to 3.8 to 2.8 to 2.2.  &gt;Same guy who is only 25!!, elite on the fast break, elite defending the wing, a great passer, and who scores 15 ppg despite a clear mental block. literally all he would need to be effective in the playoffs is getting ft's up to 60% and building confidence.  And has a reputation for putting in as little work in as possible. Plus, wing defense is overrated; it's better to have a great defender who can score than a shut-down defender who can't, because there isn't a single ""shut-down"" defender who can actually shut down a superstar scorer.  &gt;Identify the player Phi could acquire who would be better than Simmons (since you are trading away potential/youth/team control) and the picks that would accompany him.  Patrick Beverley and Robert Covington would be better for the 76ers than Simmons by virtue of taking up less of the salary cap, while providing defense and scoring. Even Danny Green, washed as he is, would probably be better value for the 76ers.  &gt;If the answer is no one, then it's a terrible trade.  Yeah, it's a terrible trade both ways. Simmons costs to much for what he is and does, and there's no way the 76ers will be able to get what they believe to be commiserate value because others teams simply don't think Simmons is worth what they're asking.  To put it another way: Simmons is like a very beautiful woman who you've married in Vegas after getting really drunk, except when you actually get to know her, you discover she's vapid, a persecution complex, complains to the manager of every business she walks into, and has a Hitler tramp stamp. And all of this ends up on display because she makes enough of a scene to be on the local news.  You might be into her for how good she looks and her potential to become a good person once you fix her, but most people are going to look at her and think she's not worth the trouble."
"Maybe not, but he can lock up the opposing teams best guard in a way that Rondo even in his prime couldn't manage. Clippers didn't need another playmaker/ball handler like the Lakers did. We needed a stout defender who could hit 3's.   (all following quotes come from this Sports Illustrated article - https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/how-patrick-beverley-silenced-doubters)  &gt; Pat Bev answered the call. In the 45 possessions that Beverley guarded Mitchell in the playoffs, Spida scored just 10 points on 23% from the field, turned the ball over 4 times, and was blocked 5 times. In the 72 minutes that Mitchell and Beverley shared the court, the Clippers were a +29.  &gt; Coming into the WCF, Devin Booker was averaging nearly 30 PPG in the previous two rounds. His dominance helped Phoenix eliminate the defending champs in the opening round, and sweep the MVP in round two  &gt; After Booker put up a 40-point triple double in game one of the WCF, Ty Lue inserted Patrick Beverley into the starting lineup for the remainder of the series. While the Clippers were unable to overcome the loss of Kawhi Leonard, Ivica Zubac, and Serge Ibaka, Pat Bev had Booker locked up. In the 110 possessions that Pat Bev guarded Booker, D-Book shot just 28% from the field, turned the ball over 7 times, and did not make a single three-point basket.  So, again, currently they are pretty even they just have different skillsets"
Almost as good as Grizzlies legend Patrick Beverley lol
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
"Asterisk reason: Reigning 2012 Western Conference champs traded away future MVP James Harden before the season and lost Russell Westbrook to injury when Patrick Beverley needlessly collided with him in the first round of the playoffs, paving the way for the Heat to repeat. Invalid."
"Age is one of the big factors, but there are other factors. For example Davion Mitchell is considered a low ceiling but high floor type of player. He’s relatively older in age, but he’s NBA ready from his college success. He also has a high floor due to his defense which keeps him on NBA rosters (at worst he could be like Patrick Beverley which is pretty good floor). A player like Kumimga is one of the youngest players in the draft but his athleticism and flashes he has displayed at his young age gives him a higher ceiling. His floor is way lower because he’s just not as good of a player as Mitchell right now, and there’s nothing that guarantees he will be better."
"The fans and media drive player beefs harder than anything the players themselves do. I can imagine a lot of players hating someone like Patrick Beverley, but quiet guys like Giannis and Harden I don't think have any hatred whatsoever. It's just competition."
"Hakeem has more all time rebounds than Rodman and Barkley in the same era. Dwight also has more rebounds than Rodman and Barkley, but in a different era. Obviously Hakeem had the height on them but I think there's room for him in there. Russell also belongs on all time defense. Heart isn't really quantitative but as much as everyone hates him, I'd put Patrick Beverley. This is probably me being a homer, but I'd also put Hakeem in scoring based on what he did to top tier big men in the playoffs. I think Rondo deserves a spot on BBIQ."
You forgot Patrick Beverley along with these greats.
Jrue Holiday  Marcus Smart     Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley  Bruce Bowen  Gary Payton
People aren’t fans of Westbrook or Patrick Beverley for their shooting efficiency.
so Patrick Beverley  just kidding
Patrick Beverley but shit
"You can't ""cancel"" a NBA player lol, their income isn't based on popularity  Source: Grayson Allen, Patrick Beverley, etc."
The lack of Patrick Beverley is disturbing to me. Smh

"You said, “That’s even worse, didn’t know he was so thin &amp; his reach is only 1” longer than PB, technically he’s smaller. Thin players like that get bulldozed by the slightest hip or shoulder, they get eaten up in the modern NBA”  Since you talked about his size and frame I took it as you talking about his entire career. I’ll drop it if that’s not what you meant.   Payton was defending PG, SG, and SF when he was playing. He won DPOY for a reason dude. He was strong as fuck and had quick hands. His defensive IQ is rivaled by few.   I highly doubt you’ve been watching the NBA for that long. Let’s do a quick math problem. 20 years ago was 2001. You said you’ve been watching the NBA for “20 + years” so I’m going off of 20 as a minimum. 20 years ago was 2001, Gary Payton was still a great player in 2001. He averaged 23/4/8 that year. If you were watching basketball at a minimum of 20 years ago you would have known he was an all star that year and one of the best defenders in the league. You would have known he was a big point guard for his era and this era. You would have known he wasn’t the same height as Patrick Beverley.   Just off of that alone I can doubt you’ve been watching the NBA for “20+ years”"
"This is wrong lol. Gary Payton is listed as 6’4” and Patrick Beverley is listed as 6’1”. Your statement starts off with a lie that is easy to disprove.   This is about perimeter defense so versatility has nothing to do with it.   Congrats on watching Patrick Beverley but have you ever watched Gary Payton? I have. He won DPOY for a reason. And again, he’s bigger then Patrick lol.   Dude do some research before you post"
Patrick Beverley is exactly what the Knicks need. A 3nD PG who would let someone like Julius Randle hold the ball most of the time.   When Kemba Walker’s knees crumble into dust 9 minutes into the season you should take a moment to think about it.
"Man literally yelled at Chase Centre staff and people on here be like, “r/nba always make up how petty Patrick Beverley is.”"
"https://sports.yahoo.com/clippers-introduce-warriors-to-new-reality-in-chase-center-regularseason-opener-142914327.html  &gt; In the Clippers’ locker room, Patrick Beverley was having some fun with some of the arena staff workers who help tidy up the facility. “Y’all a little different without KD, I see,” Beverley playfully jabbed. “Uh-huh, y’all cheated long enough.

You're being downvoted because you're Patrick Beverley.
Just seems pretty embarrassing to talk shit about someones 3pt shooting when they shot 7-14 from 3 on you and you shot 1-9 on them lol. Using Tatum and Brown to proxy shit talk while you do nothing is like Patrick Beverley shit and we all know Patrick Beverley shit is cringe
Patrick Beverley has a Hey Arnold style shrine in his closet dedicated to Bruce Bowen
bro was really dumb on his reply lmao. Patrick beverley is enough for a voice. Kawhi will take them to another level
Things like this is why you need an enforcer.  If Steven Adams was still on the Thunder he'd be doing to Embiid what he did to Patrick Beverley.
That other 40% is Patrick Beverley.
Fucking Patrick Beverley diving into Westbrook type of shit. Only Embiid weighs 50% more.

I love me some Patrick Beverley!
Man I love Patrick Beverley
I blame Patrick Beverley.
"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
they already have a bunch of rotation guys.... what they need is a ballhandler and preferably a ballhandler that can shoot and play defense.. trading ben for like buddy hield or patrick beverley is just a total waste... ben in sweats is worth more than that...
well they're trying to wait and attempt to realize their value but everyone seems to think that selling low at penny's on the dollar is the right move and that patrick beverley will help get them to the ECF...   that move DEFINITELY doesn't move the needle.. so they'd rather wait until ben changes his mind in that case...
i mean also trading him for pennies on the dollar is DEFINITELY wasting embiid's prime...   if ben ever shows up and does what he did last year.. it's a pretty good team... whatever low chance of that happening is... it's greater than the chance that patrick beverley leads them to the title...
Patrick Beverley
Obligatory fuck Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley and Cancun
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."
"Lavine was a tiny fraction of what he is now in Minnesota. You’re purely speculating that his time there played any role in what he became.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt regarding Lavines playmaking but that’s probably the worst aspect of his game outside of his defence so it doesn’t influence how good he is for the most part. His playmaking is also largely just passing out of doubles.  The issue is basically every athletic fringe rotational player is a good defender. Defence is largely based on effort and players who are fighting for minutes will often provide the most effort. What makes defenders stand out is impact and okogie is not an impactful defender. Wings and guards are less impactful as is, so you generally have to be like an all defence guy, or have some offence too.  Fair point with wiggins, I thought I saw him in your list of names.  Your last point however is complete nonsense. For starters i wouldn’t consider him a quality player. I’d consider him a 9th man on most teams. I’d just consider him better than Jabari Parker. Denver traded him along with Malik Beasley, by your logic Malik was nothing resembling a quality player. Minnesota didn’t keep him cause they got Patrick Beverley who is much better and a perfect fit for the team in every way. Memphis traded him cause they have a log jam at his position and got a second or 2 for him. And I have nothing against the Wolves. In fact this year I’m one of the highest on them, and think they have a legit shot at a lower playoff seed. I’ve also been an avid defender of them when people talk about how they should be relocated, or how KAT should demand a trade. It’s just a fact that more often than not their player development is very lacklustre and that a player shouldn’t be completely written off based on how they played in those conditions"
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
That highlight when he toasted Patrick Beverley then hit the falling three over Paul George in the clutch was absolutely sick. Just two All-NBA level defenders both trying to stop him and he just cooked them. Shame he's such a douche because I really want to root for him. Even before he was on the Nets.
"Patrick Beverley has been a godsend for the Wolves. Dude holds guys accountable on defense and everyone seems to be responding well to it, especially Anthony Edwards."
"There aren’t many. The issue, as you mention, is most PGs do more than 3 and D. But Patrick Beverley probably fits your answer. He’s like a career 38% 3 point shooter and his main job on offense is to be a spot up shooter. And obviously on defense he’s pretty good. But in order for him to play (and really any 3&amp;D PG to get useful minutes), he has to be paired up with a combo guard or a forward who can be a playmaker."
Patrick Beverley ending up on the Nets somehow.  Purely for the salt and for a new spin on the next-five-years memes.
Trade for Patrick Beverley
"https://www.twincities.com/2021/09/30/veteran-guard-patrick-beverley-landed-right-where-he-wanted-to-be-with-the-timberwolves/ Pat Bev said here he knew he was going to the TWolves weeks before it was announced. Grizz never traded for him, they were just a part of the deal to get him there. And they off of Bledsoe's contract and can take a chance on a top 6 pick, while getting better financial flexibility. So all in all I think it was a pretty good deal by the Grizz.  But yeah, Grizz are clearly not in a championship or bust, win now mode. I just think it it's incorrect to say they aren't trying to compete. The core of the rotation just made the playoffs as the second youngest roster in the NBA. Trading JV/Allen and taking on contracts makes more sense when you look at the roster construction/salary cap situation.    Some of the moves could backfire on them but the core of the team is still intact and set to compete both now and in the future."
Bro I'd take Patrick Beverley over Kyrie
"'Patrick Beverley points gun at janitors, forces them to reveal the location of Steph Curry's house'  Shit was getting twisted so hard"
We made “Patrick Beverley jokes with janitors” into a story.
cap draymond is a dirty player just like patrick beverley but draymond doesnt get any heat for it because he made a couple all star games a few years ago
My team: Klay Thompson  other teams:  Clippers: Scottie Pippen or healthy Kawhi  Bucks: Patrick Beverley or Zaza Pachulia   Nets: Some 3rd stringer from 1948
Patrick Beverley as defensive PG and emotional leader
"&gt; 3rd stringers and G League players   Lmao yes Patrick Beverley, Ariza , Dwight, Capela, Eric Gordon, Lou etc all such bums. Harden had some of the best role players to complement his play style. When did narrative start that he had bad teams? After he kept underperforming over and over again?"
Patrick Beverley should be on that team.
"Fuck Patrick Beverley but it's the Thunder's own fault. Had they nog traded Harden, then the Rockets never make the playoffs and Westbrook never gets injured."
"Yeah people on this sub think Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, and 3 protected firsts are enough to make us contenders. The Sixers' goal should be to hope we can float in the 4-6 seed range while Ben sits, and then that some team gets desperate enough to talk. If the goal is to win a ring for Embiid, selling low on our only asset is not gonna help."
"you all were [actually one of the healthiest teams in the NBA](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNBA/status/1390054193294159874?s=20) and just massively underperformed relative to number of games missed but not that it mattered at all   a healthy wolves with Dlo, Ant, and KAT got taken out behind the woodshed and shot by a Pacers team led by Tj McConnell and missing Sabonis, Turner, Warren, and Brogdon  there isn't really a single PF on the roster, they have zero defensive identity or really any net positive defensive players, and i dont see how adding patrick beverley and taurean prince (seriously wtf?) is going to add 10 wins to this roster."
Patrick Beverley. Only thing he does is run around doing nothing
"Two answers:  1) I see the Bulls flair; if you’re from Chicago, maybe you’ll understand this: it’d be like the North Side was when the White Sox won the World Series.   2) During Woj pod from All-Star 2020, Woj asked Pat Bev a variation on this question. Beverley replied that he’d probably get booed at his own parade[link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-beverley-jackie-macmullan-and-ryen-russillo/id1470466331?i=1000465702265)."
"For the sake of chaos, I wonder what Patrick Beverley would do."
Embiid after all they get for Simmons is Malik Beasley and Patrick Beverley
"Patrick Beverley(will probably be downvoted by okc fans, and that’s fine)  Fair: he plays a bit rough and isn’t careful. Also he shoved cp3 like a bitch.   Unfair: holy shit there’s a lot. that he’s this particularly dirty player who intentionally tries to injure people. He’s no dirtier than a player like Joe Ingles. Hell, I’d say  Jae crowder is the *much* dirtier player who intentionally tries to injure people. Jae crowder intentionally poked pg in the eye in the playoffs, was called out by the lakers in round one,  and took swipes at people’s knees after flopping to the floor in every play. It wasn’t really close. Beverley and Booker bonked heads and articles wrote that Beverley headbutt him. It’s insane.   Even the Russ injury, Russ made the same dive for the ball earlier in the game where he got injured. And Beverley, on every replay is clearly going for the ball."
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
First we'll learn that Patrick Beverley will get traded for his long lost twin brother Roderick Beverley.
"Timberwolves get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and Markelle Fultz  Magic get: Patrick Beverley and Jaylen Nowell  I am not even going to pretend I’ve watched half these players and just matched money for “lol Fultz back to 76ers”  Who even would win this trade?"
Patrick Beverley was born in Chicago...
Patrick Beverley
"P.J Tucker, Alex Caruso, Mikal Bridges, Patrick Beverley, Myles Turner"
"Patrick Beverley, Taurean Prince, a couple filler players, 2022 MIN 1st (unprot), 2024 MIN 1st (minimal protection), and either 2026 MIN 1st or Jaden McDaniels. Maybe throw in an additional pick swap in the distant future. It probably becomes a bigger trade that moves a pick or two for some immediate help to Philly."
"Crazy how people think they are still getting a star when his value tanks daily  They are ultimately gonna end up with a package of Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and 2 first round picks"
Patrick Beverley
Depends if the only other offers center around Patrick Beverley and Buddy Hield
"Malik Beasley,Patrick Beverley and a 1st round pick  Its happening"
It’s Patrick Beverley. Fuck that shit he did to Westbrook
"💀 worst player I’ve ever watched. Cannot believe we got Patrick Beverley who’s been a god send for us, for Jarrett culver. He gets no minutes in Memphis."
"Dwight Howard, Clint Capella, Josh Smith, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza is by himself?"
He has a career 39 FG% on extremely low volume while being fed by the mvp.  That is horrendous  Facu is like if someone took Patrick Beverley and just made him 20% worse at everything
"It's weird that the guy who constantly swings wildly at people with no regard for what he hits when whining for fouls isn't know for being dirty...  I guess slapping Patrick Beverley, throwing am elbow at Meyers Leonard, slapping Cameron Payne, shoulder barging Enes Kanter when he had a separated shoulder, shoulder barging Markieff Morris doesn't count. Sure as shit makes for a longer video than Isaiah Stewart who's been branded dirty already by some."
"Nah, Patrick Beverley is still playing as well as he ever did."
And Patrick Beverley out there doing nothing?
Isn't that Patrick Beverley?
If Patrick Beverley was on this team I'd seriously consider changing allegiances. Fuck Patrick Beverley.
"Trae is catching up, no doubt.  Trae also plays for a quite superior team. I'm a clipper fan so I've watched a lot of doncic in the postseason. Dude does stuff that Trae cannot, with all due respect. I remember him killing Patrick Beverley and then zubacs in a game.   Massacring blitzes and double teams like an adult playing amongst kids.  Hunting switches, destroying perimeter AND post defenders within minutes. If they hadn't switched kawhi and PG on him clippers might have lost this year's series.  Trae was exceptional especially against Knicks and PHilly. But I don't think he has the same impact if he faces clippers. And of course being that small has its downsides.  Trae is a superb playmaker and scorer. But I'd still take over ten players ahead of him and at least three or four guard. I can't take ten players over doncic. Maybe seven or eight."
I think Pat Bev's out at least [two weeks](https://hoopshype.com/2021/11/26/patrick-beverley-out-at-least-two-weeks/)
"According to NBA defensive ratings #2 is Patrick Beverley, D'Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and KAT"
1) Karl-Anthony “Big Purr” Towns 2) Jarred “First Team” Vanderbilt  3) Anthony “Da One Jack 🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️” Edwards  4) D’Angelo “DPOY” Russell 5) Patrick “GRIT AND GRIND LETS GO 🏀🏀” Beverley  In no particular order
"I think the only question then is who on the T'Wolves should be in the discussion? Their main plus defenders have been Patrick Beverley, Josh Okogie, and Jarred Vanderbilt.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*50:PLAYER_LAST_TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*min"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
"Yup, that's what haunted him the most for most of his Rockets career. Sure he had Dwight, but after Dwight left only Patrick Beverley could handle the ball and he was dog shit.  It's why Harden was so fucking good when they got CP3. He was finally able to get shit done."
"monstars?  patrick beverley, dillon brooks, pj tucker, the morris brothers, bol bol  players who play hard and generally resemble monsters, and then a goofy ass tall dude"
"That wasn't his point. It's like when Ben Wallace was suspended for five games for pushing Ron Artest in the beginning of malice in the palace. That isolated act of Ben pushing Ron isn’t really five game suspension worthy, but because chaos erupted afterwords he got a steeper punishment. Even though Ben couldn't control the guy in the crowd acting crazy or Ron Artest acting crazy and everything else that happened afterwards. So if LeBron popped Isaiah in the mouth the way that he did and then immediately tried to apologized, from there it seems like whether he is suspended or not is completely up to isaiah's reaction.        Here's another example. When Patrick Beverley pushed Chris Paul in the playoffs last season, he was suspended one game. But he probably would've been suspended more games if after the push, Chris Paul jumped up and started grabbing chairs and flinging them and then that would lead to even more chaos that the NBA would feel that Patrick Beverly is still responsible for. Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but I think that that's the argument that he's talking about."
"Patrick Beverley is proving this year that Jimmy Butler is a selfish, overrated loser that couldn't lead a horse to water. I hope he never makes it out of the first round again."
This is probably an unpopular opinion but this is all largely just goonish behavior and the people hyping him up as “he’s just tough blue collar and plays hard the right way!!” are the same types of people who used to say things like this about Patrick Beverley 5 years ago. Not saying he’s gonna go charging at Westbrook’s knees also but the point is obvious dude just acts like a clown in spots like this and fans eat it up and hype it up like “he wanted that smoke!!”.
Patrick Beverley talked a whole lotta shit only to end up in Minnesota. Makes me laugh
"My petty statement is that Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, and Patrick Beverley are all assholes, and each one of them deserves to be jumped by the other two."
"Well, I'm gonna backtrack and won't say literally no person on the planet thought that. It's just that Patrick Beverley will always be dirty player no.1 regardless of his defensive expertise."
fr if it was patrick beverley people would call for his head
if it was Patrick Beverley definitely
"according to Kendrick Perkins, Udonis Haslem, James Johnson, PATRICK BEVERLEY, Montrezl Harrell and Pops Junior Tucker"
That's Patrick Beverley you're thinking about. Besides he hit him in the eye which could have blinded him
"Patrick Beverley, with Kawhi/PG courage: ""the next 5 years are mine"" lmaooooo"
And we’re chalking that all up to Patrick Beverley?
Imagine trading Patrick Beverley
The next 5 years belong to Patrick Beverley.
We have Patrick Beverley
I'm guessing because Patrick Beverley is the one who deliberately injured another player so severely it cost him a year of his career and will cause him pain and other issues for the rest of his life.  And has tried to do it to others.

"I dont think that's the case  I can still remember when Kawhi was drafted, everyone thought Kawhi's would only be good on defense, but mediocre on everything else. Kinda like Patrick Beverley, but taller  The Pacers was actually the one who drafted him. They traded him before his first game. Apparently, Pop really liked him so the Spurs agreed to Send George Hill to the Pacers in exchange for Kawhi + picks"
Patrick Beverley approves[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqlf_nazW6g)
"Yea man you don’t actually like, know my team. Let me help you out.  Jae’Sean Tate is a bonafide hustler. Any team would love to have him. He never stops. He’s like Patrick Beverley with more overall talent and capabilities. He is far from trash so your statement alone is not only unwarranted, it’s amateur.  What you have is a group of guys with little chemistry, and inexperience. Kevin Porter JR is playing PG, which is new to him. He’s learning to keep his dribble going. He’s used to catching a pass, making a move, and either scoring or dishing out. But now he’s in control of the offense. That’s a huge brain switch for any player at any level. He scored 50 pts in a game when Wall was still playing. He’s very capable, just needs time. And he shoots under 12 shots a game…not a chucker in the slightest.  Jalen Green is the rook. But man his ceiling is HIGH. I’m not trying to compare him to the other rookies. He’s Jalen. He’s gonna be a pure star in this league.   Imo - sengun has the higher upside and more IQ than Wood. Wood is a very good complimentary player. He’s not a KAT like coach thinks he is."
I'm still surprised by the Patrick Beverley trade. Thought he was gonna remain a Clipper for much longer
"You pay for a ticket, the players may or may not end up in the stands.  In this case, the child has to accept the consequences that Draymond Green or Patrick Beverley may come in their direction.  **COURTSIDE ACTION**"
"""He's Kevin Durant. You know who he is. We tried I promise we did"" - Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley.  I believe the lesson learned is they know who KD is now.    That or the power of friendship?"
This is who Patrick Beverley thinks he is.
It wasn't until the game was way out of reach but at one point Patrick Beverley had more points (11) than Westbrook and Westbrook had more turnovers (5) than rebounds or assists.
Can’t watch the game. Just here to say fuck Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley!! 2020 NBA cha— oops
"Here is the trade in question:  &gt;**Boston Celtics** receive: Karl-Anthony Towns  &gt;**Philadelphia 76ers** receive: Jaylen Brown and Patrick Beverley  &gt;**Minnesota Timberwolves** receive: Ben Simmons, Robert Williams III, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden Springer and 2022 first-round pick (from PHI)"
"You're really underselling Chris Paul. He's not some under the radar scrappy veteran, he's one of the absolute greatest players in the history of the sport. He made an All NBA 2nd team the season before getting to Phoenix and another one with Phoenix. Who exactly do you propose Minnesota should get in that vein? And didn't they just get the quintessential player you're describing in Patrick Beverley?"

The Patrick Beverley special.
"We definitely could have beat GSW their first championship year.  Didn't have Patrick Beverley, didn't have DMo who was our second best player for that season with Dwight injured. Even still first two games came down to the final shot. Unfortunately missed both those shots and rest is history."
Patrick Beverley hit CP3 harder after a game was over. Morris is a straight up bitch. I hate that dude.
"I never said that I think Jokic *should* get more games, I just think that he will. His push was after the dead ball, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the league punish that kind of action harder than a play that happened during a live ball that the Heat could argue was just a hard foul. Personally, I think you should put both of them out for a similar time, but I am just expecting Jokic to get at least one game longer than Morris.  However, as somebody else pointed out in response to my comments, Patrick Beverley was only suspended one game after he pushed Chris Paul in the back during the playoffs last post season, so they could both realistically just get one game since there is some recent precedence to this sort of thing."
Patrick Beverley.
Tell that to Patrick Beverley
"I was at the game. The craziest part was that Morris dropped and was down for at least 5 minutes. They didn't show the replay so ay Ball so there was no way to tell what sort of injury he might have sustained. Legit thought it might be a Tomjanovich/Kermit Washington situation and that Joker might be gone for the season (or longer) - especially when they had a stretcher out there. Then Morris gets up and walks off after that? Saw the replay when I got home. What a fucking punk. In my book, that guy just surpassed Patrick Beverley as the biggest asshole in the league, which is no small feat."
Patrick Beverley pushed Chris Paul harder than that and he was fine. Paul's head whiplashed way more than Morris and Paul didn't flop as much surprisingly.
The overreaction was how this sub reacted to Patrick Beverley but now are turning a blind eye to Jokic
Who the hell got blocked by Patrick Beverley
He wasn't that efficient from 2 and definitely couldn't shoot 3s. He also doesn't have the best vision and has issues making accurate passes. If he didn't have such problems on offense he definitely could have gotten minutes like a Avery Bradley or Patrick Beverley
Steph Curry and Patrick Beverly are [apparently close friends.](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/11/clippers-patrick-beverley-says-steph-curry-is-like-a-brother/)
"Not particularly. A lot them can be written off with the fact that our shooting guard is leading the league in true scoring rather than a debate on Ben’s value.  Brogdon and LaVert was actually interesting but is less exciting since both of them have been out and Maxey has been way better than I expected. Also Brogdon can’t be traded any more so it’s kinda moot.   I’m not saying that we’re never trading Ben, but rather that these trades aren’t moving any needles and a lot of the other trades are just not providing value, the Timberwolves’ Patrick Beverley offer isn’t a problem because of him, it’s because the rest is literally salary matching filler that probably wouldn’t make our roster, though if we think we’re a point guard away from winning we can still make that tier trade later."

*Patrick Beverley embarrasses Patrick Beverley
"like Patrick Beverley, but better"
"I can’t find any links, but the NBA roast threads where various /r/nba users would write diss tracks about them. There was one for Patrick Beverley, LeBron and I think Chris Paul."
"And I think he's not even that good of a defender as well. Undersized, he gets beaten off the dibble consistently, also gets beaten consistently in the post, etc.. he is great at dodging screens and flopping, but on everything else he is just good, nothing amazing or anything that could justify his salary and heavy minutes. He is a expensive Patrick Beverley"
what team does Patrick Beverley play for by chance..?
"Fuck Patrick Beverley, dirty ass playing rugby out there on the court."
Can't take you seriously when those are the players you list and not Patrick Beverley.
kelly olynyk is a taller patrick beverley lol
Caruso is what Patrick Beverley thinks he is. Minus the being dirty.
"\-BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,👀👀  \- Pat Bev...I had NO PROBLEM with Pat Bev...I had no problem with Patrick Beverley -  Luka Doncic"
"Well, at least the [next 3.5 years are his](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-patrick-beverley-told-steph-curry-next-five-years-are-mine)."
How is Patrick Beverley still in the nba
"Patrick Beverley is awful. Marcus Morris has also been shit. I have no idea why Ibaka barely played. One of PG or Kawhi will have to play Luka the entire game, they gave up switches way too easy. One of their problems  is that Kawhi cannot carry that offensive and defensive load anymore so everyone else really has to step up."
Patrick Beverley trick y’all man
The hype was Patrick Beverley who has *check notes * nothing of note declaring he’s on the dream team. If you like football it’s like Vince young declaring the eagles were the dream team.
"""*I told y'all.*"" - Patrick Beverley"
Patrick Beverley got exposed big time this year.
Fuck Patrick Beverley!
"""*How does Patrick Beverley not think that's a foul?*"""
He’s probably now the Argentine Patrick Beverley with better passing
"That’s how I feel with the Clippers. On one hand, Ibaka, on the other, Patrick Beverley."
&gt;Pretty sure Caruso is just white Patrick Beverley.  Nah he can score sometimes.
Imagine white knighting online for Patrick Beverley
"I've said this many times in this sub but Pat Beverley is a bitch and I hope he breaks his legs.  I don't know whether or not him attacking Russ' knee was intentional. It was on a dead ball situation but whatever.  Everybody's got bad moments.  But this bitch has this as a badge of honor, being proud about it all these years later.  Fuck you Patrick Beverley. I hope your career ends terribly, on a wheelchair"
Pretty sure Caruso is just white Patrick Beverley.  He's a nuisance with some defensive highlights off-ball due to effort and positioning. His one on one defense really isn't anything special though
help! Patrick Beverley is in the locker room!
Love it! Fuck Patrick Beverley
Did 6’1 Patrick Beverley just block the 7’3 Porzingas
Patrick Caruso is what Patrick Beverley wants everyone to think he is
Tbh I think he is honestly hyping them up because he wants a good series with no bad blood  Last year he had to deal with the league Chihuahua Patrick Beverley being all sorts of annoying + playing with CJ “zig zag vertebrae” McCollum and Nurkic was still getting back to form  This year it seems like all the teams are genuinely excited for normal playoffs to be back and the Blazers are healthy and didn’t have to fight tooth and nail for 8th seed
Likeable Patrick Beverley
"Curry is bigger than most pgs. He's bigger than Kyrie, Schroder, Conley, Morant, Lillard, Kemba, Rozier, Reggie Jackson/Patrick Beverley etc."
"Patrick Beverley, Deandre Jordan, Chris Kaman, Corey Maggette, Eric Piatkowski, Gary Grant, Norm Nixon, Bill Walton, Randy Smith, Bob Kauffman - 1970-1971 franchise founding Buffalo Braves."
I don’t disagree but I’d still much rather have Paul George guarding Luka Doncic than Marcus Morris or someone like Patrick beverley(not that Bev will this series of course)
Put Kawhi Leonard on him from the first game instead of dicking around and putting Marcus Morris on him for long stretches like he’s done in the past. Don’t have to put Kawhi on him every play of the series and obviously there’s Paul George but at some point if you really believe this just put your best defender on him to start to set the tone early. Kawhi’s offense isn’t going to fall apart because you put him on Luka Doncic for a game to start the series.   Regardless of whether you put PG or Kawhi on him put your best options on him. So much of Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris vs Doncic last year
It was the same thing with Westbrook...until Patrick Beverley.   Fuck Patrick Beverley
This statement is an attempt to paint Solomon Hill as Patrick Beverley.
"Off the top of my head of guys who actually get some minutes: Conley, Garland, Sexton, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Shroder, Conley, Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  And there's a lot more, but i don't want to google it."
"He's gonna have a little chat with  Patrick ""Smell My Hair"" Beverley"
You know the one thing that team is missing? Patrick Beverley.
"So dirty, as a neutral fan for these playoffs (although I'm on suns bandwagon) that move plus the existence of Patrick Beverley makes me want them to lose horribly.  Feel bad for my man Kawhi, and generally feel bad for PG cause he's been playing so well til those last free throws."
Fuck Patrick beverley
"Awww little guy, you pulled what we call a ""Patrick Beverley"".   I'm gonna enjoy reading whatever you reply with after y'all get swept."
Well you are not allowed to be a fan of Patrick Beverley you realize that right?
Dude I love Patrick Beverley. Sure sometimes when you talk shit you end up losing but give me that attitude over being completely passive and not seeming to care.
The way Patrick Beverley walks away pressing a napkin against his forehead..comedic gold.
"I'll probably get downvoted for saying this, but I'm not fond of Patrick Beverley."
"If every play were called to the letter of the law, Patrick Beverley would have more personal fouls than minutes played in his NBA career."
"Here's a link to a thread on it: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/docah3/bleacher_report_report_patrick_beverley_told/  &gt; Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley reportedly told Steph Curry the ""next five years are mine"" in the team's drubbing of the Golden State Warriors last week. Sean Deveney of Heavy reported details of their exchange: ""'You had the last five years,' Beverley told Curry, according to a source. 'The next five years are mine.' To that, Curry laughed and replied, ""Aren't you 31?'""  This was after they signed Kawhi+PG13 and was their first game against the Warriors after that."
"Whenever Patrick Beverley seems to get airtime getting in someone else's face, it tends to backfire on him. When will he learn?"
But I thought the next 5 years belonged to Patrick Beverley 😂😂😂
Fuck Patrick Beverley
"I have a simple rule fix for the NBA. Stop fucking paying attention to Patrick Beverley. You'll cut down on half the reviews. It's always a flop or a foul he committed, saves a shitton of time"
They stopped play for no reason and reviewed it into a foul and then reviewed a play only after Patrick Beverley requested it. By definition more than .2 seconds passed on the clock. Every advantage was given to LAC and it's not even subtle!
FUCK PATRICK BEVERLEY
Patrick Beverley is mean and he’s a bully
Patrick Beverley can suck my ass
Fuck Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley can chug dick
SUCK MY DICK PATRICK BEVERLEY
Patrick Beverley deserves to win this game for his defensive effort alone.   This is arguably one of the best individual defensive games in history of the NBA
They hate Patrick Beverley or they're Suns fans
The fact that there are people out there who like Patrick Beverley shows that mental health services in this country are severely lacking
"Patrick Beverley blatantly fouls booker to poke it out, refs decide to give the suns the ball to keep it simple and not call soft fouls, but when you review this call the foul on Beverley instead of this barely grazing the hand bullshit"
"r/nba will hate to admit this, but Patrick Beverley might have won this game."
Give the man his props. Patrick Beverley  defense has been huge
"I have always thought Patrick Beverley was a bitch ever since June 28th, 2017"
FUCK PATRICK BEVERLEY AND FUCK SCOTT FOSTER
Can we give a little credit to Patrick Beverley?. That face guading of Devin Booker has taken him out of the game

We can't relax like this and get lazy. Giving up rebounds to Patrick Beverley is a surefire way to lose the game.
"Some may call that an ""unnecessary"" foul, but have you considered the fact that Patrick Beverley really likes fouling people?"
"You know how there’s guys that are so good at offense that you wonder how they’re so bad on defense, well Patrick Beverley  is the opposite for me.  How is someone so good at defense and so fucking terrible at offense"
"He's obnoxious as all hell, and generally I think his defense is overrated, but Patrick Beverley is making life very, very difficult for Book right now. I'm impressed."
"Tinkering ty be tinkering  &amp;#x200B;  Clippers starting lineup  Patrick Beverley   Reggie Jackson   Paul George   Marcus Morris   Ivica Zubac"
"That's not all the way fair. Morey only traded for 2 established superstars in his tenure w/the Rox, CP3(awesome) and Russ(not awesome). D12 was a free agent, and Beard wasn't a superstar when we traded for him. So which players did he trade that you cared about so much, and which superstar did you not want?  Unless you're yearning for the days of the post-TMac/Yao era of the treading water Rox, then you can't hate on the Harden trade at all if you even want to count that one. FWIW I loved Scola, Brooks, KMart, Chuck, KLow, Dragic, etc.  1. In order to get CP3, Morey traded Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations. I still adore Pat Bev and Trezz, and I got love for LouWill, but that CP3 trade led to the greatest non-Hakeem led team in franchise history. It's undeniable that trade was amazing, and even if you hate CP3, it was the best move for the team. I cared more about team success at that point than how much I missed Pat Bev and Trezz, and I became a CP3 fan.  2. I agree with you on the Russ trade tho, and I hated it in real time but tried to stay positive. We all saw how that worked out, and I still miss CP3. But that trade was on Frittata and Harden 100%, and I can't be convinced Morey wanted Russ especially at the cost of those picks. It is what it is, but Morey makes moves to get better, and he's generally on point unless the owner is a cheap bastard who takes out $200 million loans at like 35% lmao"
"I mean, Paul George, Patrick Beverley, and Marcus Morris are all on the same team and were last year too when they blew a 3-1.   Welcome to doc rivers land Philly fans"
"Figure out how to get Embiid both Marcus Smart and Patrick Beverley and you will see real quick they don't need a top scoring PG. They just need a guy with heart. But in my example, 2 of the hardest working defensive pain in the ass bulldogs, too."
I pitched for a Tv series after he retires as a cop alongside Kendrick Perkins called Bigman and the Perk with Patrick Beverley playing a drug dealer
"He was talking about Patrick Beverley. The actual quote was ‘Pat Bev trick yall man, like he playing defence […] he just running around, doing nothing."
On sumn real shit ben is just a glorifed patrick beverley
Things I like:   - Ayton playing smart  Things I don't like:  - Patrick Beverley
playoff patrick beverley
i thought he was terrible. he lacks the foot speed &amp; height to give kd any real problems.  pj pulled out his best patrick beverley impression this series
"Patrick Beverley can stop KD more effectively depending on how the refs call it. They called different things after game 2, a.k.a 'you know who I am' moment. Most annoying thing KD faces is lack of space, despite being a 7 footer. Draymond and Iguodala have done decent jobs on KD before 2017."
Nets don't have patrick beverley so thats a big ++ for disliking them less than the Clippers.
Anyone 7 footer that can't hit a hook shot while they're posting up Patrick Beverley doesn't deserve the max lmao. Rudy is an incredible interior defender despite his weaknesses on the perimeter but this dude needs to get something in his bag on the offensive end. Once he can manage to do that and Utah can incorporate him into punishing these small-ball lineups they will see success. Until then he is grossly overpaid and Utah isn't doing shit in the post-season
This one was wild. It seemed like the Clippers hit 20 straight threes. Even Patrick Beverley was out there looking like Ray Allen.
"Patrick Beverley-""The next 5 years are mine"" Sam Presti-""No,the next 6 years are mine"""
I find it hilarious that Patrick Beverley has 7 blocks in 134 mins meanwhile Rudy Gobert has 7 blocks in 256 mins
I’ve always liked PG and I like the clippers because PG is on them  But seeing Patrick Beverley get a ring would make my blood boil
"Mike Breen said ""Even Patrick Beverley is hitting 3's""! lmao"
"Reggie Jackson, Terrance mann, Patrick Beverley, list goes on and on. I'm glad he got paid tho, that franchise never gonna win a ring with him, most annoying fanbase in the world, they even disrespect their own players, said gobert was better than Mitchell lmao"
I want Patrick Beverley to win MVP just to piss these mfs off
Only thing better would be Patrick Beverley hitting the game winner at the buzzer to win the title too
I'm happy as hell that clippers won but daily reminder that Patrick Beverley intentional hurts players and is a piece of shit. One decent game doesn't change that he was unplayable in the mavs series and is a mediocre bench player nowadays. Fuck that clown.
"shoutout Patrick Beverley, man made some clutch buckets near the end there"
Patrick Beverley wasn't kidding when he said the next 5 years were his. Dude balled the FUCK out tonight. Some of those shots were absurd
"I know no ones gonna believe me but I don't care, I know it happened and no one can take that away.  Back when I lived in LA I was at a bar with my family, and Patrick Beverley and his entourage came in and walked past our table on the way to theirs.  I was like ""No way, that's Patrick Beverley, my favorite backup point guard!"" He didn't seem too happy with how I called him ""backup"".  He muttered under his breath something like ""..shoulda started but such-and-such"".  I said ""Sorry man! We love you! Can you take a picture?""  He said he wasn't feeling it and walked away.  Fastforward 3 weeks later, my dad was out of town, and I heard some noise in my parents bedroom.  I went up to see if my mom was okay but before I could walk through the door, Patrick Beverley walks out with the douchiest fucking grin on his face, and just looks at me and says ""Guess I am you're backup daddy now, too"". I started crying and running away, my mom came out with the same shit-eating grin on her face and said ""Sorry son! We love you!"""
Pretty sure I can hate them if they still have dirty boy patrick beverley
Life comes at you fast when Patrick Beverley shoots 75% from 3

Patrick Beverley knocking down those 3s! You love to see it.
PATRICK BEVERLEY THRIVING UNDER PRESSURE RN WTF

PATRICK BEVERLEY WTFF
I can’t believe Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverley are showing out like this
"patrick ""steph curry"" beverley"
PATRICK BEVERLEY
Patrick Beverley is hitting heavily contested 3s now  What the fuck do you do
I would 100% be rooting for the Clippers if it weren’t for Patrick Beverley
Jazz better get their shit together. If I ever see Patrick Beverley holding a championship trophy I'm going to dry heave.
Is anyone in the league less likable than Patrick Beverley?

Patrick Beverley is a Loki variant.
"It’s really sad. I’m a Razorback fan, and I was really surprised when I saw Patrick Beverley pop up in the NBA at all, then actually become relevant. If you had asked me for 50 Arkansas players I thought might cut it as a pro from the decade surrounding his years there, I don’t think I would have put him on the list. He was a pretty good defender, pretty hard worker, and not a complete liability on offense, but that’s all.   He got to the NBA with pure determination and against the odds. So I get why he has a chip on his shoulder. But damn, you gotta draw a line and not just straight up be an asshole. He could’ve been one of those guys you love on your team because he works so hard, but he’s just a dick."
At least Chris Paul didn't have his back turned when Rondo did that. What Beverley did was a whole other level of low. He straight up clobbered a dude from behind simply because he was losing. CP3 didn't even say anything to him. Patrick Beverley is a straight up thin skinned piece of shit.
"This is the salve we needed after our shit luck in the lottery, fuck Patrick Beverley"
Always thought it’d take an alien invasion to unite the world.    Turns out we just needed Patrick Beverley
"Patrick Beverley is the only one who in this era has sincerely tried to end someone’s career through a foul, as far as I’m aware.  He’s the primary reason Westbrook has chronic injury struggles.  He’s basically Bill Laimbeer if Laimbeer yelled at facility staff."
"Patrick Beverley is a scumbag and a coward.     I know, hot take. /s"

Patrick Beverley tricked y’all 🤣
Imagine dying on the hill of defending Patrick Beverley.
"Oh yeah, he shut him all the way the fuck down, Booker only averaged 25.5 for the series, some stellar shutting down done there by Patrick Beverley."
"I literally opened by saying I loathe Patrick Beverley. Come on man, grown ass adults need to be better than that “but he did it first😩 grade school business.”  Two wrongs never have and never will make a right. I’m all for playing physical and even hard fouls going both ways.  That’s a part of the game that I love and it really only comes out in the playoffs but the flopping and whistle baiting BS needs to be stopped by all the players. It’s pathetic and I for one can’t wait till next season when players start getting called for offensive fouls for some of that BS. Again, I am a big CP3 fan. Ever since Steve Nash retired he has taken the throne as my favorite point guard in the league, doesn’t mean I can’t take issue with a part of his game that pissed me off when I see it out of any hooper. Can’t stand it when Lebron does it, can’t stand it when James harden does it, can’t stand it when anyone does it. For the record I respect and love Chris Paul and Lebron James but just not that part of their game in the past couple years. Harden made it seem like a good idea with how often it has gotten him free points at the line but even the refs/league are starting to realize it’s bad for the game. It’s a weak ass way to play the game. These guys are too amazing to resort to that stuff. It’s part of why so many old heads complain about the game being too soft these days. Pat Bev is one of my most hated players in the league because he regularly does this kind of bitch made shit."
"There is no place for things like this in modern NBA. If you can't contain your emotions then don't play. Stay at home or find another job. You're not a kid from high school, you're an adult, a professional basketball player and millions of fans expect more from you than this. I'm going to keep saying this - Patrick Beverley doesn't deserve to play in the NBA and make money for shoving people and being a bitch. F**k Pat Bev"
"He didn't ""do some clown shit"". Patrick Beverley is clown shit personified. He deserves no appreciation for anything at all."
fuck Patrick Beverley
It makes me happy that Patrick Beverley continues to make himself look like a jackass. Dude is absolute trash.
Patrick the Greek Teeth Beverley has rabies! Upvote this!
"I agree with that with friends you know, but I just can't extend that level of warranty to NBA players.    I play basketball (not in any professional way, of course), as I'm sure you do.  And people who play like Beverley are the worst....but then to be as dirty and straight up disrespectful as he is, without even really backing it up with anything on  the court?  Like, fuck those types of players, even if they are on my team.  Sorry man, I totally understand how fandom can make you feel irrational shit, but Patrick Beverley types are just too much and inexcusable.  I have a buddy who is a diehard Grizzlies fan who simply can't stand Grayson Allen for similar reasons (sorta).  There are just some players that are inexcusably dirty and assholes and not even that good at basketball."
"I used to think Patrick Beverley was a modern day Bruce Bowen, but that’s disrespectful to Bruce who I disliked because of how dirty he was. Beverley is on another level.  Loved this dagger."
"That he is. I absolutely loathe Patrick Beverley but I got to say this, even though I’ll probably have a bunch of suns fans freak out at me, Chris Paul needs to cut out the BS too. I love everything about Chris Paul’s game except the foul baiting and flopping BS. That stunt he pulled with cousins in this game was disgraceful. At least once every few games lately Chris Paul pulls some euro soccer whistle baiting BS that would have any self respecting hooper laughing at him and telling him to fuck off in a pick up game. I hope he wins a championship this year and cements his legacy as a top 3 or 4 point guard of all time but I don’t want it to be sullied by that kind of BS."
Imagine defending Patrick Beverley and meaning it because mad
I see. Everyone here gets an award for calling Patrick Beverley a bitch

Patrick Beverley is a baby back bitch
I'm sure the comments regarding Patrick Beverley will be extremely civil
"When Patrick Beverley told Steph Curry the next 5 years were his, I didn’t know he was talking about his prison sentence"
the most positive outcome of the suns winning is not seeing patrick beverley in the finals
"Salty bitch Patrick Beverley gets in people's faces and talks shit ALL GAME LONG but when it happens to him he throws a fucking temper tantrum.  Remember this is the same dude that taunted the Warriors cleaning staff for no reason.  I'm so fucking happy the bitch is getting sent home AGAIN.  He said the next 5 years are his, wouldn't be surprised if he's out of the league by then."
There's something truly beautiful about watching Patrick Beverley rage quit a game and get himself ejected. Chris Paul just broke the Clippers brains in this one.

Patrick Beverley is straight making me ashamed to have EVER called myself a fan of his.  I had respect for his game (as a HTX girl) but his behavior tonight is just embarrassing.

Patrick Beverley is sure a great defender. I don't understand how people think he's dirty at all.
Imagine liking Patrick Beverley
One of the best clips of all time. Fuck Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley fan club let’s goooo
"Because our society rewards it. The fact that we’re talking about this guy proves it, and while it isn’t directly rewarding him, it’s giving him attention nonetheless and losers like this guy would prefer notoriety and attention despite the backlash they may face.   Some people are that big of losers. Like there are a handful of players I really don’t like. I don’t like Patrick Beverley for example. However, if I saw him in person I wouldn’t say shit - he’s never done anything to me personally and though I don’t like his play because he does dirty shit, he’s still a person. People sometimes think they have the right to harass other people just because they’re celebrities."
Patrick Beverley is a great instigator
"Eh, Patrick Beverley doesn’t pass the eye test of a legitimate elite defender. Doesn’t really have the length, strength, lateral speed, or quickness to jump a gap that Holiday, T Allen, or Smart possess."
Here you go. Enough said   * Dwight Howard played 41 games  * Trevor Ariza  * Jason Terry was like 37 years old  * Kostas Papanikolaou  * Corey Brewer played 56 games  * Josh Smith  * Pablo Prigioni played 24 games and like 37 yo  * Terrence Jones played 33 games  * Donatas Motiejūnas  * Clint Capela played 12 games  * Joey Dorsey  * Patrick Beverley played 56 games   * K. J. McDaniels played 10 games
"Yeah, but he’s still Patrick Beverley."
"The problem was that they were skilled enough to win without being dirty, but they were dirty anyways. The way they played makes Patrick Beverley look like a saint"
At least your college basketball team is relevant *cries in texas a&amp;m*. But im sure once he makes a big time play for yall it will be pretty easy to change your mind. Id be lying if I didnt say patrick beverley was one of my favorite rockets
Yeah but they didn't double team kd. They double teamed Steph. KD would get single covered every series. Rockets? Tucker or Ariza (not saying theyre bad defenders. just that he wasn't doubled). Clippers? It was like fucking Patrick Beverley.  Of course the warriors would go to him if Steph is out here getting swarmed by the defense.
Westbrook before Patrick Beverley needlessly went at his knee.
Patrick Beverley
Who’s #1?  Terrace Davis? Patrick Beverley?
Indeed. Fournier was just too much for our DOGS to handle. I don’t know why we had Patrick Beverley on him to close out the game.
Bruce Bowen with Patrick Beverley as a close 2nd
And people like these rules better for some reason. Could you imagine someone like Patrick Beverley being allowed to just undercut guys on loose balls.
Imagine Patrick Beverley but he lets players go by him and fouls three point shooters. hustle i guess
"No lol  New Orleans Pelicans starting PG Jrue Holiday was limited to 55 minutes total and missed one game of the Warriors' sweep entirely coming off a stress reaction in his right tibia. Memphis Grizzlies starting PG Mike Conley missed Game 1 of the series with Golden State because of a facial fracture, and starting SF Tony Allen played just five minutes over the last two games because of a sore left hamstring. The Houston Rockets played without starting PG Patrick Beverley and backup F/C Donatas Motiejunas, while starting C Dwight Howard played through a torn MCL and torn meniscus suffered during the Western Conference finals. In the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without starting PF Kevin Love because of shoulder surgery early in the playoffs and lost starting PG Kyrie Irving to a fractured patella late in Game 1."
That’s Patrick Beverley
"It's so funny how bad of a position the Clippers are in. Their superstar player, Kawhi, is basically out for the entire season or at the very least, 75% of the season. Clippers have no choice but to re-sign Kawhi because no other decent free agent would go there and because the Clippers gave up everything trying to get Kawhi and PG. Serge Ibaka proved to be very useless for most of the season and opted in because he can't make that same money elsewhere. Rondo looks miserable there. Patrick Beverley is still goofy as hell. Their championship window was the past two seasons. With Kawhi getting up there and age and their limited options, Clippers are never sniffing a title."
"All I want is a Lakers-Clippers Playoffs where Westbrook proceeds to destroy Patrick ""next five years are his"" Beverley."
"&gt;Who also shot 45% from 3  Depends a lot on if you believe this is real at all. He shot 28.8% and 32.4% his two other years, and was a 65.7% FT shooter over his career. He also only 22% from 25 feet and beyond, which is where he'll shoot from in the NBA.   At worst, he's a backup PG that can only play defense on opposing 1s and undersized 2s.   Like, there's not even anyone to compare him to because guys like Avery Bradley and Patrick Beverley have significantly longer wingspans at 6'7. Beverley's also a legit 3-point shooter.   To me, Davion Mitchell's upside is being a Patrick Beverley-type player, with the bust potential of barely being an NBA player if his shot is as bad as it could be."
Patrick Beverley. Not that he’s good. Just got a big mouth/personality.
Patrick Beverley and Marcus Smart. They don’t usually score and they still manage to have the biggest mouths.

"I'm replying to this late and after somebody downvoted you for no real reason, but I think *usage* is the main thing that makes me think of the 4 guys I named together. Usage is only how many plays YOU snap off: field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers. Assists don't give you usage credit, even though usage and assist rate *together* measure what people often think usage is, which is how much a given player is dominating the ball and determining how the play ends. CP3 might monopolize the offense, but he uses his own scoring far, far less than those 4.  CP3 definitely doesn't lack for scoring talent; nor do Steph, Harden, Trae, and Luka lack *anything* as passers and leaders of great offenses. But, CP3's highest usage rate in his career is 27%, while Steph, Harden, Trae, and Luka all reach or exceed 35% usage lately; if this doesn't seem ridiculous, remember that the average usage of a player needs to be 20% by definition, and so 34% usage is double the variance from 20% that 27% is. With that in mind, CP3 is half as *excessive* about snapping off plays as the other 4 players. His last 3 seasons have had usage rates of about 23%.   I think CP3 is actually one of *the few good examples* of the ""pure point guard"" in NBA history. I think guys like Stockton and Bob Cousy (who other 60s Celtics credit as the inventor of the modern fast break and the first truly good point guard at paint scoring, dribble penetration, and taking 80% of the team's dribbles) are good parallels for him. No good point guard is a scoring slouch-- replacing a point guard with a combo guard or a forward is generally a big benefit on defense, so point guards just don't get play unless they can generate advantage on offense (Patrick Beverley notwithstanding, Kawhi and PG dribble for that team). The pure point guard emphasizes scoring far, far less than the 4 guys I distinguish CP3 from-- we generally call guys a pure point guard when they emphasize protecting the ball, understanding the offense's playbook, and making rational decisions for the other players about which play to use. CP3 is pretty famous for doing this better than anyone, he's a frequent AST:TO leader even though the defense has the advantage of predictability, but that's very different from Harden's ability to score *himself* through the unbelievable, unbearable predictability of a player charting the highest usage rates of all time."
"I watched the Mavericks hunt him down like a wounded animal, iso Luka on him, and grind him into the dust whenever they needed a bucket this playoffs.  [Example 1](https://twitter.com/MoDakhil_NBA/status/1397415863490256899)  [Example 2](https://twitter.com/Foot_Basket/status/1397420330860392448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1397420330860392448%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdefector.com%2Fbask-in-the-delights-of-patrick-beverleys-miserable-evening%2F)  Check out the sequence around 2:00 left in Qtr 4 of Game 2 of that series, too: the Clippers are so desperate to keep Beverley from getting roasted again that they feel the need to blitz Luka with Paul George on the double team, and then the rest of the Mavs unpeels the frantically switching Clippers like a banana and flip the ball to Porzingis for a backbreaking dunk.  Great defenders don't get singled out, attacked, and humiliated, repeatedly, in the playoffs."
Patrick Beverley

Patrick Beverley
He shouldn't have done that. Patrick Beverley is probably gonna try to break his knee now.
"so that's another year taken away from Patrick ""The next five years are mine"" Beverley, eh?"
His full name is Dennis Patrick Beverley Schroder
"I mean, Booker has a broken nose... it's not he'd need to make up some lame excuse:  ""Sorry Miss, a Patrick Beverley ate my homework"""
2013 asterisk should be that patrick Beverley tore Russ’s acl capping the thunder season prematurely.   Or a fun one could be that 2013 was the last 2-3-2 finals home away  format. Meaning the stakes would be different with that game at San Antonio.
"Patrick Beverley is scary in the sense that he looks like a homeless guy that would be yelling to himself at a bus stop, and if you make eye contact with him, he'd probably try to fight you."
Jrue holiday is who Patrick Beverley thinks he is
"&gt;To put it in contrast I could say that Patrick Beverley received DPOY votes in five different seasons to Holiday's two  We're talking about all defensive votes at the end of the ballots of a select few people. I'm not gonna be cry about being left off those, especially as a player that was never really in the DPOY conversation  Jrue was only ever going to get on to a DPOY ballot in a similar place, where it doesn't matter. But he never did, and it's like it's outrageous he wasn't in the DPOY conversation, he was never at that level"
Ocean - Jerry West   Rusty - Pete Maravich   Linus - Luka Doncic   Benedict - Rick Barry   Frank - Charles Barkley   Reuben - Mark Cuban   Virgil - Stephon Marbury   Turk - Steve Francis   Saul - Red Auerbach   Livingston - John Stockton   Basher - Patrick Beverley
"Patrick Beverley  Patrick Beverley  Patrick Beverley  Patrick Beverley  Patrick Beverley  *""The next 5 years are mine""*"
"I guess they are saying that his defense should be an even bigger story. The video is from last season, at which point Holiday had made an All-Defensive 1st in 2018 and a 2nd in 2019, while receiving DPOY votes only in 2018, [when he finished 7th](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2018.html), so even in 2017 he didn't get the reputation they're saying he deserves until the playoffs. To put it in contrast I could say that Patrick Beverley received DPOY votes in five different seasons to Holiday's two, and Beverley is someone who got targeted by the Mavs in the first round this season and got benched from game 3 onwards (I know KD was talking about Gobert in the clip)."
Exactly. A way better Patrick Beverley without being an asshole.
Do Houston/Clippers fans recognize this about Patrick Beverley?  Because fuck Pat Bev.
Have u heard of Patrick Beverley?
Yes Paul George and Patrick Beverley will lead them to the championship
"At the end of the day it's still fuck Patrick Beverley and at the end of the day Patrick Beverley still doesn't know who the fuck I am so why should he care.  Same for everyone else, unless you're KD okay"
"Bobby Portis is way more cool than guys like Jae Crowder, Patrick Beverley. He can shithouse with the best of them but smart enough not to pick up technical fouls or ejections."
"you have patrick beverley, paul george, rajon rondo, serge ibaka, and demarcus cousins on your team"
"&gt;edit: this sub behaves like rabid dogs when they hear the words Patrick Beverley lmao. cry more bitches Clippers in 6. Pat Bev all defensive player and he’s richer than all of you combined.  Take deep breaths man, the mean internet ppl can't hurt you"
this sub behaves like pussies when they see anything positive about Patrick Beverley
&gt; this sub behaves like rabid dogs when they hear the words Patrick Beverley lmao. cry more bitches Clippers in 6. Pat Bev all defensive player and he’s richer than all of you combined.  Lmao that's all it took for you to rage like this? Grow up
"Agreed, at this point, I believe Patrick Beverley is a better player than Ben Simmons"
"I'm not sure how to articulate this as well as I should but in my opinion I think people are a little unfair when they dismiss bigs like that.  If you compare to a mid-level 3 and D player like IDK Jae Crowder or Robert Covington or Patrick Beverley or something like that I think the comparison makes more sense.   They can hit open shots and they can have a 20 point game when they're feeling it,  but they're not guys that can put the ball on the floor and create offense reliably on their own.   If you're relying on Jae Crowder to be your 3rd best offensive player you're going to be very sad when he goes 1/5 from 3, but if he's the 5th guy on a well-constructed roster with playmakers it's an awesome skillset.  The valuation is kind of weird because you're obviously expecting your big to influence the defense in a way that perimeter players can't, but I think from that perspective it makes it easier to understand why people would want that.   If you have a good point guard and if Steven Adams is going to be a one-man defense that takes the pressure off and gives you roster flexibility to play guys that aren't a good fit defensively I think that can really have a much bigger impact than just his individual skill would suggest."
Yes you can when you’re about to send your team to the NBA finals Patrick Beverley can cry himself to sleep tonight
They got finals to prepare for. No use risking missing shit for Patrick Beverley lmao

ESPN doing PR for Patrick Beverley and people wonder why ratings are down
lol yes if any player gets the benefit of the doubt too much it's Patrick Beverley
I’ve said multiple times this season they need to put someone in the game that’s not essential and have them treat Patrick Beverley the way Patrick Beverley treats everyone else. If they get booted for one of those incidents it won’t affect the team too much and maybe Patrick Beverley has a small attitude adjustment.
"I've said it many times, but I want to say it once again.  Fuck Patrick Beverley."

Patrick Beverley with a sinister smile on his face
"Yo Patrick, just because your last name is Beverley, it doesn't mean you gotta act like such a bitch."
"I thought Kobe in the top 10 was stupid, but this is probably worse.  Of all the people to put in the top 10 you landed on WB ?  Not Curry, not Durant, not Malone, not West, not Elgin, not Patrick Beverley."
Pisses me off that dudes like him and Trae Young get hurt while bum ass dirty bitches like Patrick Beverley roll along like they're bulletproof.
"This was my first thought as well.   A few of the most prominent injuries that come to mind of late were just the result of random happenstance. Pace probably isn't going to result in LeBron *not* getting dived into, it's not going to prevent that awkward drive in the half-court that resulted in Giannis getting hit, it's not going to prevent Trae from stepping back onto an official's foot, and it's probably not going to prevent Patrick Beverley and Devin Booker from bumping heads.   But on the other hand, there's another category ripe with candidates as well; those who sustained muscle tears, contact-less ligament-based trauma, and whatever else may fit. I think *those* could kick-start a discussion on overuse and perhaps pace, types of movements, etc. I just have too little knowledge of this year's injury specifics to know where to start."
The disrespect to Patrick Beverley
"It's almost as if a normal player would see in the corner of his eye that he's shooting and would slow down, but Patrick Beverley decides to keep on running under him to see what happens."
"I seem to constantly be a fan of players that /r/nba hates. Although the opinion of some of these guys has gotten better lately... guys like Dwight, CP3, Melo, Patrick Beverley all come to mind.   Also not sure how unpopular this is but being a big fan of roleplayers is way more fun than stars. UD, Jason Terry, Josh Smith, Corey Brewer (I lived in Houston in that era lol), Shaun Livingston, Lance Stephenson and so on have been some of my favorite players ever. I could probably list role players I love for much longer than I can talk about stars."
This screen is not unprecedented.   The only CRAZY thing on this play is Patrick Beverley falling towards someone’s knee.
Unpopular opinion: I like Patrick Beverley  Edit: Not even a Clippers fan
i like guys like patrick beverley. maybe it's easier to say that when he hasn't really done anything to my team. but every team needs that kinda guy to fire up the crowd. and i respect him for having the balls to literally do whatever it takes to annoy opposing players. he legit does not care what people think of him. he's just out there having fun
"Upvote because this is unpopular, have you heard of a man named Patrick Beverley"
I like Patrick Beverley
"What’s the basketball play that requires Beverley to go around a screen that way? I guess if Paul was going to straight to the basket    I guess you could say Beverley was being over eager since he had no help, but I think that’s giving a HUGE benefit of the doubt to PATRICK BEVERLEY HOW ARE YOU EVEN DISAGREEING ABOUT THIS"
"He is not elite, he is very good defender. For elite players, you need elite defenders. Patrick Beverley is borderline elite in that segment, and he almost""neutralized"" Booker. That shows you we dont have 1 elite defender. Closest are Gordon and Dozier."
Oh no Patrick Beverley what a nightmare
Patrick Beverley will go down in history as the dirtiest basketball player to grace the NBA.   It was never about the love of the game for Pat; it was his love of seriously injuring big names.

"Patrick Beverley just showing he’s a real piece of shit, hope he gets his."
"He got Patrick Beverley benched cause he was abusing him.   He's good, just needs to work on his ft and shot selection. Improve his cardio so he isn't fatigued at the end of games.    The teammates didn't show up consistently, kp is the biggest one. Guy is butterfingers playing like a new born giraffe out there. Wish there was a bunch of highlights from the series where he got the ball and just turned it over even when be had guys like rondo or Mann on him. Maxi was injured and was horrible from 3 even though he shot it the best on the team during the season. I'm not sure if Powell and brunson were injured because I don't understand why they didn't get more minutes.   Can't wait for next year."
"Patrick Beverley also poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague upon our houses"
Luka made Patrick Beverley and Zubac unplayable. From starters to DNPs. Luka played an insane series and one month later we already are seeing revisionist history from Luka haters lol
I really do not like Patrick Beverley. Ironic too because later Paul George did flop like this.
Patrick Beverley is the root of CP3’s Curse. You can’t convince me otherwise.
Patrick Beverley is equal parts elite basketball player and crackhead street person
CP been a bit stinky since being out for covid but he was pretty solid before. Why the hate for CP3? How can you possibly be for a team that has Patrick Beverley. Does not compute.
God Patrick Beverley fucking sucks
"I need this fucking crowd to wave goodbye to Patrick Beverley. Holy crap. I need him to be sung *So Long, Farewell* that would actually drain my balls."
"Yeah fuck Patrick Beverley and all, but he was squeezing over the screen and CP3 pulled up in the only spot Bev could go. Nothing flagrant about that.  Now mocking him while he’s on the ground hurt, that’s fucked up and that’s why he’s scum. But the play was fine."
"You are hated more because you have Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris, Paul George, and Rondo on your team. Lol. I do like Kawhi and Tye Lue though."
Patrick Beverley just looks grimey.
Patrick Beverley embracing his inner Hyena
I feel like it's a flagrant only because it's Patrick Beverley and honestly Im down with that
Patrick Beverley has always been a dirty player. disgusting
"I love competitive sports, and respect so many elite opponents of my team, but Patrick Beverley is such a consistently horrible person, seriously, fuck that guy. How is that not a taunting technical?"
I think one thing we can mostly agree on is that Patrick Beverley is unhinged. Ayton looked at him like “why are they letting this man play basketball and not getting him professional help?”
"Fuck it, I'm here for it. Screw Patrick Beverley now and forever."
"Just a reminder that Patrick Beverley is a piece of shit, not like anyone needs it."
Patrick Beverley is such a bitch
Patrick fucking Beverley is an embarrassment. What a piece of shit.
Adam Silver do you really want Patrick Beverley representing the league in the Finals? Come on.
I truly cannot express how much I dislike Patrick Beverley
Fuck Patrick Beverley
Imma need that Patrick Beverley GIF
Fuck Patrick Beverley
Fuck you Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley threes all day
Patrick Beverley about to drop 40
But you’ve hear of Patrick Beverley right?
"Or he’s Patrick Beverley.  Edit: Which, I guess, fits into the second category."
"So we can both agree 1 game of Conley and Patrick Beverley doesn’t really compare to Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard, right?"
That's what happens when an unstoppable force meets Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley has been a perfect library for DBook this series
If Booker is a villager that means Patrick Beverley is a zombie
"I mean, it's clearly a mix of broken nose and Patrick Beverley. And I guess since that's who broke it, it's just Pat Bev"
"Forget ""everything"". Somehow Beverley gets away with playing the way he does and rarely gets called for *anything*.  On paper, Beverley committed one flagrant foul this season (an elbow to Chris Paul in April, assessed as a Flagrant 2, resulting in an ejection). He was charged with one technical foul during the regular season, in a game against the Warriors in March. He has been assessed two more technicals so far in the playoffs, one in the Dallas series and another in Thursday's game against the Suns. He also fouled out of only game this season, against Brooklyn in February.  Patrick. Beverley.  The guy who never misses an opportunity to get in a jab, or quick bump after the whistle, or a cheap shot while looking the other way.  The guy who spends basically the entire game screaming in people's faces and openly taunting his primary defensive assignment (isn't there literally a rule against taunting?).  I'm not even a Beverley hater, really. I grew up watching 90s basketball, I loved Gary Payton, and I genuinely appreciate the strategic/psychological benefits of having someone like Pat Bev playing for your team.  It's just kind of baffling—given refereeing that often favors offense, particularly the primary ball-handlers Beverley typically defends; over-sensitive refs who have handed out techs for genuinely absurd reasons repeatedly this season (see: JJ Redick passing the ball wrong, Kelly Oubre blowing kisses, Draymond yelling at James Wiseman, etc, etc); and the frequency with which we've seen instant replay resulting in what feel like extremely soft flagrant fouls—that Beverley somehow manages to escape all of that."
This. Fuck Patrick Beverley.
Patrick Beverley is a creeper
Patrick Beverley hasn’t had a single dirty play this entire series. You’re objectively incorrect.
"Any time I see Boogie Cousins, Patrick Beverley, or Paul George fail, it makes me happy.  I'm a terrible human being."
That was Patrick Beverley
Patrick Beverley about to call you out for hurting his feelings
Fuck Patrick Beverley.
"""If Patrick Beverley was on the team you support you would love him.""   Actually, I wouldn't. He's a fucking embarrassment."
Fuck Patrick Beverley he should be out of the league and he's an absolute stain and embarrassment to the game.
Fcking Patrick Beverley
Just came here to say I hate patrick beverley and paul george.  but T. Mann needs to get traded to the Hawks.
Just came here to say that I hate Patrick Beverley .
"Thank God for basketball, otherwise Patrick Beverley would be sticking people up in Chicago."
"If the Clippers end up winning this whole thing, *IF* they win the championship... I think we will have no choice but to crown Patrick Beverley as the new GOAT.   I know it's only 1 championship but if you consider the effort he's putting in it's pretty much the same as 6 rings."
Me and all my homies try really hard to pretend Patrick Beverley doesn't exist and our lives are better for it
When the Suns make a shot I think “yes”. When Patrick Beverley flops and gets rewarded I think “no”.
jeff van gundy is like the patrick beverley of commentators
"&gt; Dame is out. Enjoy watching Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris, and Luke Kennard the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Lol, 1. It’s Patrick Beverley, there was a (now removed) thread praising him after the game where he was still getting shit on.   2. The person you’re replying to has a Suns flair, like yourself. It’s very easy to find people complaining about bev after playing against him"
"Refs are hard carrying the clippers. Hilarious watching Crowder get touch fouls on one end and then Patrick Beverley is mauling Booker on the other end and we're expect to be like, wow playoff defense!"
"I mean Patrick Beverley is absolutely an amazing defender but ffs he was to be the biggest idiots in the history of the league. Even Clippers fans cannot possibly like him, right!?!?!?"
Patrick Beverley praise will not be tolerated.
Broken noses Booker received when Patrick Beverley is on the court: 1   Broken noses Booker received when Patrick Beverley is off the court: 0
The Suns backcourt getting outplayed by Patrick Beverley and Reggie Jackson is the last thing I expected. Did pat bev really just score 1 on 1 on Mikal Bridges in the paint?
The best players know how to use Patrick Beverley aggressiveness against  him.
I’ve played sports and nobody celebrates like Patrick Beverley does. Ever heard “act like you’ve been there”?
Patrick Beverley best player in the nba?
i want clips to win but god i hate patrick beverley so fucking much. he makes one shot and acts like he's steph curry. this bum needs to get his mouth sealed shut.
Devin Booker really got called the next Kobe just to get locked up by Patrick Beverley lmao
"Patrick Beverley is the perfect litmus test for whether you're a star guard in the NBA. Guys like Steph, Dame, Harden, and Luka absolutely cook Pat Bev. Booker still needs to get to that level."
Devin Booker is Patrick Beverley son. He's getting punked
Come on Devin Booker. Don't let Patrick Beverley punk you
Does Patrick beverley have the most overrated defense in the league?  I feel it's that his offense is so bad it makes his defense look good.
"Clippers so annoying! Patrick ""Show me your knees"" Beverley and Nic ""Fatty let me sit here"" Batum along with Paul ""I cheated with a stripper"" George!  Could you compile a more unlikable squad? yes! But it'd be tough!"
"The Clippers of course, by employing Patrick Beverley, deserve to go to Seattle. Fuck em."
Marcus Morris or Patrick Beverley
