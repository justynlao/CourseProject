"DMC doesn’t seem like a bad influence at all if that’s who you’re referring to. Danuel House is just a moron and Kurucs is a piece of shit if the allegations are true, but I doubt Porter Jr would be looking up to Kurucs anyway"
You have to realize who is Nash's assistant. He traded everyone last year so he could play PJ Tucker and Jeff Green at center position. Guess who is on the Nets  Only difference is that Harden now is playing with Durant instead of Danuel fucking House jr.
Also remember that CP3/Capella/Gordon have been in and out of injuries during since they came to Houston.  Who’s gonna shoot the ball the most?  Iman Shumpert?  Danuel House Jr.?
Too soon.  -Danuel House Jr.
"Jealousy - I don't like Stephen Curry, because he is so good and not on my team.   Insecurity - I don't like Danuel House Jr., because of the stupid shit he did during playoff bubble. Insecurity, because where I was living at that time, everything and everyone was on lockdown. Couldn't really go out without a good reason. Like him, I was tired of satisfying myself with a rub and was horny af. Him breaking protocol when I'm dealing with the same shit pissed me off, so I flamed him. That pissed me off more than him messing up his team and possibly endangering them.  Boredom - Lol everybody don't like Pat Bev, so I join too."
Russ has no help bro. Beal isn't half the player that [checks box score] Danuel House Jr is

"Were they? 2018 rockets had Gordon, Capela, Ariza, Tucker and Gerald Green as rotation players   2020 rockets had Benny mac, Rivers, Danuel House Jr, Robert Covington, Tucker, Gordon and Jeff Green as rotation players"
"""huh didn't know Danuel House Jr was at the game"""
*Danuel House Jr. has quietly tip-toed out of the chat.*
That was Danuel House Jr. if my memory serves me correctly
"I don't think it was just half a season of good play though. He also wasn't just hot while they were out. He was runner-up for 6moy last season and played well in the Houston series. You are right though that his career has not been so favorable. I remember not really liking him in Atlanta.   I just think that he's going to get a contract around what he's looking for, especially since he didn't take the Lakers' extension offer. I think a lot of teams struggle with ball-handling, and there's a need for his skillset even if he's not the best player.  He's probably looking at the contracts of guys like Hield,  Brogdon, Gary Harris, Tobias Harris, Porzingis, Van Vleet,  Runio, Fultz, and Danuel House Jr  (pretty sure that last one's a typo lol) and thinking he can get the bag like them.   http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/\_/seasontype/4"
Danuel House Jr.  Isn't needed on a rebuildn and he may not be someone a GM wants young players to model their professionalism on.   Still offers value to contending teams though.
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
Lol what team is Danuel House Jr on again?
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"

Or Danuel House Jr
You seem to forget about the GOAT puller Danuel House Jr
Danuel House looking at this news like LeBron looked at JR Smith in the Finals lol
Probably from Danuel House Jr or Lou Will
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
Danuel House Jr but we’d need a pick back
