Lmao Sharife Cooper really got called out
Sharife Cooper s/o WAR EAGLE
"Sharife Cooper has a mountain of flaws, but Cunningham is not even close to Cooper level as a passer.  Cooper might not be able to show that off in the NBA cause his other flaws will expose him, but he makes insane passes and finds people on lobs that no one expects.  So Cade ranks highly in this class as a passer, maybe he is easily top 2, but I think he probably is closer to 3 than to 1.  I bet he is a lot closer to Giddey as a passer than to Sharife.  Cade makes super smart reads a lot of the time, but he isn't that level of special as a passer.  And Cade's handles are pretty bad if the comparison is Luka or Trae or LaMelo, so he can't even create that many passing angles compared to the elite lead players in the NBA."

Sharife Cooper
at this point I'm pretty sure I've mocked every 1st round PG to the Knicks at some point to always have a Knicks fan bitching in the comments about it.  He adds PNR ballhandling and playmaking in the halfcourt. Would you be happier if it was Sharife Cooper?

I think this is right.  Sharife Cooper is going to be a late 1st round pick because he’s an undersized PG who can’t shoot.  Those are big issues to making him a lottery pick.  Sengun and Isaiah Jackson will both likely he lottery picks as well.

This draft class is deeper than people think. Watch out for Sharife cooper he’s not even in the top 15 but I can see him being one of the best picks in the entire draft

"I expect Oladipo for MLE, maybe a move for another wing, hopefully a hit in the draft.  Bucks biggest weakness from a roster building standpoint is that they don't have one effortless primary creator.  Jrue, Giannis, Khris all great playmakers, but they don't have one high volume, high PnR player that can create effortlessly.  Offense can get bogged down without that.  Oladipo, even if he recovers, probably isn't that, just yet another secondary guy.  This isn't really a problem in regular season, but having one elite guard playmaker is useful in playoffs.  I don't know how Bucks address that, though.  Man, I really hope Sharife Cooper falls in the draft, exactly the sort of upside play Bucks could use."
"Young guys that control the pace like CP3, money from midrange, expert passing &amp; IQ? Idk if there’s any young stars like that rn. Lamelo/Hayes are close to that I guess, maybe Ja Morant, but i don’t think the next CP3 has entered the league yet. Maybe Jalen Suggs! Or Sharife Cooper idk"
I want us to trade up for Bouknight. But If not Sharife Cooper and Chris Duarte would be nice
I don’t believe that. They are saying the same thing about sharife cooper being 6’4. I 100% don’t believe that shit. I like sengun tho
Sharife Cooper
Sharife cooper is the best passer in the draft and he's hella undersized so he's your best bet among current prospects
Sharife Cooper but i'm only saying that cause he's short and the best playmaker in the draft.
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Also, I’m sad that the Celtics don’t have their first rounder this season.  I was looking forward to a pg or center of the future to be picked.  Looks like they got their center of the future.  Ngl I really wanted Jaden springer, Jared butler or sharife cooper in the draft."
"Prolly Cam Reddish, but the Hawks have like 8 role players the subreddit fuckin loves it's amazing.  Huerter, Reddish, Sharife Cooper are probably the most loved rn."
"Nice, here's a table with the top three category leaders.  |**Player**|**PPG**| |:--|--:| |Cam Thomas|27.0| |Tyrese Maxey|26.0| |Desmond Bane|24.0|  |**Player**|**REB**| |:--|--:| |Jalen Smith|12.5| |Paul Reed|12.0| |John Konchar|12.0|  |**Player**|**AST**| |:--|--:| |Payton Pritchard|8.5| |Immanuel Quickley|7.8| |Sharife Cooper|7.3|  |**Player**|**BLK**| |:--|--:| |Daniel Oturu|3.3| |Alperen Sengun|3.0| |Sekou Doumbouya|3.0|  |**Player**|**STL**| |:--|--:| |Tremont Waters|3.5| |Jordan Goodwin|3.3| |Louis King|3.2|"
"And still the results show these guys overthink everything, every year, even tho their paid millions.   A lot of these guys watch basketball and have no idea what they are seeing, lists of businessmen and analytic guys in these roles, overthinking. Hence why sharife cooper fell to us."
"Sharife Cooper for me, but Garza's making a good case"
Didn't realize.   Some rookies do skip summer league at times. Like I didn't DeAndre Hunter or Cam Reddish in the Hawks summer their rookie year. I dunno if both were injured or what.    I did get to see Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper ballin out this summer league tho
"besides ours:  Yves Pons, JT Thor, Sharife Cooper, Cade Cunningham"
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."
"He feels pretty similar to Sharife Cooper in that he might never be a starter because of natural limitations, but he could easily be a high quality long term role player. Getting that level of player in the second round is fantastic."
I'm still kinda annoyed that the Raptors passed on Sharife Cooper with both of those 2nd round picks.
For rookies I don't think those two have out and out comparisons unless you are joking..I see a comparison for Sharife cooper with Trae with same defensive flaws and a considerably weaker jumper similarly Evan Mobley and Jaren jackson jr
"It's pretty much what every evaluator said about him. He's decent at everything, but doesn't have any facet of the game he's a standout at. It's why some people wish we would've gone for a guy like Sharife Cooper (elite passer, but small and can't shoot) or Jared Butler (solid scorer, but below average athlete and turnover prone). But both of those guys have much higher bust potential too.   Ayo will likely just be... fine."
"Sharife Cooper is the steal of the draft (I’m biased but), Cam Thomas will find a way to crack the Nets starting lineup, Jalen Green will be the best player out of the draft, Kuminga second best."
How tf did Sharife Cooper fall so low??? Pretty sure he was a late 1st round/early 2nd round guy.  I know its just summer league but dude seems like he clearly has an NBA level skill set.
Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher’s defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade’s poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He’s good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can’t create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it’s over. He won’t get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
&gt; The fact he and Jalen Johnson  Jalen Johnson went at a reasonable position and so did this kid. Johnson was mediorce all season for Duke and quit on his team.  Sharife Cooper shot terrible in college so he seems like a long shot in the NBA despite being highly ranked.
Idk I have a feeling Sharife Cooper might end up being the biggest steal of the draft
Might even be as good as Sharife Cooper!
Khris Middleton   Nikola Jokic  Sharife Cooper  I’ll explain later
"Apparently /r/nba_draft dudes were high on him. I think they doin the same thing with sharife cooper. Tbf grant looked pretty good when he got garbage time minutes last yr, but he looks awful so far at running an offense in summer league."
"Sharife Cooper. Hella underrated. I see him being a 6moy &amp; Roy winner my “hot take” I guess. He’s super crafty and has that Trae Young type of quickness. His handle is insane, can shoot, finish, floater/layup package tough.  I see him in a Lou Will type role avg 18-20 off the bench and shocking the casuals and “analysts” who underrated him because of size."
My one takeaway is Sharife Cooper is tiny.
Dont forget Sharife Cooper
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
Y'all could have gotten sharife cooper in the draft
"I mean it was a solid off-season. Two steals in terms of raw talent in Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper respective to their draft positions. Turning two literal zeroes on a roster in Dunn and Fernando into Delon Wright who’s a  very capable backup. Resigning Collins for effectively 4 yr/100 is a fair deal. Signed Dieng of course for relatively cheap and he’ll help against bigger teams and be a stop gap till Okungwu returns from injury. And Lou will returning to mentor Cooper and give us quick buckets if needed.  While we Hawks fan are super excited about the direction of the team, we didn’t knock it out of the park in terms of free agency. We signed exactly what we needed and ducked off. The real prize is having a potentially healthy roster. Hunter and Reddish especially. That will be a bigger addition than any free agent on the market."
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
So do the Hawks but we're actually good   Trae: 22   Collins: 23   Hunter: 23   Cam: 21   Huerter: 22   Okongwu: 20   Sharife Cooper: 20   Jalen Johnson: 19   Skylar Mays: 23   Actually we have 9
Sharife Cooper was mocked around 20 and got drafted 48.  Mocks don't mean anything because the teams don't rank the players the same way the mocks do...
"Before we traded for Delon Wright and drafted Sharife Cooper, I would've bit you hand off for a good backup PG at only $6.3 million a year, that's an absolute steal."
"Before we traded for Delon Wright and drafted Sharife Cooper, I would've bit you hand off for a good backup PG at only $6.3 million a year, that's an absolute steal."
Some guys get lucky with growth spurts   This doesn't seem like a Sharife Cooper situation where he's suddenly 6'5
"I'm 5'11"",180lbs,so probably not. Though Sharife Cooper and Trae Young are the same size identically, so maybe?"
"Your comment got me to Google Dwight because I wanted to check how old he was now and TIL, Dwight Howard is the brother-in-law of Sharife Cooper who was drafted by the Hawks last night."
"Expiring contract with Sharife Cooper waiting in the wings. I doubt he’s with his 6th team for more than a season, but he can earn a nice new contract with his 7th squad."
Sharife Cooper should have gone lotto
"I’m confident the Hawks will also pick up a decent veteran PG in free agency to eat minutes until/unless Sharife Cooper develops to the point of backing up Trae full time, or retain Lou Williams"
"If you watch sharife cooper play, he passes eye test with flying colors  He gets to the rim with ease, and finds passes that no one else in college basketball would find. He’s a smart, high iq guy that will make the players around him better. Also I see people saying he’s not athletic because he’s short, but he’s super quick and has that first step.  People get so tied up in athleticism (specifically jumping athleticism) and height that they forget that at the end of the day basketball is about hooping. He’s a hooper - I’ll be shocked if he flames out in the nba, but at the bottom of the second round it’s truly a no brainer.  Also about shooting - he shot poorly in college, but on very small sample size. His FT% is really good (80%) which historically has translated better, and in high school AAU he shot a much higher percent from 3 on much larger sample size. So even if you’re low on him because of shooting, there’s plenty of reason to believe that his shooting is way better than that. He’s aLao clearly confident in the shot, shooting almost 5 a game."
There’s also Te’a Cooper (WNBA) and Sharife Cooper (NBA) now as a sibling duo
"Imagine needing a PG and passing up Sharife Cooper when he fallss to you in the 2nd round, that would've broken my heart. Good thing we live in a world where that didn't happen."
So anyone know what was up with sharife Cooper? I was told he was a fringe lottery player even though he plays no defense and stands flat footed when shoots.
Our second pick might be a value back up PG.  Sharife Cooper averages 20.2 PPG and 8 APG in the 12 games he played for Auburn. He missed first 12 games due to potential eligibility rules.   I think had he played all 27 games Auburn played this year he might have been a first round pick.   His pro comparison was our very own Trae young..
Barnes over Suggs I don’t mind— passing on Brandon Boston AND Sharife Cooper however…..wyd Masai
"Sharife Cooper to ATL, but for real it's Joel Ayayi signing a two-way with the Lakers"

"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/7/27/22592152/sharife-cooper-nba-draft-sleepers-2021-auburn-bio-stats-highlights  &gt; At 6’1 and 180 pounds, Cooper will immediately be one of the smaller players in the league.  ^ probably why he's falling"
Looks like Sharife Cooper isn’t nearly as valued by the league as most fans thought
I swear to God I'm going to need an inhaler if the Celtics choose Austin Reaves over BJ Boston or Sharife Cooper lmao
Why is Sharife Cooper falling so far.  He was projected 17
What happened to Sharife Cooper?
Spurs need to let their nuts hang and take Sharife Cooper
sharife cooper is the last major domino to fall right?
Sharife Cooper is the biggest steal of this draft. That’s a first round pick!
Sources: Sharife Cooper literally shit on the court during several workout sessions. He's expected to drop to the late second.
oh shit Sharife Cooper still available for the Knicks' taking
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
Sharife cooper will be a productive player. His shooting fucked up but doesn’t tell the full story those numbers will get better too.
We could’ve had sharife cooper…..
The fuck is this draft lmao. Steal city for Sharife Cooper and Jared Butler
Sharife Cooper and/or Jared Butler this year if they don't go in the next 2 picks lol
How Sharife Cooper isn’t drafted yet is beyond me
Sharife Cooper Revenge Tour coming soon
"Don't hate it, but might be a reach. Probably will take Sharife Cooper if he's available at #32"
Manifesting sharife cooper to Phoenix
Sharife cooper really gonna play behind CP3 Chills
"Hahaha, if they draft Sharife Cooper next you’ll be right"
I'm guessing we're gonna take Sharife Cooper
I saw somewhere that Sharife Cooper was 6’3 and that’s a load of bullshit.
"I'm super tired so I'm going to stop watching and start reading the picks on CBS. Here's my reaction in advance to Isaiah Jackson and Sharife Cooper getting drafted: ""oh shit [XYZ Team] got themselves a fucking star"""
Sharife Cooper please
My takes for this draft: Sharife Cooper and Isaiah Jackson are going to be the sleeper steals of this class. They're fucking great
1. Jalen Green  2. Cade Cunningham  3. Franz Wagner  4. Evan Mobley  5. Davion Mitchell  6. Alperen Sengun  7. Jalen Suggs  8. Jared Butler  9. Sharife Cooper  10. Moses Moody
"Sharife Cooper. Dudes the best ball handler and passer in the class, if the shot gets respectable he could be a Trae-lite type of elite playmaker and high level starter for a long time"
1. Jalen Green 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Cade Cunningham 4. Alperen Sengun  5. Sharife Cooper 6. James Bouknight 7. Corey Kispert 8. Evan Mobley 9. Keon Johnson 10. Cameron Thomas  Not my top 10 big board. Just going based off how previous drafts have shaken up.
"Bust - Mobley, Kai Jones, Sengun, Kuminga, Sharife Cooper (o/u 23.5, really?)  Star - Cade, Green, Kispert (GOAT level shooter conversation)  Steal - Murphy (will go top-17ish and still be a steal), Hyland, Petty, Herb Jones, Queta, JT Thor, Wieskamp"
"jalen johnson won’t fall that far, i like sharife cooper or tre mann on the rockets though"
Sharife Cooper wins ROY
Sharife Cooper and Greg Brown
Sharife Cooper looks like he could be a steal Kory kispert is moving up on a lot of mock drafts the kid can shoot.  This is a pretty good draft and the free agent market is sort of thin I expect to see a ton of trade's draft night
"Sharife Cooper, please no"
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6. James Bouknight (Oklahoma City Thunder)  7. Jonathan Kuminga (Golden State Warriors) 8. Moses Moody (Orlando Magic) 9. Franz Wagner (Sacramento Kings)  10. Josh Giddey (Memphis Grizzlies)  11. Alperen Sengun (Charlotte Hornets) 12. Keon Johnson (San Antonio Spurs)  13. Davion Mitchell (Indiana Pacers)  14. Chris Duarte (Golden State Warriors)  15. Corey Kispert (Washington Wizards) 16. Trey Murphy (Oklahoma City Thunder)  17. Cameron Thomas (New Orleans Pelicans) 18. Jalen Johnson (Oklahoma City Thunder)  19. Kai Jones (New York Knicks)  20. Jaden Springer (Atlanta Hawks) 21. Ziaire Williams (New York Knicks) 22. Jared Butler (Los Angeles Lakers) 23. Isaiah Jackson (Houston Rockets) 24. Sharife Cooper (Houston Rockets) 25. Tre Mann (Los Angeles Clippers) 26. Joshua Primo (Denver Nuggets) 27. Miles McBride (Brooklyn Nets) 28. Quentin Grimes (Philadelphia 76ers) 29. Day'Ron Sharpe (Phoenix Suns) 30. Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
If he made the right pass more often he would be averaging more than 3.5 assists and less than 4 turnovers.  You want to watch an elite passer? Watch Sharife Cooper. He’s 10 times the passer Cade is.
"The fans who are going to be watching Nate Hinton, Caleb Martin, Cassius Winston, and Sharife Cooper duke it out? Yeah, they'd deserve that prize money tbh"
"I like this one too, been thinking the same thing:   * They'll have a full season with McMillan, which will help them gel a bit more. Not only that, but they won 68.4% of their games with Nate last year, that's 56 win pace in a full, 82-game season.  * De'Andre Hunter will be back and healthy, people forget they were missing a starter who played like one of the best 3&amp;D wings to start the season.  * They brought back LouWill, who was a nice bench spark plug last year, drafted Sharife Cooper to give them some backup playmaking, picked up Gorgui Dieng (who's a reliable backup C) and Delon Wright (a really solid defensive guard), and they have a ton of high-potential guys like Cam Reddish/Jalen Johnson/Onkeya Okongwu who could break out."
"Raptors: David Johnson  Hawks: Jalen Johnson &amp; Sharife Cooper   For the Raptors, Johnson is actually really interesting because he was actually mocked in the late lottery-first round range before Louisville hit a COVID pause in February and his efficiency tanked after.  I’m shocked he’s on a two way because he’s a pretty good prospect    For the Hawks, Johnson and Cooper are just two of the most talented player of the draft, but both probably won’t be able to find minutes his year (which isba food problem to have). Johnson’s a 6-9 forward with a great athleticism and passing but I actually think it’s good if he gets G league mins year 1 because he has been missing alot of games in his development (Injured at Duke and often in high school, in order for dev it makes more sense for him to play G league than 10 NBA mins) and Cooper had a first round grade in every mock/big board. Should be a cool year for both teams"
Plus Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper
Dwight Howard I guess   Jaylen Brown now   Sharife Cooper next 😈
Ong I even joined their sub. Mostly because I’m a fan of Sharife Cooper but also because of that 2 minute long video they post every time they win a game. “You just lost to the Hawks.” Trae was really perfect for the A.
"Yes, we(Baylor) always put him against the biggest scoring threat on the other team. In college he could defend the 1-5 and we also had a beast of an offensive rebounder in Vital that gave us multiple opportunities from 3. I remember Auburn fans saying Sharife Cooper was gonna destroy us and I honestly can't remember a single thing he did all game cuz Davion defended him so well."
You didn’t mention gorgeous dieng or sharife cooper
[YOU JUST LOST TO SHARIFE COOPER 🤡🤡🤡](https://streamable.com/rhdcxd)
Put Sharife Cooper in
"it’s elite. but unlike lamelo, trae, jokic, and sharife cooper, his accuracy as a passer is way behind his vision. hitting a guy on his hip versus his chest is often the difference between a shot being contested or not. it puts him in a lower tier than those other guys, but it’s also exciting because it’s an area that he can work on and improve."
So deep we probably won’t get to see much from Jalen Johnson or Sharife Cooper outside of the g-league 😢
"Sharife Cooper, easily. ROY is a crapshoot."
Sharife Cooper has by far the best odds. Ant has the worst.
Sharife Cooper if Trae Young gets injured and he somehow goes off
Who is this Kai Jones guy and how in the hell was the 19th pick? Dude averaged 9/5 and started 4 of 26 games the year he was drafted. Watched last 5 min of the game and I was in shock when the announcers said he was the 19th pick.   Sharife Cooper was drafted 29 picks behind this dude?!
sharife cooper fell cause he is like 5’10”
More time to show that he’s fat and can’t shoot?  If you’re a PG that can’t shoot youre gonna have a tough time getting drafted. Sharife Cooper was a top 5 playmaker in the draft but fell all the way to 40 and he had all the PT and opportunity in the world
East:   Sharife Cooper - Bogdan Bogdanovic - De'Andre Hunter - John Collins - Clint Capela 😈
Sharife Cooper
Sharife Cooper or Jared Butler probably
"I think this means Sharife Cooper will be taking the spot and if need be the Hawks will roll with small lineups, Collins will be serviceable up front on most nights if it gets to that with injuries"
"I know im a hawks fan but I think we might take the cake.  Our 2nd unit will be some combo of:  PG: Delon Wright/lou Williams  SG: Kevin huerter  SF: Cam Reddish  PF: Gallo  C: OO/Gorgui Deing  Then we have Jalen johnson, Solomon hill and sharife cooper to back those guys up"
You left out Sharife Cooper for the Hawks
Sharife Cooper is legit
Sharife Cooper
"We absolutely refuse to use 2nd round picks, and just keep trading them forward or selling them for cash. We had #33 this draft, and there was a fuck ton of talent left on the board and we traded it for a 2026 2nd and cash. We also waste our two-way spots on random dudes that have basically 0 upside. We could have had Sharife Cooper, BJ Boston, Jared Butler, the list goes on.  A few years ago we had some 30 yr old unathletic undersized PG with no NBA experience, and wasn't even that good in the GLeague take up a two-way spot for the entire season."
Sharife Cooper Trae 2.0
"So, Sharife Cooper might be the best point guard in the nba"
Sharife Cooper is also Trae Young
"a Trae and Sharife backcourt is unrealistic, as they would allow 190 points a game. So, unless things are drastically surprising, Trae would be the starter with Cooper off the bench. If Sharife becomes a good player and garners a large contract, it is really hard to pay that price to a back up PG"
I still can't believe Sharife Cooper dropped to the  2nd round. Dude was a diamond in the rough during summer League.
"I know we have a deep roster and are looking to win more than develop, but I really hope the staff are not singling out the rookies and red-shirts to play harder for a roster spot. I know there's not a rush to get Mays, Sharife, and Jalen out there, but I hope we're seeing them as important assets in the future. Cooper and Johnson especially."
Sharife Cooper on the hawks is nice. Also Kevin huerter
Bro I was begging for him or Sharife Cooper with pick 46 and 47 I like Banton but man i wish we hade one of those 2 instead of David Johnson
"He was really bad at Kentucky in a lot of ways, but no-one thought he drop *that* far. This was a really weird draft in that respect, when guys dropped they *really* dropped.  Jared Butler, Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper, BJ Boston, Keon Johnson, Cam Thomas all absolutely dropped and managed to find themselves of high caliber playoff teams which is pretty wild considering their talent level. If they went lottery/top 10 in another (weaker) draft it wouldn't have surprised me."
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Jalen Green  4. Josh Giddey  5. Franz Wagner  6. Chris Duarte  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Davion Mitchell  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Alperen Sengun  11. Cam Thomas  12. Jeremiah Robinson Earl  13. Jared Butler  14. Sharife Cooper
"everything. absolutely everything. coaching, players making boneheaded decisions, stars not showing up at first, now role players not showing up, sending Jalen Johnson and sharife Cooper to the g league and proceeding to start Solomon Hill and having to give TLC actual rotation minutes."
The Sharife cooper erasure is a crime that I will not tolerate
Yea I’m still amazed a player like Sharife Cooper fell to the 2nd.
"2017 - John Collins  2018 - Trae Young, Kevin Huerter  2019 - Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish  2020 - Onyeka Okongwu  2021 - Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously I'm biased but I'd say the Hawks have drafted better. Every single one of the guys on this list has starter level upside (if they haven't realized it yet) and are going to cause a money squeeze on the Hawks because of how good they all are. The Grizz probably have picked guys better equipped to be rotation and role guys but the Hawks seem to have a lot of guys who would be on a lot of team's starting lineups"
"I think you misspelled Sharife Cooper. Jump shot concerns are overblown, guy will step into the league as one of the better passers right off the bat, and will get to the line at an absurd rate for a rookie.   I will have to somewhat agree on Henry. I love his play on the gritty side of the court. Day 1 stud on that end."

He may not 100% be a first round lock but no one I’ve recently seen has him in the 2nd round like you’re saying.
No Sharife Cooper or Tre Mann?
