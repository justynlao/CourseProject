"Kevin Love just collects his huge amounts of money and basically does nothing but enjoy his life (we all know he's not injured for that long), and nobody gives him shit like they did Andre last year. I feel like that should be talked about more."
Kevin Love at the end....
"I just noticed Kevin Love has only played 2 games this season. Do Cavs fans want to keep him or trade him if possible? He was good last season but looked miserable. The team's ok now, so maybe he'll just be good."
Couldn't even break down Kevin Love in the finals. And once Bogut got hurt we couldn't effectively protect the rim against lebron and Kyrie for 20-25mins a night.
"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, “the best defense is more offense”. We should just double down on the offense. Let’s get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."
I love Harden but you gotta give the ball to Kevin Durant man.
"I love Harden so much now. He is my favorite player in the league after Kevin Durant. Even a year back I hated him to the core, not sure what changed. I want Harden and MDA to win a ring so bad."
"[Kevin Love and JJ Barea were the first to do it](https://www.canishoopus.com/2012/3/24/2899579/love-barea-first-teammates-with-50-and-triple-double-in-the-same-game)  If you gave me a month to guess, I don't think I'd have picked that combination"
In what world is kyrie an all time great? He is a fringe all star who has made 2 all NBA teams in 10 years. Chris Bosh and Kevin love are more all time greats than kyrie

Dikembe Mutombo played 1 career game against Kevin Love
"Yeah I guess my point is it's hard to know what's a true pf in this league rn. There was a time where you could definitively say KG TD Dirk Bosh Josh Smith Griffin Kevin Love, David West, Zach Randolph were all in the league and all consensus pfs. Giannis is kinda one but he's a sort of anomaly imo. Davis is for sure though"
"If you're playing the nuggets, sixers, and Lakers it's going to be pretty important. I think you always need to have weakside rim protection but guys that excel at weakside rim protection aren't guaranteed to be good post defenders, like robert covington is good weakside rim protector but he's a poor post defender, there are tons of skinny long dudes who play really good help weakside defense but they're just too skinny to stop these massive dudes from backing them down, sometimes length and skill can compensate for that lack of strength in the post. A lot that goes into post defense is just raw strength and smarts. Typically though you need to run a drop coverage with really strong post defenders because they're too slow and top heavy to switch out on the perimeter which opens up 3 pt oppurtinies on pick and rolls.   Great teams that win championships typically can play every sort of defense at a high level and make adjustments throughout the game. The only outliers imo are the lebron miami and cleveland teams but some might argue Kevin love and tristan in combination are actually good enough and while the heat did play small they had udonis haslem who plays bigger than his size and they also had joel anthony. Chris Bosh wasn't exactly a pushover either and was kind've impossible to guard from the 5 even though he was kind've an afterthought.   GS best teams excelled at every type of defense for example. They always had the ability to go to draymond at the 5 for their switch heavy schemes and first they had bogut and then they had zaza to deal with good post up guys. Lakers are very similarly built this year. Raptors championship team was also built similarly with gasol and then switchy Ibaka at the 5."
"I honestly don't see a buyout happening either, but it's been reported by 2 sources now (Zach harper and Kevin o'connor).   Now the only way I see this happening is andre requests a buyout and leaves a ton of money on the table. His agent is also kevin love. Management likes to be on good sides with agents now. As we know, we are in the player empowerment era of the league. Players usually get what they want.   And also this would give more minutes to allen. He's due for a new contract and this move will help evaluate him better without drummond there.  Again I don't see it happening but being a nets fan. I hope it will lol."
Conveniently leaves out Kevin Love as well as spark plugs like Jordan Clarkson Rodney Hood and veteran shooters like Kyle Korver and George Hill.  the toughest teams he faced where the pacers who somehow took them to 7 (lol) and Celtics led by rookie jayson tatum. I think KD would do just fine lol
"The only way I could see expiring for expiring happening is if somebody thinks they can resign Drummond and actually want him on the team and don’t want to resign the contracts they’re trading. I definitely don’t want a longer contract for Drummond tho, Kevin love puts us in a tight situation already. It hurts to lose a player like him and get nothing tho. I know we pretty much gave up nothing for him and he ruins our offense, but he does have a natural ability to rebound the shit out of that ball.  Edit: Then again they could just go after him in FA. So we’re fucked lmao, excited to see what magic Koby can pull off."
He is just allergic to the line and his ballhandling is meh. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is point guard. If he hasn't been learning how to get involved offensively with them it isn't a good sign.
It’s insane the kind of narrative people have been spinning about Kevin Love. The dude did nothing to anyone but every but hurt NBA player and fan has to make up these rumors about him being the problem. The stuff IT said about Love was insane in 2018
"&gt;He’s Kevin love but worse on defense?  That's what you were just saying...  So you're telling me you'd take Love over Lauri because of thiccness instead of their Offensive and Defensive efficiency?? I would understand it if you went with the vet aspect of it all, but you decided to double down on that terrible take. Huh."
Lol what? Why would Kevin Love do that to a kid
"“He’s Kevin love but worse at defense” “he’s great offensively but that’s not what the Cavs need”  Garland also shooting 43% from 3 on 4.5 attempts a game is super good too if you wanna talk stats  Has scored in double figures in 10 out of the 12 games he’s played at 20 years old at PG?  Man I’m not sure what you’re talking about but this eye test of yours is something  Edit- hahaha checking your profile never mind I remember you, there’s a reason you have a 20 day old account you got banned from our subreddit. Don’t even bother responding mate, you’re a damn head case"
"He’s Kevin love but worse on defense?   He’s great offensively, but he’s the last person the Cavs need. We have to compensate for sexland with clamps at all other 3 spots"
My god what these cavs could be if they could trade Kevin Love for literally anything
Cavs are the worst franchise. Why would you have two starting centers? Lol they are paying Kevin love Max money. Horrible gm
"Newsflash everybody is fake tough guys especially Kevin Durant. Also, who cares these are grown-ass men, if Klay felt bad later I'm sure he'd apologize, but he probably doesn't and I doubt McGruder gives a shit really. This is a fraternity of 400 or so guys and they don't all have to like each other at all times. Borderline NBA players don't need to be protected from shit talk from all-stars, what they need to do is keep grinding, and next time you play somebody remember that and bring a little extra for those guys. So many people got participation trophies in sports that are trying to dictate the way competitive athletes carry themselves. Klay is a HOFer, a champion. He can punch down if he damn well pleases when it comes to sticking up for his boys. I've met Klay (humblebrag) and he was super nice. I personally thought Klays comments were pretty funny. Also a fan of ""it's a mans league"", totally got to eat those words too, along with Lebron's Halloween cookies. Judging the guy to be a dick because of once or twice trash-talking over a long career is dumb. Be real. If he was on your team you'd love Klay. Chocolate milk, bull-dog lover, silly China stuff, Instagram thot nonsense, stoner, hanging out at Delores park and trying to play some rando's trumpet. Klay is a real one."
Yes and upvote takes like LeBron gave Kevin Love depression and Kyrie should retire at age 28
Im pretty sure Kevin has unresolved issues with the warriors and wont mind a rematch against these warriors although it would never happen. I dont think he has beef with Steph but it looks like he'd love to get one over Dray and Klay. Theres my flaming hot nephew take on this.
"Kevin Love came out about his depression as a professional athlete and now we all gotta be nice to each other, god forbid one of these guys has a panic attack on court again"
"If Russ was so hurt he should have sat. Man if Westbrook was on the Lakers and played like that y'all would have burned Staples down.  Wizards fans are so used to bad teams that they are quite nice. I can't imagine what would be said about him if he played for Philly or Boston.  It annoyed me that he was apparently mad that fans blamed him for the loss. Who should we blame, PJ Tucker? When people stop blaming you is when you're truly lost because that means you have no expectations left. LeBron deserved blamed for his Finals choke and he would agree with that now. Think about how fans don't really blame Kevin Love for their poor Finals performance in 17/18, he isn't considered on that level.  With the glory comes the praise, but fans are gonna get mad when you shit the bed too."
kevin love also the only player in nba history to have his inbound passes hyped up. they've been talking about this since his ucla days.
"Kevin Love was perennial All Star and best PF in the league before LeBron got to him. Just like Bosh, LeBron made him worse. Other greats elevate their teammates. Lebron does the opposite."
"yea the legendary 2016 Cavs superteam with Kevin Love getting concussed and averaging 8 points in the finals. or the 2020 Lakers that everyone was shitting on all year but soon as they won they turned into a ""superteam"""
"Look at Kevin Love, man."
"Banana Republic customer, Kevin Love is engaged to unpaid travel blogger, Kate Bock."
"&gt; There was that story  yeah just like there was that story where lebron gave kevin love depression  Once again, r/nba doesnt understand that people are trying to make drama and stories out of everything"
"Yep, Kevin Love is one of the only few people I see actually moving along the baseline to get a better pass tho"
"HAhahahaha it's still love Russell Westbrook, Fuck Kevin Duraaaant!"
SI model Kevin Love is engaged to Kate Bock.
"If kevin durant has million number of fans i am one of them 🙋🏻. if kevin durant has ten fans i am one of them. if kevin durant have only one fan and that is me 🙋🏼🙋🏽🙋🏾. if kevin durant has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth 😢. if world against the kevin durant, i am against the world ❌🌍☄️. i love #kd till my last breath.. 😍 .. Die Hard fan of kd 🤓🌹. Hit Like If you Think kevin durant Best player &amp; Smart In the world 🤠"
Tell me when Kevin love and Kyrie gets MVP some time in their career like harden and westbrook
Kevin Love on the T-Wolves was a walking double double. So sad the Cavs ruined him
"Kevin Love has the record regardless of when it started, with 54 straight games.  Kevin Garnett and John Stockton are next with 37"
Remember when Joakim Noah did this with Kevin Garnett and then KG told him to go fuck himself??? Loooooool I love Big Ticket but goddamn
Kevin in Love.
It’s not implying when you state it outright.  Kyrie Irving was injured for half that season so of course he didn’t make an all nba team. Kevin Love sacrificed all his stats when he joined the cavs he averaged 26 and 13 the year before he joined the Cavs and 20 and 12 for his entire Minnesota run he was a top 15 guy.   Wade was better than Bron in the Dallas finals and was still a top player in following year even as he was declining.
Kevin Love was not a top 15 player the year they won in 2016 lmao
He is a real potential hall of famer not guys like Blake Griffin and Kevin Love who lose and miss the playoffs every year.
Hey did you know LeBron James gave Kevin Love depression. There’s a whole story about it
"Jokic is the most fun, out of shape looking big to watch since Minnesota Kevin Love."
Klay probably will have 2 years left in league and will look similar to blake griffin does now or westbrook or kevin love...like 50% of their former abilities.  Mcgruder I dunno he could be out of league some day too but klay's time is not far away.
"Eh, probably not. Kevin Love is definitely part of the All Time Cavs but not sure about starting 5 over Nance, Daugherty"
lavine is a guard version of timberwolves kevin love don't fall for the trap. any gm who isn't dumb would take Simmons
"As much as I love Wood, he isn’t Kevin Durant."
"They've had good players over the years, just been mismanaged to hell. I feel bad for the talent out there. I've been rooting for them since they had Kevin Love (they're not my team, I just have a soft spot for them)"
"What? I think it's more of a spacing thing, Lebron is a great attacker but he can't attack the rim consistently with a paint full of people. Putting Kevin Love on the perimeter opened the floor for  lebron."
Because Kevin Love turned into a spot up shooter with lebron. That's not what he's best at.
The reason curry forced the 3 is cause Harrison Barnes was not hitting anything and lebron was ready to block him again at the rim. Curry couldn’t drive and kick it out and he probably wasn’t going to get a layup over lebron. This all helped out love greatly. He did a good job getting a contest in but there was a lot going into that defensive stop besides Kevin love.
"Yeah he did, but he had to adapt to be a third superstar akin to Chris Boch, which is hard when you know you are good enough to be the main man and is used to be the main man. Especially hard when 1 is extremly ball dominant and the other is possibly the GOAT.  Kevin Love is the same now which is why Cavs are doing so good now.  Like maybe not in the finals, but literally every win is important when you want to win the championship."
"&gt;  2 consecutive plays with some of the best defense that has ever been played on steph  this is something I'll never agree with. Yes Love defended those possessions and Curry took bad shots but that's honestly almost entirely on Curry tbh. Dude was in his own head and wanted to force the 3 so badly. Love gave Curry like 4 drives and blow-bys in 5 seconds of playing defense, Steph just didn't want to collapse the defense or finish around the basket. That was very bad from Curry imo since the 3 is the only thing Kevin Love didn't give him, yet it's the shot he forced onto him"
"What's crazy about it? He was a better, more prominent player in an era where players made more money during their respective primes. This the part where we pretend Richard Jefferson was a better player than Kevin Love? lmao"
"When I say ""relatively accurate from range"" i mean you need to guard him at the perimeter because they won't reliably miss. I stopped explaining their tools because the reply is getting long. Base reasoning below.   TLDR In no order: Harden (step back foul draw, relatively accurate, big enough to drive through matchups he can't shake off), KD (Dirk fadeaway is pretty hard to guard, accurate from range, big enough to bully through a lot of matchups), Dame (accurate from range, slightly better handles than steph lets him shake off more defenders, more willing? to drive through dame is probably 10th or out of the list), Kyrie (relatively accurate from range, probably the best handles in the league), Kawhi, Tatum, Jokic, Lebron, Jokic, Luka, AD.   Hmmm so, first of all I think we agree KD is a top ISO player right? even though the stat for 2015-16 disagree. That shows we kind of need to develop some standard for how we measure iso in addition to pure stats. Eye tests are generally biased, but we can get somewhat close to relatively fair. For ISO to work well, you need to be able to consistently beat out a player 1v1. Thats predicated on you having many different ways to score, generally also involving elite handling. Being elite at just one thing makes you predictable, and predictability can often times be exploited as a weakness (Ben Simmons on offense). Curry doesn't really have the size to threaten a drive through by force consistently--his main weapon is how far away he can make a three. That means that even Kevin Love can guard curry because he knows curry will 80% of the time pass or shoot if he isn't receiving the ball already in the paint (which, thats not really shooting shooting). If curry were simmons sized, he'd probably average 40 a night as an illustration of what I mean. Every player I list has the ability to score in more than 2 ways or have the handles to shake off most defenders."
"One Iverson made enemies in every front office outside of Denver and that's questionable if he didn't in Denver. Two Westbrook hasn't shown an unwillingness to go to the bench as was what many thought of him when he was drafted. Three he's a three star recruit that lucked out because circumstances got him in good positions. He wasn't going to be in UCLA until Farmar left, 2 Kevin Love came to the Bruins his sophomore year, 3 he could've stayed but that would be detrimental to his draft stock since Jrue Holiday was coming and UCLA may not have given him the minutes or attention, and lastly Sam Presti wanted him more than what scouts thought. They had Brook Lopez over Westbrook in many mock drafts. So in many respects he's overachieved his entire career now comes can he adapt once his max contract is up."
"Klay was interviewed the whole third quarter, he played little league ball with Kevin Love, they were super good but lost the state championship and Klay was saying it still hurts."
Imagine if the best player on the planet said this. The media would kill Kevin Durant. The media is just going to ignore this because they love Luka Dončić.  Luka Dončić is not a good leader. Luka Dončić has to lead by example. GOAT potential? Please...
There was a time when Ramon Sessions was in the league with Kevin Love and Rudy Gay.   Imagine: Team LoveGaySessions
What if its garland for gay. So you also have Kevin Love on board?
"just b/c he didn't tell people in the media and elsewhere doesn't mean he wasn't in contact with his teammates and management and close friends. They just prefer to keep it in house, so they don't want to talk about it to the media. Now he is back and playing well, and the team is winning, no need to keep dragging this. sometimes you need to step back for self care, for all the BS this sub makes about Kevin Love and mental health, when a player actually steps away to fix things, they sure do love to bash him."
On one of the only nationally televised games we got all year too. Shit was heartbreaking. I remember before the play even happened thinking “well Kevin love is the best outlet passer in the league and it’s lebron fucking James who HATES the wizards. This is probably gonna go in”
"I’m gonna be real, do y’all still have the same trainer from the Kevin Love days? Feels like since 2012 can’t stay healthy."
Gave Kevin Love depression... deported David Blatt.. just unbelievable.
"It's not about the pick and Shamet being incredible, it's about them spending their asset pool and money on a 28 year old scoring forward who isn't a great playmaker, isn't a great defender, doesn't offer significant upside, and is making 38 million for 5 years. At the end of that contract it will be bad, objectively, and I think you be hard pressed to call it a good contract right now.   I'm not attacking anyone, the Cavs gave kevin love a contract that is 2x worse. But the tobias contract was not great."
"For three years in a row demar and Kyle got stopped by a team that had LBJ, kyrie and prime Kevin love. The only team that could stop that is the warriors."
"Yeah dude, must have been hard carrying   Kyrie Irving Kevin Love Chris Bosh Dwayne Wade"
"1. Actually they aren’t rotating them on a substantial level,  as seen by the fact all 3 are playing a ridiculous 40+ minutes  2. Yea you kinda left out 1 little detail about Kyrie playing off ball in Cleveland: they didn’t have a kevin Durant. In your comparison,  the co on-ball presence (Lebron) is harden. So while Kyrie and Bron could just take turns scoring all game, Kyrie and harden can’t do that. Which brings it back to my point about diminishing returns...  3. As you just explained Harden is on ball. But he’s not just on ball and able to do his thing, he has to get the ball to Kyrie AND KD. So he’s more of a traditional PG. So as PG that means he’s not averaging 30, 35 like he normally does. And if he’s not averaging 30-35, well then he ain’t “James Harden”.  Perfect example is Chris Bosh and Kevin love.  Both still good players obviously, but Bosh became a percentage of what he was before (they won a title with him scoring 1 point in a clinching game), and Love at the end became a straight up role player."
"I dont have a lot of feelings towards your team but since I've been watching basketball the wolves always manage to underperform. I remember the Isaiah Rider, Christian Laettner, Tom Gugliotta days..KG era with Marbury...KG with Cassell and Sprewell (best team yall ever had btw)...Kevin Love era...you guys always had talent yet somehow  managed to make the playoffs only 9 times in the last 30 years."
Kevin Love had a 31 rebound game in 2010 with 31 points and 5 assists. Dwight had one in 2018 with 32 points.
"This team sucks obviously, but I really think Edwards, McDaniels and even Vanderbilt are showing great signs of development. Allstars aside (aka KAT and Kevin Love), I can't really think of any Wolves players that developed at all while still on the Wolves."
We're a kevin love and a delly away from being full health and i'm so excited.
It’s what I expected Kevin Love to do with the Cavs. But he didn’t even want to do that lol. Just gets to travel and watch from the pine while he pulls in $30 million per.
"Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Brad Wanamaker, Christian Wood, James Harden"
"&gt; True its popularity but Tobias has been better than siakam vanvleet kemba and sexton and Jimmy butler barely played  Meh.  Dudes that are injured for the year still get in like KD, Curry, and Thompson.  I think Kevin Love was still getting the votes after the he became a Cav and was barely getting 15ppg under Lebron and Kyrie."
"Kevin Love, John Wall, Dreymond Green, Jrue Holiday, and Nassir Little."
Derrick Favors Rudy Gay Kevin Love Ramon Sessions
"Rudy Gay, Derrick White, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Love, Dwayne Bacon"
"* Blake Griffin: 2 years, $75.6M * Russell Westbrook: 3 years, $132.9M * John Wall: 3 years, $132.6M * Kevin Love: 3 years, $91.5M  I'd rather have Blake's contract than Westbrook, Wall, or Love. None of them are helping you win but at least Blake comes off the books 1 year earlier. If you're bad, you might as well be bad and get a good draft pick.  Also, I really really hope not, but Klay Thompson's 5 year, $190M definitely has the potential to be the worst contract in the league..."
"Kevin love. Half the subreddit thinks he’s an integral part of our offense, the other half thinks we’re monumentally better without him"
flash back to when dwayne casey had cj guard kevin love in the post and got smoked
"I mean, both were terribly incompetent. The Wiz were in an easier conference as well. But still, the facts remain the same, and thus he is not equivalent to Minnesota Kevin Love."
Minnesota Kevin Love literally never made the playoffs. Beal has already won 3 playoff series.
He is essentially Minnesota Kevin Love.
"Specifically for these football passes, Kevin Love used to be great at them. Y'know, back when he played NBA basketball."
"How will Minny improve?  1. Sell it to a basketball enthusiast that really cares for the city.  2. Revamp the whole FO, Sports Staff and Coaching Staff. The FO is the reflection of the roster. Bad FO = Bad Roster. Kenny Atkinson will be a good bet for this team to develop. Retain Saunders as top assistant.  3. Chart the direction of the team and recalibrate if KAT is still the Franchise Player of this team. But for DLo, if Atkinson will be the coach, retain him. Else, trade him.  4. Draft well. This is the FOs task. Trade for culture guys and quality vets. This team is young and need guidance.  5. WHATEVER CHANGES ARE MADE, STICK TO IT FOR FIVE YEARS! HAVE PATIENCE!  6. The fans must support the franchise by practicing patience. (Some fans are really patient to the point I am the one running out of patience).  PS: Love went out, Garnett went out and soon KAT will want out if there is no concrete steps to improve the team, especially the upper management.  From,  A Warriors fan tired to see this franchise struggle since Kevin Love went away."
"Didn't even face Draymond in Game 5. Also, are u tryna say without kyrie or Kevin Love he would've won the 2016 series. The answer is clearly no, he did not single handedly carry the 2016 cavs team to a chip."
"Happiness at any level doesn't make you immune to sadness. As we've seen with Robin Williams, or for a more homegrown example in Kevin Love, it doesn't even make you immune to depression or the pitfalls of depression. The ability to empathize with someone's issues, no matter how well off they are outside of them, should be applauded, not met with derision.  &gt; I seriously can't even begin to comprehend how people are literally feeling sorry for a guy who gets paid generational wealth to suffer some mild inconveniences at work.   Your inability to comprehend something doesn't make you correct. It makes you ignorant. You can have your opinions, but you just look stupid when you try to judge others by projecting your opinions onto them."
Kevin Love is the most overrated 3rd option of all time. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were by far the best duo in the NBA in 2016.   I want Bradley Beal to end up on the Los Angeles Lakers. It would make the Los Angeles Lakers a lock to make the NBA Finals and the Finals would be competitive.
"Bro this got me super pissed, I'm ready to go off on that Oompa Loompa motherfucker all over again. KEVIN LOVE IS A SAINT!"
Kevin Love but good at defense
Lakers win this game if they have Kevin Love
Trade AD for Kevin love
"I left Sabonis primarily out in my comment because I really didn't see Prime Sabonis. Older Sabonis was definitely a generational passing big man. His height and IQ helped a lot but the main problem with me putting him at the top was how limited showing it was. He only came to the league at 31 so I'm just going off Jokic compared to the ones I did see.      Edit: And another thing, I feel Jokic passing isn't just limited to post passing. He's a tremendous outlet passer and he does it with such accuracy and can do it effortlessly. It reminds me of younger Duncan on the Spurs and Minnesota Kevin Love. I think those stand out as the two best outlet passers I've seen in the past 15-20 years.  My #1 pet peeve with Jokic passing is sometimes, he does it **too** much where he tries to force it rather than play naturally with it."
"Hmm I guess so.  Wiggins wasnt our pick though, we traded Kevin love for him .  Not sure if youre counting that or not, but people usually do   But anyways , its not like we've tanked, we just suck.  Sadly, the wolves have actually been trying to win but always fail.  And last year was the first time we ever moved up in the lottery.  We are the prime candidates for the type of team that the league wants to get one of the top picks, for the sake of parity."
Did you shake hands like normal humans or like Kelly olynyk? Kevin love would like to know
"Yes but he’s also never played with LeBron. If Kevin Love and Chris Bosh (all-nba players) needed a year to gel, Drummond can’t do it in a few months.  At least he’s succeeded with Blake Griffin so maybe that’ll translate to AD??"
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
Who knew that Kevin Love and Blake Griffin would both fall off the cliff at the same time?
"Are you implying that Kevin Love dropping weight contributed to his injuries? He did have injuries when he was on the Timberwolves, including a broken hand. And considering he's had knee injuries, losing weight was definitely the right choice to make it easier on his body."
"Nah Rubio, Kevin Love, and Nikola ""I'm in the mafia"" Pekovic were awesome to watch"
"Forget about Kevin Love, what ever happened to Kenneth Faried?"
"Yeah that would be it. 2018 Cavs would be nasty too with IT, D Rose, Dywane Wade and Kevin Love"
"Yup. Just to add, Kevin Love is the only player to have HOF Break Starter. And Curry is the only player with HOF Circus Threes (Although Harden should definitely have this one too)."
"Klay for Kevin Love was on the table too before he went to Cleveland.  Man, both of those would've been all time level disasters lol"
"&gt; Warriors only won first year because Mike Conley, Kevin Love, and Kyrie got hurt. Steph is a choker he couldn't win finals mvp. The warriors only went to the finals the following year because Durant choked a 3-1 lead"".  did i say that? why are you saying that to me? lol  cuz i never said that"
"&gt;KD joined a premade championship team that only lost 9 games the previous season.  ""Warriors only won first team because Mike Conley, Kevin Love, and Kyrie got hurt. Steph is a choker he couldn't win finals mvp. The warriors only went to the finals the following year because Durant choked a 3-1 lead"".   It's funny how people can say this nonsense, but then turn around and say the warriors was some all time great team before Durant joined."
Tbf Kevin Love should have had more but Kyrie was selfish and took the last 2 possessions for himself even though love was on 35.
Kevin Love knows about that one
You just called that guy a dumbass and you forgot Kevin Love was an all star in 2018 lmao maybe calm down a little?
"Worldwide, Klay Thompson is a bigger star than Kevin Love"
 Fair enough  u/dallasmavs get:  Kevin Love  Matthew Dellavedova  u/cavs get:  Tim Hardaway Jr.  James Johnson  2021 - RD 2  2022 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/GAnl4zi8i
"Hell no, when it mattered Kevin love was nothing more than a role player, and the team they faced had even better depth than them. If that’s a super team than the Jordan bulls, bird Celtics, magic lakers, and pre-Kd warriors were a super team."
"Same story as kevin love, all they can do athletically is stand near the basket and be tall"
"Because it's Kevin Love. He doesn't even play basketball anymore, he's irrelevant"
I agree 100%. It didn't hit me til now that Kevin Love is a complete non-factor to the NBA. I can't even remember the last time I thought about Kevin Love as someone that could affect a match up between two teams. Has he even played during this season? I really can't remember when I last saw this guy actually play basketball.
"Kevin Love is a basketball player, plays for the Cavs"
Kevin Love is Garreth Bale
"Kevin Love is shorter, older, almost as injury prone and  worse defensively than KP while giving hardly any offensive upgrade."
"&gt; Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com, the Dallas Mavericks feel Love would fix the problems they have had with three-point shooting and defensive rebounding:  &gt;”A source with knowledge of the Mavericks' thinking suggested Kevin Love as a much better fit [than Andre Drummond] given the team's 3-point woes and desire to surround MVP candidate Luka Doncic with shooters. Love would also help boost Dallas' problematic defensive rebounding metrics. Still, the Mavericks have two appealing expiring contracts—Tim Hardaway Jr. ($18 million) and James Johnson ($16 million)—that would help facilitate a deal.""  I apologize for the shitty headline, but I didn’t want to editorialize the link - I tried googling other sources, but only found even shittier headlines.  A “strong” fit =\= a better fit than Drummond"
"This is exactly it...I don't know why people romanticize time in Minnesota.   If ""Good Stats Bad Team Guy"" was a actual person he would be Kevin Love in a Minnesota jersey."

"my family being from kentucky where there isn't a pro team, i loved CBB but wasn't that into the NBA until my ex bf (a texas fan) and i watched so many of kevin durant's games that i knew i had to follow him professionally. dumped the bf but fell in love with the league and have been watching kd since"
"Honestly he is/was looked at very similar to how Kevin Love was looked at in his prime. A franchise player for a mid to low level team but couldn’t lead you to the ship by himself. A great complementary piece on a championship team. Could do it all if you asked but if you had to ask, you probably aren’t a top team in the league."
"It was KHANNNNNN, but they could’ve easily built a playoff team around Kevin go back and look at the picks they had and who they picked after K Love. Also look at Khan’s path to being a GM it’s a joke. Wolves could’ve had a solid foundational team reaching the playoffs on a reg basis."
"Crazy thought. All of Minnesota superstars began with the letter K. Kevin garnett, k love, kat."
"Do we know for sure that Kevin Love still exists? My guy has played in about ten games total over the past three years, and I haven't heard a word about him coming back"
"Except he literally isn't lmao, he is literally historically bad at the rim and every single year he allows over 65% at the rim  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?sort=DEF_RIM_FGA&amp;dir=1   He is Kevin Love bad at the rim, and Kevin Love is arguably the worst rim protector in NBA history, no blocks no nothing and everyone scores on him"
"Easy to forget that these guys played High School and college against thousands of just regular kids. Normal people, whether they knew it or not at the time, meeting future NBA stars.  Like my brother played against Kevin Love. Weird as hell."
"The worst thing LeBron ever did was not commit to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Had he done so instead of sign one or two year contracts, we would have had the promise of some stability when recruiting free agents and coaches. Instead, the best we could ever do before 2015 was sign guys like Larry Hughes and Mo Williams. Had he stuck to his guns and said we’re playing for MY team, Dwyane Wade and either Bosh or Chris Paul would have joined instead of them going to miami and we sleepwalk the East for the next 15 years. The biggest question mark is whether we draft Kyrie Irving with the Clippers’ number one overall in 2011 and with Chris Paul and D Wade I don’t know that we do. At that point was the fo smart enough to avoid the mine field that separated 2 and 9? Best case scenario we draft Valanciunas as the heir apparent to Z but could have very well ended up with Derrick Williams, Enes Kanter, Jan Vesely, or Brandon Knight. On the other hand, maybe we look to add a sharp-shooting backup 2 guard with great defense and championship pedigree in Klay Thompson. Another question is whether David Griffen takes over the GM role? He made some brilliant moves that played a big part in our championship but would we have had a player like Kevin Love in 2015? Would his partnership with AD have started years earlier? Would peak Boogie Cousins or Lamarcus Aldridge have joined up? Would a real coach have come to Cleveland instead of the clown car of HCs we have had?  Safe to say he would have rings. Possible he would enjoy two long spells of consecutive championships broken up by a bad matchup here or there or its not outside the realm of possibility he wins a dozen or more rings"
"&gt;Embiid is consensus MVP on this sub  He has the best record in the East and is putting up monster stats. I dont see what your point is.  &gt; Harden literally got praised for not only being the MVP and best player in the league yesterday, but some tried to argue he's better than Michael Jordan. He's not hated in this sub anymore   &gt;   &gt;Agreed about Westbrook, he gets waaaaay too much hate, but tbf I was talking about superstar caliber players, and Russ isn't anymore, so it's hard to compare his hate to everyone else's   &gt;   &gt;Curry is the most loved player on this sub by far, now I know you're just makin shit up. Some dude even did a study and found that, as every top highlight post was from Curry. Curry has plays made outside of the actual game reach 20k upvotes  So does Curry, Jokic, KD whoever. Its a good game, people get reactionary. Check out the Clippers game after the Nets beat them to see  how much people Hate Harden. He's still hated. Using the most recent example of when someone had a monster game isnt a good example.     They were still doing this to Westbrook during his MVP season.   Curry gets loved but he also get clowned....way harder than Lebron when he has bad games. Its almost as if when you play bad you get clowned on. But even when Lebron and Curry play bad, its way less vitriolic than other Superstars.  Lebron literally has the most up voted post of all time in this sub. He gets SO MUCH love on here. What is your point bro?   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The top post of this sub for a long time was that LeBron gave Kevin Love crippling depression.   &gt;   &gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not\_enough\_is\_made\_of\_the\_fact\_that\_lebron\_got/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not_enough_is_made_of_the_fact_that_lebron_got/)   &gt;   &gt;I can do the same thing you're doing; A lotta posts shit on stars like that, and they all come at times when it's easiest to hate on them.

I'm not takin it to heart, just explainin why you're off there  Dude do you even read your own thread that you are using as an example. Look at the comments in that thread, there arent that many people hating on Lebron(there are people defending Lebron too) as they are supporting Kevin Love. This is such a bad example.   &amp;#x200B;  Yea......you are right, the hate comes at the time its easiest. But none get as vitriolic as it does for other superstars MUCH more than Lebron. LMAO what are people saying about Lebron?? When you're team is losing or you play badly, you get clowned on(and with Lebron its never to the extend that it happens to other players. This is such nonsense.   Dude people were calling Curry a fraud who couldnt carry a team when the Warriors were losing at the beginning of the season. 100 posts?? Yea...I dont believe that.  When you lose people say reactionary nonsense. It happens to everyone. Im not off dude you just have a persecution complex about Lebron.  Get a grip man, even with the minuscule examples you are talking about with Lebron carrying, this is light stuff..like I cant even believe you think this is insulting or perceived as hate. This is very mild compared to ACTUAL hated superstars.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Difference is I've provided examples and agree that a lotta other players get shit on too, but of the top players in the past few months, Bron has more than all of them  You have provided no evidence man. Im not trying to be a jerk here but you couldnt even be bothered to read the thread you linked. The Lakers are 4-6 in their last 10 games dude. Their is no hate, the Lakers are just losing. No one has been hating Lebron, this is just a flat out lie."
"Well take kyrie and Tristan Thompson, and Wiggins off of the caviliers.  That means no kevin love to cleveland   So it would have mostly been LBJ and first/2nd round exits. They would neve4 be good enough for a ring they would never be bad enough for the lottery. Since cleveland is a super small market free agents wouldn't flock over there.   Maybe he steals 1 ring. But he won't have his 4 rings without leaving."

"KAT would be ok with those guys. He is a great shooter, not just for a big man but in general. He woukd have to be relegated to being in the corner like Kevin Love for the Cavaliers."
"Is Kevin Love a full time 5? I know he's not playing right now, but he ought to be one at this point. Defensively, he's too slow to play the 4. But he's also not a strong enough rim protector to play the 5. He's stuck on a no-man's land from a defensive standpoint."
"It took a ridiculous set of circumstances for that to happen. Lebron had to be born in Akron, had to then get drafted by Cleveland + then get guilted into returning + they had Kyrie + the first overall pick so they could acquire Kevin Love; so it wasn't like he was coming to the same terrible he left. That's like hitting three lottery tickets in a 10 year span.  I guess strictly speaking that violates my statement of ""doesn't matter what you do"". I guess I should change it to - pray for rain."
UCLA hasn't been to a final four since Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook were there. A few Sweet 16 bertha are nice for a lot of schools but not one of UCLA's stature.
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
"Kevin Love, his hair is mostly gray"
Theis is literally prime Kevin Love
Bron had Kevin Love in 2018.Everbody knows the weak east where ficking DeRozan was the main threat.  Why don't you feel that Curry makes his teammates better than other stars do? It reflects in the stat when he is on and off the Court.
Is he becoming the next version of Kevin Love in MIN? It looks similar.
"&gt; when you can trade for Paul George, you do so  By that logic, the Warriors totally should have traded Klay Thompson, because when you can trade for 2014 Kevin Love, you do so."
Kevin Love has played 46 minutes this season and is owned $91 MILLION DOLLARS over THREE YEARS lol
"Wiggins still had value his first few years in the league. The wolves could've traded Wiggins instead of LaVine for Butler, and I'm pretty sure Kevin Love was planning to leave the wolves after his contract ended and that's a big reason they traded him."
Bron gave Kevin Love depression
"I should clarify, I'm not faulting Wiggins here I'm just saying think about all of the opportunity costs and poor decisions wolves made around him. Of course there are way worse players out there, but in terms of trading Kevin Love and giving him tons of minutes because he had so much upside, and then giving up a first round pick to get a worse contract. Think of how much better off the wolves would be if they just never made that original trade with the cavaliers."
You guys act like it was minnesota who decided to trade away Kevin love. The nba did that. Lebron made the call and they forced minnesota to do it.  Don't be fools about this
"Tbf it was 2011, 13 and 14  It’s pretty damn lucky but it only amounted to kyrie and Kevin love. If anything Cleveland is just lucky that one of the best players of all time was born nearby"
"The Warriors actually benefited from that. If Curry had turned into a superstar in 2011 or 2012 they wouldn't have had time to complete their rebuild in peace and would've been pressured to trade Klay + Dray for Kevin Love or some other win-now move.  Plus it let them keep Curry for 11 mil a year, opening the door for the most disgusting FA signing of all time."
"Underrated: Larry or Kevin Love, surprisingly  Overrated: I think the world has wised up to Drummond being bad, so maybe at this point, Sexton because he's the only nationally notable Cav."
"Maybe like a Sabonis comp?   Or a young Kevin Love without the range? Wolves Love used to eat up boards and beast in the post, and is one of the best outlet passers of all time.   Just throwing those out to see what you think. I was born in 1987 so I don't know really."
"I'm not too sure. Purely from a talent standpoint I think it's pretty close. I'd argue 2016-17 LeBron was better than he is now, and Kyrie and Kevin Love more than make up for the lack of AD. The Lakers have a bench advantage, but it's not like the 16-17 Cavs' bench was bad. The main reason I would say the Lakers are better is a pretty sizable advantage on defense."
I love how 2018 is always used as the example for this argument. That was literally the only good Rockets team Harden has played for.  And even that is nowhere near a 73-9 team PLUS Kevin Durant.
What if Warriors never traded Richmond for Billy fucking Owens?   What if Warriors actually traded Klay for Kevin Love?   What if Warriors didn’t trade J-Rich?
Joe Harris makes me think Kevin Love v2
Kevin Love
Klay Thompson to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love  Steph Curry to the Bucks for Bogut
"My immature middle school self wanted Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Demarcus Cousins all to be on the same team"
"That could still be your peak though. Look at Kevin Love, he spent his prime years on the Timberwolves, but never won anything. Then he goes to Cleveland and wins a ring. Now, I don't think anyone would argue that Cavs KLove was the best version of himself, even tho he won a ring. The team and organization have a huge impact on winning. Ypur prime is just the best that you were as a player"

"Kevin love, ive already seen him in the booth sometime while he's been injured"
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
"The Celtics front office is frankly inexcusable. Even last year, it was clear that the Celtics needed a big better than Theis if they wanted to make any progress, and that bench depth was lacking. Also, I'm a Sixers fan, and I hate the celtics (I love Brown + Tatum though) usually, but it's still infuriating to watch a FO just tank their very good team in this way.   They did virtually nothing to help, and they completely botched the Myles Turner trade that would have been such a huge help. Danny Ainge needs to go, because his inability to make a single proper move this year is baffling, especially when the needs of the team are so clear. Even now, a move for Drummond would be a huge asset, and Kevin O'Connor suggested that maybe even Vucevic could be available?  And frankly Kemba needs to really get motivated or get benched. I don't understand how he's out there smiling and laughing like he's in wonderland when the team is getting their ass whooped. I get he's a nice guy, but dude you're losing.  The Celtics aren't a problem of core talent. Tatum+Brown+Smart (when he gets back) is a good core, but they need a big, and some back-up."
This has been a problem since at least the Kevin Love days
"Less weight, same strength. He didn't Kevin Love himself."
"Eh, we’ve deactivated Drummond and Kevin Love was originally out 3-4 weeks 8 weeks ago, but has been working out on the court for 4 weeks.  I don’t think we’re being subtle about trying to get everyone on the roster more minutes to see what we have, whether that’s just making this a developmental year or a tank year is up for debate, but I’m 100% certain we’re not putting out the best roster and lineups to win night after night"
What about Kevin Love? Assuming he could stay healthy
"He would not be the first guy to start taking his fitness more seriously after a year or two in the league. Kevin Love comes to mind, lots of others."
"I love the Kevin Harlan call ""it's pure"""
"JJ Redick covered this in his most recent podcast with Kevin Love.  He said that the wine culture developed when the teams started staying the night in other cities after a game instead of immediately leaving right after the game. This led to the team’s having dinner and gave them a place to drink wine.  He said Popovich, Lebron James, and Jimmy Butler were the initial guys to really get into wine and start getting the rest of the league into it."
"Okay, I was thinking today. The Wolves fucked up with KD, they are fucking up with KAT, they didn’t do too well with Kevin Love, they sorta blew it with Jimmy Butler. Why don’t we blame the wolves for Wiggins being a bum so far in his career?"
I mean barely winning 40 games for his career is hardly winning but okay.   You said it yourself Kevin Love was in the west 8th in the east and getting swept barely even counts lol
"If you are winning games when you are having big games then your numbers are by definition not ""empty"".  I didn't say anything about season long ""success"" but at least he carried his team to the playoffs the last two years even if it was the East. Did Kevin Love do that in Minnesota?"
"Why would it have to be a frontcourt player, bunch of times guards replaced big men in the all star game.  From the top of my head Dragic replaced Kevin Love."
Is Sabonis as good as Kevin Love was on the TWolves?
No I don't think so cause Dragic made it in 2018 as replacement for Kevin Love
Kevin Love is washed and done. Your team gonna have to pay for a nobody. Cavs are really lucky Lebron took pity on them.
"A team to match us on players out in those trying times! Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-21) | [](/ATL)Hawks (13-17) ---|---   D.

"You can’t really find anything disproving the Millsap doctrine because it was something made up by Pelton, and isn’t really used in the Nba community. The only reason I knew what you were talking about was because I love Kevin Pelton and he brought it up on the Lowe podcast once.  I would say that it isn’t that per 100 stats on low minute guys can’t carry over too playing big minutes, its just that most of these stats require fairly large minute sample sizes. For BPM for instance it stabilization takes around a season for a full time starter. RBPM can take up to three seasons, so that looking at a guy averaging 17 min in one season and saying that it translates is just not a statement based on any real statistical evidence."
"Kevin Love's situation isn't a fair representation because he played on a Lebron team and he didn't even get adequate usage in his spots. he was a stretch 4, but he was by no means a stretch big like how KAT is now. He was a guy that scored a lot inside the arc and all those spots were taken away from him on the Cavs to let Lebron and Kyrie room to attack inside. I think Love as the second option on a good team could have made the playoffs(not anymore, he's pretty much washed now).  Cousins being the best big was due to the lack of quality bigs during that time, but he was definitely good enough to be part of a playoff team had he gotten any help."
They got fucking swept by one knee Kyrie and a Kevin Love less Cavs. Lebron didn't destroy the Bulls in the 2nd round.
4 years/$30 mil is a tough sell on someone who has been consistently injured. I would give you 1 Kevin Love for him though.
"Kevin love was one of the best PFs. His role on the Cavs was completely different and it hurt him a lot, but that doesn't take away from his Minny days. The west has been a gauntlet for the 21 years. Not making the playoffs isn't an indictment against you when you could easily make it in East."
That the Cavs shouldn’t trade Wiggins for Kevin Love back in 2014. I was really high on Wiggins and didn’t know as much about hoops as I thought I did.
 That's like saying Kevin Love was the best power forward when he was in minnesota. He was the most *productive* center in the NBA for maybe a year or so before he got hurt.
Honestly 2018 cavs D wade  D rose  Isaiah Thomas  LeBron  Kevin Love
"Yep this sub loves to say Skip Bayless has bad Lebron takes and then posts things like ""Lebron gave Kevin Love depression"" or whatever is on the front page right now about Lebron picking up teammates but not Kuz"
Kevin Love but he hasn't played in forever
This is entirely speculation.  Kevin Love has said nothing but wonderful things about LeBron.  Why do you morons come up with this garbage?
PG: Sam Cassell  SG: D'lo  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: KG  C: KAT  6th Man: Kevin Love
"Remember to tell your kids about the time Lebron, kevin love, d wade, IT, crowder, Derrick Rose, JR Smith, Kendrick Perkins and Kyle Korver all played for the cavs at the same time"
"But he gave Kevin Love depression, and Kyrie left because LeBron was the problem.  /s  If a cancer gets you 9/10 finals and a ring for my team, I'll take that lol"
"Exactly. I mean let's look at the last 10 title winning rosters:  2020 Lakers: Lebron had AD  2019 Raptors: Kawhi had Lowry and the best supporting cast in the league  2018 Warriors: No words needed  2017 Warriors: No words needed  2016 Cavs: Lebron had Kyrie and Kevin Love  2015 Warriors: Steph had Klay and Draymond  2014 Spurs: this is the only one in the last 15 years without a superstar. Tho Duncan and Parker were both star caliber players  2013 Heat: Lebron, Wade, Bosh  2012 Heat: Lebron, Wade, Bosh  2011 Mavs: Dirk had no other star  So really in the last 10 years the only championships without a superstar and another star besides him is 2014 and 2011. Dame has never had another star besides him since Aldridge, and Aldidge left before Dame hit his prime."
Even LeBron needed a top 5 guy beside him or multiple allstars. Kevin Love in 2014 was a walking 26-15 guy and Kyrie was about to enter his peak.   Dirk is the only example in recent time where the gap between the 1A option (Dirk) and the second option was that huge.
&gt; Only big man i've ever seen snuff out Curry 1-on-1  Kevin Love: Am I joke to you?
Fit? Not even close.  Kevin Love and TT were huge liabiliies in that series. AD would be a massive upgrade.
Kevin Love did that too.
True. I used to be amazed Kevin Love wasn’t up for MVPs or talked about more but he was just putting up numbers on a bad team. Russ is great but he made the triple dbl meaningless unfortunately.
kevin love
The Hawks 2014-15 come to mind. A 60 win team that was swept by LeBron's Cavs (minus Kyrie and Kevin Love from memory)
"""Aldridge can't move anymore, he has no defense.""  ""Blake can't run, he can't even dunk anymore.""  Damn clowns around here are too blind to notice the difference between a washed out player and a player who lack the will/desire to play for their team anymore. These are obviously not the stars they were before but I would be willing to bet they are still better than 90% of the buyouts of the past 10 years.   Same clowns will somehow be surprised if Kevin Love is traded and he starts playing well again."
"it's called LeBronto because Dwane Casey had CJ Miles guarding Kevin Love and the Cavs shot an absolutely absurd 41% from three  yes LeBron absolutely murdered us but a large part of that was Cleveland playing infuriatingly well and hitting ridiculous shots that had no business going in - mix that with bad coaching and a star who couldn't take us where we need to go and yeah it was kinda inevitable  the raptors would've had seven of the best ten players in a series between the teams, that is NOT just 'better individual role players', that's just a better team eh  at the end of this it's all hypothetical but if you're really gonna go with *the Lakers built around them and they function better as team* then lol  also he isn't called LeBronto he turned Toronto into LeBronto that's the meme"
"&gt; even if k live under performed  He literally averaged 8.5 points and 1.3 assists and shot 36-26-71.   Over Games 5, 6, and 7, he averaged 6.0 points and 2.0 assists and shot 29-13-70.  That's not just simply under performing...  Kevin Love was a star for the Timberwolves, some people even saying he was around a top 10 player at times. He was never anywhere close to that player with the Cavaliers. People really need to stop acting like he was."
He had a first overall pick teaching his prime and traded another number 1 overall pick for a star in kevin love. Those were three star players even if k live under performed
Their issue was interior defense. You’re never gonna have a good defense with Kevin love as your back line defender
"contrary to popular belief, Kevin Love did actually leave the bench for once this season"
"Both of them are all-time great floor raisers.  But Jordan is a better ceiling raiser.  In Miami, LeBron barely won 2 of 4 titles.  He could easily have lost in 2013 as well, making it 1 of 4.  The Heat went into all four of those Finals as huge favorites, and three out of four times they underachieved. LeBron greatly diminished Bosh (and later did the same to Kevin Love).  Even Wade had to defer to LeBron for the sake of the team."
Kevin love when healthy shoots a face up bank shot the majority of the time in the post
"cleveland lebron had to carry more than 2013 lebron, people say the 2016 cavs were a super team but they weren't in reality considering kevin love only averaged 8 points and 6 boards on 36 percent fg in the finals,   cleveland lebron never had a 2011 he always showed up  as good as lebron was during the regular season in 2009 he did not make the finals although it was not his fault he nearly averaged a 40 point triple double  also 2018 lebron might be peak playoff lebron, it's probably the toughest teams he ever had to face before the finals ever in his entire career and he overcame that and made the finals"
"You do realize the game is a team sport right? Which is why 1 elite player takes a terrible team deep into playoffs it’s an amazing achievement no matter how bad a conference is, and the fact that he had no chance to win in the finals is irrelevant   2018 he had 8 40+ point games, beat Boston on the road when they hadn’t lost a game at home in the playoffs, without Kevin love  He puts up 51/8/8 in his 101st game of the season off the back of an 8th consecutive finals run and would’ve taken a game off the biggest collection of talent in 1 team were it not for a mistake by JR  Cavs went from being in the NBA finals to 19 wins just from losing him  You’re blinded by hate man"
"LeBron has played with Kyrie, Wade, Bosh, AD, ray allen,  Shaq (okay wayyy past his prime), Kevin Love. I think those players are just as top tier as KD’s but that GSW team was way more than the sum of its parts before KD joined so it will definitely be looked at differently"
"That 2013-14 season was such a carry job by Dragic.   They almost made the playoffs (and had a better record than Kevin Love Timberwolves) with 43 games of Bledsoe, the Morris twins, Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, Channing Frye, and PJ Tucker as the core."
"Holy crap I'd love for someone to make a parody of that ""Adam Ruins Everything"" series with ""Kevin Ruins Everything"" showing him surrounded by All-Stars in multiple jerseys."
Kevin Love being considered a star
I mean Ja broke this sub when he t bagged Kevin love and that was a missed dunk lol
Lebron 2018 had solid role players and borderline all star in kevin love
"The teams he faced weren't amazing, I agree. But look at his teammates. His best teammate, Kevin Love, shot 50% TS in the playoffs. Replace Bron with any other Top 5 player and the Cavs wouldn't have made the Finals."
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
"I just love how they casually subbed in Kevin Durant at the end of the half, it’s like they’re playing MyTeam"
"You're right, whether it's PF or C, there's always been skilled and great bigs playing--it's just that the positions have really evolved throughout the years. This is nephew-level take from OP. The back-to-back MVP is a big who is fast and skilled like a wing, and has playmaking abilities. In 2017-18: Anthony Davis was third, Giannis sixth, and Durant seventh in votes. In 2013-14, Joakim Noah was fourth in votes. In 2012-13, Tim Duncan was seventh in votes. In 2011-12, Kevin Love was sixth and Dwight Howard seventh in votes. In 2010-11, Dwight Howard was second and Dirk sixth in votes.  OP is romanticizing this too much. It was only eight years removed when Noah was a point-center in the MVP discussion, just not as good as Jokic. A lot of bigs have adapted a perimeter game and some play like a wing (or are wings but are tall like centers). Either way, the ""bigs"" are not likely to go away; they'll just keep adapting and evolving."
"The west was absolutely loaded with great teams during his prime. Phoenix, Portland, Houston, Lakers, Seattle, and Utah were all really good. I guess we can’t give Lebron any credit because he couldn’t win a championship without Kyrie, Dywane Wade, Bosh, Kevin Love, or AD on his team."
"Yep, also the same team that had a negative point differential in their first round series against the Pacers. The same team whose second-leading playoff scorer was Kevin Love averaging 15 PPG on 51 TS%."
"Swap out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Love and I think that's the ""1st team All-bad-money"""

"Come on man, Kevin love AND Kylie got hurt in 2015 - the second best player on the cavs in the FINALS was matthew delivadova.   You mention his record vs KD and his record Vs Steph. How about the fact that after being the “best team of all time”, steph’s warriors were so afraid of Lebron they recruited the second best player in the game to guarantee victory.  KD left a team who was up on that same warriors squad 3-1 to make sure he couldn’t lose. You really want to count those records?  2018 - look at how bad that team was, almost as awful as 2007.    Not to mention Lebron had historic runs in the Miami playoffs as well those four years (d wade hurts knee, Lebron completely shuts down mvp d ros, etc)  Lebron vs Duncan: ummm those Spurs teams had 3-4 all star/hall of fame players with possibly the greatest coach ever?  And that same team had to run an AC conspiracy to win the 2014 finals.   The only thing Shoddy about you is your take on Lebron.   Here’s the real take: LBJ is the best playoff player of all time."
"&gt; The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.   That's a result of a salary cap system where you have four players taking up $130 million in annual salary, with a salary cap that is only $109 million.  The league is literally set up to make sure it becomes impossible to effectively construct a winning roster over many years. It's the sole reason why we do not have perpetual dynasties in the NBA.   &gt;They also passed on Myles Turner this summer. They passed on Jimmy Butler. Didn’t get Vuc. Passed on CP3 in 2013. Paul George on the Pacers. Kevin love in 2014. I mean seriously should I go on?  I mean, the only pass that isn't a clearly good pass there is Jimmy Buttler, and with his history of ""locker room issues"", that's hardly something you can blame them for. I'm not sure anyone other than Pat Riley could have gotten him on the right track.   &gt;He’s never been a serious MVP candidate. Has been a gem on a bad team never winning anything in the playoffs and has injury concerns. Now, am I talking about KAT or AD? Who’s the risk?   AD has absolutely been an MVP candidate.  Neither KAT nor AD are risks, but I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that AD is significantly more valuable than KAT.   &gt;Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That’s sad.  Of course it is. One ring is obviously *much* more important to a franchise that has never won one. Only 19 of the 30 teams in the NBA has ever won a championship. 10 out of 30 has won more than one.  Winning *a ring* should be the number one priority for almost every team in the league, without question.   &gt;Part of the Lakers “history” is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Yeah, good thing they never shafted someone like Shaq.   Oh, wait.  &gt;Oh and you know who cited Thomas’ situation as a reason he didn’t want to be in Boston? AD.   He sure did, but literally everyone knew his only destination was the Lakers. He also pretended like he was interested in Knicks, like literally every single major free agent player does. And none of them *actually* have any intentions to play there.  It's almost as if the publicly released statements celebrities make aren't always the truth.  Almost.  &gt;How did the bulls shaft MJ? Are you fucking serious? Do you not remember how the late 90s went for him vs the org ?   So you're talking about *the one time* Krause actually said *organizations win championships, not players*? The statement which Krause clearly and sensibly explained in a rational matter literally the next day.  &gt;At this point dude, you’re in straight denial. Read your last paragraph. Then read it 10 more times. Goodbye.  I'm not in denial, you're just trying to argue revisionist history like you're on the Fox News editorial staff."

Kevin Love had a 90% season shooting 5 a game. Is like 83% for his career.
Curry was injured in the same season as KD during the playoffs. And curry took the team to the finals.  Curry was injured in 2016 with a sprained MCL. Pretty obvious when a top 3 ball handler of all time can't break down kevin love. And then absolutely cooks lebron the following year.
"People love to tout accomplishments of players when they're playing, but the first and most important ability is availability.  Steph and especially KD are not durable players.  The Warriors lost the 2019 NBA Finals primarily because their best player, Kevin Durant, got injured in game 1.  The Nets were a 7-seed in 2020 because their best player, Kevin Durant, was out for the whole season.  The 2015 Oklahoma City Thunder missed the playoffs because their best player, Kevin Durant, was injured for most of the season.  In the 2016 playoffs Steph Curry's play regressed a fair amount from his regular season MVP performance - rolling his ankle and being injured for 6 playoff games likely didn't do him any favors.  James Harden has **never** had a significant injury - I was legitimately shocked to see the news that Harden will be out for at least 10 days with a hamstring injury.  I would bet that if the playoffs were today, Harden would play through it.  But I cannot remember a time where Harden had to miss more than a week because of injury.  Sure, when they play at full health, Durant and Curry may be better than Harden.  But the only player in the past 10 years anyone can argue is anywhere near as durable as Harden is Lebron.  Doesn't this count for something?"
Kevin love and KG still the only hoopers with rings.
"“Got rocked” lmao.   got bailed out by a suspension to Draymond, Kyrie hitting one of the clutches shots of all time, and Kevin Love putting the clamps on Steph.  I fucking hate the warriors and like Lebron, but you stans are thirsty as fuck."
Kevin Love Lol.
Yeah dude. I felt like Kevin Love that week and Utah was LeBron 😞
Kevin Love and Michael Beasley. Just because i vividly remember them both (More so Beasley) dominating as Freshman in college at the same time. Although I always thought Beas would have the better career.
"We'll trade you Kevin Love for the right offer - great center.   Zeller, LaMelo, PJ Washington and Miles Bridges match salaries with Love, just saying..."
You seem like a happy guy. Oh and Kevin Love is a GOAT contract
"It's a huge thing if a C can make open 3s regardless of the release, to draw rim protectors out of the paint.  Javale's career DRB% is 21.2. Wiseman is at 21.4 this season. There is a big difference in ORB%, like with all bigs that shoot outside. Look at Kevin Love before and after he started shooting 3s. Some people think it's worth it, some don't. I'm pretty split on the issue.  I also think he will improve his rebounding. He gets a hand on a lot of boards that he doesn't end up securing. I think he will gain strength and haul those in."
"Yeah that’s accurate that it’s rare, especially if you win rookie of the year. It’s also only been around since 1986. The superstar winners would probably be Tracy McGrady, Kevin Love, Paul George, Jimmy Butler and Giannis."
I was trying to figure out who the thicc white dude on Minnesota was and I realized it was Kevin Love lol
&gt;dude in his prime couldn't get a good shot off of DPOY Kevin love  Yeah let's judge a player's entire prime based on one play lol. Of course it's a Knicks flair.
"Nothing is guaranteed, but Wiggins got Cleveland Kevin Love and that worked out well."
"Are you giving Steph excuses when he 28, demanded the iso, rejected open teammates, and failed to create a good shot off of Kevin Love?"
"Lol, this is so dumb, Steph never in his career was an heavy iso player. He literally get half of his shots by off-ball movements (dude in his prime couldn't get a good shot off of DPOY Kevin love). Also why would you want Steph to have such a offensive load for a 34 year old player, even if you guys make the playoff you guys are getting bounced by much more talented teams."
Kevin love. Always hurt and making 30+ million
"Jimmer goes to Minnesota and becomes the white kobe and Shaq with chubby Beast Kevin Love. They run an all white lineup with Jimmer Shved AK47 Love Pek. They go to the finals after Jimmer wins his first mvp. Donald sterling gives all his worth to buy the Timberwolves, he slurs MJ instead of magic since he’s in the Midwest. MJ come back and joins Lebron in Cleveland. Sterling is banned but MJ and Lebron get fucking smacked by Jimmer and chubby Kevin love. Also Zion goes to the Hawks"
"For a franchise that is so often horrible, they've managed to have a lot of VERY talented players.   Garnett. Kevin Love. KAT, Jimmy Buckets. Spreewell. Anthony Edwards. LaVine. Mayo.  And for a franchise that has done so well in the draft,, they have also done REALLY bad.   They drafted KG and Allen, who would go onto win a title together... for another team!  Sure... they got KAT, Edwards, LaVine, Garnett, Allen, Mayo, Pekovic.  &amp;#x200B;  But they pass up on Steph (in favour of Johnny Flynn), draft Lauri but trade him and picked him over Mitchell, missed out on Herro. Got Wiggins in the Love trade instead of Embiid (though that was Cleveland's fault).   &amp;#x200B;  I don't know what to make of that franchise's lack of luck."
"I see you couldn’t provide source?  Go take a look at individual RAPM seasons, and you’ll see that massive amounts of outliers. The 19-20 season all has Aaron Holiday, Jrue Holiday and Siakam ranked in the top 10. AD the guy who was first team all NBA is ranked in the 20s after Lou Williams at 13 and just after Kevin Love at 19. And that’s just a few. No model is perfect but that is ridiculous.  I could go on. No one. And I mean no one uses single seasons rating of RAPM to mean anything. The RAPTOR guys recommend no period less than 5 years. Goldstein said minimum 7.  And no one said any of these stats are perfect. But the whole point of RAPTOR and Lebron is that they use shorter time to stabilize. Lebron is ranked poorly defensively in both of them.   Yeah there is pretty big difference between 9 and 1 buddy. Being the 6 best defensive center in the league and being number 1 is pretty fucking different.  I mean if he says LEBRON is an elite defender when none of the advanced models say so, then he is saying his own (and everyone else’s) models suck.  Why would you take your own eye test? Are you an NBA scout? Do you watch the all 10 footage and know what the defensive plays are, and who messed up? You are the one who said to compare it to the eye test not me."
Wiseman and pick for Kevin Love. Sounds like a deal
Kevin Love is robbing CLE so hard. He's legit awful and has killed multiple possessions for the Cavs.
Tbh as a player apart from what he did to kevin love i really liked him. Has way more b-ball-iq than what you'd expect of a shaggy look a like lol. Was honestly disappointed when we didn't keep him
"According to Max Preps it's :     Kevin Durant   Dwight Howard   Kevin Love   Derek Rose    Sebastian Telfair   OJ Mayo    Greg Oden     Idk, I'm not like super into high school basketball or even college basketball recruiting, but I do remember the hype around Durant. I don't really remember it for any of those other dudes besides, funny enough, Telfair."
"I love idiots like you.   The reason the Celtics have so many Hall of Famers from the 60s is because they all won so many championships. If Wilt was good enough to carry his team past Russell, his supporting cast would all be enshrined as well.  &gt; bill is literally kevin garnett on steroids  So he's a ""top 10-12 player all time"" on steroids? Makes sense he'd be one of the best all time."
I'm pretty sure you would get ANT in a deal for Simmons.  Look at what Kevin Love went for. You don't think you could get a good deal for Simmons when every trade involving a star to a desperate team is including multiple firsts these days? Even the trade for Aaron Gordon lol.
Bruh they used to call us a super team when the second best player behind LeBron was Kevin Love. LeBron by himself is a super team to these guys lol
Cleveland super team outside of lebron and Kyrie was the other all nba player it sure was not Kevin love go look at the postseason runs and what he averaged that cavs team was never the clear cut favorites and if they were it was only because lebron was on that team
When he teams up that team is never the clear cut favorites are they? When the heat got together people had celtics coming out of the East that year and Bulls ended up getting the number seed. On the cavs he missed almost a month and a half and Kevin love may have been an all nba player before but he was not the same on the Cavs that team and the warriors were evenly balanced that’s why it went to 7 games sheesh it’s not like what KD did and they went 15-1 in the postseason lmao
Kings fans always dreamed of getting Kevin love so we could have gay love cousins.
Pretty sure game 7 is more important then game 6 lol cmon man you’re just embarrassing yourself now. Also we can all bring up moments where a player struggled. I remember Curry getting locked down by Kevin love of all people and Curry being the “leader” of a team that blew a 3-1 lead in the finals. I don’t bring that stuff up because one moment doesn’t matter. Over a course of a season is more telling
Bro trading our whole bench for Kevin Love would be a W
"He has the worst contract in the league, besides maybe Kevin Love."
Seeing KG leave and go get his chip in Boston and then losing Kevin Love and see him win one with the Cavs... and now seeing Towns rotting away in that dumpsterfire of a team...
&gt; Kevin Love (more)  lmao
The next Kevin love?
Kevin Love has been injured too are you just ignorant of that?
Goran Dragic  JJ Redick  Joe Ingles  Draymond Green  Kevin Love
It’s Kevin Love all over again. Except KAT is better than KLove.
Kevin Garnett?  Kevin Love?

"Kevin Love can still produce very good basketball, but he doesn't fit well into the Cavaliers' rebuilding project."
Around what the Wolves got for Kevin Love.
Nice of Kevin Love to make it appearance
"wait, kevin love actually exists? I thought we were just joking"
"&gt; Speaking to Bob Fitzgerald on KNBR, Durant put fact over fiction when answering the age-old question of how tall he really is.  &gt; ""Since I love you guys so much, I was recorded at 6'10"" and three-quarters with no shoes, so with my shoes on I'm 7-feet,"" Durant finally revealed.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/amp/"
"I honestly believe that if they didn't get KG, they'd either not exist right now or be sold/relocated.  People are mentioning the Kings in this thread, but I think Minnesota beats them out just because they had KG, they had Kevin Love, and (so far) they have KAT, and they still haven't been able to do anything across those 15 years."
"Do athletic players careers not last as long? I always hear about this but I am not sure this really is the case. We all know about Derrick Rose who suffered an injury or someone like Cam Newton in the NFL but athletic players can afford to lose a step while borderline slow players can't. Like Kevin Love and Blake Griffin are both the same position and same age and 1 was an athletic freak while the other one was very skilled. They are both dropping off at around the same age. Zion Williamson isn't just really athletic, he also has really great BBIQ so I think he can be someone who continues to develop skills as he ages like Karl Malone and Lebron James did."
"It kinda blows my mind Kevin Love is just healthy and not playing without being diagnosed with any mental disorders.  Like I get the Cavs have chosen to not pursue this, but they could definitely be docking his salary for doing this right?"
This comment made me miss husky Kevin Love
Nic wanted to play just didn't get a chance. Kevin Love is choosing not to play.
Kevin Love has entered the chat...
Kevin Love (basically) didn’t play in game 6 and 7. Their second best player was Jeff Green lol
"I probably would too.  And, well, an in his prime Kevin Love over KAT too probably."
"I think Kevin Love is the worst one ever because it was a stupid contract at the time. Guys like Wall and Klay at least got injured. We knew Love wasn’t actually a player that impacted winning before he got that deal, and it made no sense bringing him back after LeBron left."
"Feels super important to point out that the salary cap has nearly doubled since Arenas signed his deal  So while the Kevin Love deal may have been for more money, it was far less a percentage of available cap space and therefore not as bad"
"all those weepy fuckin praising comments and threads about kevin love and demar talking about their mental health, and this thread is full of people agreeing that love is currently not dealing with any health issues and that he's a lockerroom cancer for having those issues. wild shit man wild shit"
"KAT being a top 5 center I feel like is more about a lack of high quality centers in the league.   Maybe he is truly one of the best despite that lack, but I don't see him being the alpha guy on his team.      Perfect fit for a Kevin Love, Chris Bosh  3 spot."
am I a joke to you - Kevin Love  me too - CP3
"Amazing how he did that by himself and that he didn't have 3 other all stars with him plus a great bench. At least the Cavs were full strength in their first, wait, they didn't have Kevin Love and were down 2-1 until Kyrie was out too. Kevin Durant had nothing to do with it either, right, the all around better player than Steph yeah he held them back.  Steph had a good run but the Suns gonna shit on them from now on sorry."
"Bruh I legit thought of K Love cause you said Kevin, probably should stick with KD or Durant"
Man Kevin Love is one handsome dude.
Kevin Love isn’t better than Kobe or Steph
"I dont know that, in light of all the attention people like Kevin Love and others have received, that the mental health aspect of this story is being properly portrayed. This is a REAL, deep-seated psychological problem. To see this guy, in real time, battle through this is an insanely inspiring story. Its obvious this isnt something hes doing for attention. On the contrary, he seems to be somewhat insecure or embarrassed about it. Good for him."
Embiid didn't start playing until 2016-2017 and they traded the first overall pick for Kevin Love anyways  Would Embiid push out KAT or would they find a way to play with each other is the real question
KAT is a fake star and so is Kevin Love. Edwards is the only real star player the Wolves have had since Garnett and Butler.
Him and Kevin Love seem pretty close
"&gt;This is factually incorrect as Kyrie Irving was not a max contract player in 2018, he had a salary of $18.8M (**half** of what Kemba is due to earn next year!).   Maybe you should read up on how the salary cap works. Kyrie's contract was a max extension at the time that he signed it. He was on a max contract. The value of a max contract changes year to year and based on experience. For example, Steph Curry makes $43M, so is Kemba not on a max deal?   &gt;And even if you think they ever had a chance of beating Lebron, if they made the finals they were going to lose to the Warriors in 5 games.  They were not at all legitimate contenders that year.   They definitely had a chance of beating Lebron. They were up 3-2 and were in the lead in the 4th quarter of game 7.   And being in the finals makes you a contender. People could have said that the raptors weren't really contenders. Then KD and Klay went down and look what happened.    &gt;I am telling you, it is completely unprecedented and a ridiculous concept for a team to be a **real** contender when you have a bad max contract.   Kevin Love - 9 pts, 7 rebs in the finals - 15 pts, 6 rebs in ECF with very bad defence = nba champion   Michael Finley - 2006 Mavs - 4th highest paid player in the NBA, didn't play   Keith Van Horn - 2006 Mavs - 14th highest paid player in the NBA, played 12mpg   David Lee - 2015 Warriors, highest paid player on 25% of salary cap, played 8mpg in the playoffs   Larry Hughes - 2007 Cavs averaged 11ppg in the playoffs, paid 25% of the cap   Patrick Ewing 1999 - highest paid player in the NBA, injured for the playoffs, knicks made the finals   I'm not going to keep going back but I've proven my point.   20, 4 &amp; 5 of decent efficiency is not bad relative to the examples above. Its not what you hope for from a max contract but its a nice player.   By this logic Mike Conley and Tobias Harris are bad max contracts, too. And they are on the two 1 seeds."
Same with Kevin Love.   It’s tradition for the Timberwolves to get a franchise big and waste away their best years.
We were selling out games during the Kevin Love era when we were still under 40 wins. Give this city a .500 team and that place will be packed again.
I lost so much on that game. Pissed me off because Kevin Love got that exact call literally a week earlier on the cavs.
Lmao kevin love gave hilter depression!
"Unrelated but Kevin Harlan really is a national treasure. Love the enthusiasm he shows for all sports/games, and the fact that he’ll randomly drop words like “brouhaha” all the time is really endearing to me :)"
Excuse me? That's obviously next season. They're trading Kevin Love for LeBron and a bunch of picks /s
Omg I love you Kevin Harlan. I had to listen to Marv for like 2.5 hours
CP3 will beat LeMao.  I'll never forgive LeScissor for giving Kevin Love depression.
"Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Karl Anthony-Towns, Terrell Brandon, Tom Gugliotta, Tony Campbell, Al Jefferson,  Wally Szczerbiak, Sam Cassell, Stephon Marbury, Isaiah Rider, Jimmy Butler"
"Kevin Love averaging 16/10/2 in 2015/16 is the best I got off the top, but even that is better than Kemba this season.  Keep in mind, he's been really hurt all year and has played a lot better the  last few weeks.  If he's a bit healthier next year, his contribution should be comparable to 2016 Love on the Cavs."
He certainly saved our asses. Imagine if we'd traded Splash Bro Klay for Kevin Love... my god.
"For me, the primary reason was his secret deal to Joe Smith to give him 3 1-year contracts in order to get around cap issues. This cost them 4 1st round draft picks (2000-2005) when the league found out. Not having those 4 draft picks led to KG having the worst supporting cast and little leverage to do anything but waste his prime leading to his eventual trade to Boston. (edit - this really cemented us as the worst franchise, because had they been able to build a winning mentality during those KG years, it may have carried over to the Kevin Love years, the KAT years, etc)."
"Here are some of my sources!     BTW, none of this is Durant slander. Dude is a walking bucket and I love watching him play. I just think he gets a smidge too much credit for the rings, and Harden doesn't get his just dues.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html   https://www.landofbasketball.com/player\_comparison/kevin\_durant\_vs\_james\_harden.htm"
"this comment made me look a little deeper...  he has attempted 252 field goals and 51 free throws.   kevin love is effectively paid $103,300 per shot attempt"
Kevin Love will finish Cleveland off on Sunday with a 30-30 throwback win against the Nets while screaming you f-in need me.
"**Kevin Love**  Love is being paid $31,300,000 this season   He’s made a total of 305 points   That comes out to an insane $102,622.95 per shot.   Combined with him being a locker room cancer, I can’t think off a worse contract right now"
Sure thing. Kevin Love and LeBron James ^Jr
"In the Cavs championship year Love averaged 16pts and 10 rebounds.   In the Rockets years w/ CP3 and Harden, Capela had 14pts and 11 rebounds and 16 pts and 13 rebounds while being a much bigger defensive presence than Kevin Love.   Kevin Love was an all-star by name but his performance on the Cavs was as a key role player, just like Capela. KLoves role was different but he was still playing a role really well, not the star of the team. That's usually what the 3rd option does in a Big 3."
Clint was a solid role player. Kevin love was an allstarvbefore. There’s a difference. Clint just knows his role and does it very well
"Chris Paul, James Harden, and Clinton Capela is a really solid big 3. I know Clint will probably get some hate to put him in a big 3... but if lebrons second run with the Cavs is considered a super team with kyrie and Kevin love, then so should that rockets squad."

"I don’t even mind drafting AB. No matter how good that pick was, we were trading them for Kevin love. Had he turned out to be an absolute super star like Giannis i would probably have more regrets not less."
I unironically want to trade for kevin love. Do not ask how i will not answer.
Management just figured playing Kevin Love 30 mins would result in a loss.  Oops
"If LeBron had this Kevin Love during his 2nd run with the Cavs, he'd have gone 3-1 vs the Warriors instead of 1-3."
So is Kevin Love
Why’s bron chatting up olynyk after the Kevin love arm incident
Kevin Love remembers the shoulder.  Although Olynyk isn't withe team anymore....   I got nothing....
"Kevin Love is still good enough to get the Knicks to the postseason, will someone please part with a second round pick and take him already? You’re all missing out"
"I don't know man, even with those 3 #1 pick, I'd still be pissed if we're out of the running for yet another because Kevin Love decides to become a 2012 version of himself at the worst possible time"
"&gt;did nurse get them over the hump?  As far as the Casey situation goes, I think the image of Kevin Love roasting CJ Miles repeatedly on post-ups in the playoffs is burned into the minds of every Raptors fan"
"I'm almost certain that the 06 Mavs would win. No one would be able to stop Dirk on that roster. Dirk was averaging 27/9/3 on 50/40/90. Prime Dirk being guarded by Kevin Love? BBQ chicken. Then you had Josh Howard and JET who were 20ppg guys, and then Jerry Stackhouse, Marquis Daniels, Devin Harris, Ketih Van Horn who could go off for 20 points on any given night.  Sure, LeBron will get his points, but Dallas just has way too many threats. They won 60 games that year, had the league's best offense and the 11th best defense."
Fuck Kevin Love for not getting with the program. Mother fucker fits out like its his job.
Yeah Mo Bamba is our Kevin Love he will stick it to us.
I always liked Kevin Love :)
"There's something ironic in Kevin Love finally deciding to play and kicking both Cavs and Celtics in the nuts with this, it's the ultimate fuck you and I love it"
It's because Kevin Love dominated in 2021 with 30 and 14.
Can you really complain about lottery luck when you got Lebron and Kyrie?  You also got #1 overall two other times in the last decade and used one of those to get Kevin Love who helped you win a championship.  The draft has been more than kind to you.  The Atlanta Hawks have picked #1 once back in 1975 . Talk about bad luck
"yo man cheer up, at least you got to watch Kevin Love drive a dagger through the last bit of hope even the biggest of Celtics homers might have. You love to see it"
Thank you Kevin Love
"So angry at the outcome of this game.    Fuck the Cavs. In particular fuck you Kevin Love, you’ve played less than 25 games and have only scored over twenty ONCE and you choose to go off for 30 in a game we needed to lose. FUCK.    Fuck the Celtics, what the fuck are you guys doing. You couldn’t even score 100 against a team that has lost the last ELEVEN straight, and has EIGHT guys out. Y’all are so trash.    Fuck the flattened lottery odds for giving us shit luck year after year. Thank god Koby and the Cavs FO has at least hit on picks.    lastly, FUCK Houston, Orlando, Detroit and OKC especially for being so terrible. Jesus Christ I can’t even believe there’s 4 worse teams than us but it is what it is.    You guys already know this is the game that is gonna result in us dropping from getting the 3rd pick to some bullshit like 7 or 8. Because of course it is."
Lindsay Gottlieb gave Kevin Love depression
VINTAGE KEVIN LOVE
Cavs fans: fuck Kevin Love for not playing and giving up on the team  Also Cavs fans: fuck Kevin Love for playing well and ruining the tank
This post was made just to sh*t on us. No one other reason. The Kevin Love stuff is just filler so it doesn't get auto deleted.

Kevin Love for MVP  \- every Knicks fan
Thunder &amp; Magic Legend Kevin Love
Kevin Love sticking it to Cleveland one last time
Knicks legend Kevin Love
Bro imagine telling Knicks Fans that the PF that would seal their playoff berth was Kevin Love
Kevin Love deserves every penny
"Kevin Love turning back the clock and coming in clutch for the Knicks, while being a player for the Cavs."
Shame on him.  I still can't forgive him for giving Kevin Love depression.
"Yea, because Kevin Love was Jordan during the Cavs run in 2016-18.  Man was ass and there was no one else to cover him.  It was the role players hitting 9000 3s that ended us."
"What did Casey ever do in the playoffs that would make you believe that he could win either of those series'?  Casey was excellent at developing players, but when it came to making crucial adjustments in a timely manner during a seven game playoff series, he failed. Time and time again, he couldn't do it.  Anyone who lets CJ Miles guard Kevin Love for multiple possessions in the playoffs deserves to get fired lol"
ah yes the guy who put CJ Miles on Kevin Love and changed nothing for an entire series would have totally been able to come up with the big lineup or the wall.
Kevin Love lmao
&gt; most points in a quarter was modern day records  What are you talking about? Klay had 37 and Kevin Love had 34 points in a quarter.
Ricky gave Kevin Love his best statistical years and allowed Pekovic to make a lot of money. He is a pretty good passer imo.
He was worth that Kevin Love trade tho 🏆
"In THIS league there are a ton of players much worse paid as much or more. Nic Batum, Horford, Drummond and Otto Porter make like 28M a year each. Kevin Love is making like 31 lol"
I will never forgive LeMao for giving Kevin Love depression.
That team was worse at least LeBron had Kevin Love
"3 - LeBron, Kyrie and Kevin Love."
"I remember Shaq randomly asked once during some highlights what team Kevin Love played for. I saw that as more indicative of how far KLove fell off the radar, but still was funny."
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
"This is actually really amazing. Check out the list from 10 years ago (2010-11 season):  1) Kevin Love: 15.2 (USA)  2) Dwight Howard: 14.1 (USA)  3) Zach Randolph: 12.2 (USA)  4) Blake Griffin: 12.1 (USA)  5) Kris Humphries: 10.4 (USA)  6) Pau Gasol: 10.2 (Spain)  7) David Lee: 9.8 (USA)  8) Al Jefferson: 9.7 (USA)  9) Emeka Okafor: 9.5 (USA)  10) Tyson Chandler: 9.4 (USA)  Okafor's parents are from Nigeria but he was born and raised in the USA and is an American citizen  Humphries only played 44 games, though—11th place w/ 77 GP was Al Horford, who is Dominican"
"kevin love, blake griffin, horford, millsap"
"Kevin Love. Hell, people have already begun to forget about him."
I think a good comparison is Kevin Love. Obviously to complete different players but similar athleticism. Love per 36 is still averaging over 10 rebounds per game in his 13th season at age 32 as an undersized big and he's not even trying his hardest. Luka isn't as good a rebounder as Kevin Love was in his prime but I think it's a good indicator that he won't fall off to severely if he avoids major injuries and doesn't get in a situation like Love he should age fine.
"&gt;Yes wtf? Kyrie and Love, two allstars. 2020 no ill give you that.  All star Kevin Love averaging: 16/10/2 in the regular season and 15/8/2 in the playoffs with alongside 8/7/1 in the Finals. 2016 was not a Superteam.  Stephen Curry 2016 Choke was just as bad as Lebron's 2011 choke. He was the unanimous MVP for Christ sake, he was up 3-1"
Colin sexton ain’t shit. His career would benefit from being relegated to a six man role.  All Kevin Loves good will for bringing a chip and sacrificing his role for those teams is gone. All the praise for his mental health work is forgotten. All they talk about is his toxicity and salary.   How about your franchise front office is toxic and your franchise direction is shit and you should be praying at the alter of Kevin love for what he brought to your city
Harden aka Stripper Man: Lieutenant Dan earn this name from me because he has no legs in playoff 4th quarter's because of his extra curricular activities.  Curry can't shake Kevin Love and Can't guard Kyrie. Also curry needs a whole system built around movement and we know Harden dosent move because he gots no legs.
"&gt;We pretending Klay/Dray didn't exist? A team of 4 all-nba players in their prime is unprecedented. Three max contracts on the same team, plus a DPOY-level anchor.  Sorry if I worded it wrong. What I meant was that Curry was the top engine behind what made them a superteam. Him and KD were unequivocally the top 2 players on that team, and were the main drivers of that success. It's different if Steph was the #3 on that team because it'd be fair to wonder if he really was that good without a superteam. But it's hard to discredit Steph considering his status on that team.  &gt;Out of \~1000 GSW playoff minutes, only 260 had an opposing starting PG. And yes, I'm counting Jrue and Conley's minutes in full even though they were notably injured. Then you have other starters out, such as Montiejunas and Kevin Love in full.  Fair point. But look at the context of that too. The Pelicans whether Jrue played or not weren't 2015 Jrue Holiday away from avoiding a sweep. So were the Rockets. They're not a Patrick Beverley away from a gentleman's sweep. Conley and the Cavs were really the only instances of injuries actually making a possibly decisively different result. And the Grizzlies were more so undone by playoff adjustments.  &gt;Not to mention the biggest threat in the West had injures to both superstars to barely miss the playoffs. Show me another year that even comes close.  It's not like they got healthy the next year and lost.  &gt;Sure. Except that I keep hearing about KD's rings not counting while Steph's do. That Kobe was carried by Shaq due to FMVPs, but Curry made things easy for Durant's FMVPs.  Considering that this thread only has me and you on it, it's unfair on my end if you keep bringing up other people's opinions on the matter because I'm not those other people.  &gt;You're using SRS to discredit Lakers being a 4-seed early in the season, so I'm saying the Warriors should be higher due to easy SRS after allstar break. Keep the same energy.  And the Lakers ended with a 37-45 record. The result wouldn't have been that bad if they weren't so shafted with injuries, but that's also a hypothetical on how good they would have been if they all played healthy. The Warriors ARE a better team once the schedule turned. They were 4 games below .500 at one point and are 3 games above .500 now. They went from like 22-27 to 36-33. You don't think the schedule had anything to do with that? I'm keeping the same energy man, unless you expected the Dubs to be a top tier team in the West. My preseason predictions had them as a 6-8 seed and it's averaging out now.  &gt;The entire discussion around 2019 Lakers vs. 2021 Warriors is a clusterfuck.  YOU started this. My original comment was:  &gt;And everyone would agree Bron and Curry makes their teams a lot better. Lakers without Bron in 2019 or Warriors without Curry in 2021 are bottom feeders rather than playoff/fringe playoff teams.  These are facts. These teams without their superstars would be shit. That's all I was trying to say. And yet you replied with:  &gt;LeBron's core was baby Ingram/Lonzo/Kuzma while Curry's is Draymond/Wiggins/Oubre. Curry has the better core who are all healthier, yet his team is an 8th seed.  Where the fuck in my comment did I ever start the comparison of the two other than they both elevate their teams, which is a fact btw? You're the one that started comparing those two even though they're completely different contexts outside the fact that they have 2 superstars who did/are doing their best to get them to the playoffs.  &gt;They're not similar situations and you're trying to pigeonhole the discussion as a told-you-so on LeBron's biggest disappointment since 2011 finals.  YOU'RE the one who brought it up, not me. And since there's no way to accurately compare them since they're so different, I even mentioned that:  &gt;but that's a moot point either way.  As in comparing them is moot other than saying that Steph and Bron elevated these really bad teams to playoff level heights. How the fuck was I supposed to compare them then since YOU brought it up? Using end of season stats was imperfect, but considering you chose to compare them then there was no other way to do so. Then you came guns blazing arguing how Steph has been lucky and how he was on a superteam.  &gt;SRS nitpick already covered above.  What nitpick? Those are facts.  &gt;I say Lonzo is a rookie, you say bullshit (he's a sophomore). The point is LeBron was running with an inexperienced core with significantly more injuries. All of this should be obvious.  And the point is he was also surrounded by vets. The injuries are what really make this an uncomparable situation. This should be obvious, yet you started bringing up supporting casts after all I said was Bron and Steph made their teams better."
"&gt; Him and KD are what made the team stacked lmao  We pretending Klay/Dray didn't exist? A team of 4 all-nba players in their prime is unprecedented. Three max contracts on the same team, plus a DPOY-level anchor.  &gt; And do you even have data for most injured playoffs of the century?  Out of ~1000 GSW playoff minutes, only 260 had an opposing starting PG. And yes, I'm counting Jrue and Conley's minutes in full even though they were notably injured. Then you have other starters out, such as Montiejunas and Kevin Love in full. Not to mention the biggest threat in the West had injures to both superstars to barely miss the playoffs. Show me another year that even comes close.  &gt; Oh and again, there's no such thing as a championship with an asterisk. Champions are champions.  Sure. Except that I keep hearing about KD's rings not counting while Steph's do. That Kobe was carried by Shaq due to FMVPs, but Curry made things easy for Durant's FMVPs.  &gt; And they're a playoff team. A solid 7-8 seed, but a playoff team nonetheless. What's your point?  You're using SRS to discredit Lakers being a 4-seed early in the season, so I'm saying the Warriors should be higher due to easy SRS after allstar break. Keep the same energy.  &gt; I mean dude if you're gonna say I nitpick at least back it up with shit I've actually said man.  The entire discussion around 2019 Lakers vs. 2021 Warriors is a clusterfuck. They're not similar situations and you're trying to pigeonhole the discussion as a told-you-so on LeBron's biggest disappointment since 2011 finals. SRS nitpick already covered above. I say Lonzo is a rookie, you say bullshit (he's a sophomore). The point is LeBron was running with an inexperienced core with significantly more injuries. All of this should be obvious."
Like when Kevin Love was getting 20 rebounds a game
"I sometimes think Klay's 37-point quarter is unbreakable. He literally didn't miss. One of the best shooters in history, who is also known to get in the zone like no one else, riding an all-time hot hand. That said, Kevin Love was only three points short, so it could happen, especially with how many threes guys are taking."
"&gt;Lolz, yeah, going 1-4 with the Heatles would definitely have been legacy enhancing for Lebron. Stans gonna stan.  2-2 with the Heatles get your head outta your hating ass lol  &gt;And yet it's like swallowing gravel for your ilk to even acknowledge that he did, indeed, save a championship.  I acknowledged it as a clutch shot, he saved the game but it doesn't define LeBron's entire legacy. Bron made his own legacy. You gonna start whining about Kyrie too now?   &gt;Jeez louise, is this a joke? Or did you literally miss his entire career before he came to the Cavs?  He wasn't even an all-star or doing anything in the playoffs before the LeBron &amp; the Cavs you idiot, even tho he was averaging 25 PPG. You sure *you* didn't miss his career? Lmao idiot.  &gt;First 3 championships, he had....Scottie. Who had the stat line of...Kevin Love at times in his career when MJ won championships. Uh ok. But sure, I guess we're just inventing teammates for MJ at this point.  Pippen led in all major statistical categories besides scoring. He literally carried MJ in those areas since all MJ could really do at a high level was score/defend guards. There's a reason MJ couldn't make it outta round 1 and only won 1 playoff game without Pippen or a HOF coach u casual. Also you forgot Rodman, MJ literally had a superteam for 3 of his rings. Kerr, Paxson, and BJ Armstrong also made insane clutch shots that woulda lost MJ the finals if they hadn't.  &gt;Just so we're clear, the eastern conference semi-finals isn't ""almost making the finals"".  Doesn't matter, they won 55 games and were a playoff team without him. It proves how good MJ's teams were. Add Phil Jackson onto that too and that's literally all the advantage in the world  &gt;As an aside Learn proper grammar then we can talk. You're just a low life hater echoing skip brainless."
Fuck Bickerstaff for not playing kevin love tonight. He is our tank commander
"And he loses strength that makes him better in the post, a.k.a pulling a Kevin Love  And even then, he won't be a good protector, those things are mostly limited to genetics, he will never be fast, agile and jump high, also defensive instincts when to contest, rotate etc   I know that people want to believe that players can improve on everything, even at age 26 in their prime but it's not realistic"
"OP talks about Dantley as ""not a winning"" player. Which is a label that gets attached to guys who don't win rings.   Heck, Dirk was talked about like that from 2007-10, solely because he didn't have a ring.   Whereas guys with rings aren't talked about the same even if they later play non-winning ball, like Kobe 04 or Kevin Love now."
"Ease up man, i love Randle.   But do you think Kevin Durant ever considered wearing safety orange, and walmart blue?   Ya me either."
"&gt; With how much more shots are going to be chucked in the future of the NBA plus the number of threes that are going to be shot, your value as a rebounder would decline if all you do is box out in the paint.      But is it actually true that longer shots lead to longer rebounds?  [This](https://sites.northwestern.edu/nusportsanalytics/2018/02/28/do-longer-shot-attempts-mean-longer-rebounds/) says that the data on that is inconclusive.  Intuitively it seems true, but has it been proven?      Otherwise, you take a big risk by not doing a traditional box out.  Giving up easy putbacks off misses is bad for your chances of winning and there's also gotta be some damage done to team morale every time you give up a basket off an easy offensive rebound.  Very few guys in NBA history have an innate ability to predict where a rebound will go or some advanced geometric understanding of bounces like Rodman or Kevin Love.  For the average guy, even with all the threes, it probably just makes the most sense to stand under the basket."
Including Kevin love in Oakland
"Wow, so no injuries ever I think Penny Hardaway would be a top 5 point guard all time , Grant Hill would be a top 30 player, Bill Walton might overtake one of the main guys we think about on the greatest centers of all time list, look at the career of Derrick Rose and how different that would be oh, and just not to mention the Championships and Seasons that would be different if other all-time great players never got injured, like what if Chris Paul didn't get injured in the 2018 Conference Finals , what if Kevin Durant doesn't get injured in 2019, what if Kyrie and Kevin Love don't get injured in 2015, what is Steph Curry doesn't tweaked his ankle against the rockets in 2016, etc the shit would be all over the place lol"
"&gt;I assume because Steph had already shown he could win a ring without KD's help.  Yes, all he needed was for both Kyrie and Love to be missing for him to win, Kevin Durant would have won in 2012 if Wade and Bosh were injured"
Kuzma. Kevin love with the Cavs.

 But there’s no way they win if Casey’s coaching. Guy ran predictable schemes and had CJ Miles guarding Kevin Love ffs
he might a case over kevin love but im not sure
"I think kevin love is more valuable off the court than he is on the court to me, it kinda seems as though he wants to do well enough to have a team enquire for him and then negotiate a buyout or something. So i'd rather not gear the offense towards him when we have young guys who i'd rather see gel and grow."
I forgot Kevin Love still played
"Absolutely not.  Kevin Love may not be great.  But Varajeo is most likely retiring in a week, once the season is over."
Kevin Love is a good guy and can be a phenomenal vet but idk if he will step up or not. This contract is basically Varjeo's last stop in the NBA trying to balance out the Cavs locker room.
U guys should buyout Kevin Love. Let him come to the Wizarss
I'd argue Kevin love is a .5
"People just misinterpreted the OP's post and why it got upvotes. There was one line buried in there that could be sort of read as ""LeBron made Kevin Love depressed"" but the post was just commending Kevin Love for dealing with mental health struggles and being a good soldier through it all. It's just a straight up circlejerk narrative that the OP was ""LeBron gave Kevin Love Depression"""
Lebron giving Kevin Love depression will always be the right answer to this question
"The injury didn't affect his ability to run, it affected his short area quickness and made him unable to break guys down off the dribble in space. See: not being able to get by Kevin Love"
"That cavs game was so fun to watch. Kyrie and Kevin Love got benched, leaving LeBron to play 45 minutes. We have yet to see that lebron with the Lakers"
The Kevin Love special
I think that’s Kevin Love trying to get off a bum team. Lol
Kevin Love will be out of the league soon lmao
"At this point just trade for Kevin Love if you’re Philly. He shoots, get him to gain ~10 or 15 lbs this offseason so he can get back to Minnesota KLove on the boards and just pay him 30 mil to put an end to this hacka shit"
"That's the thing, if we trade him in the offseason, we probably either have to attach assets to get someone to bite or we get someone with a similarly awful contract ie. Kevin Love, John Wall etc."
Kevin love played some defense
"A championship doesn't get asterisked because of injuries. Injuries have ALWAYS been a problem for the playoffs. Always always.   They don't always mean that a team is done for either. Magic Johnson's rookie championship he played all 5 positions because the season's MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was out for the finals with an injury.  There are a lot of injuries this year and it sucks. But let's cut the shit with this ""asterisk"" crap. Very few finals are played with every team in the playoffs at 100% health for the course of the entire run.  We're not going to asterisk Kawhi and the Raptors from 2 years ago because of KD's injury are we? Might as well just not count one of Golden State's championships because of the year that Kevin Love and Kyrie were out right? /s  Cut the shit. Injuries are part of the game. They're a part of the game that no one enjoys and everyone wishes weren't there but they are a constant part of the game and always have been. No asterisks for injuries."
just false  even kevin love this year was better than drummond
"I hear this a lot and it’s really unfair to compare the Warriors injuries in ‘16 to the Cavs in ‘15.   The Warriors lost Bogut, who averaged 12mpg, *after* game 5. Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Barnes and Livingston all played every game.  The Cavs lost Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love for all but one game combined in 2015. They basically played without their second and third best players for the entire series.  These are not comparable scenarios. The Cavs beat the Warriors at essentially full strength. The Warriors beat LeBron with a bunch of bench players who were thrust into starting roles."
"Curry was playing hurt. Dude couldn’t shake Kevin Love, but every time after he would run circles around him"
To be fair Kevin Love was an all star like how Andre Drummond was an all star
Yup. Just like Klay and KD being out isn’t the same as Kevin fuckin Love.
"well there's injuries... and then there's INJURIES   like even to the dude you responded to who wrote:  &gt; Like Cavs got injured one year, GSW won. GSW injured, Cavs won.  Draymond getting ejected/suspended for 1 1/2 games is not the same as Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving missing the entire series..."
&gt;He reminds me of like a Tim Hardaway just a 3rd guy on a team.  People seriously forget how good CJ McCollum is. Tim Hardaway? Really?   He's a Khris Middleton/Kevin Love type player. Would be the 3rd best player on a championship team.
"The Hawks weren’t a serious team either &amp; they were playing with a Coach that is currently coaching another team that isn’t serious either so they could’ve convinced them &amp; plus Horford was coming off a injury, they would’ve loved that #1 pick &amp; possibly even more from a 3rd team involved. Kevin Love was a empty calories player, those Minnesota stats should’ve been seen as nothing."
"LeBron’s back was fucked in that series/whole 2014-2015 season, I thought bro time was about to end like Larry Bird’s. Plus Iggy was fouling the hell out of him lmaooo. I think if LeBron was healthy, that could’ve been a game 7 series. But in retrospect I truly think the Cavs shouldn’t have traded for Kevin Love &amp; actually went for Al Horford. Kevin Love isn’t a 16 game player due to his low motor, durability &amp; defensive limitations. They possibly could’ve got Paul Millsap in that trade too due to major hype Wiggins had in that upcoming draft &amp; got off of Anderson Varejao contract."
"Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson, Derrick Rose, and Jae Crowder lead by a GOAT is not a trash team. Just because they were misused by the Cavs doesn't make those players bad."
Kevin Love has never appeared.  Averaged less PPG and total points in 2016 finals than Tristan Thompson.
A super team isn’t a super team ask me later. If you want to put 2013s carry job and 2016s run with the corpse of Kevin love on the same tier as the 2017-2018 warriors I’ll let you have your illusions lmao
2018 Kevin Love and 2015 Kevin Love are very different
Was it last season that Sexton was trying to do an iso 30 footer while Kevin Love had a mismatch against CP3 at the top of the key and only passed at the last second. That was an unholy dumb move.
You can love him or hate him. But you have to respect Kevin Durant for doing what a top 5 player should do.  Put your team on your back and carry across the finish line.  Real interesting to see what the Bucks do.  That's a tough game to lose after being up for essentially 3 quarters.  I feel like the coaching could have been better for them last night as well.  Too late to make adjustments and in some cases no answers for the Nets.
"Well, about 10% of Harden. Kevin Love in 2018 was more useful than whatever Harden was today. Also the Bucks are much better than the teams LeBron played that year."
are we forgetting he had kevin love on that team?
CJ Miles on Kevin Love still gives me nightmares. 4 possessions in a row of free layups.
"  The only super teams have been Miami, Warriors, and KD Warriors.  Cavs looked like a super team. But the way Kevin Love turned out made it so they weren't."
"Everyone forgets Jeff Green was the 2nd best player on the 2018 Cavs roster lmao. Kevin Love disappeared and Jeff Green showed up big against the Pacers, Raptors, and Celtics en route to Golden State."
i only love one man and his name is kevin
I love Kevin Durant
Still not as bad as Dwyane Casey who put CJ miles on Kevin Love.
"Kevin ""The Franchise"" Durant  Always love those clips where he falls and the entire city of Brooklyn runs to pick him up"
*Chris Bosh and Kevin Love =/= “super team”
"Soo. Steph Curry who couldn't even make it into the playoffs. Lebron James who barely played and is hobbled and Julius Randle who may be good but no love for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell?  Luka Doncic who can't get out of the first rd?  I whole-heartedly disagree with HALF of this list.  Oh yeah, did I miss Kevin Durant????!!!  Who picks Playoff P over KD?  No Booker?"
The way Harden was moving was similar to Kevin love
"Fuck all the haters, here in Seattle we still love Kevin Durant."
"Good game Brooklyn, all this shows is how shit Coach Bud is and how good Kevin Durant is lol but I love KD so all the power to him."
Kevin Love
Did PJ just pull a Kevin love?
People are still calling for post ups... Look up the quotes from the coaches. They don't want guys posting up anymore! From Kevin Love to Porzingis to Lopez. They are coached to pull up and take jump shots! Rick Carlisle basically said a few years ago that post ups are for idiots. And Yet every time that Porzingis took a jumper people were just mindboggled and questioning his sanity.
its still considered. dmc never made an all nba team up he broke 30 wins. same with kevin love.
"Because people see ""3 1st overall picks in 7 years"" without realizing the cavs traded wiggins for Kevin love."
In good faith and no stanning involved either way - how is this team without kyrie and harden better than the 2018 cavs and 2007 cavs? Just cuz they sucked for finals teams doesn’t mean they didn’t have capable starters. You don’t think Brooklyn would like Kevin love or ilgauskas?
"He may look bored, but I genuinely don’t think there are more than 10 people alive who love the game of basketball more than Kevin Durant. Obviously no way to objectively assess love for the game, but dude seems to eat sleep and breathe ball. During the lockout dude was literally on a pickup court every single day it felt like lol"
Whose careers have actually been ruined for no reason? Dave Chappelle (and I love the guy) has complained about cancel culture but is still one of the biggest comedians in the world. Kevin Hart is still everywhere. Even Louis CK is back to selling out shows and his actions were indefensible.
Yea but you also have to think about the fact that Lebron gave Kevin Love depression.
Oh but with Kevin Love going from putting up big numbers on a lottery team to putting up worse numbers in the finals it matters?
Kevin Love goes to Utah
"&gt;He cheated on his ex girlfriend who was Doc Rivers daughter, got a stripper pregnant, wanted an abortion, didn’t get it, so he ended up tying the knot.  Yet there's murals of Kobe painted all over LA. I'm sure that must be because of his spotless personal life, right?  Anyone wanna guess how Magic got HIV but his wife didn't?   Barkley got caught with a prostitute, is he hated for that? Is Wade hated for having a kid with another woman while he was married?  Klay Thompson got caught in bed with another woman, but ""weed toaster lol.""  &gt; was apart of many horrendous losses, including the infamous 3-1 comeback from the nuggets. Which PG shot a corner 3 that hit nothing but the side of the backboard.   Curry gave up a 3-1 lead after winning unanimous MVP, and got locked up by Kevin Love. He must be hated by r/NBA for that, I'm sure.  And Luka just gave up a 2-0 lead to ""Playoff P."" I'm sure he's now hated too."
"KD’s third option was LeBrons only other star on the Cavs.  If y’all think Kevin Love is a super star, would love for any NBA team to work out a trade for him"
"What star has ever dragged this undermanned a team through? Closest I can think of is lebron bringing the cavs to the finals in 2018, and that was against an over performing Celtics, and a derozan raptors with Kevin love playing like Kevin love for once"
"Problem with what you’re saying is it applies to building an NBA team as well. No one is predestined to win a championship and even though you need a good team to do it, so much luck is required to actually get it done.   And the same goes into building a team. It took 13 years for Dirk to finally get there in 2011. Do the Spurs take it in 2014 if Kawhi is what they thought they drafted (a 3nD specialist) rather than the budding star we know him to be today? Warriors almost traded Klay for Kevin Love and it would’ve happened if Jerry West didn’t threaten to quit. And the majority of people at the time thought they were crazy for letting that deal fall through.  That’s just the nature of sports. Whether you’re just betting or building an actual team, it all comes down to wins and losses. And just like all of them, Bob is gonna be seen as a shitty exec until championship prove otherwise. Remember when Pelinka was the crazy Lakers GM that clearly had no clue what he was doing as he constructed a team that made no sense? All that noise died down once they hoisted up that Larry O’Brien."
"doesn’t matter if he had a bum lebron or not honestly, the adjustments he made throughout his cavs run were well documented and prepped the team to steamroll through the east    kevin love before this season said  “With Ty Lue, it was like, 'Okay, we were an underachieving regular season team.' But when it came time for the playoffs, he was like, 'I got this.' Everything he set up for us, he just had a brilliant mind for his schemes, and his Xs and Os, his ATOs, everything that he did. It just made more sense moving forward when it came to playoff time.”"
"Kevin Love dropped off every NBA playoffs. Using him to justify LeBron having ""hand-picked all stars"" is such a joke. He'd play well vs the Raptors (the entire Cavs team did) and suck ass against everyone else. These kids just look at the stats and think they're NBA analysts it's so funny."
Who is Kevin Love in this scenario?
For a second.. i thought kevin love was on the hawks.. lmao.. didnt sry didnt watch hawks game this year. Just lurking on the reddit.. but grats brother..
We need the Kevin Love gif.
"The man who said there’s a Klay Thompson every draft night, and that Kevin Love is a once in a generation player has power over Carlisle?"
Kevin love might be the biggest example of a Nigerian scam artist in the league for that contract alone lol
Uhm idk if you would have said that about Kevin Love though lol
"Wade a was too 4 player at minimum when he joined them. Bosh's prime just started.  Get your teenage ass out of here, you didn't even watch the heatles. Bosh was 26-30 during that stretch and was still good even afterwards.  Kevin love was thought of a top 15 player before the Cavs and Kyrie looked like a superstar in the making."
"You are aware that Lebron teamed up with Kevin Love and Kyrie in 2013 though right? Not today? Giannis was a rookie, Kawhi was a 20 year old averaging 11 PPG. Kevin Love was 3rd in Scoring, 3rd in rebounding, and top 10 in every advanced stat. He averaged 24 and 14 over the last 4 seasons before going to Cleveland…"
"I'll die on the hill that Klove is a GREAT player but he did what he did in Minny because there wasn't anyone else to do it. Empty stats. He isn't a top 10 player. I don't even consider Kyrie a top 10 player today either. They aren't ""That Guy"". top 10 is super stars, LeBron, KD, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Steph, Kevin love has never been on these levels, he's still one of my favorite players though , but being put with other ball dominant scorers exposed him."
"Kevin Love averaged 26-13 on 59% TS while playing every game of the season the year before he came to Cleveland, got 2nd Team All-NBA, and finished 4th in MVP voting. People forget he was CLEARLY considered a top 10 player in his last few years in Minny. And D Wade was 28 and Bosh was 26 when Lebron came to Miami, how is that the end of their primes?? This revisionist history with Lebron is so weird.   That team had 26 year old Lebron, 26 year old Bosh, and 28 year old Wade. They were all just hitting their primes."
Lol I love Terrance but my guy shouldn’t have worn it. Kevin Martin wore it for the Thunder as well. Maybe that’s what left the bad taste in my mouth.
Kevin Love averaged 20.5/11.5 on 47.5/35.3/90.0 in that series badly outplaying both of the Raptors “star” players Lowry and Defrozen. Not to mention the Cavs role players all shot lights out that series ( &gt; 50% from the field). Hardly a carry job
Dude if Kevin love could play defense he would've had 2 more chips!!
"People are forgetting how good Kevin Love was in 2014. SI had him ranked 13 going in to 14-15, ESPN had him 7th. Top 5 in ppg rpg BPM Vorp. Top 10 in every advanced metric. Kyrie was pretty universally thought of as a top 25 player and on the upswing. But it didn’t gel great and Lebron decided he needed to go more heliocentric than Miami.  That said the only version of those teams I’d consider a super team was probably 16-17, but by then it’s too late. All 3 were all stars and Korver, Thompson, JR was a legit very good secondary group. And even then Love not Kyrie was all nba, so they probably don’t qualify.  The Lakers def aren’t, I think you need 3 for the general public agreement. So just Miami."
Heat years. If you say Cleveland with Kyrie and Kevin love absolutely not
"Kevin Love - poor guy who had an amazing career. He is stuck in Cav with his injuries and crazy contract. Yes he won a ring but i don’t think people will remember him winning that ring … they will only remember Lebron has finally won one for his hometown. As much as I don’t care for Irving, I can see why he did what he did. I honestly think he deserved that final MVP, not Lebron, that year."
"Kevin Love made  2nd Team All NBA twice before he got to Cleveland.  He averaged 26, 12.5, and 4.5 the year before he got there.  He was a 3x all star in 6 years in Minn in an absolutely loaded west.  I would say having him as your third option defines goliath lol.  How many teams have a 2nd Team All NBA guy in his prime as their 3rd option?  cmon now.   He didn't fit great with Lebron and then injuries happened, but Kevin Love was a really good player.   \[As an aside, this is an inconsistency/ fallacy in some of the Lebron arguments.  People say he always makes his teammates better.   But when really good players like Love and Bosh aren't as good as they were pre-Lebron, then everyone just acts like they weren't really that good to begin with.  OR since they aren't as good with Lebron, they use the lesser version to define how good Lebron's teams/ supporting casts were/ weren't.  As if  K Love counts as just a role player in Cleveland and not the same All NBA level guy he was just a year or two earlier.\]"
"Yeah. Diet Kevin Durant, also known as Khris Middleton needs some love. KD and Khris are wet from mid. So is Kawhi and CP3. I just wanted some recognition for my guy. You're correct in everything you said."
The Cavs were a great team. Kevin Love had the same challenges that Bosh did. I don't know why the media has made Bosh such a darling and Kevin Love seem like a ball and chain.  The Cavs team was objectively great. They just went against a ridiculous opponent.
Still believe a Kevin Love doesn't make you a 'super team' but I think 2011-2013 Heatles were. 2017 Cavs were their strongest iteration that to me was a super team but the Warriors were just too much.
Lol beat him out once and probably shouldn’t have and a glorified Kevin Love. Cool lol.
"I used to love Phil Jackson and Kevin McHale in their giant suits, towering over the sidelines"
"&gt;this is the right answer.  Also if T-Mac came into the league in 2010 he'd be some kind of mix between Kevin Durant and James Harden.  You are way overrating McGrady.  McGrady is an inefficient scorer, much of it owing to his tendency to fall in love with his jumper. Despite having elite athleticism, he uses it to shoot difficult mid range shots over others as opposed to driving to the rim.  Durant and Harden are who they are because they are incredibly good at driving to the basket, and so they always get easy points from free throws."
Which is hilarious because GS won a title with Kevin Love and Kyrie out in the Finals. No one mentions that “asterisk”.   You can only play who’s in front of you and realistically every championship team faced an injured team at some point in the playoffs.
"Thank fucking God. But we know Harden will come back now. And what a stupid post. You aren't a contender with 3. You're just the 2017 Cavs but with Harden instead of Kevin Love. You're not even fun to watch. It's just insulting to basketball. Big 2 is fine though. But all I know is the Nets need to lose. This is wonderful. Playoffs are interesting again. Injuries suck,and this is a wacky season."
He could barely even see the ball.  Just stop.  Reggie was trying to make that a 1 all the way and I love Reggie but Kevin Harlan wasn’t even calling him out.
Nope. Kyrie and Kevin Love went down.
"2017-2018 might’ve had more in all honesty, Gordon Hayward, cousins, IT, fultz, curry, cp3, John wall, kawhi, Kevin love, mills Ap, Conley, kyrie, klay Thompson.Those are the big names"
"I reckon this is also bec of the unnecessary hate that Lebron receives. He’s overhated for how valuable he is to the game in totality (sales, influence, dominance). Also from Lebron haters or fans sick of the Lebron praise — their reactions towards level headed fans who just appreciate greatness regardless (coming from a Kevin Love fanboy) of team/affiliation are often over the top."
so Serbian Kevin Love? Minus the MVP and 'Bron
"I'll, mostly agree with you on Kevin Love, he never did great against the warriors, although we did need scoring desperately in the finals which he would have helped with.  Kyrie was still regarded as a top 15 player at that time. Bam and especially dragic are not at that level. Not having Kyrie, except for one game where he was already injured, and having bam at only half capacity for the 4 games he played are not the same level of handicap  Edit: keep in mind Kyrie was hobbled for the entirely of the playoffs that finally caught up with him in the finals. This partially explains his below par (for him) stats. Since we're talking about a hypothetical scenario where injures don't occur, he presumably would have better stats on healthy knees the whole time"
Kevin Love would’ve hit that outlet pass
Hahahaha Kevin Harlan's so corny man I love him
"I think people forget how utterly dominant that Warriors team was before KD. In 2016 Steph was not 100%, Draymond got suspended and both Bogut and Iquodala got hurt. And they were basically one shot away from beating a fully loaded LeBron, Kyrie, Kevin Love Cavs team. Even without KD they would have been championship favorites or at least strong contenders every year."
" LeBron went up against a historically great KD Warriors super team 2 years in a row in the finals (probably the best teams of all time). In 2018, LeBron's 2nd best player was a hobbled Kevin Love.   This Bucks team is not a super team or near the tier of greatness that those Warriors teams. Now if Giannis had Steph, Klay, Middleton, and Jrue all on the same team, then that would be more like what LeBron would have felt vs the 2018 Warriors."
Kelly Olynyk stole the Cavs title chances in 2015 and should be convicted for assault against Kevin Love.
Curry choked every single finals series. Locked up by Kevin Love in 2016. Routinely has Derozan-esque games where he drops like 12 pts on 34%. 0 finals MVPS. Lebron got exposed by bench players in 2011 and dropped 8 pts in a finals game. Got blown out in record fashion on a superteam against the Spurs. LBJ and Curry ain't so great when the pressure is on.
"2018 Kevin Love is way better than anyone else on the Nets roster. They also had Jordan Clarkson, who's now 6moty."
As if a thread about how Lebron gave Kevin Love clinical depression didn’t get thousands of upvotes...
He has that Kevin Love syndrome. Great player on the Timberwolves and as a result gets 1) forgotten 2) his accomplishments are questioned because bad team.
Yes 37 year old Ray Allen coming off the bench and posting the highest 3PA rate of his career is the same exact case as Kevin Love
Because it’s nothing that he could’ve done to prevent that. It was a simple up and down motion. It’s not like Ad groin for example. It’s like Kevin Love getting his shoulder dislocated in 15 because of Olynk.
Nah this sub shits on Kevin love more than the Cavs sub
He gives Kevin Love depression and this sub stans Kevin Love.
"Kevin Love admittedly doesn’t make a lot of sense, but he’s played for team USA before and sometimes they just want a veteran voice/guy who’s played a fair amount of international ball. I believe Grant also played for the select team previously so they were somewhat familiar with him. Randle had a great reg season but the horrible post-season definitely soured a lot of people’s opinions. On top of that, his style of play really wouldn’t be very conducive to overall team chemistry/success."
"Because he was just 2nd team All NBA, and deservingly so, and guys like Jerami Grant and Kevin Love got a nod before him."
Reminds me of Kevin Love.
Honestly I think Pop wanted to scout Kevin Love firsthand and picked him.   Now I think guys like Randle and others aren’t interested because they weren’t original picks. They don’t want to be 2nd/3rd choices.
&gt; Kevin Love  ಠ_ಠ
"Garnett was drafted in 95 thou, Kobe 96, Duncan 97, and dirk was 98. Dwade was a clear miss, Melo for sure makes it, and I think Anthony Davis is there too. I'll throw in Chris Bosh for consideration along with D rose, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Andrew Bynum, Demarcus Cousins, Paul George,  Lillard, Draymond, Klay. I know Pau Gasol started in '02 but he should be on  In a few years switch in Luka, Embiid, and Jokic"
KEVIN FUCKING LOVE
"If Kyrie, Kevin Love, and Lebron are a superteam, I don't see how Giannis, Jrue and Middleton aren't. Jrue is the 3rd option on this team and has proven to be a way better playoff performer than Kevin Love."
"If Lebron wasn't hurt, he would not have gave Kevin Love depression"
Kevin Love is off in Kokomo. There's where they wait to go.
Kevin love spacing is still valuable especially in that series when blatt was playing TT and mozgov on the court like it’s 90s basketball.  I don’t think klove swings the series but lebrons efficiency would of been way better I know that for sure lol
Kevin Love would have helped the Warriors close the series quicker lol. People really need to stop saying the dumb without Kyrie and Love. Draymond Green eats Kevin Love alive in almost every match-up between those teams. Tristan Thompson was actually more of a threat to the Warriors. As he is a better defender than Love and was killing the Warriors on the glass.
"Their record was abysmal without LeBron, and Kyrie and Kevin Love were offense-only players and prevented them from being an elite defensive team. Kevin Love was and still is one of the worst defenders in the league, smaller players would blow by him and bigger players would bully him. They would have been better with a non-all-star elite defensive role player instead of Love, and ironically would have avoided the ""superteam"" label despite being a better team.  Middleton and Jrue are a better #2 and #3 because they are two way players that can impact the game even when they aren't making shots, if Kyrie and Love were having an off shooting night they were detriments to the team."
Necessity is different than luxury. To beat the Cavaliers of Warriors didn't need Kevin Durant with their existing roster (they were injured and lost by one minute in G7). But Durant was a luxury and they changed their roster to get him and then he was a necessity to win.   You make it seem like LeBron and the Cavs like he had no help whatsoever. Kyrie Irving Kevin Love LeBron James. All amazing shot creators and their Prime.  You're mixing narratives for the Warriors and KD
Without kyrie and Kevin love tho
Curry forced a contested 3 over Kevin Love even though Klay had a clear lane to the basket. They could’ve made it a 1 point game with 35 seconds left but Curry decided to play hero ball. I’d say this was his worst moment considering the circumstance (4th quarter of game 7 of the finals). He was ice cold that game so idk why he thought chucking up a contested 3 was better than getting a guaranteed 2 from Klay.
Just first? He was disrespected his entire tenure. As was Kevin Love on the Cavs. They don't get enough credit for their sacrifices.
"nets don't need dinwiddie, they're probably getting kevin love next year, they should just try to resign some of their free agents and get some more, and try to get dinwiddie in a sign or trade or let him walk"
Norris Cole inbounds play. Lamar Odom inbounds play. Kevin Love inbounds play. Patrick Ewing missed game winning layup. JaVale McGee fast break.
"Lol I'm not the one being delusional. Lmao Draymond's an Allstar level talent but Kevin Love wasn't. Do you hear yourself? We've seen how well Draymond does without All Star level talent. KLove was/is better offensively.  &gt;It was only Bron &amp; Kyrie that did this.  He averaged 26 and 12 twice. You are wrong. He was the offensive engine behind the Kings. He got Chris Boshified once he joined the Cavs. (Bosh was also a 20 and 10 guy that led his own team, which is why ""the decision"" was so hated).   All Bron teams, until the Lakers (and really them too, its just not as pronounced), functioned that way because he completely takes over the offense. Its the reason he could take a Cavs team to the finals with virtually no help, he becomes the offensive engine for whatever team he's on. Y'all just don't know basketball and fall for whatever narrative the media gives you.   2018 was unfair, 2017 was almost dead even."
That kevin love and chris bosh treatment
"Except this isn't the Knicks that is one of 30 teams, this is the best of the best. Why would you choose temper tantrum Kevin Love over almost anyone else? Rhetorical, I know the answer they gave, it's just idiotic."
I agree that Javale is a good fit for the roster but i also think that Randle being overlooked for Kevin Love is ridiculous
Kevin Love
"I think the majority of people believe that the teams were fairly even but Durant tipped the scale and ruined everything. Of course there are people who believe the Cavaliers were superior but that’s probably because the breaks that the Warriors had in 2015 far outweigh what the Cavaliers had in 2016. The Cavs still managed to win two games in 2015 with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving being injured which is very impressive.  Being said, I believe the rivalry was amazing to watch until Durant came and made it so one sided that the 2017 and 2018 Finals weren’t even worth watching."
But boy?  Kevin Love ain't nobody's but boy.
"but that doesn’t detract from the point? the criteria to make it as a big changes, but he was NEVER made an offer… most agreed Kevin Love sucks but he deserved an offer over Randle???"
I thought after this place thinks lbj gave kevin love depression you people would learn to not over analyzing all the time.   I think i am underestimating the stupidity of this sub.
Kevin Love was borderline unplayable against GSW in 2018.
2021 Kevin Love doesn't either
&gt;Kevin Love hasn’t been great but he served a role and brought leadership.  What leadership? No one even listens to him on the Cavs...he's constantly having childish outbursts and pouting when he doesn't get the ball.
The 5 time all star Kevin Love who sacrificed his game so he can fit in Lebron's system. The same guy who'd averaged 26 and 12 prior to joining the Cavs? Who averaged 19 and 11 in that season as the third option. What a joke of a player.
"Kevin Love was not good that year, at all"
Kevin Love does??
Kevin Love not being in the pic is blatant trolling
Cavs 3rd Star was Kevin Love. Warriors have Klay fucking Thompson. Steph Curry was a 2x MVP. Kyrie has never even been in MVP discussion ever.   What a dumbass opinion
Kevin Love
"I was writing a response about how that couldn't possibly be real and must have been a fan creation (where are Kevin Love and JR Smith?) and then I found this: [https://twitter.com/nba/status/1001568943310589952](https://twitter.com/nba/status/1001568943310589952) Even the NBA knew it was a formality.  In case anyone else is curious like I was, Korver averaged 1.5 PTS, 1.8 RB, and 0.8 AST, while Thompson averaged 6.8 PTS, 5.3 RB, and 0.0 AST. Putrid."
Because Julius Randle isn’t a rim protector/C that the USA team needs. Kevin Love isn’t even on the team anymore.
"Tell me how many games those Kyrie and Kevin Love team would win without LeBron. Might not even make the playoffs, TBH. You are delusional, seriously, if you don't see the huge, huge difference with that and joining a 73-9 team that blew the only 3-1 lead in Finals history lol"
Pretty sure Kevin Love coulda done the same
yeah Keldon shouldn't be on this team...  But replacing him for Kevin Love was a MASSIVE upgrade
I said to myself wow Pau still doin the dam thing at his age then remembered we have 43 year old Kevin Love
Let's not forget as well that Kevin Love averaged 8 points per game for the series and was terrible. Dude was concussed and it really showed.
Well that’s because the worst player then was like Kevin Love(that’s no disrespect to KLove the team was that good) and now it’s people we have to google to find out who it is
Almost all the best big men in the league now are foreign. It’s not like he made it over some huge names. Kevin Love hasn’t been great but he served a role and brought leadership.
sub in kevin love lmao
kevin durant is such a troll lol I love it
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
"You know Randle shot like, 42 percent on catch and shoot 3's, right lol?  I don't know why everybody is pretending like there was no way he could possibly adjust his game to play like a non-bum version of Kevin Love, since Kevin Love was so special to get invited in the first place."
So the international experience and shot making stopped mattering all of two weeks later after finding out that Kevin Love has sucked for 3 years like the rest of the planet was already aware of.
"Let's look at Colangelo's exact words for why Love was invited over Randle.  &gt;“Regardless of who you select, there’s always a few names that come up regarding why they aren’t there,’’ Colangelo said. “Randle was right there. He was one of our considerations. Especially when some of the injuries took place and we lost a few players.’’  &gt;“He had a great year this year,’’ Colangelo said of Randle. “**He’s come a long way. The best reason to say why Kevin Love as an extra big was because of his international experience. Yes it’s true he hasn’t played much of anything the last couple of years, but the skills he brings to the table and commitment he’s made to physical conditioning, he’s a versatile guy up front who can rebound and hit shots.** Who’s to say how many minutes a guy will play? You’re not playing all 12 players. It was a matter of filling out the roster with role players. Randle was close.’’  So what happened to needing somebody who can hit shots?  Or did the need for experience and shot making go out the window all in a matter of a few days?  Now what they actually needed all along was somebody to take no shots once their physical specimen Kevin Love dropped out for being dogshit."
"Derrick Williams was so fucking good in nba 2k14. My myplayer on the Timberwolves was amazing once I got Rubio traded, coupled with Love and Pekovic pick and roll, and Kevin Martin shooting lights out. Great times."
"I like the implication of this. He’s either saying LeBron was far superior to him, or that Kevin Love was as good as Steph, Tristain Thompson as good as Draymond, etc. It’s nonsensical and self-deprecating."
"Saying Lebron had a great series is an understatement. Ya cavs caught a few breaks, but Kevin love was not 100% either. Had a concussion for a game. People clamoring draymond out was reason Lebron dropped 41 but did it again the game after.   I think 2017 cavs were even better team and had the advantage outside KD"
NBA champion Kevin Love*
Kevin Love has been a ghost for 3 years.
Kevin Love isn’t there.  Javale is a decent rim defender and rebounder
Fair. Better take Kevin Love instead.
yeah makes sense to go with fucking javale mcgee and kevin love instead  yall just be saying shit
"Man y’all just be rewriting history. I’ll let y’all say the Heat were a super team (even though I disagree heavily because D Wade knees deteriorated by year 3) because they had LeBron with his Uber athleticism still &amp; they had great defenders on that team, but the Cavs best defenders in that tenure were LeBron, JR Smith, Richard Jefferson &amp; Iman Shumpert (whenever he got to play). Kevin Love &amp; Kyrie were one way players &amp; Kevin Love was a player that LeBron terribly evaluated because he’s not a 16 game player meaning he’s a liability defensively &amp; his game isn’t really suited for the playoffs."
But when I said Kevin love was a token pick everyone freaks out and downvotes...
"Tim Duncan is unequivocal number 1. Kevin Garnett is my 2 but I can see others getting the spot. Barkley is still sitting pretty at 3. Hell, I know he was mostly a small forward, but I think Larry should get some love as a power forward and may put him at 4. But Giannis is knocking on the door if he gets this chip."
Imagine if the Cavs had Draymond and Klay instead of Kevin Love 😂
"‘Similar production’ doesn’t matter, we’re just talking about which team had the better players.   Imagine how good the Cavs would’ve been if they had Draymond Green and Klay Thompson instead of Kevin freakin Love lol"
fuck you talking about? 10 points a game kevin love? Give me klay every day and twice on sunday
I bet you could get Kevin Love for less
"In a game where LeBron and Kyrie combined for 77 and Kevin Love had SIX steals, the Cavs still lost."
Kevin Love is the only player the Cavs didn't draft and they traded for him with draft picks. It's not like a bunch of free agent decided to come to Cleveland...
Kevin Love averaged 26 12 and 4 before being traded to the Cavs.  Those finals were a lot more even than people will ever admit.
"Technically that year Cavs had more. Draymond Green was not a star, Kevin Love was a star."
"Perennial All-Star and Banana Republic ambassador, Kevin Wesley Love."
Some organizations just suck at team building. It's not small market vs big market.  New Orleans: Chris Paul Anthony Davis Zion Williamson  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett Kevin Love Karl Anthony Towns  Sacramento: Boogie Cousins  Etc.
"LeBron James / Kevin Love / Dwyane Wade / Isaiah Thomas / Derrick Rose  I mean, how many All NBA level guys does LeBron need??"
"“I was the underdog, Cavs had the Curry stopper Kevin Love so I got no help”"
"How were the Cavs better? Yes their offense was great, but JR Smith and Kevin Love would be unplayable against Houston, and LeBron can only do so much"
"You're arguing that Lebron James plus 2014 Kyrie and Kevin Love isn't a superteam but yeah, I'm delusional..."
"I didn't wanna say it but yeah, this is an example of how young this sub skews. Kevin Love's stock has dropped off a ton but at the time Kyrie and Love were seen as some of the top guys at their positions."
Replace Kevin Love with prime Shaq and I jizz my pants. Am I doing this right?
&gt;No one cares about Kyrie or Kevin Love being injured  A lot of people do.
No one cares about Kyrie or Kevin Love being injured so what are you talking about??
That's just a select few I would love to see join in. Hell I'd have Kevin huerter out there if it was my day lol
"The Cavs were a superteam before LeBron came back????     (And even if Bron didn't come back and it was just Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, I think it'd be a stretch calling us a superteam that season.)     But, whatever, TIL that superteams can go 33-49 and end the season behind the Knicks?"
"Gonna go Cavs just become of my family roots.  Kyrie Irving, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Shaquille O’Neal"
Jrue is so good at defending big men in the post. Pels played the Cavs last year and Kevin Love couldn't do shit to him
Never said they were. I was just commenting on why Kevin Love was there in the first place
Kevin Love wasn’t either
"15 years ago the Spurs were getting most of the veterans. Michael Finley comes to mind.  A great team will get veterans looking for a ring.  I'd like to see a list of veteran FAs who might be ready for a paycut, and veterans that might be waived/bought out during the season.  I'd keep an eye on Kevin Love. He seems injured and done, and has 2 years on his deal, but I think the Cavs will look to buy him out and if he gets 6+ months of rest and rehab, he could maybe join a team in February, just in time for a playoff run."
I'll be honest....I wouldn't pay him a big contract. I see another Kevin Love in the making. But alas if not the Suns some sucker....I mean team is going to give him some stupid contract.
A healthy washed up Kevin Love is still plenty productive enough to play for a contending team. He’s girthy enough to hold his own rebounding and provides spacing at a premium position.  No doubt he could help a playoff team as some platoon small ball 5/4 where he only has to focus on rebounding and catch and shoot for 20 minutes a game.
I would bring back Kevin Garnet from retirement. I'd pay him $10 million to come back and force Kevin Love to retire. Just make his life a living hell. If he wants to coast through retirement he can certainly try but I'm going to have someone call him out ever single practice. He can be smart with the gm anytime he wants but let's see him do that to Kevin Garnett. I'd payto watch this during practice everyday
"I remember a couple of years ago he was asked something to the effect of why doesn't he train with players on other teams in the off-season. He said something like why would he train with them when they're his opponents.   &gt;He told The Athletic: ‘I can’t work out with you in the summer and then play you in a few months. It feels weird. It doesn’t feel right with me. Like other players, it’s cool for other players, but I don’t. I don’t want to. Other guys do it. ‘I feel like with LeBron and KD [Kevin Durant], KD did that to LeBron. Take a lot of his thoughts and use it against him. And that’s what I don’t want guys doing to me.’  [Source](https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/25/nba-mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james-kawhi-leonard-summer-training-10055101/)  I think he just has a killer mentality, which I love. But because he doesn't train with them he doesn't build the same relationships. Like most of those guys grew up playing AAU ball together. Giannis didn't and he's also not into training, so he really isn't making friends.   I absolutely love his way of thinking. If other players don't give him props and go to his games then it's whatever. It doesn't seem to phase him."
Was Kevin Love starting at center?
"People dont really appreciate how awful that 2018 cavs team was. It was Lebron, the dead corpse of Kevin Love, and a bunch of role players. We had absolutely no business even making it to the 2nd round, let alone almost taking game 1 of the finals against the warriors."
That shit was a masterpiece. Idc what the haters say about the East. No other cav in the Pacers series averaged more than 10 points except “ all star” Kevin love with 11 ppg. Dude was literally doing everything
Kevin Love doesn't even run up the floor on defense.  He just kind of strolls up and arrives in the middle of the play.  You don't even notice you're playing 5-on-4 though because he's a turnstile when he does get there.  Sometimes he doesn't even bother walking up the floor at all.  I've seen plenty of plays where Love just stands on the other side of the court and waits for the ball to move back.  You don't notice it because the camera shifts away.  The Cavs were having a really nice season early in the year -- we were 10-11 after 21 games including the two wins over the Nets -- but the poor behavior from our max players sapped our momentum.  First it was our having to bench Andre Drummond because he just refused to play real basketball.  And then Kevin Love came back and stunk up the court.
This is Dan Gilbert’s clown ass thinking he can run a great franchise without Lebron lol. He thought he could sign up Kevin Love for that contract and trade it for assets to rebuild. What a clown. Such a terrible FO. No wonder Lebron wanted the hell out.
Or when you age derp derp. Kevin love is a 32 year old big. It happens. He's not lazy.
"Kevin Love did the same exact thing to him when he was ""healthy"" in their Christmas matchup the next season. Curry himself said that he could have gotten around Love but was hunting for a three too."
Sure. Or I’m not fucking weird and start psychoanalzying basketball players that I don’t know.   This subreddit argued that Lebron gave Kevin Love depression. like what?
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
"I don’t think Kevin love gets in. He likely doesn’t have more than 4,000 points left in him at most, so he won’t get 20k points, probably not 10k rebounds, and he’s only a 5X all star and 2X all NBA 2nd team."
"&gt; That’s just a bunch of excuses for MJ. You’re failing to look at the 93/94 team.  How so? It's the truth, they coasted to a title with Jordan and the very next year despite having better pieces overrall, couldn't make past the second round.  &gt; That team was a bad foul call away from the ECF. They took the Knicks to a game 5 without MJ. If they don’t make that BS call the Bulls are back in ECF. That’s not normal.  No they weren't, they were a bad foul call away from being up 3-2 in the series, the foul call didn't end the series, they had two games left to play and couldn't get it done.  &gt; You think the 2017 Cavs would make it to a game away from the ECF without Bron? Not a chance.  Yes, i absolutely do, especially considering how god awful the Eastern Conference was in 2017. They probably wouldn't have made the Finals, but they would've made the ECSF. They would've had to go through a 42-40 Pacers squad led by Wayoff P to match what the Bulls did in '94, hardly a challenge.  &gt; Or how about the 2011/12 Heat? Bron had to go nuclear in a game 6 at Boston down 3-2 in order to save their season. Bron doesn’t play that series and BOS probably sweeps Miami.  So? Jordan had to score 42 in Game 7 of the 1992 ECSF to carry the Bulls through the Knicks, then he had to average 41/8/6 in the greatest Finals performance of all time to beat the Suns in six, great players do great things.  &gt; I could do this exercise with a bunch of our modern stars and I can PROMISE you their teams aren’t winning 55 games without them.   And that only shows how you fail to understand what context is. Modern stars leave their teams because they don't think they can win, so they move while their teams rebuild, Michael didn't leave, he retired, the Bulls tried to bring new pieces to keep contending, which obviously didn't work as they got bounced in the second round.  But i will go along with it. Kevin Durant AND Serge Ibaka left the Thunder in 2016, they went from 55 to 47 wins. Kawhi Leonard left the Raptors and they went from 58 wins in 82 games to 53 in 72 the next year.  And since you love to ignore context, here is one that you will love: LeBron James joined a 35-win Lakers squad in 2018, they won 37 games with him the next year, by your logic you should question his impact."
Kevin love     Jimmy butler    Karl Anthony towns
Lowry - No  Lillard - Yes  Carmelo - Yes  Derrick Rose - No  Paul George - Probably   Kyrie - Yes  Kevin Love - No  Rudy Gobert - Maybe  Andre Iguodala - No
"Kevin Love has a much better case than Iggy  5x all star, 2x all NBA, Rebound title, MIP, NBA Champ, and a gold medal"
all expect kevin love
The Cavs would then trade them both together for Kevin Love.
"Ja's ""too big for his britches"" poster attempt on Kevin Love always makes me laugh.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJvHeuCLJAs"
Fun fact Kevin Love and Blake Griffin both recorded about 35 in their Max vertical leap in the combine. KLove no step vert was 29 Blake had 32 in his no step vert.
He wasn't. Kevin Love was switching onto Curry 1 on 1 for defense and getting stops. IIRC Curry did mention he was hurt during that dumber.  EDIT: SUMMER
"Not a record, but I doubt we will ever see someone get 30 points/30 Rebounds again. That Kevin Love game was something else."
"[Bosh says that it's hard playing with LeBron because you'll have to change the way you play and adjust to LeBron's game regardless of what you're comfortable with](https://sports.yahoo.com/chris-bosh-warns-kevin-love-that-playing-with-lebron-james-can-be-frustrating-for-stars-031507786.html?a20=1&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANOhFz9d5YlOosTvcNCjFgpVcMabknl0mOnspnt6xazYuoXVWLBgEGOSxIkdJCDWOrQh1HaV-vdS2dQpsWwNT9K8xzEGRY4uFZmISDh_hn_2wxH-QNyGbJA50buzlbVXOMeCpyScNfPTqhmpyBfsNgInttyeQFzJbSs9JwNKpCAP).

"So Kyrie and Kevin Love are not good teammates then?  Lebron is a better overall player because of his athleticism and high usage rate.  Bird had better numbers because he played in a team. He is not the team.  Lebron is the team. He needs the ball to be effective. He cannot function without the ball in his hands. Bird can.   Watch the 85/86 Celtics to see how the game is played properly. No hero balling in that team.  Lebron is a poster boy (along with MJ and Kobe) for hero ball which brings alot of money to the sport but at the same time, it killed the essence of the sport."
He had a good mid post player in Chris Bosh in Miami and a good low post player in Kevin Love in Cleveland. What happened to those guys?  AD is lucky that Lebron’s athleticism has gone down and has decided to defer more or he would have suffered the same fate as Bosh and Love. Two players that were having career years individually prior to playing with Lebron.
"I'm not ignoring context. I'm very aware of the context surrounding why they lost.   Of course getting Durant wasn't the only way for them to win.   I already touched on how Green not getting suspended or Bogut not getting injured or Curry not getting fouled out would have resulted in a win.   You could even argue that Kyrie and Love getting injured is another avenue to win like it was in 2015.   Again I feel like you're misunderstanding my point...    I already acknowledged that the Warriors had the base level of talent to be able to win. That's not what getting Durant gave them. Getting Durant was getting a safety net so that even if any of the aforementioned circumstances occured again the Warriors could still win.   So if we pretend for a second that you are the Warriors front office or ownership. And I ask you ""/r/MasaiGotUsNow, your team just lost the finals. What do you ***need*** to do in order to make sure that doesn't happen again?""  Your response would probably be ""All of those circumstances are out of my control. But free agency is in my control. So what I ***need*** to do is get the best player I can so that this team is so talented that even if any of the other extenuating circumstances occur we can still win.""   Now you, as a fan, can be against that decision and think that they shouldn't be allowed to do that. That's fine.  But in the context of this conversation, regarding what the Warriors ***needed*** to do in order to, not win, but prevent a loss in the face of overwhelming adversity: it was to get the best player available, which was Kevin Durant.   And that's part of the reason it seems to you like I'm ignoring the context of the injuries in 2019 or the other circumstances in 2016. Because the whole benefit of having Kevin Durant was to make any and all circumstances irrelevant. If you make your team so good then theoretically Draymond getting suspended shouldn't matter. Curry fouling out shouldn't matter. Bogut getting injured shouldn't matter.   But as we saw, Kevin Durant wasn't even enough to negate all adversity."
Kevin Love was pretty good - getting 20/10 out of your 3rd option. He could deliver a bucket when needed. He was absolutely sick from 3 point range at times. I'd say the first 3 seasons in Cleveland he largely delivered but in 2018 he had become basically useless when he was the 2nd option. He really fell off a cliff and never recovered.
Agree. Nobody is getting close to 55 rebounds. Only one player (Kevin Love) has hit over 30 in a game since 1996.
That's dumb. Any type of player can win a championship. Role players have won championships. Even lower tier stars like Kevin Love have won a championship. Is he better than Barkley?
"Kevin Garnett. I got to see his peak years in MN back in middle and high school, with the culmination having season tickets during his MVP year and seeing the Wolves win their only two playoff series in franchise history.   He is just so unique, full of passion and intensity, never been another player like him. Love his entire attitude. Love the ferocious dunks. Love him boinging the basketball against his head when he missed a free throw. Love him not allowing any made baskets after the whistle. Love how complete his game was being able to score, defend, rebound, ball handle, and pass. He changed the landscape of the NBA coming out of high school - not saying others like Kobe and Lebron wouldn’t have still been great players, but without KG jumping first the narrative for those guys change a bit."
"Kevin Garnett. His intensity on both sides of the court were insane. I also love all the stories of his trash talking, like when he told Melo his wife tasted like Honey Nut Cheerios 🤣"
Kevin Durant. Just love watching him play and the stuff he posts on Twitter is always hilarious
"Man when I heard Rubio was coming from Spain, I immediately thought “Finally Kevin love have some help! 6-8th seed guaranteed”"
"There’s nothing about Wall’s play this season that suggests he’s taken a big step back from where he was. And subsequently get to the point of being out of the league like Cousins.   Many thought Rose was heading in that direction. Look where he ended up. Slight bit of skill and a team that understands you and he’s a fairly large contributor to a higher seed.   If Klay can’t run like he used to off screens , he becomes a more stand still shooter than a movement shooter. With his shooting, that turns him into a better version of Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris. While still being a physically bigger player on defense. If he can’t chase guards, he’s strong enough for 3s. In the finals Kevin Love couldn’t post him up. He got moved back.   He will change. He’s not Cousins."
"His teams have more talent than their records indicate. The bad defense is his fault, he’s the center he’s like anti Gobert. Elite shooter though but I’m starting to get Kevin Love flashbacks from KAT."
"If we’re talking old heads, Wes Unseld’s highlights of just his outlet passes are insane. Kevin Love’s father was Wes’s teammate (hence Kevin’s middle name of Wesley), and that’s where Love learned how to outlet pass."
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Kevin Martin should get some love, averaging nearly 25 ppg game in '09 along with generating an absurd 10+ FTA per game (making 9)."
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Prime Kevin Love is the GOAT
"There’s sooo many great ones honestly, but two of my favorites that haven’t been mentioned in the thread yet are:   &gt; Clippers meeting with Durant was “intense” and “at one point Steve Ballmer was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned  &gt; Kevin Love was confused when he didn’t see Jordan Clarkson run onto the court moments before tipoff Monday night. Then Love saw teammate Tristan Thompson, who was lagging behind. Thompson said one word to Love. “Utah”."
Kevin Love. 😂
Didn’t your team give a max contract to kevin love who has been riding your bench for the majority of the last two years?
"Yes, the iconic superteam of LBJ, Kyrie, and Concussion Kevin Love. Also, LBJ, AD, and 60-year-old Rondo."
On the Kevin Love Boat
Right and KD still did everything he could and had crazy games.  It’s like when KD won with the Warriors people were saying he’s better than LeBron cus LeBron couldn’t win with Jr Smith and Kevin Love lmao. In reality LeBron was still clearly better. Same thing happening here with Giannis vs KD.
you'd rather let him walk for nothing than firsts and a very promising young player? Strange. But then again the Cavs did reup Kevin Love even though he's made of glass.
tbf when he skied over kevin love is still by far the coolest missed dunk i’ve ever seen lmao
kevin love averaged 8 pts and 7 reb in the 2016 finals vs 73-9 warriors
"&gt;KD did nothing 'by himself'.  You seem to be taking things way too literally. By your logic, I could argue that Lebron didn't do anything 'by himself' when carrying the Cavs in 2018 because he needed performances from Kevin Love and other role players to win.   &gt;he needed help, he wasn't close without it.  This literally could apply to any NBA great. No one wins without *some* help. Seems like a pretty useless point to make.   I'll put it this way: KD, with barely any consistent help after Game 3, with the exception of Blake Griffin, nearly willed the Nets to a series victory over the Bucks."
I'm flashing back to Casey putting CJ Miles on Kevin Love...
"Love is good, but he isn't close to KG, KD, and Kevin McHale."
"It’s actually Lebron both ways.   His haters gas the ever living fuck out of Zydrunas Ilguaskas, Mo Williams as they hold any remote comparison to Shaq. Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Pau Gasol.    Additionally they retroactively made Kyrie and Kevin Love Superstars when LBJ joined them . You can’t be a superstar and your consistently leading your team into the lottery, I don’t care how many all star selections you get    They are the same group of people who never once mentioned The words Anthony Davis as much as they did when he played with Lebron. AD is great but most people had AD firmly outside the top five. When he goes to LBJ suddenly he’s been top 5 this whole time lol"
"Dude Curry has gotten ragdolled in the playoffs and looked a shell of himself a lot of times. The guy was getting locked up by Kevin Love in the 2016 finals. He is just too much of a finesse player. MJ's size, explosiveness just gave him the edge even when his jumper wasn't falling. He was relentless at attacking the basket. Curry could only dream of having the finishing prowess on the baseline and around the basket Jordan had. The hangtime, vert and handsize just made Jordan a force around the basket. Curry only has the teardrops and floaters which doesn't utilize enough, he barely takes any midrange jumpers even when the three is off."
"Lavine was a late lottery pick, he didn't really develop until he was traded to the Bulls in the Jimmy Butler trade. Good selection by the T-Wolves but they completely failed at unlocking his potential. I was mostly kidding with KG and KAT I agree the Wolves are bad at drafting lol. I even forgot to mention Kevin Love, god these guys have had a lot of #1 picks."
"&gt; It absolutely changes how you'd rank him.  Because you're getting swept up in the narratives that you framed in the first paragraph. If the 2016 Finals plays out exactly the same way except Kyrie misses his shot over Steph and Steph makes his shot over Kevin Love, resulting in a Warriors victory, how would that affect your ranking of LeBron?"
"He couldn't win in Cleveland, so he went to Miami with 2 other stars to form the first superteam. He went back to Clevland with all their first overall picks, and only won there after Cleveland picked up Kevin Love, a star at the time. Moved to LA, couldn't win until he got yet another star.   His co-star gets injured this year, and his team can't even make it out of the first round."
"Klay was almost gone because Kevin Love was available and only because Jerry West was against it, and Draymond was scouted by West. The current front office didn't even draft Curry! Every decision they made after Jerry West has been horrible and even Jerry West can be attributed to KD as he had told him that he could be in a bunch of finals and be the most successful loser. They drank their own kool-aid for years and believed they were so much better than the Logo that they banned him from practices. They get credit for spending and wanting a championship every year, unlike Fertitta in Houston who wants to constantly duck the luxury tax, but I won't give them credit for things Jerry West had a hand in. Especially when this same front office could've kept Jerry West as a consultant, but ostracized him instead."
"So there exists only 1 super team? The Warriors? That’s laughable. It’s all semantics and subjective to biased opinions then. Again, look at what the league was doing, Celtics with KG, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce was the Super team of their time just not labeled. The Lakers and other teams did the same.   Lebron bailed on Cleveland why? Why didn’t he just push forward n win it then? Because he wanted to start Ring chasing with the best odds… look at the intentions and moves. Lebron, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love is a super team. Are we just arguing semantics and minor details here? To split hairs so we can dump 100% of the super teaming on Durant while forgetting all context of every other Franchise trying to super team? Or just excuse Lebron?   Lebron crushed the East for how long with Super teams? Take out Lebron of his teams huh? So why not just take Curry out of the Warriors, Kd with Klay and Dray isn’t a Super team either just an extremely great team led by Durant in that case  I applauded Lebron for leaving Cle the first time, he was smart enough to know he can’t carry alone. The league is trending towards stacked super stars and super teams at the time. He was a genius to orchestrate his OWN super teams on HIS terms. And then he can bail on the franchise (Cle, Mia, Cle) n let them sink of swim. The Warriors were a self made “super team” and Kd joined it. So he had it easier than Lebron having to put together a super team, so what? If I recall at least KD left the Warriors but let them work something out of it. Lebron just nopes the fuck out on the franchise with no help on the future I think."
The All-Kevin lineup   Johnson Durant Love McHale Garnett
"Only tangentially related, but in December 2015 I saw the Cavs play the Nuggets in the Pepsi Center. Joffrey Lauvergne put Kevin Love in the spin cycle in the first quarter and I yelled out ""Don't hurt em! Don't hurt em!"". At the time I thought King Joffrey was the best big on the roster, over Nurkic and Jokic, based on that single play. I maintain to this day that I was wrong."
Kevin Love full court outlet passes.
Kevin Love: outlet passing
&gt;Ok now do Kevin Love with some boy bans music.
"Not just a lil bit, he’s actually changing the way he plays in order to pad his rebounding. I was also really sold on him during his younger days in Detroit, thought that he would be the next great big. During his stints with the Cavs and Lakers, I was able to watch him closely. He plays hard moreso to get rebounds, not necessarily to do the right plays. On the defensive end, he almost always hesistates before fully committing to switches because of the possible defensive rebound opportunity. Which, part of the reason why he’s almost always cooked defending the PnR.   Also, rebounding skills for me, includes great nose for the ball, great positioning, active hands to always try to challenge for the rebound. Minny Kevin Love has a great rebounding skill/technique, leading the league in rebs while not being the most athletic big (like when prime Dwight was leading the league in rebs). I don’t think Drummond excels in those areas.   Also he said it himself he literally is throwing elbows at teammates that tries to fight for the rebound as well. Taking stat padding to an even more annoying level."
I love Kevin Harlan
"Andre Drummond(C), Kevin Love(PF), Ben Simmons(SF), Rajon Rondo(PG), Austin Rivers(SG)  This actually looks like a good team on paper."

Jeff Teague’s face watching Kevin Love hit the 3 that extended the Cavs lead to 38 before halftime (wow) always gets me.
"Kevin Love would like a word. a 30-30 Minnesota miracle man who was barely dragged to a championship by Prime LeThanos.      Before you say anything, I do believe that KAT plays more of a winning basketball than Love ever did, but he's a center who's a cone on defense."
"Not sure why you get downvoted for that statement. History is replete with guys who put up 25 on bad teams. Then they go to good teams where they can win, and usually those players come back down to earth and score like 18-20 points a game. It’s not hard to score on a really bad team if you are the best player eating up all the usage. Dude is basically Chris Bosh or Kevin Love. Both those guys had very similar stats on bad teams. Way over what they would go on to produce on good teams.   I won’t argue against anyone saying his best years are wasting away. If DLO/KAT/ANT/BEV can’t produce this year, people need to stop making so many excuses for KAT. How he is underrated, I will never know."
LeBron would have won in 2015 if Kyrie and Kevin Love didn't get hurt. Easily.
"Kevin Pritchard explained it best after his second stint with us:   &gt;""Sometimes he was the best player on our team, and sometimes he was the best player on the other team,"" Pritchard told reporters. ""We love Lance and we wish him the best."""
Kevin Love 4 years 120 million
Yup with kyrie injured in game 1 and Kevin love not even playing for that series.
"Every team deals with injuries during the playoffs. A slow ass Kevin Love locking down Curry in the 2016 Finals doesn't scream fully healthy to me either, but that's the way the game is. That Blazers team was better than you remember."
Kevin Love defending Curry on their most important possession.
"Kevin Love for Ben Simmons, fast and easy. No take backs."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yyGCpla2UY&amp;ab_channel=NF  He went 3/16 and there isn't a single double team, he was even getting switched on to Tristan Thompson, Larry Nance and Kevin Love lmao and couldn't score"
"The weakest link was Harrison Barnes, and they added the second best small forward, a former MVP and scoring champ.   Klay, Steph, Draymond, and Iguadala (who could've started in Denver). You can't put together a better team in 2014-15   Lol yea they're not stacked.   Kevin love was a huge part of their championship, but he was obviously not the greatest PF, others proved to be effective. He was a lone star in Minnesota. They took a chance on Love and it paid off, but it was never a sure thing."
"I think Kevin Durant is one of the best of All Time.  I love Draymond both on and off the court.  I disagree deeply with everything they just said.  They sound very immature and coddled and out of touch.  They argued ON WORKTIME AT THE WORKPLACE.  The org did the best they could to try to fix it.  It wasn't perfect, but asking for an apology is ABSOLUTELY normal.  My goodness, ego is a crazy thing."
"ultimately they won 73 because they played super well together, not because how stacked they were  obviously KD changed that the next season, but people stay revising history when they talk about the 73 win season  people love evaluating teams with hindsight  it's like the people that downplay kevin love after seeing the results, but completely ignoring the fact that he was the best PF when the cavs acquired him"
Yeah kyrie and Kevin love were trash af. So we’re the 10 shooters on his team /s
"I agree with the crux of your point about things being different, not necessarily easier or harder. But now I'm also kind of intrigued by the thought of Bill Laimbeer's skill set in today's NBA.   Of course, dude wouldn't last a day had he insisted upon carrying on with the dirty play for which he became so notorious. But he was also very cognizant about what he was doing (dastardly, even), so I could see him curbing a lot of that for the sake of self-preservation.   *Only* in terms of Laimbeer's actual skillset and make-up, I do think there's a chance he survives in today's NBA. For one, he was one of the first stretch fives in NBA history and [used to hold the Finals record for 3-pointers in a single game](https://youtu.be/Y_4W06cZZsY).   Elsewhere, he was kind of like a slower Kevin Love with better defensive awareness. Led the league in rebounding, excellent outlet passer, could stretch the floor, and somehow always ended up ready and waiting as a helpside defender despite his halting athleticism. And as strange as it sounds, he [somehow had a knack for chasedown blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qANRO_mfcvY&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen).   The obvious factor for which there's no answer, would be figuring out what to do with Laimbeer defensively on high screen and rolls on account of his cement feet. Maybe that's where his modern career starts and ends. Like, I make that comparison to Love but Laimbeer would have never been able to do what Love did in that Finals perimeter matchup with Steph Curry. But if a team were able to finagle something to shield him on that front, I actually think he'd have a lot of assets that'd translate today."
"Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard after Lance left the Pacers to sign with LA in 2018:  &gt; We love Lance. We love Lance on the court, we love Lance off the court. Sometimes, he was the best player on our team and sometimes he was the best player on the other team. We love Lance and we wish him the best.  Not the best thing to say about a former player as a GM but he was definitely right."
Kevin love is my second guess because I remembered he was 6'8
"Kevin Love, Steven Adams? Al Horford? John Wall?"
Kevin Love and whoever else gets bought out
"Prime Kevin Love was when he was in Minny, but yeah those were damn good teams."
"first go around yes (+2018 but by that time we were aging out and had zero assets left), second go around no. 2015-17 we had some of the best playoff offenses ever. Obviously you can argue that's because of Bron but Kyrie/Peak JR/Tristan Thompson/Prime Kevin Love is a pretty damn good supporting cast"
"“I’m Kevin Durant, you know who I am” or when Lebron said he was confident because he’s the best player in the world I love it  BIG DICK ENERGY"
"Fast forward to mid-season, Kevin Love gets bought out 👀"
May we interest you in one Kevin Love in fair condition?
"He can’t get the mental health excuse, this sub reserved that for Kevin Love."
I think Klay and Kevin Love grew up pretty close in Lake Oswego
"Then again he played a postion that was pretty well represented during his best season. Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Chris Bosh, Tim Duncan and Dirk where still playing high level basketball. Now compare the numbers."
"Kevin can Love, Marcus is Smart, Jaylen’s skin is the color Brown, Demarcus has Cousins"
"Yeah if it’s a random role player it seems weird but when guys like Durant say “I’m Kevin Durant, you know who I am” or when Lebron said he was confident because he’s the best player in the world I love it"
Drummond isn’t a negative. Sheesh everytime a player plays with Lebron and is asked to play entirely outside his comfort zone he is suddenly terrible. It’s Kevin Love all over again.
"Cavs: Kevin Love is worse than you could possibly imagine. Every trade idea is built upon the false pretense that he’d ever help anyone win at this stage. His attitude, contract, and general health sucks so hard."
"Oh he will fucking play. Because yeah who is dumb enough to give up that money. But you are going to abso-fuckinglutely hate how he is playing. Look at how Kevin Love has been playing with the Cavs and shit, it will be like that, he won't give any effort, he will go through the motions and not give an actual shit."
i mean the 5th pick wasn't that bad and he was with u guys till this szn. I feel like Rubio must hv been ur  best pick in the Kevin Love era
"In the last few years Minnesota has turned Kevin Love, Zach Lavine, and 4 lottery picks into D-LO, Malik Beasley, ~~Ricky Rubio~~ Taurean Prince, and ~~Jarret Culver~~ Pat Bev."
Not really a statistic but who locked down Steph Curry while up 3 with 30 seconds left in game 7 of the NBA finals?  Kevin Love.
"And you wouldn't win 15 if the Cavs had kyrie and love. And you wouldn't win 17 and 18 if you didn't make it impossible to win by recruiting Kevin Durant. But it's fine, you guys won't win another chip anytime soon lol"
I love both of these guys and how they played in summer league but they haven’t played a second of NBA basketball so I would just pump the brakes on throwing them out there like established NBA players.   I remember Iggy Brazdeikis and Kevin Knox lighting up summer league their rookie seasons.
"Mental health is so important when it's Kevin love tweeting about it, but we see Ben clearly struggling and just haaaave to shit on him constantly"
"Anybody who comes from the era of the dress code and the media environment of the 90s or earlier know that the players have it easy as fuck today. Kevin Love is complaining about being criticized for being out of shape. NBA players are closer to the billionaire class than they are to the average fan, not sure why people need to cape for them. These guys get max deals then turn around and complain bout being held to literally the bare minimum. If these guys don’t want to do the bare minimum, quit. Give up your max deal and just walk away. Imagine being a WNBA player listening to these guys lol. Like honestly they need to get some perspective and stop being narcissistic pricks."
"If Kevin Love had come out talking trash the moment they didn't pick him, then you'd have a point. He didn't though so you don't"
"I like how you didn't respond to any of the pictures I showed you, clearly showing that Kevin Love is taller than LeBron. Look at them lined up at the Olympics. LeBron is clearly shorter than Love, and Love measured 6'7.75"" without shoes at his draft combine. I even linked you his draft measurements and he hasn't grown since then, since he is still listed at 6'8"" in 2021. This more than proves that Love, listed at 6'8"" and LeBron listed at 6'9"", is bullshit from the NBA.   The NBA height listings are garbage though. You can be naive and believe all of them that you want, but the NBA has been inflating players heights since the 80s and there wasn't 3rd party sources to verify that measurements were be taken accurately. What incentive do NBA teams have to 100 percent be honest with their listings? It is the same in college and high school. Players are regularly added 1-2 inches in height. You're telling me LeBron is only 1 inch shorter than KD and AD?   &amp;#x200B;  Celebheights is not outdated. It is still ran to this day, and regularly updated. Even the consensus average guess of LeBron on there, is that he is less than 6'8"". Either way, my originally point stands. LeBron is not an entire 3-5 inches taller than Zion, like some people were falsely trying to say."
"Drummond had the 4th most post-ups in the league with a blistering 82 ORtg on those possessions.  Sabonis was top-10 in attempts with an 84 ORtg on postups.  Westbrook, Siakam, Nurkic, Wiseman, Aaron Gordon, Kevin Love, …  All these guys were in the top-25 in post-ups per game while scoring fewer than 0.90 PPP. Absolutely awful offense.  The Blazers had one of the best offenses in the league and still posted up Nurkic on 30% of his offensive possessions with a ghastly 0.74 PPP  If teams see a small guy on a big, they go to that post up regardless of how bad the big is at posting up. They shouldn’t, but they do."
"How can he blame it on Kevin Love? The guy was not playing, and a single player aside from Johnson, vice Kevin Love, would not magically improve a recently constructed team."
This show is stupid and Kevin Love is a dramatic little bitch.
Nah fuck Kevin Love i'm on team Colangelo on this. Love said he wanted to play for team USA and he showed up out of shape in no condition to play. That's not disrespect to Colangelo but to the guys on the team. I'm glad he called him outz
"Are we going to pretend like Kevin Love hasn't been a curmudgeon in Cleveland these past two seasons? He's been a bad teammate, the antithesis of a leader, and his on-court play has diminished significantly. Colangelo airing him out publicly was wrong and fucked up but I would say that Kevin Love has been more detrimental to the success of the Cavaliers over the course of the last two years than Colangelo's comments were to either Kevin Love's reputation, or Team USA's gold medal run this summer"
"That's a great breakdown of the situation. Simmons is not a player I personally consider in the elite tier where the max contract for them is an underpay, but 76ers fans sound completely detached from reality when they say that he's worth nothing close to his contract without shooting better.   Look around the NBA, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, Al Horford, Kevin Love are getting paid close to Simmons money and they produce nowhere near his value. Porzingis, Tobias and Wall are getting paid more than Simmons and are producing less value. Simmons is a DPOY candidate and a great passer in transition which like it or not, is valuable in the regular season when players are less willing to sacrifice their bodies on the defensive end. He's a 3 time all-star in 4 years of playing. Perennial all-stars get max contracts easily in today's NBA.  Simmons on the open market is still a 25-30 million a year player. He fits the Sixers exceptionally poorly because their superstar is a big, but that does not make it his obligation to change his game, it's on their front office to build a team that suits their star.   As for the trade request, wasn't this mutually agreed to when his group and the Sixer FO had a meeting at the start of the off-season? They said that they would like to trade him, he agreed that he would be better in a different situation. Then Morey spent the entire summer making ridiculous trade demands very publicly to the point where everyone who follows the NBA knows that the Sixers are only keeping him begrudgingly. Why wouldn't a player hate the team at that point? He needs to report to camp, take the money and crush the team morale as much as he can."
"Tell me you know nothing about basketball without saying it.   2016 Warriors were far, far better than 2015. Kevin Love in the playoffs is worthless. Look at his stats.   2016 Warriors against the Cavs minus Kyrie is over in five at best."
"Kinda like how Kevin Love is blaming Colangelo now shit is going wrong for him, because he is (at least somewhat) washed and trashed his own value by lacking effort and allegedly ruining team chemistry? I don't hate on Love but have some responsibility if you're going to accuse Jerry of having none."
Kevin Love lied about being in shape to get on Team USA and then got called out for it.
"&gt;if you deadass think Kevin Love was the reason the team struggled early on...  If you need me to be more specific about the sentence...  &gt;if you  Last I checked, you were replying to me. The ""you"" in your sentence would be me.   Its okay, words are hard lil buddy."
"Kevin Love is a shitty basketball player these days with a shitty attitude. That said, it can be hard mentally when you're not good at the thing that's defined your life and you know you'll never be as good at as you once were.  He's still a shitty basketball player with a shit attitude though."
"&gt;Because if you deadass think Kevin Love was the reason the team struggled early on... 💀💀💀  Yeah, that's putting words in my mouth bud."
&gt;The only reason it was public was because Colangelo was scared they might actually lose and desperately needed a scapegoat.    &gt;Because if you deadass think Kevin Love was the reason the team struggled early on... 💀💀💀
"The problem wasn't who did or didn't ""hold up their end of the bargain"", the problem was it was public when it didn't need to be.  The only reason it was public was because Colangelo was scared they might actually lose and desperately needed a scapegoat.   Because if you deadass think Kevin Love was the reason the team struggled early on... 💀💀💀"
"Colangelo knows people were going to blame him and call him a asshole because he’s been a shithead his entire NBA career, so he was just getting ahead of the curve and saying it wasn’t just him being a dick the decision was made because Kevin Love showed up out of shape.  Love hasn’t exactly earned the benefit of the doubt the last 2 years by showing a basic late of interest in even pretending to care about the Cavs and throwing actual hissy fits on the court, Colangelo has been a snake forever.  This whole thing boils down to two arrogant people being arrogant."
So Kevin Love has mental health issues?
Tell me you're casual af without telling me you're casual af...  Kyrie only played Game 1 of the 2015 series that Golden State won and he was injured in that game. Bron nearly went up 3-2 on Golden State by himself. No Kevin Love either.
Only Kevin Love could get that much credit for contesting a bad Curry 3 on the worst night of his career
Gotta be Kevin Love in 2016 Game 7 for 5 seconds /s
Yeah but you can't see it as an attack on Embiid.   LeBron was the main reason Kevin Love lost 10ppg when he went to Cleveland. That doesn't mean LeBron is a bad player.   It's just a stylistic clash. A paint dominant player and a drive-and-kick dominant player are going to step on each others' toes in a big way because even though their games are different they're both trying to occupy the same space.   One will always be forced into an awkward position.
And remember the time he made Kevin Love suicidal? Man you kids are annoying.
I remember his clutch af shot over Kevin Love at the end of the game in the finals. He was so clutch…
"[Spears] Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  To this day, this is still the funniest story ever. That 2018 Cavs locker room was magical"

"&gt;but then, even considering our dominance, you'd think he'd have at least one.   For sure. This is definitely a fluke. But flukes are fun to point out!  &gt;It's absolutely true because you can't let him iso, he'll make the shot.  Except on lockdown defenders on the perimeter like Kevin Love. ;)"
"Playing NBA 2k13 and Timberwolves are the bomb.  Love and Pekovic bombing 3s, Kevin Martin on fire, your own player the MVP after grinding."
He also shot plenty in the face of LeBron/Kawhi but you insist on mentioning Kevin Love.
"Plenty of elite shooters get doubled or are otherwise left alone to go one on one for a game winner. It’s just not Steph’s game is all. He thrives in shooting from off ball motion, not face shotting. See Kevin Love ding up on him…"
Aren’t you the guy who said Hartenstein and Biyambo are better than Kevin Love?
"What are you talking about, almost every NBA series is close... And are you not going to take into account Dwayne Casey was an unprepared ass-hat who let the corpse of Kevin Love cook CJ Miles for 20/10 without making any adjustments. He drew up iso play after iso play with no ball movement, and expected demar to make every shot with someones hand in his face. Maybe his game doesn’t translate as well to the playoffs as other players, but the original argument was you arguing that he “caps a team if he has a significant role”, which I just don’t believe."
"Umm, Kaminsky has a career blocks per game average of 0.4, and Olynyk's is 0.5 . Kevin Love (6' 8"", 6' 11"" wingspan) averages 0.4 in his career. I don't think these facts are actually helping your point. Short-armed bigs don't block a lot of shots.  The median NBA team blocks about 5 shots per game total (for 2020 it was New York with 4.9 per game). Divided among all of the minutes being played, that's about one block per 48 minutes per player. The ""statistically average"" player gets 0.75 blocks per 36 minutes. So 0.5 isn't even that far below average. But that's not remotely how shot blocking works. The leader board for blocks per game [last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_game.html#per_game_stats::blk_per_g) is completely dominated by centers and small-ball centers, who drive up their team's averages. Slot career-average Blake in there, and he'd still be above average for an NBA rotation player, although still below average for a power forward.  Some other interesting data points: LeBron's career blocks average is 0.7, and Kawhi's is 0.6 . Dwyane Wade, the best shot-blocking guard ever, averaged 0.8 . That's our baseline for a *great* defensive non-center. So all we really proved is that Blake is definitely not that."
"That's solid. Very solid. We call this ""The Kevin Love Strategy"""
"For so long people have acted like the org can’t do anything right, thanks for acknowledging their development looks good.  It drives me nuts when people are just like “I want to see Garland play on a team where they actually develop him properly then let’s see how he does” like all the young Cavs players are moving along really nicely right now.  Garland and sexton have shown huge improvement each year.  Okoro showed development last year.  We drafted KPJ.  I have some confidence in our ability to grow as a team.  We’re still gonna only win like 30 games though and that Kevin Love contract is genuinely still a headache."
"Oh man I remember the amount of hype he received, Lebron made the right choice trading him for Kevin Love and getting that ring or else he would’ve been stuck in Cleveland for the rest of his life"
1. He had a back injury that was affecting him.   2. Both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injured.   3. The Cavaliers intentionally slowed down the pace of the game so as to not play to Golden State's strengths. Half court efficiency for most players is far worse than transition (which is a lot of what brings up offensive rating).
"I get that Jrue is probably a better player than Cavs Kevin Love but it's weird to me that Khris Middleton is being portrayed here as an equal to Kyrie Irving.  Even aside from that strange comparison, I have never really seen anyone call Khris a top 20 player.  If that's what he is, then great. He's one of my all time favorites. And I hope he can ride that and his playoff success to the Hall of Fame, like Kyrie was so obviously capable of doing by the time he won that championship."
"I mean, Kevin Love is still getting paid..."
I mean KD was the best player in both series’.  Like are those rings crossed off for Klay and Steph too?  Do they actually only have 1 ring?  Does that 1 ring have less value than the two they won with KD if the Cav’s were missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love basically all series?
"Rick Adelman coached Clyde Drexler, Terry Porter, Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway, Chris Webber, Yao Ming, and Kevin Love, but never won a ring. Despite winning 60% of his games and making the conference finals, guess he’s a scrub.  Don Nelson coached Alex English, Bob Lanier, Sidney Moncrief, Chris Mullin, Sarunas Marciulionis, Latrell Sprewell, Patrick  Ewing, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki. He also has the most coaching wins in NBA history and made the Hall of Fame as both a coach and a player. No rings though? Fuck that guy too."
"I haven't payed enough attention to the off-season moves, but I would think Kevin Love would be a good replacement  Edit: thinking about it they probably have that position covered, but Simmons would do well in Cleveland"
Kevin Love with his outlet passes
Well there is John Wall and Kevin Love.
"Definitely not gonna be able to acquire Sexton. The Cavs will ask for a lot and/or demand Kevin Love be taken back in a deal. And I can’t see any reason why the Thunder would want to dump Dort or the Jazz giving up the 6MOTY. As for Turner you can add THT, Nunn and a Minimum deal and I believe it works. Warren and maybe Brooks make sense although who knows when Warren plays again."
Vegas odds will be amazing on who will play less games. Him or Kevin Love
Warriors putting up 150 a night against any team playing Kevin Love and Isaiah Thomas.
"Wasting Kevin Love, Garnett, and KAT and never doing anything of note as a franchise. Now THAT is a shit franchise 😂"
C: Zydrunas Ilgauskas  PF: Larry Nance Sr/ Kevin Love  SF: LeBron James  SG: Austin Carr  PG: Mark Price/ Kyrie Irving
"Plus Kevin Love and Kevin McHale. Honestly, Team Kevin by itself would be pretty deadly."
Kevin Love?
"Uhh they got Kevin Love by trading their number one draft pick, about 10 seconds after drafting him.  Kind of funny how once you luck into the pieces to make a deal, it gets done instantly.  Weird, really weird."
Kevin Love after the olympics and the negative press run he had going
"Also, how did you guys get perennial rebounder kevin love? Trade lmao. And they needed active pushing by lebron to actually do it.   If a team no star wants to play for can turn from laughing stock to champions in 1 year, why can’t a team with one of the greatest of all time do it in 7? Cuz they were incompetent."
"Spurs should stand pat and just field offers for anyone they don't deem untouchable. Not a big Spurs follower, but I'm not sure if anyone on that roster is safe. Maybe Murray, White, Walker, Johnson, Vassell and Primo are the only untouchables.  Cavs need to only be concerned with the Kevin Love deal and what they think of Sexton as the deadline approaches. They are better off standing pat and watching Garland develop.  Wolves should run it back and bank on health and internal improvement.  Raptors, too."
"Embid can't guard 1-5.  You need someone who can guard them and come off switches .  Who does embid have to guard at his position on a nightly basis in his conference. Clint capella just catches lobs, bam has no jumper, Celtics, wizards, nets no serious threat down low. Brook Lopez is outside the paint spacing for giannas.  Nerlen Noel's is a defensive player.   Verse simmons having to pick up. Trae young, westbrook, kyrie or James harden,  Jimmy butler, Tatum, . All with different skills sets ? A.d. was basically a glorified kevin love with the pelicans. Always hurt and your team can never win."
"Why doesn’t Tacko Fall, the largest of the Cavs, simply eat Kevin Love?"
That's Kevin Love but not poor
"At that point, you’re betting against yourself by getting rid of so many core guys at once. Any sort of Cavs trade really feels like it’s going to involve Kevin Love being moved to a 3rd team with a guard they wouldn’t mind moving.  For example, I can see the Cavs moving Love, Sexton, and a first to Philly and Philly moving Love’s contract and one of their firsts to Houston for Wall. Saves Houston money and gets them a pick from Philly, Philly gets two good lead guards and if the Cavs are bad again, they can move Wall plus that pick for more value, and the Cavs obviously get Simmons."
"That is funny. And prepare to flame on.... but... Im a Laker fan.  And I get that I benefit from the subjectiveness more than most, because I have players that benefit.  The issue is so real that GMs team build around the concept.  You know:  LeBron, Kobe, Kevin, Harden etc etc can either get a bucket or will get a call.  It just bugs the crap out of me that when there is a great play I hold my breath for 2 secs to see if there is a call or not.  OR if there should have been a call but wasnt, robbing me of some of the joy of the moment.  I dont really have an answer, just a wish that it was clearer / cleaner &amp; less subjective.  My best reconciliation is:  This is competitive entertainment &amp; will have some moments you have to suspend belief.  Not a compromise I love making."
"John Wall and Kevin Love were perennial all-stars!  They're up for grabs, PHI!      Other than that its CJ McCullum, who might've been an all-star in the eastern conference lol"
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
But Kevin love can score more than 4 pts a game.
instagrams from NBA purgatory! Kevin Love and Derrick Favors will come join the shootaround any minute now
Holy shit dude. You just gave us an idea to get out of that awful contract.  Let’s eat Kevin Love.
"I wouldn't trade a bag of stale popcorn for Kevin Love. It's cheaper, doesn't constantly bitch and moan and at least I can eat the popcorn."
It's crazy how much faster and more athletic he was as fat Kevin Love than he was in the LeBron era.
The worst thing about the Kevin Love trade is that we also traded K-Love the octopus
Well that’s not much worse than Kevin Love tbh so not a big deal. Very little downside in waiting.
"Sir, you are forgetting about 5 time All-star Kevin Love!"
What is his value possibly going to depreciate to? The best we can right now is Kevin Love or Malik Beasley lol
"And i hope we send him to Cavs or something.  ""You wanted California and to play with Steph? Here, enjoy fucking Ohio and playing with Kevin Love."""
"Just to name a few: Baron Davis, Reggie Miller, Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook, Bill Walton and Kareem (imagine him as a Laker; nuts!)  I wonder if the Lakers and Clippers would flip a coin for Territorial Picks."
"Redick on that nba player tier 2 hotness with Minnesota (first stint) Rubio, Banana Republic Kevin Love, and post-haircut Gordon Hayward. For those curious, tier 1 is Wizards Oubre, shirtless (and sometimes pantsless) Serge Ibaka, Jeremy Lin wearing a Harvard hoodie (according to my wife), and for the real freaks, white hijab Kobe in that LA times photoshoot"
I model my game and my diet on fat Kevin Love
Fat Kevin Love put up some crazy numbers in that era
"As a Philly native and Sixers fan I’m always gonna say AI. Luckily for me I was just graduating high school when AI was drafted and got to watch a ton of him over the years. I also watched a ton of Kyrie, including the championship ring, when I lived Cleveland 2011-2018. Kyrie is a nice player for sure - with insane ball skills and moments of pure greatness. Iverson was just on a different level. His competitiveness, his heart, his speed, his originality, his off the ball defense. He carried that team to the finals and never had a supporting cast member who was even as good as Kevin Love. He was just something to behold. Almost every night he did something that made you jump out of your seat. If I could watch anybody play ball again it would have to be AI. No disrespect to Kyrie, but I’m not sure where these comparisons even come from. It’s not even close."
"Right, but there's always Dellavedova, Smith, and Jones. Also, Kevin Love is on the team."
It's a popular gym players use when they're in NYC. I've seen Kevin love and Duncan Robinson use it too
Kevin Love syndrome
"The quality of college looks like rec league compared to most euro leagues these days. However College basketball does a couple things better.   One is that the game is faster while the NBA is creeping up to 3 hr range.   college basketball does the final 2 min a lot better than the NBA. I think the inbound at half court rule after TOs in the NBA is one of the dumbest rules in sports. Don't you want to see Giannis, Lebron, Steph take the ball the length of the court w/ a few sec left? Or see Kevin Love throw a 70 ft dime?"
Kevin Love was the only guy who averaged more than 10 points in the pacers series.  Kevin Love averaged 11 points.  The pacers had 6 guys averaging 10+ points.
"Then we would've run with Eric Bledsoe, Paul George, LeBron James, Kevin Love and TT."
"Your logic is just simply amazing my guy  KEVIN LOVE ALL STAR YAY, JR SMITH posts percentage, old ass Kyle Korver, fucking Rodney Hood  You just proved why it was such a big deal, go look at the stats of those players in the playoffs"
"why do they have to be starter quality? not all of those players even started and you're expecting starter quality from all of them? what? make it make sense  they obviously underperformed, but when they traded for them they were already formidable players  you said ""*now* they're high quality role players""  a player overperforming or underperforming for half a season isn't reflective of what value they have in the league  they were ALWAYS very solid role players, they (namely clarkson and hood) just shat the bed that year  you see the same shit with people evaluating the heatles after the fact, and saying the 2014 heat weren't a superteam because wade was past his prime like that's supposed to mean something  or shitting on kevin love to big up bron like he wasn't the best PF in the league when they first got him"
&gt; Kevin Love - Rotation Player  We may have found a glitch in the matrix.
One that hasn't been mentioned yet - In 2014 a bunch of reports about a potential Klay Thompson for Kevin Love trade came out. Would most likely prevent the Warriors era + change the look of Lebron's second stint with the Cavs.
"kevin love gets himself kicked off the Cavs and it'll be RJ, Frye, Love, and maybe Arenas trolling"
"They sold high on Wiggins and wound up with Kevin Love so all in all it was a pretty successful run. You wind up with a young star, a great trade piece and a solid defense/rebounding guy who was huge in their 2016 title run.  Bennet was absolutely an all time terrible pick that was questioned immediately by many analysts."
As good as Kevin Love is we just don’t have the supporting cast to secure the 13th seed with him on the bench.
"And only Kyrie was the great selection.  Drafted Bennett way way early (Cody Zeller is much better and is still in the league)  Wiggins was overhyped and thankfully they packaged him for Kevin Love.  If LeBron didn't comeback, it would be funny to see Kyrie dragging one of the worst defensive teams in the league to wins with young Wiggins, Dion, Tristan and Bennett."
You don’t remember Wiggins because he never played for the Cavs. He was traded to Minnesota for Kevin Love.  Obviously Bennett wasn’t a good pick.  Kyrie was obviously a good pick.  Tristan Thompson while maybe not what you hope from a #4 overall was a contributor for a championship team.
Because Kristaps is an overpaid poor man's Kevin Love and we don't have a Kyrie.
John Wall and Kevin Love
"Don't lie, it's cuz our MVP Kevin Love is gonna get injured again."
"If we play in modern rules, I would love to see Kevin Garnett at C"
"Hear me out.   The Warriors were down two All-Star when they lost to the Raptors: KD and Klay.   I'll concede to that (and I'm a Raptors fan).   That was a difference maker. I'd like to think the Toronto Barnies would have made it to seven games and had a shot, but the reality is they would have been lucky to get to game six against that team, assuming they are healthy.   That said, the Warriors were not down two All-Star when they lost to the Cavs.   They missed Draymond for one game, and the Cavs missed Love for one game. That's a wash.   The Warriors also missed Bogut for two games, but he was only posting 12 minutes a game and adding 3 points and 3 boards a game, and while his two blocks were impressive in that short space of time, he wasn't having a huge impact for the team that season (he was only about 5/5 in the series before that, and that season.  So missing Draymond for one game when Love also missed a game and also missing a guy averaging 12 mpg is NOT comparable to missing Kevin Love for 7 games and Kyrie for 6 games.   Now, unless there were two other All-Stars missing that series, I'm pretty sure my not mentioning that is quite reasonable since the disparity between the two does not warrant a comparison."
"In 07, he carried the cavs to the finals with Mo Williams as the number 2 guy and got swept by a dominant Spurs team with a prime Tim Duncan. In 11, he played poorly and lost with a super team. In 12 and 13, he won with that super team but he also beat super teams to get there (Celtics). In 14, he lost to another dominant Spurs team and the Heat were clearly no longer a super team (neither Wade nor Bosh even averaged 20 that season and Wade was wearing down due to injuries. In 15, he lost to the warriors who won 67 games in the regular season without Kevin Love even playing (lebron averaged 36, 13, and 9 in that series). In 16, he beat the best regular season team of all time. In 17 and 18, he lost to the greatest super team of all time. And in 20, he won without a super team (I don’t want to see anybody bending the rules of what counts as a super team when there were only 2 stars on the team)."
"Not a player, but the cavaliers FO as a whole. At some points i dont even know if they’re trying to tank or be competitive. Their worst moments were definitely the 2000s. Gave up young prospects for old washed up veterans for 7 years and got pissed when Lebron left. Were also so incompetent that they decided to just trade kyrie without even trying to work things out, then decided that an injured IT would be a good enough partner to run the season and didnt chase any other stars.   Literally the only good moves they made that i can remember from the top of my head this past decade was: (1) trade wiggins for kevin love, and (2) not sign collin sexton for the max. Everythings else was just bad or inconsequential."
"funny how a lot of people here are like ""oh yeah easy to be happy hes rich"" and conviently forget all the mental health awareness from guys like kevin love. just having money doesnt make people happy. sure it removes stress from things like paying bills, but there is a fundamental difference in how people approach everything in life if actually, truly happy. the perspective on life is completely different."
"That's just pure horseshit, Kevin Love is not better than Tim Duncan or Kevin Garnett."
"Modern NBA players are better than older players but Austin Rivers compared to Bob Cousy also benefits from a half a century in developments in the way we train and teach basketball players.  &gt; ""Kevin Love is better than 99% of the power forwards on that list (referring to top 75 list)""  Bull fucking shit lmao"
Kevin Love was not an all star in 2015. And LeBron is considered by many to be the goat so no it was not an easy ring.
"&gt; Heat did not win it so why include them ?  Because they were literally in the finals? And they would've won if 3 rotation players didn't go down in Game 1? Jimmy does not play that gassed in game 6 with a healthier usage rate throughout that series.   &gt; You don't mention Kawhi for the Raps who has the main reason Toronto won.  Because I literally said you probably won't win one without making at least one or two trades. Use your head, obviously this includes Kawhi.  &gt; Jrue played a serious part in Bucks winning.  Sick, dude. You know who played big if not bigger parts? The guys the same franchise drafted in 2012 and 2013  &gt; Spurs and GSW are more like exceptions rather than the norm.  That's a convenient excuse.  &gt; Also with player movement today saying that a given team is ""bought"" does not make a lot of sense to me.  I'm not making a value judgment about it at all, good for them.  &gt; Also what Lebron has to do with any of this  We're talking about teams that massively uprooted their roster to win a title. We're looking at the rosters of each recent finals team. We're noticing that not many key Cavs or 2020 Lakers players were franchise mainstays.   &gt; and how are his only ""bought ones""  Because they are????  JR Smith was not drafted there or around long before the run.  Same with Kevin Love. Same with Richard Jefferson. Same with Iman Shumpert. That team was a contender because LeBron came back, not because he stayed. Remember that Heat run?  Tristan and Kyrie were the only ones that were actually there for some time. Look at the 2020 Lakers, it's even more egregious.  I get it's a nerve reaction since you're a Cavs fan, but I shouldn't have to walk you through the construction of your own team."
Kevin Love is 60m in deadweight.
"John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love and at a stretch Kristaps Porzingis are some of the worst contracts today."
John wall is for sure the worst. As for your list jimmy butler should not be on there and Kevin love should at least be ahead of hayward.
"It was just a single game, he doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence as those two. Imagine calling Corey Brewer or Mo Williams 50-point scorers because they did that once.   Is Kevin Love also a superstar and all-time player just because he had one 30-30 game just like Wilt did (expect Wilt did it 128 times)?"
"Kevin Love is still on the roster and getting big minutes.  Don't get me wrong, he had the most important defensive stop in Cavs history, but he is not a good defender.  Has been playing with some nice passion this season though."
"When Kevin love started opening up about depression, it took a huge weight off his back….  Now he can stand upright and he’s apparently 7’0"
I love how Kevin Love just chest bumped his bench mate in celebration
Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio have really come full circle
Russ for Kevin love trade who says no?
"I love Mobley. Also, Kevin Love looks to enjoy playing basketball again."
"Kevin Love is like 6'8"""
Dont get too high dont get too low. Remember with our best player its going to be rough.  On top of that our match up  vs teams with quality bigs is our worse match up. DeAndre defeated us. Jjj and steven adams hurt us. Today we had kevin love evan mobley and Jarrett allen stop us. They stopped jokic. Then shifty small guards is another weakness for us so sexland is an issue. Cavs are pretty much our kryptonite for sure. I hope we can get to 500 by all star break though.
Can we interest you in a slightly used Kevin Love? We already let you take Hartenstein
High flying Kevin Love making an appearance
That Rubio pickup was huge not just in a silo but also because he knows how to get Kevin Love to care about basketball again
"Ant is literally the player the Timberwolves have been looking for their entire franchise history. Team has had good big men- KG, Kevin Love, KAT- but never that star perimeter player you sort of need to truly compete for championships in today's NBA.  Thought we had him finally when we got Jimmy Butler (oops). Thought Andrew Wiggins could turn into that player (ouch). Now it looks like we *finally* got a real one."
"#An open letter to LeBron James  Hello,  As a kid from Earth, your teams were my “default” team. After the mid-2000s, through the Mo Williams years, your fans held on. Then, you, the hardworking, driven, focused, determined LEADER, came to Miami.  With a keen eye for talent, you built a TEAM focused on hard work and success. If your “Just a Kid From Akron” phrase had a managerial equivalent.. it’d be personified by you.   You brought us 4 rings. You brought us DeRozan. You yelled “Fuck Dallas”, and took us to the playoffs 9 of the past 11 years. You managed to go back to Cleveland, in a deal that made me sad (lol) at the time. Had I known it’d be a deal that’d lead us to another championship I think I’d have moved on much quicker.  It’s like the saying goes, “Trust in LeBron”.  You brought us Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, AD... AD! The list goes on! Kevin Love!   You collaborated with Drake.   This off season we lost a LeBron legend in Caruso. But we managed to keep you. HUGE DEAL! You’ve built a culture of winning rings. The parade on the planet in 2012 &amp; 2013 &amp; 2016 &amp; 2020 brings to life the excitement you’ve created. Happiness, joy, a player to root for.  As a kid I cheered for you by default. As an adult I cheer for you by choice. I’m a proud LeBron fan. You’ve given us a player to be proud of.  Front office, back office, front court, backcourt.. you’ve built something truly special.   When we won, the pandemic spoiled your moment. When your trades came through, Twitter trolls tragically disrespected your value. Still, you’re here.  I’m grateful that you’ve given so many people on this planet so many positive memories. I hope you’re being appreciated the way you deserve to be. For a man to be as accomplished as you and remain as humble as you are.. it’s legendary.  So, to the King of Akron Thank you,  Earth"
Missed Kevin love on your list. He's got the best case out of everyone named.
"Timberwolves traded Ray Allen for Marbury  Traded Brandon Roy for Foye  Traded KG for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, and Telfair  Traded prime Kevin Love (26-13 averages) for Wiggins and Bennett. (Yes at the time this one was kinda fair because of Wiggins hype, but in retrospect it ain’t good).  Traded Michael Beasley coming off his two best seasons for cash  Traded prime Jimmy butler for what eventually turned into Malik Beasley and Beverley"
"Larry Bird is the most obvious. Dirk is another one. Kevin Love was really good for a while. Kukoc, McHale, maybe even Porzingis."
Poor Kevin Love doesn't even get a shout-out in meme threads.
The Warriors should've traded Klay Thompson for Kevin Love. I'm very thankful they didn't!
I really wanted the Kevin Love for Klay trade to go through in like 2012
10/10 commentary.  I love Kevin Harlan
"Then trade AD for Kevin Love, then give Harden to the Lakers for Kevin Love."
"I appreciate you actually providing a response. I love when people take the time to craft a message instead of drop a hostile remark and end it at that.  ——  I don’t mean to act like there’s a huge gap between the two. To me, Kobe is a Top 10 player, and KG is like a Top 18-ish player, at worst.   Now to address your stats. It looks like Kobe has the edge in things like career PER/TS%, whereas Garnett has the edge in VORP/WS and the like.  A lot of what you brought up are outdated box score-derived metrics, and those don’t personally mean too much to me. David Robinson is 2nd all-time in WS/48. AD is top 3 in PER. These things are nice to look at, but aren’t the be-all, end-all for me.   ——   Here’s how I see it: Kobe was a generational offensive talent and a great defensive guard (albeit overrated by Lakers fans), whereas Garnett was a generation defensive talent and a good offensive player.  I personally think the gap in offense makes up for the gap in defense - and as someone who values offense slightly over defense, I side with Kobe.  In the 2000s, Kobe Bryant had the highest PPG average. If you look at the guys with the 5 highest PPG in the 2000s, Kobe also has the highest TS% out of all of them. He was the best scorer of his decade.   Kobe has 8 seasons alone where he averaged over +3% rTS or more. In all of those 8 seasons, he averaged 20 PPG or more. Garnett has only 4 seasons where he averaged above +3% rTS or more and averaged more than 20 PPG.  Kobe averaged 24 or more PPG for 13 seasons straight. Garnett’s peak PPG in a season was 24 PPG, and he never matched that scoring output again.  Kobe has a 3-year-stretch in the NBA where he averaged 31.7 PPG on +3.2 rTS. KG has never come anywhere near that.  Kobe was a substantially higher-volume scorer and managed to do it on slightly higher efficiency. Kobe was in a different stratosphere from a scoring aspect.  Also, Kobe was a much better playmaker. Kobe, despite playing in the Triangle, which suppresses individual player assists, averaged slightly more APG. But playmaking is more than how many assists you rack up.  Kobe had a slightly higher peak passer rating than KG (7.3 to 7.1), but a much higher peak Box Creation score (10.4 to 6.1). Box Creation measures the amount of open looks you get teammates per 100 possessions. And this is why Kobe is a substantially better playmaker than Garnett: gravity.  Kobe was a marginally more skilled passer than Garnett, because Garnett was a fantastic passer. But evident in their peak Box Creation scores (and other metrics, which well get to), Bryant generated way more open looks than KG ever did. And anyone who watched their careers play out could tell this by watching the games.  Bryant demanded so much defensive attention that it generated an unprecedented amount of open looks for his teammates (the Kobe assist isnt just a meme!). KG never had that effect because he wasn’t an elite scoring threat.  Below are On/Off TS% values for many of Kobe's long-term teammates over the years which illustrate how much of a monumental impact he had on his teammates ability to get easier points:  Robert Horry (01-03): 43.7% to 52.0% (+8.3)  Rick Fox (01-04): 45.7% to 53.7% (+8.0)  Lamar Odom (05-11): 53.8% to 56.6% (+2.8)  Andrew Bynum (06-12): 57.2% to 61.2 (+4.0)  Pau Gasol (08-13): 55.3% to 58.7% (+3.4)  Ron Artest (10-13): 46.2% to 54.8% (+8.6)  ——  Also, I’m glad you brought up some advanced metrics, because impact metrics also prove Kobe was in a completely different world offensively than Garnett.   From 2002-2011, Kobe Bryant led the league in 10-year ORAPM with a score of 6.6. Kevin Garnett logged an ORAPM score of 3 in this time frame.  At his peak, Kobe Bryant had a +20.6 impact on ORTG when on the floor. That is higher than 2006 Steve Nash and 2006 Dirk Nowitzki’s ORTG impact **combined**. For reference, KG’s highest impact on ORTG in a season was +15.8. Also, Kobe had multiple years even in his late prime where he was having a +10 more impact on ORTG, whereas KG only had that sort of impact on Offense at his peak.  ——  Another reason why I have Kobe over Garnett is because he was a notably better playoff performer. From 2008-2010 in the playoffs, he averaged 29.8 PPG, 5.7 RPG, and 5.5 APG on +3.9% rTS (for reference, Jordan averaged 31.4/6.1/4.0 on +2.4 rTS% from 96-98, if you were wondering how impressive of a 3-year-PS-peak this is).   Kobe has a career PPG average of 25.0 and career rTS of 1.9%. His playoff career PPG average went up to 25.6 and his playoff career defense-adjusted rTS% was 2.5% (higher than Larry Bird’s BTW). KG averaged 17.8 PPG for his career on 1.8% rTS. In the playoffs, his output went up to 18.2 PPG but his defense-adjusted efficiency fell all the way down to **0.6%.**  Whereas KG regressed to nearly average efficiency in the postseason, Kobe upped his.  ——  Kevin Garnett was in a different world than Kobe when it came to defensive impact, but Kobe was in a different world when it came to offensive impact. And I think the gap in offense impact paired with Kobe’s superior longevity (which is evident in 11 All-NBA 1st team selections to Garnett’s 4) and playoff numbers/efficiency (discussed above) more than make up for that.  It’s just an opinion though. Everyone is entitled to their own."
"On-Off is worthless stats. For example in 2017-18, Lebron had a +1.9(lowest of his career) because that year the Cavs 2nd best player was Kevin Love and their defense was ranked 29th but still 5th on offense. That Cavs team was still the best team in the east tho and Lebron was carrying them all season long. Thats basically what is happening to Luka right now, he carrying a mediocre team with bad defense but good offense(1st and 10th ranked in the last 2 seasons) because the offense is basically just Luka same with 2017-18 Lebron."
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
"Kyrie’s shot in the 2016 Finals is the most overrated clutch moment in sports history. There was nearly a full minute left in that game. The Cavs won by 4. They would have won even if he’d missed it. The block, and Kevin Love locking up Steph on D was way more clutch."
Ok Always injured Kevin Love will put someone through the table and then dislocate his own ankle
2-1. Kevin Love didn’t play in that first Finals.
Kevin Love and
"Went to elementary school with Klay, and high school with Kevin.   It was crazy because we all just knew Kevin Love would be in the NBA. So much so that he definitely didn’t need to attend the same classes I did. He was in the gym with Chris Dudley for the majority of the day. Oh well, happy for him."
"Sabonis isn’t a traditional C and he definitely wasn’t seen as one around 7 years ago when he was drafted.  Remember, Kevin Love was universally viewed as a PF up until like 2016."
"&gt;Lebron is a really bad leader (not player) and he gives up on his team in certain circumstances eg. when they are down  I agree, especially with the certain circumstances. He didn't give up in his first stint with the Cavs, he just couldn't get past the Celtics. The only time I feel that he did was in 2018. After that Game 1 Finals, I don't think he really wanted to try do what he did in that game 1 again.  &gt;Has bad body language and his passive aggressiveness makes a lot of his teammates uncomfortable when things dont go his way  I can agree.  &gt;He likes to sound cool and stuff but when things actually happen he doesnt stick to what he says eg. when he said when you are down, stay down your teammates will pick you up but doesnt do it when it happens  I can agree.  I mean he did give Kevin Love depression, right? ^^^^^^/s"
Devin Booker is the guard version of Kevin Love(in his prime).  Very good player. But third option on a contender at his absolute best.
"Yeah but in 2015, the Cavaliers starting lineup was literally Lebron, then two New York Knick players who were the worst team in the league, then a point guard and center who went undrafted aka no team wanted them. They still took two games from Golden State so I wonder what the series would’ve been with Kyrie and Kevin Love."
3-1 also is Klay's record against Kevin Love in the Finals. I'm imagining that banter between Mychal Thompson and Kevin's dad. Even better to imagine them as Randy Marsh in a little league game.
"What’s great about Mobley though is he doesn’t have to touch the ball to have a positive impact on the game. When there is a pick and he gets switched on a guard he’s able to keep up with them and impact the angle of their shots cuz of his crazy length. And he’s smart and not fouling in those situations either. I was at the game Thursday and the way he forced players into poor shots, I’m seeing the Bosh/KG defense potential. I said in 3 years, but it might be sooner than that  https://mobile.twitter.com/Tony_Pesta/status/1451993477957423109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1451993477957423109%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftherookiewire.usatoday.com%2F2021%2F10%2F24%2Fcavaliers-kevin-love-evan-mobley-all-defensive-player%2F  https://youtu.be/dYleoS29RkY  https://youtu.be/UAqjhwzqqkg"
"little did Klay know, blowing a 3-1 lead to Kevin Love would become the biggest blemish of his career"
"Was waiting this, what he did to Kevin Love was awful. Plus he’s a flopper to this day."
Kevin Love had a 34 point quarter but he's definitely not going on the list. Is 35 point quarter the cutoff point?
Even with Kevin Garnett the Timberwolves only made it past the first round and with Kevin Love they never even sniffed the playoffs. Minnesota teams since KG left haven't been properly built teams
"Remember when Kevin Love broke two bones in his hand doing ""knuckle pushups""?   Anyways, I am sure he is good at fighting and judging who would be good at fighting..."
Kevin Love isn't an MVP caliber player.
Kevin love is mentally weak?
"The cavs are looking solid. Mobley playing great defense, Rubio's presence has positively effected the entire team, sexland is back and looking good, and despite not loving the trade at first, I'm liking Lauri on the cavs.  And let's not forget KEVIN LOVE WHAT A GAME OFF THE BENCH. Looks like he's found some passion in basketball again, it looks like he cares out there again. I'll give Rubio credit for that cause somehow I know he's got something to do with it.  Forgot to mention Allen. My favorite pick up we've acquired through a trade in a long time, and he's showing his worth."
Kevin Love is an awful teammate

Washed up means he plays like Eric Bledsoe or Kevin Love.  He's still getting triple doubles. Something most players NEVER do.  I get that he isn't as good as he was. But he isn't washed up.
"You are right, Kevin Love made 4-straight appearances in final"
People were trying to convince me this guy was as athletic as current Kevin Love this offseason...
Kevin Love just gave Rubio depression smh
"[https://twitter.com/AmNotEvan/status/1452846136713256966](https://twitter.com/AmNotEvan/status/1452846136713256966)  Kevin Love joked that if Rubio and Campazzo were going to scrap, it would've been a royal rumble.      ""I saw Jeff Green about to check-in and I was going to put him through the scoring table."""
"&gt;I faced Kevin Love here when I was pitching and he was batting. I beaned him right in the back, knew he was going to be a Cav.  Can't wait to see this dude back on the court. I also hope he does guest commentator at least once more before he returns."
looks like the goon squad gave Kevin Love his hops back
"Kevin Love, engaged like this, is one of the better bench guys in the league, but still a massive over-pay.  The other very encouraging sign is that the last 2 wins - the Cavs don't need, and don't just stand around - waiting for Sexy to score, other guys are looking for shots and the ball is moving."
"I hope he turns it around. The Kevin Love hate train just made me sad. More K-Love touchdown passes, please."
Was Kevin love trying to pull a Blake griffin? I didn't think he could be a productive player on an NBA team anymore.  Great game out of the Cavs.
Kevin Love: 22 points off the Bench  Entire Nuggets Bench: 24 points
Kevin love just dropped his old man dick on the nuggets forehead. Also Jarrett Allen with a casual 21 and 16
"He’s no Kevin Love or Lauri Markanen, but he’s alright."
nods in Kevin Love
###KEVIN LOVE IS STILL ALIVE EVERYBODY
It's kind of cool seeing a vintage Kevin Love performance out there.  He's playing like guy who has something to prove after the Olympics stuff.
Kevin love has been great tonight. Great to see that he can still be a factor in the league.
Could Kevin Love win 6MOTY? That would be so strange I wanna see it happen
The Kevin love thing probably
Kevin love esk
This game is hammered. 2021 Kevin Love faceups vs Aaron Gordon off the dribble
Kevin Love esque defense by Vooch
"Kevin Love and Ben brought this up in massively different ways. There was no incentive for Love to share, yet he did. This has only become Ben’s story once other options didn’t work. It’s as obvious as scummy as it gets."
LOL yet he's in a great headspace to demand a trade right? Like I said before these are individuals are conveniently using mental Illness like Ben anr PG13. It's actually harming people who are for the cause like DeMar and Kevin Love.
"This Giannis bit cannot be overstated. Speaking as a Bulls fan, I’ve appreciated Masai’s ability to think carefully about the future and never settle. He saw DeRozan &amp; Lowry weren’t enough and gambled on the Kawhi rental for one. Likewise, he accepted the risk of losing out on Giannis FA and left himself flexibility to rebuild.   His foresight is excellent. Compare that to the Cavs, who signed Kevin Love to a 5-yr Max despite LeBron’s departure. That asset has been positively toxic for the team.   It’s not a given that a GM will avoid reactive moves. That’s why Masai is top tier."
"Believe it until proven otherwise. Let the professionals handle it.  I have been dealing with these issues all my life. Every time people tell me I'm faking, I tell myself I really wish I was - because it's better than being handicapped this way.  Trust me when I say that only a small amount of people can fake it in front of a psychologist/psychiatrist.  They can see through your lies pretty well unless you have meticulously planned it like a sociopath.  Time will tell. For now just accept it for what it is.  If you supported Kevin Love before, then it's fair to give Ben some support.  Else, keep certain things to yourself. You know what happened, why and how it did, leading to this.   But no use rubbing it in now."
"Melo was better in every way. His consistency and longevity was a huge key. Paul George is amazing DONT get me wrong. But Melo was heavily snubbed from a bunch of all nba back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. (2006,2009,2011, 2014) these four all nba selection should have been given to him. 2014 and 2009 one should had been automatic but for whatever reason boozer got it over him in 2009 and Kevin love in 2014.  Also don’t forget the forward selection from the 2000s was heavily dominated by Garnett dirk duncan lebron. There was no way PG would get first place over them. Melos 2013 all nba selection was also the hardest to get first place. Durant managed to edge Melo out with 50/40/90 and Lebron was just at his absolute best. Had the knicks management with Phil Jackson been competent the Knicks would had been a consistent playoff team. No reason to blow up a team that was second seed in 2013."
Kevin love
So far I just don’t see it. I see another washed Kevin Love except he’s way younger.
"I have to say, I have been really UNIMPRESSED with Markkanen so far. I know it's early but to me he's the younger version of the older version of Kevin Love; slow, soft, iffy shooting, and a defensive liability.   Bulls fans out there, am I being too hard on this dude?"
"Just to highlight how long ago 5 years is, 5 years ago, the following players played in the All Star Game: Isaiah Thomas, John Wall, Kevin Love, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan.  Those guys have had varying degrees of success since then, and contribute to winning, but when was the last time anyone thought of any of those guys as stars?"
Lmao AD was on the Pelicans most of his career . Do you know how ass that franchise is ? Only Lebron has pulled some shit like lead a nobody team to the conference finals and nobody ever said ad was at Lebrons level … ever .   Kylie Irving never had any individual success without Lebron you can add that to Kevin Love .  All I’m saying is Lebron doesn’t win that chip without AD. AD wasn’t carried to any title he was a costar . Peace
"Even Dame has a few 3 seeds, WCF appearances.  When has AD ever led a team to anything.  C’mon now.   No one has ever looked at an AD led team and thought because of him this team will do damage, until he teamed up with the best player of this generation, and Bron was still the reason  Even everyone Bron has teamed up with, they’ve all had major success without each other (other than Kevin Love, I put him the same boat but AD is much better than him)"
Is that why Kevin Love is always injured.
and one Kevin Love
Like Kelly Olynk and Kevin Love… that was straight garbage
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
"Yeah it’s like comparing shit to diarrhea but at least Ben has grounds to be upset after getting thrown under the bus and isn’t supporting something that actually hurts people. Guys like Kevin Love has/is giving up on his team and they haven’t thrown him under the bus. Meanwhile, Kyrie is giving credence to a conspiracy that has real world effect outside of basketball."
"The Cavs had the good fortune of having the best player in the game being born in Ohio, and actually wanting to play for them. They also had the good fortune of landing the number 1 pick two years in a row and being able to trade for Kevin Love. Once LeBron left, though? Lottery team."
I did love Mike and Mike but it’s obvious Kevin and Lamarr are a step up.
"It’s not the Sixers point of view that a player should play in exchange for his salary. That’s just how sports contracts work. Christ, Harden showed up fat and jogged around until Houston found a trade partner. Simmons can do the same, but the Sixers don’t HAVE to trade him. He’s under contract! Now that signing longterm deals and refusing to play under them is becoming a thing, the league is going to have to do something about it.   It would also be wrong for the Cavs to tell Kevin Love, “sorry, you suck. We’re not paying you the last two years of your deal.” They’d never get away with it. The definition of contracts is they are legally binding!"
its not about comparison but role. if you actually witnessed the big 3 miami. Kevin love and AD were both regulated to a Chris bosh role. AD on the other hand has to do what Chris bosh does and score though. I'm not suprised why he gets injured so much. he's doing too much.
AD is basically playing Chris bosh and himself. Kevin love was trying to be Chris bosh when his skill sets far from that.
"I don't think Minnesota failed Kevin Love. He had the most productive years of his career there, then they traded him to a place he could win a ring"
"Because Kevin Love didn't say it immediately after refusing to show up for a month, then showing up to get paid but refusing to play, then saying he couldn't play because he had back issues but abandoning that approach after doctors examined him.  Simmons would have been well served to give at least some time in between each reason for not playing.  With the way he changed the reason so often it makes it look like he's just trying every approach possible to get paid but not play."
"Different roles bro.  Russ was always in a starter’s role.  Rose was injured that year, and has shown the last few yrs that he still has the ability to be an effective floor general and has the humility to come off the bench for the best of the team.    Lakers would actually be way better off with Rose right now.    Love scored 2 points less than AD but I guarantee it was on less shots.   AD is a featured part of the Lakers offense when they play, vs Kevin basically having to get his from role player like shots and opportunities.   And for the record, i did not say K love was better, said AD was playing kevin love esque, which as you can see from their proximity in stats is not far off  You think that star players = automatically better when basketball is really about roles and player circumstance.   Russ has much better averages, but in a playoff situation, give me Rose who actually knows how to win."
"Kevin Love got His accolades, he’s keeping his money."
Great start to a new season. The Suns bench is one of the best ones in the league and are playing well together. Javale and Shamet have been great additions with Mcgee a much-needed backup big. It's a shame that they botched their last 10th pick. They could have at least traded it for a complimentary PF. Could see Kevin Love joining the team post-trade deadline if he gets bought out.
"I was 10 years old when I fell in love with the Sacramento Kings. I loved Peja, my boy Bibby, smooth shooting Brad Miller and a young up-and-coming stud in Kevin Martin  I remember the joy of running around my house seeing Kevin Martin's GW vs. the Spurs in 2006, thinking we were on our way to upsetting the no.1 seed, only to fight back tears a few games later. But nonetheless, proud of how my team fought to push that series to six games, nearly stealing game 5 after we got the snot kicked out of us in game 1.  We'll be back soon... I thought to myself. These guys won't let me down for long...  Lol. It's been a long 15 years. I'm tired of this BS"
Don’t disrespect Kevin Love 2016 finals lol
"still got nothing on ""Did Lebron give Kevin Love depression?"""
"Yes, but... Kevin Love used to cook him. When you are cooked by KLove year in year out, your reputation takes a hit."
kevin love is good
"I loved that sequence in the Christmas game, Kevin Durant tried to stare down Love and then he ignored him to make that crazy pass lol"
"Kevin Love is bad at this point lol. Wall would look better if he was given minutes, and Wall isn't exactly good either."
go watch some UCLA highlights  Kevin Love was insane
"they just need to relocate at this point. they've been doing shit like this ever since lebron was drafted. they let boozer walk away for nothing while being a rfa. they signed larry hughes over ray allen or michael redd. didn't want to trade jj hickson for prime amare stoudemire or iguodala. didn't want to trade kevin love for paul george in 2018 or they could have traded kyrie for middleton and bledsoe instead of getting isaiah thomas and  a bunch of make a wish kids. not to mention drafting luke jackson infront of josh smith and kevin martin. drafted dajaun wagner over amare stoudemire and caron butler. also drafting dasagna diop over joe johnson, zach randolph, richard jefferson and gilbert arenas. traded jamal crawford for chis mihm. drafting anthony bennett. the whole franchise is a joke"
Kevin Wesley Love learned the art of the full court pass from his godfather and Dad's former teammate Wes Unseld.
"Holy shit, you must be either stupid or malicious to watch that game and think that Luka was trying to stat pad. No one in our starting lineup can shoot, dribble, or make plays other than Luka.   Should we have let Dellavadova and Mozgov get more chances at running plays during the 2015 NBA Finals so that they could get themselves going? Should we have just forced Lebron to dump the ball to Kevin Love in the 2017 Finals over and over until he got himself going? Should we have said fuck it, let Joe Harris and a hobbled Harden take turns initiating the offense last playoffs?"
It’s a good pairing.  It’s so much fun to have an identity and a culture with everyone on board.  Even Kevin Love seems with it.
A two handed chest pass from Kevin Love could breach the walls of Ba Sing Se.
"Kevin Love after tonight's win: ""We got a fucking squad now."""
"idk why other teams miss shots. KP 4/12 for 9 points?  Lauri, Jarret, Evan and even Kevin Love all have better pts/rebs tonight  Just be 7ft tall and put the ball in the hoop"
Is Kevin Love the best full court outlet passer in the game's history? He's probably top 10 and has so many of them.
Silver Fox Kevin Love
I swear if kevin love sticks around in the league for another 3 years he'll have a full head of gray hair
How has Kevin Love been this season? Decent role player?
Dude gave up almost 20 million to get out of OKC for this...When people still wonder why Kevin Love is still in Cleveland its because of this  type of scenario when it comes to faded stars that leave money on the table to be on completive teams
Kevin Love might have something to say about that
Kevin Love is still in the rotation  John wall would be in the rotation if he accepted a backup role
8 mil is nothing…look at John wall or Kevin love
Did LeBron Give Kevin Love ~~Depression~~ Two Little Bite Marks On His Neck?
Lmao Kevin love 😘
I think it’s that no one talks about the Kevin Love game.
"No, it will happen someday. I’m not saying I expect to see it happen in the next 5 or even 10 years, but it’s totally possible at some point.   Klay didn’t even score until over 2 min into the quarter. Kevin Love who isn’t even an ultra elite scorer had 34 in a quarter as well."
"Curry isn’t always efficient in every series. He underperformed severely in 15-16 and got locked down by Kevin Love. Kyrie outplayed Curry that series. Curry also avgd 22 against the Rockets in 19, with Durant being the best player for the Warriors, Harden avgd 35 and was the best player that series. It’s up on who is hot or not. If Kyrie and LeBron are hot GG. If Curry and Thompson light up then GG. Doesn’t matter who’s better team"
because steph missed draymond for 1 fucking game compared to lebron missing kevin love for the whole series and kyrie for the last 5.
"He was also part of a talk/panel thing organised by the NBA a couple years ago with Barack Obama (and Chris Paul and Kevin Love). If conservatives wanted to be mad at him, there’s plenty of ammo."
"Its also probably recognition. I've read a lot of people talk about this, there points being that towns (like everybody from highschool) likes to work on his upper body.  I wish i could paymore attention to towns and had an effective critical eye for him. Wiggins was my main guy cause kevin love was and then ant happened.      I don't think i appreciate towns as much as i should."
I love Kevin Jorter Punior
Kevin love did basically the same. klay gets so overhyped here
It will never be a Lebron like carry when you have James harden as your second player. Lebron had Kevin love in 2018. Let that sink in.
"No. Kevin Love was also there as well. But my argument isn’t about how much credit Kyrie deserves. I do think anywhere from 20-30%.   But my argument is that OP stated people were underrating Kyrie because of his controversies, which isn’t true for a lot of people. My argument is that many people look at what Kyrie did before LeBron (and Love) got to Cleveland. Not much. What he has done off the court actually has no affect on a lot of people’s rankings of him as a *player*."
"Kevin Love was severely anxious and depressed even after he won his first championship.   The pressure, the things going on behind the scenes got to him and we didn’t find out about this until years later.   Meanwhile Simmons has been absolutely shit on by his coach, his teammate, the Sixers fans, and the national media for the past 4+ months but he is faking his current psychiatric problems.   The handling of this situation by Morey just strengthens the players’ view that teams and ownership only view them as objects/assets to be used and discarded at their time of choosing. They aren’t treated as human beings and this has never been more evident than with Simmons and the stupidity surrounding the situation.   The man has been asking out for months, the team is over 20% into the season, Embiid is once again struggling with injury - yet Morey is still holding out.   Only the Sixers players and their fan base will lose because of Morey’s arrogance.   As the months continue to pass Simmons value will continue to drop. No executive has even leaked a trade offer because they know Morey will ask for way more than he is capable of getting in return.   I’ve said this before and I stick by it. Find me one top NBA talent that would willingly sign with the Sixers or any team run by Morey after this public shit show."
"&gt;	According to a report by Windhorst, Ramona Shelburne and Dave McMenamin, the Cavaliers, Pacers and Denver Nuggets discussed a trade that would have sent Love to Denver, George to Cleveland and assets including Gary Harris and the draft's 13th pick to Indiana.  &gt;	The reporters also noted general manager Kevin Pritchard reneged when ""the Cavs were just starting to celebrate.""  &gt;	Pritchard and the Pacers moved on and flipped George to the Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis.  Youre stupid."
Kevin Love
Kevin Love
Finals Kevin Love he ain't.
Weirdest part was he had some good moments but pride and ego hurt a lot of Lebron Teams. Kevin Love is still in therapy... The reality is you better know who's team your on if you play with Bron. He's still and will be the face of the league until he retires..
"I will never stop believing he is incredibly overrated. With him as the Pelicans’ best player they did absolutely nothing as a franchise. Then he got a ring by teaming up with the greatest player of his generation. He’s basically Kevin Love. The best player on a really, really shitty team who puts up big numbers because someone on the team has to score and rebound and only wins when he gets carried like a big ole ugly ass unibrowed backpack by the best player in the world. Nobody can convince me otherwise. He ain’t top 75. Dwight Howard, however, you can’t convince me isn’t."
I'm not joking but I was at a free concert for my college about 10 years ago and two doods were standing in front of me wearing jerseys. One a Rudy Gay jersey and the other a Kevin Love. Together they were Gay Love. I chuckled a little
"wasn't as obvious in Miami, but he definitely was feeding off his teammates in Cleveland the 2nd time around.  Left Kevin Love a depleted husk and Kyrie insane."
Didn't Kevin Love have a 30/30 game?
"As a Minnesota fan, I'd welcome him back with open arms if he wasn't being paid a billion dollars. Throwback to all the Free Kevin Love memes when he was in Minnesota"
Yeah I love Ja but his almost-poster on Kevin Love shouldn’t have been posted on Slam as if he made the dunk
Shout out to Kevin Love for that other 30/30 game
Cant believe that thread got 28.5k upvotes. But then again the LeBron gave Kevin Love thread got nearly 19k upvotes.
Kevin love isn't actually a bad idea..
Cavs fan. I would say Cedi last year but this year since he’s better I guess I’d say kevin love bc of the contract situation and his stubbornness about it but honestly I would say it calmed down a lot and he’s been decent
I hate his contract but I still love him and he’s definitely been playing with more energy this year.  Fully bought in Kevin Love is a valuable player for us even if his contract is still ass
Kevin Love is on that list? Lmao the fuck??
Kevin Love
Wasn’t expecting Kevin Love to be the only other 30 30 lol
kevin love should have been on the list
The only player that we all hate is Kevin Love.  Everyone else is well liked
"I would agree that saying ""I did something only Kevin Love has done since 1982"" is not a great argument.  However, if Howard had retired earlier he would probably have been more likely to be on the list, which doesn't make a ton of sense."
"Kevin Love, Mitch Richmond, Walt Frazier. 5 is stacked"
Wolves fans were about the same when Kevin Love left.
"Embiid up until June 19th (7 days before the draft) when news of his stress fracture broke was the consensus #1 pick and Cleveland was planning on selecting him. Everything changed with the injury.   Wiggs was almost certainly going to go #3 to Philly.   Lebron, embiid, and Kyrie would have made up the cavs big 3 those years if embiid didn’t get hurt - unless bron still demanded a trade for Kevin Love in which we would have had a Timberwolves with KAT, Lavine and Embiid.   Even crazier “what could have been” is the bucks taking Embiid and a Antetokounmpo, Embiid, Middleton.   Not even sure which of Bron/Kyrie/Embiid - Giannis/Middleton/Embiid - KAT/Levine/Embiid I’d prefer. Probably Cleveland’s for the years against the Warriors and the bucks long term heading into the 2020s but a lot of implications from that injury to Jo."
Kemp was not near as good as Kevin Love and it's not close.
He shouldn’t. Very good player but not great. Was anyone ever scared of Kevin Love?
No they didn’t. Plus Kevin love was the one who truly played shit
You know how every year they have players from decades ago? Thats gonna be Kevin Love.
No one’s said Kevin Love yet? T-wolves fans made a whole ass thank you video fake burning his jersey
"I have nothing against Kevin Love but if he makes it in , but Derrick Rose doesn’t I think that’s complete horse shit.  Especially considering how the recent years of their careers have gone.  If Rose incorrectly was the first MVP to not make it, Especially after his comeback to how solid he’s actually been compared to what Love is,  then the line to making it or not making it gotta be better than Kevin"
Demarcus Cousins on the Kings. Kevin Love on the Twolves. Big point and rebound guys.
Richmond is objectively a worse basketball player than Kevin Love.  One extra all star and 3rd teamers in a notoriously weak era for his position does not mean he has better accolades.
what did kevin love do to you
"alright mister technicality. that’s the hill you’re choosing to die on? Yes double fouls are a thing, here’s a link:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2012/11/28/kevin-love-demarcus-cousins-double-foul  Double fouls are to be assessed only when there is a difference in opinion between officials and they can’t come to an agreement. So yeah, you got me, double fouls ARE a thing. So then are you arguing that what SHOULD have happened on this play is that one official should’ve called block, one should’ve called charge, and that they should’ve disagreed on what the right call is to the point of not coming to an agreement, thus calling a double foul and having Ant and Vincent jump it up at mid court? And then the right call would’ve been made? just wanna get this straight here  Edit: and yeah it’s thanksgiving and my family is boring af, I can go all day"
True and Kevin Love as a locker room precense and energy guy
"I guess but he didn’t know it would be that hard when he signed up to play for Cleveland. He had two young All Stars in Kyrie and Kevin Love and an open lane in the East. Out West, Golden State hadn’t even gotten out of R1 yet."
Youth and inexperience.  Only guys in the regular rotation that a true veterans are Kevin Love and Rick.  Ideally a prime 3+D wing would be a great addition to the team. Who I dunno. I'm a big Royce O Neil fan.
"I said this 20 years ago Steelers 19-0, Warriors Wins record + Title, Warriors 16-0 are the only three ways I'll get a tattoo. I mean I was 10 at the time, but I am maybe the best at predicting heartbreak, Steelers dropped game two to the Ravens, but otherwise that's 15-1 in the AFC championship, Kevin Love somehow defends Curry after 73-9, then the Cavs set a record offense for one game to stop the total sweep."
"This isn't unusual, most players would rather be the guy and put up numbers than be a Chris bosh or Kevin Love."
Lauri Markkanen and Kevin Love
LeCoach benches Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving!
"Ooooh there it is! Is that why you hate Kevin Love so much? You hate white people? 😂 Touch grass, loser."
LMAO   Kevin love is still warming the bench.
The one where Kyrie busted one in his eye. Then Kevin love locked him down.   But I’m biased so don’t quote me
"Why tried Kevin Love when they can have heroic voice of the voiceless, Enes Kanter?"
"Sit down and ask yourself honestly, are the Cavs contenders with a team of Jarrett Allen, Kevin Love, Lauri Markkanen, Darius Garland, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Mobley?  Just think about it please.  In no universe are they contenders, just like how the Hawks weren't contenders in 2015."
Do you know how hard it is for professional athletes to admit that? Did you see Giannis' tweets? Did you see Biles at the Olympics? Kevin Love? DeMar Derozan? Have you paid *any* attention to mental health in sports in recent years?
Why would they want DJJ when they could have nba champion and former all-star Kevin Love?
"Shout out to Kevin Love and Ben Simmons, too."
I hope y'all don't play Kevin Love.
"As a die hard cavs fan, I hate Kevin Love so much that I openly root for the team to lose, him to have a fantastic game, so it drags up his trade value, and one day we won’t have that horrific contract and can sign a decent free agent or two"
"Except Love's stats in his first four years with the Cavs were about on par with Bosh in his first four years in Miami. Keep talking out ya ass though. That's what you're good at lol. Even then Bosh wasn't relegated to posting up on the three point line all game long.  Kevin Love fan? No, just not ignorant. That's all. You seem to have a pathetic hate boner for Love though. You constantly say ignorant shit about him lol."
Kevin Love couldn't play the chris bosh role if he had lebron and d wade on the same t-  &amp;#x200B;  NEVERMIND  &amp;#x200B;  imagine a kevin love fan giving anyone a migrane.   &amp;#x200B;  except maybe kevin love.....in the 3rd quarter of a regular season game
"I hate 2k sometimes, just because some of the scenarios will never happen.   In last year's I lost in the ECF, to the Kevin Love lead Cavs. They swept both the Nets and Bucks. I had to uninstall the game after that."
"“He was told to play like Kyle korver”  he’s been alone and able to do whatever he wants the last two years and has had mental breakdowns and walked off court during a game.  He’s being begrudgingly led by 20 year olds who are better than him.  Someone else made him do that?   How come the Cavs are winning games now that Levin Love is finally out of the rotation?   PS typing a mundane wall of emotional text I didn’t read doesn’t benefit you in anyway LMAO   Referencing it like it matters is even more hilarious.  You could reply to this, but why?  Kevin Love still gonna be benchwarming a bottom tier NBA team either way   You’ll never see 16rpg 30-win Kevin Love prime again."
"Whatever you said, Kevin love still stinks.  He averaged 16 rebounds a game and won 38 games  When he played for the Cavs he stood in the corner like a bum is supposed to.  Then he had panic attacks during regular season games.   Now he’s not even trade bait.  All time great rebounder, right there.   Puts up monster rebound numbers in blowout losses   And that’s Ricky Rubio’s fault."
"Defend the honor of Kevin Love? You mean speaking facts? I never insulted you or anything so why are you being so salty?  Idk what you don't understand about basketball being a team game.. There's generally 12 active players on a roster, and you can't make them play better basketball. The thing is, Love was guarded by all the same starting power forwards as every other starting power forward. So put him on another team and give him the same role, and he'd produce the same. Why wouldn't he? He be guarded by the same guys who guarded him on the Wolves. It's funny that you say he's picking up these numbers in garbage time when he played his absolute best when the Wolves were in playoff contention before Rubio went down. Generally the bench plays against the other team's bench too.. No idea where you got this idea that Love was going up against bench players. He dropped big numbers on guys like Aldridge and Griffin, not bench players."
LMAO imagine rushing to defend the honor of Kevin Love.   “It was only 4.5 offensive boards a game”  No mention of it being during 30 win seasons LMAO   He trying real hard to get a rebound down 20 against the other teams 3rd center.  Seems legit.   Drummond dropping 23-20 and losing by 35.  Seems legit.  Great rebounders.
LeBron James gave Kevin Love depression.
Rodman.  Kevin Love is an underrated rebounder. We mention 20-10 guys but Love was a 20-15 guy one season.
"kevin bacon your father was responsible for the og love park, your ass had better be a sixers fan"
"“B-but it’s just for self promotion and image, he’s just trying to make it seem like he’s good”  Lmao why do people do this? Kyrie donates millions to charity and WNBA players and it’s to “build his perception,” yet the same problem never arose with lebron, Kevin love, etc."
"Kevin Love averaged 8.5 points per game that series. It really was LeBron, Kyrie, and 'misfits'"
"I’ll give you that, LeBron had Wade and Bosh in Miami and Irving and Love in Cleveland. Now he has Anthony Davis. And Jordan had Pippen and Rodman, and Kobe had Shaq and later Gasol. You’re not wrong.  But Kevin Durant’s team almost beat the warriors. They had Westbrook. So he leaves a franchise that loves him and that could have won a championship for the easy way out with the team that beat him. That doesn’t make it sound any better.  And separately, Davis is talented but overrated, not a top five player in the league. I’d give him top ten maybe."
"Yeah getting real minutes in the finals from Tristan,JR, Iman, and RJ. Misfits or are you talking about the always injured Kevin Love averaging 8 in the finals?"
"Lol maybe he thought they had the assets to trade for ""whoever he wanted"" but something tells me his idea of a big 3 at the time was not him, Kyrie and Kevin Love. Especially since his previous star teammates were Bosh and Wade.  Solid team but is it even as good as LBJ, AD and whatever rotation player you pick from the Lakers?"
"They had like the 5th best offense in the league before Collins called out Trae a couple weeks ago. It’s odd that Trae got shit when he was leading them to success and yet Collins isn’t getting shit when his actions are clearly motivated by getting a big ol’ contract. Collins is not going to get what he wants if he can’t adapt his game and play some defense. Teams don’t go for the Kevin Love, offense only power forwards anymore. It is especially not useful on this Hawks team."
I found a way to get three more in! Copied from another comment I made:  I actually found a somewhat plausible scenario for us to get in on this.  Raptors and Celtics both could use an upgrade at center so Boston gets first dibs at horford/Drummond and Toronto gets the other and Boston’s exception. OKC takes on whatever bad contracts Boston/Toronto want to unload OR get Kevin love and either way get a pick from Toronto and if we get love a Cavs pick
I actually found a somewhat realistic scenario for us to get in on this.  Raptors and Celtics both could use an upgrade at center so Boston gets first dibs at horford/Drummond and Toronto gets the other and Boston’s exception. OKC takes on whatever bad contracts Boston/Toronto want to unload OR get Kevin love and either way get a pick from Toronto and if we get love a Cavs pick  Edit: maybe plausible is a better word than realistic lol
Screw it seven team trade.  Celtics can get horford back Raptors can get Drummond and Celtics exception.  OKC takes on Kevin love and a second rounder from each team.
"Yeah I don't think Drummond is in their long term plans, they've got Jarrett Allen, Javale Mcgee, Kevin Love, and Larry Nance Jr. They should be starting Jarrett Allen long term given his age - Drummond is superfluous for that team because Jarrett Allen does about everything he does but better for less money."
"Kevin Durant should have known that association with a player as mentally unstable as Irving was dangerous.  Harden's arrival will give him at least a second super star he can count on.  On the other hand, who will accept to sacrifice him in this trio?  Indeed, 3 super stars who love to carry the ball ...  There will always be only one ball on the field. One of them will have to accept to make efforts. Who will be the Chris Bosh of the trio ? And who will be the D.Wade?"
I mean what he said has some truth regardless. Kevin Love was considered a top 3 PF at the time and LeBron bailed when he realized Wade and Bosh would no longer do it for him.
"CLE has got to be looking to move Drummond at this point. Having him and Allen splitting minutes at C doesn’t do anything for development. Why acquire Allen if you are gonna let him walk next year?   Realistically they’d love to move Kevin Love AND Drummond but I think Love is straight up untradeable given his age, injury history, and contract."
Kevin Love
Sorry I meant he made it to the finals with jr smith as the second scoring option I believe Kevin love was injured that year
"Yes, KD wins with the 2012 heat, KD wins with the 2013 heat, KD wins with the 2020 lakers and yes he beats gsw if you swap ibaka and westbrook for kevin love and kyrie"
"For sure, I'll give him that. But he still had the best player in the world next to him plus a solid Kevin Love, and the Warriors hadn't added KD. Harden almost took down the KD Warriors, who demolished everyone else, if not for a historic streak of 27 missed 3's in game 7. And they still only lost by 9."
"Ok? I’ve been over him for like 5 years, why can’t I appreciate 30 ppg fat Kevin love"
So prime Kyrie and Kevin love wasn’t a thing?
Drummond is most likely gone this year. Kevin Love definitely isnt in our future plans. Getting Jarrett Allen to be our future center is a great get by Koby.
"I love how confidently you say a team with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and possibly Kyrie Irving won’t win shit. Their OKC final together was a long time ago, and they are both two of the best offensive talents of all time. Maybe they won’t win anything, but I am not as confident about that as you are"
The 2016 cavs team was playing Richard Jefferson in crucial finals minutes they did not have great depth lol. Hell Kevin Love was nothing in those series so might as well list TT as the third in his big 3.
*cries in Kevin Love*
You mean to tell me Penny Hardaway is worse than Nets Kyrie and Cavs Kevin Love? You can't just cherry pick things that fit your narrative.
"Jrue is just the perfect fit with this Nets team. Imo a third star is almost always redundant, unless said star is able to become an elite role player (Ray Allen, Klay Thompson, Chris Bosh. Counter example is Kevin Love).   Jrue just works wonders for the defense, and in offense his skills don't go to waste.  This is even without mentioning that you will get to keep Allen and/or LeVert if not more."
It would be funny if the Nets were not having Kyrie's antics and traded him back to the Cavs for Kevin Love and some players.
Eh I’m not so sure many Cavs fans these days watch with their eyes on Kevin Love or would go to a game solely to see him anymore. Gilbert got smart when lebron left and decided Love was the piece to build the franchise around for the next half of a decade. It was a dumb move.
"This falls flat for me.  I have a lot of respect for guys like Kevin Love and Demar Derozan.  They acknowledged that they were fighting some demons, they confronted them openly, and they advocate for better mental healthcare for those who face similar battles every day.  That's the mature, courageous, admirable way to handle it.  Kyrie has yet to come forward about any such issue.  He hasn't shown that courage.  To admit that he's vulnerable... that he's struggling... that he's human.  That he's relatable.  Instead, dude does the opposite.  He treats others as if they're beneath him.  He disrespects his teammates, his coaches, and his fans - not to mention the people who pay him $35M to play - by not showing up to work.  He gets caught on camera at a party with no mask, mocking the struggle that has touched almost everybody else in the world at this point.  Maybe he does have some demons.  And if he feels like he needs to talk about them at a future date, I'll listen at that time.  But until then, I'm gonna treat him as if he is exactly what he appears to be - an arrogant, entitled asshole."
Kevin Love never sniffs the playoffs in his career
"Kevin Love was putting up huge numbers before Cleveland, Bosh was great before Miami.  They were still solid when they joined their superteams, but being the 3rd option to 2 superstars kills your numbers it seems.  It’ll be interesting to see how Kyrie handles this."
Kevin Love is the wrong material to build a wall out of
"Why?  And for who?    You do know about salary matching, right?  With the combined cap numbers for Drummond and Love, pretty much the only players they could trade in return would be.... Damian Lillard and like another $5 million player....... or both CJ McCollum and Nurkic AND an additional ~$20 million worth of players.  Seems super likely, to get the services of Kevin Love and Andre Drummond.  /s  There is absolutely no one who is going to take both Drummond and Love off your hands at the same time.  That's a fantasy."
Kyrie about to know what it feels like to be Kevin Love.
Kyrie and Kayne need Kevin love.
The Kevin Love market is whatever is the opposite of a hot stove is. It's a frigid stove. That contract hurts
"Realistically, nobody fucking wants Kevin Love"
"Alternatively, they could keep them both. Kevin Love is their best point guard anyway."
I’d imagine Kyrie BECAUSE Harden is there. Dude left Cleveland because he wanted to be THE guy and now he’s Kevin Love. Might just say ‘screw it’ and focus on “Uncle Drew 2: Rucker Boogaloo”
"Kyrie is clearly the Chris Bosh, Kevin Love guy right"
Drummond is expiring and Kevin Love doesn’t exist
This is one of the worst posts I’ve seen. Like Lebron gave Kevin Love depression level.
Kevin love dump coming up
"Yes and Kevin love who was basically a role player. Don’t act like their situations are similar just cuz u hate bron, KD is ridiculously stacking the deck yet again"
"Larry Nance Jr, Kevin Love, Javale Mcgee, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond.    TALL BALL IS HERE MOTHERFUCKERS"
"That leaves the Cavs with Jarrett Allen, Javale McGee, Andre Drummond, Kevin Love, Thon Maker and Larry Nance.  Seems like a logjam."
I hope the same great people championing demar and kevin love and p.g.'s mental health are equally concerned here.
Once again you are focusing on what other ppl think and what their perceptions were while i am focusing on what was actually true. Again if you think this way i would love to hear your take on whether you thought the cavs were a superteam during 2015-2017 and if lebron was playing with the best pf in the league in 2015 since kevin love was viewed as the best pf in the league at the start of the 2015 season. By your logic lebron had the best pf in the league in 2015 since thats how everyone viewed love before the season started. I don't care who ppl thought were the top 5 players in the nba heading into the season. And i never said ad was for sure top 3 you just completely made that up out of thin air.
A better fit doesnt necessarily mean a positive asset. Kevin Love or Blake Griffin could fit much better on this Rockets team.
Definitely wasn't because of Kevin Love lmao
"Miami Heat was definitely a super team. Could you call the Lakers a super team? I mean, they just did what every other team did. Make a duo. Just so happened that Lebron and AD was the best duo. I think I might have to consider the 2015-2017 Cavs a superteam too. Kyrie is obviously a superstar. And Kevin Love was putting up ridiculous numbers with the Timberwolves then he joined the Cavs."
Kevin Love averaged 26/12 and was All-NBA second team the season before he joined the Cavs.
Booooooooooooo. The amount of faith some people put into a bunch of privileged millionaires that they’re not just normal dudes that occasionally don’t give a shit about responsibility is crazy.   I can appreciate what DeMar and Kevin Love did but it seems like poor mental health is being attributed to just about every issue a player could have off the court.   Not to mention the idea I’ve seen put around that public criticism of a players basketball ability is tantamount to purposefully inducing depression in them.
"Lebron's second cleveland era made lebron a true leader. After dealing with too many weirdos, he totally learned to control all people near him. JR Smith, Kyrie Irving, Iman Shumpert, Kevin Love, and many who came and gone. Man, it should be too easy to play with an ambitious schröeder now."
Remember the whole “LeBron gave Kevin Love depression” thing?
"There are examples of players who, by simply getting in better shape, were able to have better seasons. You mentioned two in Harden and Jokic. Harden hit the weight room in recent seasons, and it’s no coincidence he was going ham scoring. Curry’s career also is an example of hitting the weight room. Jokic came in fat last season and went to WCF after he put in work dropping weight.   The most evident example I think was Kevin Love. I think Love getting in better shape really did make him better.   To your argument, Shaq had a legendary career, but his lack of interest in staying in optimal shape was also what drove Kobe crazy during their lakers run"
"blake, kevin love, sabonis, cousins, boozer from the top of my head"
"6) The defender who's primary defense is clapping really loud in the other players face  7) the one who has all the handles in the world but just literally move 1 inch. Even when the defender bites hard already.  Honestly though, when you and the pg are on sync on the pick and roll. It's pretty much over. Haha. Especially if you have a mean jump shot.  Dont even get me started on the stretch bigs who also always somehow ends up with the rebound even when they were on the other side of the court. And did I mention they also have Kevin Love-esq outlet passes? All I'm trying to say is.. I miss playing. It's been a while."
I LOVE KEVIN DURANT
Never forget Lebron gave Kevin Love depression
"This happened when Kevin Love admitted he gets depressed. There were lots of ""OMG HE'S A HERO"" and then ""What does he have to be sad about, He MaKeS MiLlIoNs.""  In the end, he's just a dude who needs a little help making serotonin. Welcome to the club bro."
I mean this sub said LeBron gave Kevin Love depression
wasn't that about Kevin Love?
"There hasn't been one player that played with LeBron ""circus environment"" that has been public about hating it.  Kevin Love talked about how hard it was for Love to adjust yet loved the entire time overall. Bosh too."
The funny thing is it makes LeBrons championship look even better in hindsight. He was able to bring Kevin Love and Kyrie to a championship. Since then neither player has accomplished anything. Compare that to Celtics big 3 and Rondo and nearly all went on to have meaningful highlights after.  He was able to get Kyrie to play nice for a few seasons and focus enough to win a championship. It will end up being the only meaningful part of Kyries career.
Can't believe we're just letting Bron off the hook for giving Kevin Love depression too
"People who really have mental health issues have an extremely hard time talking about it or even sharing it with even their closest loved ones.  Take Kevin Love. Nobody knew about this shit for a long, long time.  PG and Kyrie are the poster childs for using fake mental health issues as excuses."
"The thing is, him being an awesome person/teammate and being a flawed basketball player can both be true.   Setting the Rockets/Harden drama aside, Russ the person has rarely had any issues with the Thunder team and the OKC community. Most players he has played with seemingly respect and even love him as person/leader. He will always have his teammates' back on the court and you know he will play his ass off every damn night. He is also a hard worker and professional towards his team mates and coaches by most accounts.   But his game is shall we say, not conducive to championship basketball. Believe me. I have watched enough Westbrook games to know how hard he plays. It's a cliché with him, but it's true. In my opinion the best game of Westbrook's career was 2012 Finals Game 4 which we lost. The Thunder were tight that game after we got our big initial lead. Players were also seemingly gassed from playing so damn hard during that initial run. But Westbrook just kept on going driving and shooting his way to keep us in the game. He was insane that game and the Thunder's best player that night. On a team with Kevin Durant on it. And it wasn't particularly close.   And this is where the problem lies. He knows no other way to play basketball but the way he played that game, which got him to also average a triple double in three consecutive seasons. That style of play is clearly enough to at least make a playoff appearance, but not much else as evidenced by the Thunder's playoff record during that stretch.   He can't really shoot from deep despite his supreme confidence in his shot. He is also surprisingly an average defender and has been for most of the time I have been watching him. He also loves shooting a free throw line jumper in transition that may or may not have caused me to sometimes hit inanimate objects around me out of frustration. Sometimes even if he made them.   Knowing all that though, I would welcome him back on the Thunder in a heartbeat. Always interesting regular season games and early playoff exits every year? Some people would balk at that, but I would take it. One thing that having Westbrook on your team guarantees, is it will never be boring. It'll be frustrating at times, but never boring. And I'll take that if that means I get to see him in a Thunder uniform again."
Trade him to Cleveland for Kevin Love
Kyrie purposely bilking white guy owners for as much as they will give him. He and Kevin Love just taking money hand over fist for no play. And no ones figured it out yet.
What would you trade for Butler with?  edit:  Free agency right?  So you’d have to move Kevin Love then right?
THIS WAS SOME KEVIN LOVE TO LBJ SHIT  or vice-versa!
"Kevin Love in his Minnesota prime was said to be 6'10. Apparently, he is 6'8 now."
"You literally played 4 straight series where the opposing Point Guard was injured, giving Curry the easiest ride to a ring in a while.  Not to mention Kevin Love being injured in the Finals too... the WHOLE Finals, and it took you 6 games.  Bam and Dragic getting injured was significant, but we likely would've won anyway, to be as honest as possible. You guys arguably wouldn't if Kyrie &amp; Love were injured.  Lakers &gt; Raptors &gt; Warriors"
"No SexLand, Love, Kevin Porter Jr or even Exum :P"
You mean Kevin Love the locker room cancer who gets mad at his young teammates?
Lebron is really the only non center I can remember that consistently beat Jrue in the post. Jrue was even locking down guys like Kevin Love in the post last year.
"Hmm. If we’re truly saying like no defense at all, that’s hard to find. People like Luka had atleast an inkling of defense within them.  But:  Trae Young/Devin Booker/Andrew Wiggins/Kevin Love/Thomas Bryant"
If this was Kevin Love he'd for sure be getting a pass by reddit fans. People can downvote and disagree if they want but it's truth.
"yeah, this type of weird overzealous anger towards him is just really weird to me. a basketball player says harmless goofy ""woke"" stuff off the court and this is what you come away with? sorry but i just can't relate, i don't think i'll be able to understand your mindset.   people probably said a lot of the same shit about AI if you were to defend him after the practice rant, ended up being related to the death of a close friend he was missing time for. went through the same shit with kevin love. maybe we just give people the benefit of the doubt until we know anything at all about the situation?"
Kevin Love
Yeah people are ignoring some pretty obvious signs of him not being okay mentally. But when kevin love talks about depression they're dead serious .
"According to [Basketball-Reference HOF probability](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html), Kevin Love has a higher chance of making it right now.  Grant Hill had an amazing college career with 2 championships on top of his great NBA career, where people debated if he would have been better than MJ without his ankle injuries.  Yao Ming is in the Hall more for his cultural and international impact than his NBA career.  Tracy McGrady was one the best scorers the league has ever seen and was debated as the best SG with Kobe for most of a decade.  The defining guards of this generation, the 2010s decade, are:  Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Damian Lillard.  Kyrie gets an honorable mention, but he's closer to a DeRozan than he is to that list."
What do you mean by one dimensional?  Do you mean a good defensive player but limited offensive player like Gobert?  Do you mean a good offensive player but limited defensive player like Kevin Love?  Do you mean a good shooter but cant attack off the dribble like Davis Bertans?  Do you mean a good slasher/finisher but can’t shoot like Giannis?
"Kyrie is a significantly more important and better player than Kevin love though lol. Like its not just the accomplishments its the overall impact on the actual game. That's why guys like Grant Hill, Yao Ming and Tracy Mcgrady are in. They are apart of the very fabric of the game and quintessential parts of their generation of basketball. Kyrie is very much that. Him, Steph, CP3 and Russell Westbrook all are defining guards of this generation. He 100000 percent makes the hall of fame. For you guys to argue against that is so fucking lame and I am not even a Kyrie fan at all. Reddit hivemind bullshit at its very best."
"I actually see it quite the opposite. If Kyrie actually spoke up and said hey I’ve got major depressive disorder, or I’m having panic attacks, or I have a family member battling a terminal illness I think you’d have hardly anyone making fun of him for that. In fact, people are making fun of him because he come across as entitled and woke but that might even decrease if people knew his struggles. If instead of disappearing and being MIA he released a statement or authorized the team to do so I suspect he’d get a ton of respect, empathy, and support. I know they’re generally more well liked but I’ve never seen anyone make fun of Kevin Love or Derozan following their mental health disclosures."
Remember Kevin Love popping his shoulders? This could easily turn into that if they both trip.     It's not just annoying. Its also really dangerous.
"Totally, and he think he’d ultimately be okay with taking it on the chin on his next contract. But to think we almost lost Kevin Love to suicide breaks my heart, and I don’t want Kyrie to feel that close to the edge either."
"Ok but when other dudes who seem to have more legitimate mental health problems - eg Kevin Love, Demar, no one is shitting on them. Kyrie is over here pretending to be an intellectual and says the most pretentious and outlandish crap that is so off putting it’s actually hard to empathize with him. If Kyrie does have legit mental health concerns (which is likely), he’s probably not going to be honest about it and he’d probably play it off as “I’m just more woke than all of you, you wouldn’t understand.”  In other words, Kyrie kinda a douche."
"He's popular, but I don't think you realize that you can be a really good player and still not make the Hall of Fame.  Do you think Kevin Love is a Hall of Famer?  He has a similar resume to Kyrie."
"I understand that Kyrie’s done things like this before, but people really need to rally behind him and send good thoughts toward his mental health. Kyrie has always shown signs of struggling with his mental health, and he’s at the age where certain disorders can start to really take a toll on people. This pandemic has sped everything related to that up, and from recent experience, something that you’d be able to handle okay enough in regular life, can push you very close to the edge in pandemic life. I’m Latino, so I can only imagine how difficult it is to be black, but there’s still so much stigma in minority communities to seek help or that Your sadness is validated. Kyrie’s a sad dude, and I think if you’re an NBA fan, you need to recognize that and take it easy on him. Look how far to the edge Kevin Love has been in recent years, we need to provide Kyrie the same level of empathy."
What about Kevin Love or Gordon Hayward?
"This sub is very hypocritical. We applaud people like Kevin Love for speaking out about mental health issues, and then make fun of people going through mental health issues. It’s pretty clear Kyrie has something going on."
"'11 heat weren't stacked, 0 depth, '15, injures, '16 ""big three"" member kevin love averaged 8ppg, 17', didn't matter, 20' no depth just him and AD"
"yeah, everybody wants to gag on demar and kevin love when they discuss mental health problems, but if its a player that the hivemind doesn't like, his struggles get dismissed. ya'll have zero idea what could be going on behind the scenes in kyrie's life, and you aren't entitled to know either."
Did Lebron give Kevin Love depression?
Ikr at first I thought I was watching Kevin Love with the ball
Must have learned it from Kevin Love
Does that means steph and klaya first championship was a fraud as well? Considering kyrie and Kevin love were out
"Kyrie seems like he has not the typical depression mental issue like DeRozan and Kevin love but the stronger psychotic one like mania, bipolar, shizo. Not surprised if he hearing voices in his head and have several delusions."
Only Kevin Love can have depression bro. Don't believe it.
Wow who knew it took 1 year to make AD turn into Kevin Love and it’s actually AD’s fault lmfao literally just a taller light skin kevin love this season dear god
kevin love could do nothing but shoot open jump shots and get cooked on defense
Jeff Green was more valuable to the team than Kevin Love
"Kevin Love missed an Eastern Conference finals game 7 and nobody gave a shit, that tells you all you need to know"
Can't decide which trade is less likely - giving away Brown and Harris for Kevin Love or trying to re-negotiate with the Rockets to also get Tucker and Boogie lol
I'm on record saying I like that Cavs trade.  But highly doubt they'd trade Dinwiddie given his contract situation. I also have trouble believing anybody wants to give up that much for a deal surrounding Kevin Love.
"Love and McGee don't move the needle for us enough to trade Joe Harris, who is massively important to us.   McGee or Drummond might be bought out - we aren't giving up our 4th best player for the shell of Kevin Love"
Joe Harris is more valuable to a championship team than Kevin Love and JaVale McGee. The Brooklyn Nets don’t need to trade for a center.
What leadership? When he called out Kevin love for leaving the game after having a panick attack? Thomas is more of a liability on that front than an asset.
"Kevin Love, Derrick Rose, Osman, etc. are good at defense? Since when?"
The east was just atrocious that year. That bucks team wasn’t that good either and the sixers were led by a rookie in simmons  and embiid in his second year playing  The Cavs team outside of Lebron was awful. Next best guy was Kevin love and then third best guy was Jeff green?
"K Love already slimmed down significantly for his 26&amp;13 season , maybe not quite the Cavs Love but definitely FAR from Fat Kevin"
But we can get a much better package for Brad than the corpse of Kevin Love and picks. We don't need a 2nd horrible contract to pair up with Westbrook's.
"A lot of comments saying its like the 1st year LeBron was with the Lakers, but LeBron was injured (and many were also) and we didn't get to see them at full strength in the playoffs.  I prefer thinking of a supporting cast like George Hill, Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson, with Jordan Clarkson coming as the 6th man. If the Kings are just as good as these cats, than LeBron can make them contenders, as proven in 2018."
I don’t know about leadership man       IT was a straight dick to kevin love in Cleveland. Blaming love for not playing hard enough during a losing streak when he had the flu
What about in 2015 if Kyrie and Kevin love don’t go down gsw never gets that championship boost for 2016
"Kevin Love, Beasley, Tyus Jones, Dieng, Taj Gibson, Teague... there’s a lot of examples of this being not really true"
"Never sniffed the playoffs with the Kings, then once he got traded the kings became a 8th seed contender. Same story with the pelicans, onve he got injured the pels went on a massive run. He wasnt ever good enough to lead a team to the playoffs. Reminds me of a more dramatic Kevin Love."
You did not just compare Harden to Kevin Love and Ray Allen lmao. There is not a team in history that Harden would be the third option for
I mean every big 3 that's formed before this one has had the third guy sacrifice a lot of their shots. Kevin Love was averaging around 20 shots a game prior to Cleveland and started averaging 13 or 14 a game with them. Ray Allen was averaging around 20 shots a game in Seattle then about 13 or 14 with Boston. Both was averaging about 17 shots a game in Toronto then went down 12-14 during the Bron heat years while wade went from 20 shots a game to about 17. The absolute best case scenario was golden state where instead of Klay sacrificing shots both Durant and Curry sacrificed a little from their shot total.  Basically if go off of history Harden's taking the amount of shots you'd expect a 3rd option on a big 3 team to take. They can try to figure things out and get him more shots. However both Kyrie and KD have already gotten mad when they felt they weren't getting enough shot attempts in the past.
"*A relevant comment in this thread was deleted. You can read it below.*  ----  I might be alone here, but imo Shaq was trying to do something similar to Kobe's tweet challenges. He just did it in a macho/tough love/awkward way, and on live TV. But I think he was romanticizing and thinking he could say that and then Donovan would take it personally or say ""challenge accepted"" and then go crazy and then Shaq would feel like he was on the same shit Kobe was on in terms of mentoring/inspiring the new generations.  All speculation, but I think maybe this was a step away from his hating and petty past, and an attempt to start being more of a tough love older brother/mentor.

Do Cav fans have Love for Kevin*
"Well yeah, obviously I'd overstate that. OP clearly hasn't watched basketball in the past 5 years, or else he'd understand why Cleveland fans don't hate Kevin Love sitting there absorbing 25% of their salary cap to not be his former all-star self. You gotta rub it in a bit for them to truly understand it.      It's different from say a Blake Griffin contract(former star who never brought his teams any glory) or an Andrew Wiggins contract(overpaid role player), he did the work and this is the organization's way of saying thank you for the championship. Tryna make KLove fans feel guilty or some shit."
"Cav fans have no reason to talk about Kevin Love. He's injury prone so he never sees the floor, and when he does he doesn't play anywhere close to the player he used to be. That being said, that's no reason to not love Kevin. He went from a 1st option to a 3rd option(Minny to Cleveland) and worked HARD to adjust his game. Stayed and got the ring, and didn't throw a fit when Lebron left. In fact, he doubled down after getting that massive contract, and stayed to be a veteran presence for the young upstart Cavs team. Consummate professional, doesn't ask for a trade even though he's an aging vet with a usable skillset.     Love is happy to cash his check in while being a veteran for this young Cavs team. No Love Lost."
"Yeah, I like Kevin Love, but why would I be talking about him being an all-star? Also, who is even talking about all-star right now?"
"Yes *but* LMA has been a long established abbreviation for **L**a**M**arcus **A**ldridge. We don't need to shorten that further to LA.  I'm not against people using acronyms for players in general where context fits and the player doesn't already have a very short name (If you use KL instead of Love for Kevin Love that's a paddling), I'm more against this specific one."
I think it's underrated that Kevin Love has 34 points in a quarter with one minute left and if he had gotten the ball from Kyrie in last minute he could have broken that record?
love kevin durant~~~ LOVEEEEE kevin duranttttt
"People are on him because he doesn't have that Kevin Calabro legend tone. They also rip on him for being corny, but I personally love it, it's like an uncle telling you a joke where you laugh and give him crap but you secretly love it"
Bron learned something from Kevin Love
Bring back Kevin Love when he's healthy
"It will be interesting to see how long this record lasts. Kevin Love got close to breaking it in 2016 when he had his 34 point first quarter, but thanks to Kyrie Irving refusing to pass him the ball at the end of the quarter, he fell short.  30 point quarters are extremely rare (I think there's only been 10 in history), and you are going to need closer to 40 than 30 to break Klay's record."
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the home locker room after the final buzzer to give Collin Sexton and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Dylan Windler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
There was this one guy named Kevin Love who wasn't half bad
i’m still mad that Kyrie iced out Kevin Love at the end a the first quarter where it looked like Love could tie or break this record &gt;:(
Kevin Love injured is addition by subtraction when it comes to defense
Westbrook ?   Mike Conley ?    Kevin Love ?  John wall ?   Plenty of bad contracts that could be moved .
Kevin love?
Kevin Love is out.
Yeah but there are All stars and All stars let's not pretend that Kevin Love + Kyrie is the same as Curry+Klay. The only ones who are comparable there are KD and LeBron.   Also you say you don't count Draymond as an all star but he performed at that level while the Cavs has a worst support cast
"Him and Nance are definitely the veteran leaders on the team.  Javale has been a nice pick up as well, not only for his energy on the court, but the rest of the guys seem to really respect him. The only thing I am worried about with Love returning is if we can keep up the pace that JB likes to play at. Kevin can't really run the floor very well."
"At least Kevin Love gives you rebounds and all the bench enthusiasm and sex appeal of a soccer dad, what does Melo give you?"
Jokic is averaging less than a triple double now. Literal trash player you should trade him to the Cavs for a superior big man like Kevin Love
"I understood what you meant, man, for that I've added the context that this last season was pretty normal (played 86% of the games and averaged 30+ minutes) despite most comments around (from fans of other teams) kinda making it look like he played 10 games or something, if I had to guess I'd say that people just didn't watch us last year but that's fine too. Anyway, I'm just saying that I feel like things are a bit overblown and, if we are really gunning for the play-ins, that we could expect a pretty ok Kevin Love coming back to play when he is ready.   And I think that Love is expected to be reevaluated this week, by the way, so let's hope for a smooth recovery and another positive player to our team! It really feels like we are gunning for the play-ins, it has been a fun season."
"Really sad to see the downfall of these once great veteran players, here is a stat that will shock you, Both Kevin Love and Kevin Durant scored ZERO points tonight."
"Lmao you're trying too hard buddy.   Pacers finished 5th in the East at 48-34, they were not a good team. Oladipo was their best offensive player at 55% TS on 22 points. Everyone knows the Raptors in the playoffs are a terrible team, I mean their franchise player averaged 17 points on 47% TS while giving up buckets on the other end every other possession.   &gt; Celtics beat the Bucks with Giannis  The Bucks were massive underperformers even after 2018, what makes you think they were any good before Giannis's first mvp season? the Bucks won 44 games that season. You're trying too hard convincing me facing Brown the sophomore and Tatum the rookie was a difficult obstacle for a superstar caliber player backed by another all star in Kevin Love.   Tell me how you think these teams are even half as good as the 76ers, Bucks, and Celtics right now/"
Not really. This is the coach that left CJ Miles to guard Kevin Love in the post for 5-6 straight possessions before calling a timeout. In the playoffs no less. He may be fine for team culture and inbounds plays but he is terrible with matchups.
"LeBron having Dinner with Kevin Love, suddenly phone ringz"
"Oh, that's weird. Kevin Love just @'d him on that handle the other day so I figured it was still good. [https://twitter.com/kevinlove/status/1352278221430153219](https://twitter.com/kevinlove/status/1352278221430153219) maybe he changed it and someone tried to steal."
And Kevin Love isn't even playing
Let's not forget that actually Cavs will have Kevin Love back at some point.  Love in SexLand
Kevin love could get re-signed today for another $25m salary and just ride the bench for the whole contract &amp; I wouldn’t even mind. Love his veteran presence no matter what because he’s been loyal to us
Hear me out   The return of fat Kevin love
Ah yes the LeBron gave Kevin Love depression thread. Truly one of the worst posts in this sub. /u/chacata_panecos wrong for that one.
That guy who said lebron gave Kevin love depression
Too bad he couldn’t slow it down before Kevin Love put the clamps on him in the Finals
"I love Chris Webber. I have been a fan of him his entire career. I actually think he and Kevin Harlan make a great duo. I wish they had not stuck him with Marv this year. Give Marv to Reggie, please."
Shaq giving Christian Wood depression just like Lebron did to Kevin Love
Honestly pretty bad luck with KD going to the dubs and Steph/Dray being like Kevin Love Kryptonite   *cue mention of Love shutting down Steph at the end of game 7
"Kevin Harlan has a ""big fight"" vibe to his voice all the time and I love it"
I'd love it if they panned to show Kevin and Reggie were irl broadcasting at the arena  It'd make Kevin steamrolling and cutting off Reggie like 4 times in a row so much better
Minnesota Kevin love is the all timer for me.
I sold my house in pursuit of the Big 3:  The Dunk  Kyrie's shot  Kevin Love sticking with Curry in space
&gt; Why was Lebron MVP when he played with Dwyane Wade and Kevin Love?  When did this happen?
Why was Lebron MVP when he played with Dwyane Wade and Kevin Love? Why was Magic with Kareem ever MVP? Why was MJ MVP when he had Pippen? You're so dumb for even asking this.
I didn't read the article but Kevin Love has played 1 game this year. Regardless of what people think about Kevin he will at least bring some reliable shooting/spacing on offense.
Lol the reason the Cavs are playing so well is because Kevin Love isn't playing.
Kyrie and Lebron gave Kevin Love depression....then Sex God cured it.
"No, second year and third year players that win it make no sense ala Kevin Love or Gilbert Arenas."
"Nice, I like Kevin Love"
Yes coach Kevin Love.
"No, the 2018 still had guys like George Hill, Rodney Hood and a bunch of vet guys + a much more uinjured Kevin Love, it’s close though. It’s amazing what you can do when you ain’t paying max money to Tristan Thompson."
"To be fair, Lebron gets all the credit and his teammates get all the blame is common practice. I don't blame him for being fed up, look what they did to poor Kevin love who bought into the system."
"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter  Larry Nance JR. gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Cedi Osman yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Austin Carr hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"For real, I need a compilation video of just Kevin Love and the cavs bench’s reactions"
Yea everyone knows Kevin Love invented anxiety.
"Nah, you're right. Sexton and the other young players were frustrating to watch. Kevin Love probably felt like retiring early, and there were a handful of testy moments where it was obvious it wasn't a team all on the same page. They survived that shitshow and came out better for it."
"Kevin Love, Windler, Delly too. Legit depth"
"Last week, we had a stretch where we were missing 8 players and had to start Damyeon Dotson and Yogi Ferrell. We were missing Sexton, Garland, Love, Drummond, Exum, Delly, Dylan Windler, and Kevin Porter.   Since then, Sexton and Drummond are back, Exum was traded, Porter started a food fight over a moved locker and ~~got~~ is about to get waived.  Windler (wing who’s played all of 9 minutes through first two seasons bc of injury) and Garland should be back by this weekend. Garland is finally coming into his own and was a huge part of how we started this year 3-0. Other than that, we’ve missed Love’s floor spacing quite a bit. This offense will be finding and hitting many more open 3s when healthy."
Anyone know where those sweaters are from? The one that Kevin Love is wearing while celebrating
They wanted to trade Klay for Kevin Love who was a top 10 player back then. You think he'd pass up on that?
"Hey, it could also be Blake Griffin. Maybe Kevin Love? The possibilities are endless."
"I mean this is still frustrating to watch and Colin has been developing really well but shit like this would happen all the time. Chris Paul is on Kevin love. Give him the ball, fuck whatever play you’re trying to run.   He’s getting better every year but watching Colin run the 1 when he was thrust into it was tough to watch tbh"
"ADD DARIUS AND KEVIN, WE LOVE SEXMAN'S LAND"
Kevin love looks like he could be cedi's Dad.
Kevin got a ring at the cost of love for the game
I'm happy when Kevin Love is happy. I remember him begging every playoff team to save him post-match last year :).
No no that’s for Kevin Love
Love Kevin Love’s reactions
"Unreal performance.  Also, seeing Kevin Love this happy makes me happy."
Kevin Love + Sexton = Love Sex
"Dude was playing with so much intensity, damn   Also, gotta love Kevin Love just loosing his shit over and over"
"Has Kevin Love even seen the floor for 30 min this season yet? Serious question, when was even the last time he played lol"
"The King just got a game off of the Durant super team. Kyrie also put up some monster numbers as the number 2 scorer on his team! Kevin Love, Dellavedova, Jeff Green, Cedi Osman, and Larry Nance were there as support as well."
"LMAO Kevin Love was like ""YES FUCK KYRIE IRVING"""
Kevin Love was out there like a dad watching a JV game lol
The big three got Sexed...  who said this team ain't making the playofff?  any word on when Kevin Love returns?
Watching Kevin Love in his beige jumper celebrating was incredible!
Lmao Kevin love
Kevin Love goin crazy lol
"Cavs were a super team, Kevin Love was a monster it’s just he got relegated to that 3rd option role"
Kevin Love is a model but Cedi Osman is not one. I love Cedi tho
"Those two get me every time, some of my favorite media personalities with such great chemistry. I love hearing Verno freak out on Kevin haha."
Kevin Love
Best Kevin Love trade scenarios. Since the Cavs have so many bigs here are some potential teams .   https://youtu.be/pyPcWBVM964
"If salary was no object, I'd rather bring Kevin Love back to Portland. I'm sure he misses home."
That Ja Morant dunk attempt on Kevin Love  https://youtu.be/SJvHeuCLJAs
At some point that talent **needs** to translate to wins and playoff appearances. They’ve been garbage for a very long time. Only 2 decent seasons since 2006 and they ran their best player since Kevin Love out of town after their first playoff appearance in *14 years*.
"They did trade the other two number one picks for Kevin Love, so there's that."
"I thought we were supposed to be empathetic to players even if they're rich after what we learned of mental health from DeMar and Kevin Love?  Good for KD, but for someone like KAT this has obviously been a lot more difficult."
"Plug in a player who can shoot very similarly to Steph and has for almost as long as him with a much worse supporting cast? Prime Steph has always played with at least 2 All NBA players (and often an all star caliber player off the bench) until now, where has 1 All NBA player and several other good role players (revitalized Wiggins).  Give Dame a bunch of low post split opportunities by rotating around Klay or coming off moving Draymond &amp; Bogut screens and he's putting up stats nearly as good as Steph. Not 2016 regular season Steph, but damn near close considering his stats are comparable and he's been rotting away on the Blazers for years  I'll take it one step further; Dame wins just as many rings as Curry does in his exact situation  Put Dame on the 2015 Warriors (vs 4 straight injured point guards, no Kyrie or Love in the Finals, 2017 Warriors (Kevin Durant on his team vs a historically bad Cavs D) and 2018 Warriors (with KD vs LeBron and Jeff Green as his 2nd best player) and he's very likely winning 3 rings too. I know I'll get downvoted, but it's true."
"I'm all for having your favorite player, I will rep Dirk til the day I die, but my problem is the fans that will blindly defend anything by said player.   It creates misleading and false narratives. It's like with Dirk's 2011 finals run. Mavs fans will discredit the role players on that team to hype up Dirk. Dirk was the best player, but you don't have to make it seem like he dragged a rec league team to the finals, to make Dirk seem better.   My criticism with player fandoms lies in people discrediting other players if it doesn't fit their personal favorite player's narrative. LeBron fans will trash Kevin Love or Kyrie to make LeBron look better, or Steph/Luka/Trae/LeBron etc...  fans will hive mind downvote anything that is anti-Steph/Luka/Trae/LeBron. And I'm not even talking about arbitrary things like Trae looks like a dirty lollipop! Like obviously downvote that, or upvote it if you lol, but when you have Luka stans downvoting a comment that talks about how Luka made a bad play or took a bad shot, it is just completely biased and homer-based.   Again, I'm all for having your favorite players and rooting for them, but when you start lying to yourself to prop up your favorite player, it's a little ridiculous, and adds nothing to the basketball conversation, and just turns the subreddit into an echo chamber."
KAT? Kevin Love?
"He’s still the best player in the game and his team has the second best record in the league while he’s played every game and his stats are still Damn good.  In prior years, like 2018, which I think Lebron deserved MVP as the Cavs team was a dumpster fire and overhauled the entire team mid season along with Kevin Love missing months due to injury.  Lebron drug them to a 4th seed and had his best season ever in my opinion.  People claimed then that it was more about record and being best player on the best team.  Now that Lebron is getting that narrative, people suddenly want to change the criteria.  Be consistent."
Hurting for Larry Nance and Kevin Love rn.
Kevin Love
he had Kevin Love and good role players and played a weak Indiana team with Oladipo as the best player and then Toronto with Derozan/Lowry and who? after that a Boston team with no kyrie and led by a 19 year old Tatum...all those teams would get swept in the west lmao..lebron has the easiest road for 8 straight years
I love how active Kevin love is on social media ijs
"""Well hello there, welcome to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada! We are here with Kevin...""  ""Durant.""  ""Kevin Durant! And to start here Mr. Kevin Durant in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, I have this record for you! We know how you love your records... if you could just take a look- ""  ""Oh wow. Heh, yeah.

""Hmmmmm. That's not right. You see I distinctly remember that there was a slightly different story going on. From what I heard.

""There's really nothing to shar-""  ""And why don't you tell the fans about what you did for Jay under that mixing board on that rainy night in Newark. Tell 'em Mr. Kevin.""  ""What do you want.""  ""I want you to do exactly to me what you did for Hov. Nothing held back. You will slobber, and suck, and you will put your fist in my like a civil rights sign- is that understood Mr. Durant, here in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada?""  Kevin sunk to his knees to do what had to be done.  ""Doot doola doot doo..."" Nardwuar snarled.  ""Doot. Doot."" Replied KD through tears."
"We still love you Kevin, even if you're playing with literally Satan"
Ahh yes when Kyrie and Kevin Love were out injured and the Warriors were fully healthy. I guess LeBron is the only superstar not allowed to have help?
"there's definitely been a case, not that he was ever the favorite since 2013 but I do think he could have gotten it in certain years, specifically 2018 &amp; 2020. The only years he didn't really have a case is 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019 imo.   In 2015 his team was 19-20 (lost like all games but one in the two weeks break he took, if that's not the definition of valuable...) until they won like 30 of their last 40 games, Curry &amp; Harden was ahead of them so yes he probably didn't have much of a case  in 2018 Harden had more wins but a much better team. The cavs changed twice almost completely that season (Rose Wade IT Crawder and Irving leaving, then those 4 leaving and getting Hood, Hill, Nance) and Kevin Love got hurt. They still won 50 games despite the constant changes   in 2020 Giannis started the season much better and LeBron was never the favorite. He closed the gap before the break, Giannis was hurt before the pandemic and was probably going to finish the season with fewer than 70 games while LeBron was gaining momentum, and in the west this time, where he finished as the #1 seed. So to me he had a case, maybe not as the favorite but a #1 seeded LeBron always has a case. It's just that all his 4 MVPs were undebatable MVPs"
Kevin Love actually played in the finals outside of Disney world that actually had high tv viewership because it wasn’t a joke of a series. Real chips over completion rings
That's what Kevin Love averaged in the finals.
"As much as I love data showing Duncan to be superior, I must say that RPM is highly suspect. For example, it suggests Vince Carter was better than Kevin Durant in 2013. Moreover, Ryan Anderson was above LBJ in 2011."
RJ had a better finals series than Kevin Love. Yes or no? Because objective stats are NOT the same as disapproval
"Considering that you guys *barely* won in 2016, yeah. RJ was a competent wing player who could guard multiple positions and make an open corner 3. Doesn't sound like much, but when you take into consideration that none of your other players in 2015 could do that, yeah, it makes a big difference.   He was 5th on your team in minutes played in the Finals, ahead of Kevin Love, who had an *awful* series."
Looool. So the raptors are just gonna hand vanvleet or lowry to the celtics for freaking kemba. They would want multiple picks &amp; players to swap kemba for lowry. Walkers contracts looks like kevin love level of atrocious.
"lmao FUCK KD but this is adorablelol  &gt;Durant said he started to feel better about his decision during his time with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  “I was worried about how my peers were going to feel about me,” he told Steinberg. “In my profession, that’s the only thing I care about. So when I was talking to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and they were like, ‘Congrats, man, do your thing,’ and Paul George was like, ‘Congrats, man, I am happy for you,’ and Kevin Love was like, ‘Shoot, do what you gotta do,’ that eased my mind a little bit, because I want that from my peers.”"
Lets just ignore the fact that in 2015 we didn’t have Kyrie or Kevin Love
My favorite one is the heave over Kevin Love
"your source literally proves that kyrie was afraid of something that never came close to materializing:  &gt; No formal offer was made by any of the teams  vs. the potential Love trade:  &gt; Pacers general manager Kevin Pritchard reportedly backed out of a three-team trade  so even though kyrie is rumored to have been ""afraid"" or whatever of a Suns trade, that was clearly not very well-founded. it doesn't take a genius to see that a potential deal with Phoenix wasn't irving's only gripe  not sure why you would double down so hard on kyrie's existential fears lmao"
"Thats exactly what I was getting at, just wanted to give that side of the coin. Ppl making fun of it cus they dont know what living like that might be like. Shit is chaotic out here for some ppl and they over here sitting cozy laughing at somebody that might actually have problems.  But pray for Kevin Porter Jr, and Kevin Love is such a standup guy for speaking up. Gang sign John Wall is one of my favorite players too and I love that Derozan is a crip. Fucking clowns"
Lebron was never trading kyrie for paul george lol.

Not before that play or since that play has Kevin Love got a stop on Curry on the perimeter. Curry's MCL sprain was limiting him.
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Lol Kawhi LeBron Jimmy Butler Chris Bosh Kevin Love
Kevin Love Handles
"I think Westbrook is special. Very high impact and energy guy. Keldon feels like he has that from the forward position in that downward run and attack the defenders with no fear. I do think he improved as a playmaker. I just think that's still his weakness for a great player along with jump shot being hot/cold. I think he could have worked with the Spurs for years past. He feels very Spursy in some ways.   He definitely has grown in some PG ways since I saw him (i got to photograph a game of his before he ever wore UCLA officially - it was fun). I was on the photo side so I got to go to the Final Four. I left when Kevin Love came for his one year.  But those Fucking Florida Teams with Brewer, Horford and Noah!! So close!"
"We can make it a term of endearment, kinda like when referring to fat kevin love"
Kevin Love could've blocked that.
Our offense shifted from moving the ball to force feeding Drummond. Drummond was being really bad. Offense hasn't really recovered since.  Our defense has fallen off a cliff.  We badly miss Kevin Love. We're missing spacing and his defensive rebounding. Suns 2nd chance points really kept them in the game when it seemed like the Cavs could take a solid lead. Then Devin Booker did his thing.
&gt; The second he hit that I burst out laughing.  Like we almost expect him to make those but still find ourselves laughing at how beautifully bs it is lmao.  The one vs Kevin Love couple of years ago is my favourite one.
"which time?? In the last 12 years they've had the up and coming spooky teams of:   * 2007-2009: Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Corey Brewer * 2010-2014: Kevin Love, Derrick Williams and Ricky Rubio * 2015-2019: Andrew Wiggins, KAT, Zach Lavine * 2020-Present: KAT, D'lo Russell, Anthony Edwards"
The State Farm commercials always killed me especially the one with dame Kevin love cp3 KG and Deandre Jordan
"&gt; i think he would fit right in  Except when it comes to the salary cap. A Clippers trade for Kevin Love is nearly impossible because of Love's huge salary, unless the Clippers want to send [Beverley, Lou Williams and Marcus Morris to Cleveland.](https://tradenba.com/trades/rjzVz1BpP) I'm guessing the Clippers don't want to give all that up for Love though. Another possibility is [Bev, Lou, Zubac and PPat for Love,](https://tradenba.com/trades/RFTRrmMmP) and again, I'm guessing the Clippers won't want to gut their team like that just for Love, although the thought of the Cavs taking on yet another center is pretty hilarious."
[Here's what Kevin Love has been up to lately.](https://youtu.be/S1_L6RGDggk)
"He is one of those players that are kind of frustrating because he could be so much better.   In college as a freshmen he was a 20/11 player with 65% TS. That is rare company and has the potential to be a 25 point scorer in the NBA. He supposedly has a [43.5 inch vert](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664?lang=en) with elite length. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is Chris Paul. How isn't he a 20+ scorer by now? We can't use the excuse that he hasn't had pg's that can pass. By the time Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Joel Embiid, Kevin Garnett, and Giannis were 22 years old they were all 20 ppg+ scorers already. Many of us were hoping he would turn into them and his first two years he had a trajectory that he might but then going back down to 14 ppg is a little disappointing. However, the Suns play a super slow pace with Chris Paul and have bottom 5 lowest possessions per game in the NBA when last year they were top 10 so everyone's stats is going to go down a little bit. Additionally, the Suns have a lot of mouths to feed with 7 players scoring in double digits (6 players if you don't count Dario who only played 6 games)."
"what thats the worst take i seen in a long time like people JOIN him not because of him he makes teammates better but he makes people join first left cleveland to make Miami superteam and only won 2 in there then when he returned to cleveland kevin love was there a kyrie first finals excusable second superteam kyrie was averaging 27ppg and i believed he dropped a 40 bomb, next cleveland was still above average with Kevin love, and LBJ left and missed the playoffs with a team just a little bit worser than the 2007 cavs like explain that and then lbj with all the luck in the world got AD, and won a chip and was not the best player on his team AD was better in almost every major statical catagory, [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html)  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html)"
My peeps. This was on NBA inside drive 2000. Go play that game if you love his color commentary. He and Kevin Calabro do a great job on there.
Is Kevin Love even alive? I haven’t heard his name in like a year now.
"Regardless of what your opinion that fact of matter is even with your two metrics you want them to be compared at they still aren't even close. Love is only had one season over 61% true shooting towns only had one season under 61% in which it was 59%. Ask for Efg% Towns has never been under 56%, Kevin Love has never been over 55. They are not even close take the L and move on bro."
"Exactly and the graphic made it seem like the rest of the team fell apart when lebron left even-though most of the starters left in free agency and or were traded, and Kevin love was injured. They had Sexton and Osman leading the charge compared to Pippen Horace grant, Bj Armstrong for the bulls and Spicy P, Lowry, Fvv, Ibaka, Powell, and the other raptors."
"Not just the decision, he followed that by creating another stacked super team in Cleveland. Who exactly was the other super teams at the time when he went there? Literally no one else was going around teaming up yet(in their primes) with other stars, Lebron did it twice before anyone else had done anything at all similar. And then Lakers again got AD to pair with Lebron, who is another superstar.  It makes no sense to forgive Lebron and act like it's fine for him to do it and then blast KD and use arbitrary standards. Heat were bringing together 3 all-stars and two top 4 players together. He tried something similar on the Cavs, Kevin Love was rated much higher at the time than he is in hindsight. KD isn't wrong that he didn't expect the level of backlash because it was what was already happening with Lebron."
KAT is just new age Kevin Love.
"I love JRs story about Kevin Garnett getting his welcome to the NBA.  Bc of KG, JR got pummeled so bad, even KG was fucked up over it"
&gt;They should trade Westbrook for whatever value they can get  I don't think Westbrook will ever be traded for value again.  Would have to be like them getting Kevin Love in a 3 way trade or them giving up picks.
"Yea, something like LeBron was demanding so much of Kevin love that he was causing so much stress and anxiety"
Amateurs  -Cavs/Kevin Love probably
Kevin Love to the Clippers!?
"Ian Eagle, Mike Breen, and Kevin Harlan are all legitimately fantastic play-by-play guys and easily the best national NBA play-by-play guys, imo.  The problem is the color commentators are typically pretty bad.  Doris Burke is probably my favorite national color commentator, as she brings the best combination of knowledge and smart analysis but also just genuine love and excitement for the game and players, and a good vibe with her fellow commentators.  Outside of those few, it's pretty rough.  When you have play by play dudes like Marv and color commentators like Reggie Miller and C-Webb calling a good chunk of high profile, nationally televised games, it gives it a bad look.  Imo TNT should replace Marv with Eagle (or Eric Collins from Charlotte) and look for a much better color commentator for their main Thursday night games."
I love me some Kevin Harlan and Ian Eagle tho
Kevin Love throws better outlet passes than Tom Brady
such a fucking classic stupid ass Bill statement comparing Kevin Durant to Kevin Love. Just so unneccesary
Yes. He subtweeted Kevin Love one time in 2015. What else happened? Please enlighten me.
Well even Rose and came out and sided with Butler...but yes his antics were choad like lol...towns is just another Kevin love in terms of value...they should try and swindle some team and start over with edwards and picks so we can have this conversation again in 5 years lol
Definitely Bosh over Kevin Love.
Vooch is literally Minnesota Kevin Love. Completely empty numbers that wouldn’t translate anywhere winning is a regular occurrence and not just a novelty
"Obviously, a great team but I don't think its better than any other team ahead of them. Outside of Lebron and Kyrie, it gets hard to identify any other talent better than on the pother teams. Kevin Love was injured in the finals too."
"David robinson was washed by the time timmy showed up on the team. he was still a great center, don't get me wrong, but just nowhere near what he was in the MVP days. He was servicable. def not a huge contributor in the 2003 run.  Ginobli and TP would not be SHIT without Timmy, neither would pop tbh. whenever i bring up this ranking people say that timmy had it easy with the team culture and stuff but the truth is it was because of him that both his euro-guards had their potential unlocked. he also was the foster of the team culture that led to 5 rings.  so it really just helps my point since Ginobili and TP ended up so great. they would not have been all stars, let alone HOF if not for TD. Kawhi of course was great and but the last ring was by no means a carry job by him either, i think TD def deserved that finals mvp. of course kawhi was a great teammate, just not all star level at that time. And you bring up Bowen, which is like his 5th best teammate if im being nice. Lebron's 5th best teammate was fucking kevin love or bosh, who are both way better than bowen ever was."
"It’s not really slander. I’m telling the truth. He underperforms in the biggest games, tier 1 players dominate in big games.  And winning a ring with KD and Kyrie as your teammates means a whole lot less than winning a ring with Kyle Lowry and pascal siakam. Or klay and dray. Or Kyrie and Kevin love."
"Pop wanted switchability on the perimeter at the cost of rebounding. Imo he probably overthought that substitution, and iirc he admits that himself. You have to think your all-world, all-time great defender would find a way to pull one strong perimeter defensive possession out of his ass with everything on the line right? Especially if Kevin Love could do it on Steph lol. It’s easy to look back on it with hindsight though, if the Spurs just got the defensive rebound we’d be praising Pop for making such a gutsy call."
He really is our Timberwolves-era Kevin Love :'(
"He's euro Kevin Durant with a little Arvydas in there too, he really will be special if he pans out. He also seems to love the game and want to be in there, even if it's just 10 minutes now. I don't even know what his prime would look like but if he gets anywhere close to it he'll be a good player"
"Exactly like when he had him...I wonder if he could guard Kevin Love better than CJ miles did....I guess we will never know.  Also, cool story, one of my friends used to work at Archery District in Mississauga (dodgeball with bows and arrows in a city close to Toronto) and James Johnson's brother was there for his bday so he got to meet James.  Said he was a SUPER nice guy who got REAL competitive when the arrows started to fly haha."
"I would hardly call peak Kevin Love a ""decent player"" He was probably top 2-3 PF in the league when he was at his peak."
Something something Kevin Garnett and Kevin Love.
He actually recreated the shot by Steph Curry on the 2018 NBA Finals Game 2 over Kevin Love.
Kevin Love to Celtics Isaiah Thomas
Yepp as a Sixers fan I love my team and Embiid is a monster but how do you guard Harden Kyrie and Kevin Durant lol
Good stats on a bad team. Kevin Love 2.0
He’s like a big Kevin Love without the pedigree
How in world does someone say rebounding is sacrificed by playing kevin love?   Thats probably his most elite skill.
"Nance was ruled 4-6 weeks two weeks ago, so hopefully only 2-4 left. Kevin Love is like Schrodinger's injury, he both is and isnt injured up until the moment the roster is submitted."
"Zion is such a good scavenger, kinda reminds me of fat Kevin love"
"True LeBron the famously bad teammate who no one likes playing with. Not sure if you remember much about his Cavs days but he actually gave Kevin Love depression. I suspect that's why AD is out for so long, he's actually depressed because of LeBron and they're hiding it behind the veil of an ""injury""."
That was my first theory but then I remembered Kevin Love and George Hill.
"r/nba - ""After Kevin Love, Lebron is now making Caruso depressed"""
i think kevin love was a 1   and it’s proven more so by the fact that when his role get diminished he couldn’t impact in more ways
"By this metric were the LeBron 2016 Cavs a superteam?  LeBron = 3, Kyrie = 2, Kevin Love = 2  Unless one of either Love or Kyrie were only 1; but I feel like at that point both of them were fairly established stars."
The Cavs are a super team lmao. Just because the warriors blew them out the water with a better super team doesn't mean the Cavs weren't. These lebron stans are lunatics. If the warriors didn't have Durant. The Cavs would most likely have won back to back rings with there super team. Lebron went to Cavs with Kevin love to create a super team. Just how boston did back in the day.
Kyrie and Kevin Love are are a combined 4x all nba   that's okay..
"Also 2016 Cavs. One superstar (Lebron), one perennial all-nba guy (Kevin love), one perennial all-star (kyrie)."
"i literally cant cuz they all fucking suck. thats the point of these lists. they're clickbait to draw views.  this list says ibaka was a top 20 player. no one except for the biggest thunder homers have ever called ibaka a top 20 player. russ was not considered a top 5 player. the only time russ has ever been in the top 5 convo was in kd's last year in okc, and his triple double year.   no one was putting kevin love over howard, curry, and harden back then lmaoo. even blake and aldridge were widely considered better than love. love was at best a borderline top 10 guy. not much higher than that"
"&gt; No, he was not. This is revionist history to try to act like Kevin Love was a superstar before LeBron snagged him to form some sort of superteam but then ruined him/gave him depression  You're the one revising history. He was considered Top 10 by many based on not only the eye test but also through analytics.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2014.html  He was 4th in WS/48 behind KD/CP3/LeBron among all the other candidates right before he joined Cleveland so the notion he wasn't playing ""winning basketball"" is bogus."
"&gt;Kevin Love was considered a Top 10 player  No, he was not. This is revionist history to try to act like Kevin Love was a superstar before LeBron snagged him to form some sort of superteam but then ruined him/gave him depression...  When there were at least 10 players better than him. Hell, Blake, Aldridge and old Tim Duncan were better PFs were him in the early 2010s. He put up good stats but was a defensive liability, his post up game wasn't leading to winning basketball and didn't even make the playoffs before LeBron. Neither did Kyrie."
Oh interesting. I did not know kevin love was considered a top 10 player back then. I’m a casual sorry about that 😅.
Kevin Love was considered a Top 10 player before he teamed up with LeBron &amp; Kyrie was an All-Star so yeah.
Technically the Cavs were but with how Kevin Love played its hard to consider him part of that
Not cavs because Kevin Love wasn't even close to playing like an all-star in 2016. Warriors are right on the cusp of being a superteam but I still wouldn't call them one until KD showed up.
"The Cavaliers were not a superteam, they were just a very good team. Kevin Love did not play remotely close to even an All-Star level in the playoffs. The man averaged 8.5 PPG in the 2016 Finals."
"Racist or not, I don’t understand how some people can be ok with people spamming Yuta’s insta and essentially bullying. It’s so hypocritical to commend Kevin Love and the like for speaking out about mental health and then condone bullying and brigading a player for playing defense"
"At the same time brigading his insta on unrelated posts and clowning for it, even if you’re not racist, is supremely shitty. This sub loves to commend Kevin Love and the like for speaking about mental health but still condones essentially what is bullying Yuta for playing defense."
So he’s basically nothing like kevin love lmao
Way better than Kevin Love.
"Actually I don’t respect him for that whole going for Westbrook’s knees thing from years ago. Just like I will never respect Kelly Olynick for Kevin Love   Goin for someone’s knees is the sports equivalent to kid touching for me. If you do it even one time, I don’t care about your excuse and there is no forgiveness or respect on my end for you till the end of time. Don’t give a fuck if you go on to cure cancer tbh 🤷🏼‍♂️"
Kevin Love?
Fat Kevin Love with out the scoring volume
Young Kevin Love?
I mean Lebron gave Kevin Love depression
"That is not stacked  Stacked is  MVP LeBron James  FMVP Dwyane Wade  AllNBA Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  ALL NBA Kevin Love  Kyrie Irving  Tristan Thompson  Jr Smith  Kyle Korver  MVP AND DPOY CANDIDATE /ALLNBA Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Rajon Rondo  KCP  Former DPOY Marc Gasol  6MOY CAN DENNIS  6MOY MONTREZL  Caruso  Etc  Vs   Patrick Bev, EG, Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson... lol. LeBron has been loaded with HOF on his team."
easily better than any Ja dunk unless Ja made the kevin love poster. Ja's only comparable dunk was on baynes but even that was less contact
For sure. If Ja didnt miss that one on Kevin Love last year that would be up there too
Kevin love retired years ago
LOL. You're making it as if we want to keep them. No one wants Love and Drummond. NO ONE. We've been trying to trade Kevin Love for 3 years-.
I think Cavs fans care that Kevin Love is taking up all their cap space but never plays...? No one forced him to re-sign after Bron and Kyrie left.
"Kevin Love is just stealing at this point, out 28+ games with a calf strain?"
Where’s Kevin Love? Will he played again this season given the team’s trajectory?
"In 2016, Kevin love and Kyrie didn’t make the all star team. Does that mean the cavs were never a super team?"
Kevin Love
Might i interest you in one Andre Drummond? He comes equipped with a shiny Kevin Love.
"Because he wants to.  According to Tom Haberstroh, LeBron stopped taking most technical free throws [after getting laughed at for missing one](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents19409872/fifteen-feet-trouble) in a game against Charlotte in December 2016.  &gt; There are better options available to the Cavs -- like, for example, four-time All-Star Kevin Love, a career 82 percent free throw shooter. &gt;  &gt; But this is alpha dog territory, and James has flexed his superstar status in moments like this before. Consider the 2010-11 Heat, which many consider the most alpha dog team ever. That season James, a career 74 percent free throw shooter at the time, shot 15 T's, while Dwyane Wade (77 percent) took one and Chris Bosh (80 percent) took zero. James made just 10 of the 15. &gt;  &gt; Hornets fans should be delighted to see James at the line. When he shoots technical free throws, his accuracy gets markedly worse. In fact, among the 104 shooters since 1996 with at least 100 technical attempts to their name, James ranks as the worst, converting just 67 percent of his 248 tries, per NylonCalculus.com tracking. &gt;  &gt; Even still, Love does what so many of James' teammates have done before: He steps aside and lets James take a crack at it. The referee passes LeBron the ball, and he begins his elaborate routine. He places the ball on his left hip and blows into his right fist as if to reignite a dimming ember. Then he lines up his toes on the line, dribbles three times, spins the ball in his left hand, steps backward with his left foot, rocks back, rocks forward, plants his left foot back on the line. He bends his knees. He looks up at the rim. He shoots. &gt;  &gt; The shot falls short, bouncing off the front rim with a thud, the ball plopping right in front of James. He slaps it away while the Charlotte crowd collectively cheers and laughs at him. Few things electrify a crowd like an opposing star's missed technical free throw. &gt;  &gt; James seems oddly rattled at the line this night. Earlier, in the first quarter, he had actually tripped in the middle of his free throw routine during that same unorthodox step-back, planting his foot too early and knocking himself off balance. &gt;  &gt; Which helps to explain why James, in this moment, is visibly frustrated. This is his seventh technical free throw of the season, almost halfway to his career average of 18 per season -- and this one apparently cuts deep. No one knows it at the time, but with 50 games remaining, it will mark the last technical free throw that James will take in the 2016-17 season. &gt;  &gt; James, like never before, has given up."
"It certainly will still be negative. Even guys like Wiggins and Harris who are making less and are playing well are still very well are negative contracts. John wall is the 4th highest player in the league and has 2 more years left. Not to mention he plays point guard, the most saturated position in the league. Most tanking teams already have their future PG and most contenders don’t have $40M in useless expiring contracts to even make a trade work, let alone hamstring any cap flexibility for 2 years.  The annual candidate to make a trade like that would be the Knicks but they’re not even making dumb moves like that. Only teams that will take Wall would do so for draft compensation. Look no further than Kevin Love who is making 25% less than Wall and still can’t get any takers."
"Kevin Love's article about having a panic attack really hit home to me and I'm glad athletes like him, DeRozan, and others use their platform to destigmatize conversations about mental health in general.   I've had one panic attack in my life ~5 years ago when I was living in NYC. Was commuting home for the day after going to the gym, and it came out of fucking nowhere. I literally thought I was having a heart attack and was going to die. I asked complete strangers in a crowded subway car to tell my family that I love them."
Kyrie not being there is a bigger deal than Love. Kevin Love was never good against the Warriors until like 2018 where he was the second option. And he was just OK in that series
But what defence though. Curry could of probably got the lay up or midrange but Kevin Love was so desperate to block the 3. Arguably the greatest finals series of all time.
Kevin Love gotta be #2
Kevin Love said it on road trippin just a few weeks ago
Kevin  Love
"I agree with your fan understanding of the game point. I am personally entertained by the announcers(i love Kevin harlan), but id love it even more if they would do more of what Tony romos doing in broadcasting."
Looks like short kevin love
Kevin Love has done it in every game this season
Bruh people just last year were saying Lebron hates white coaches and gave Kevin Love depression
big man &gt; outlet pass to guard (westbrook in this case) &gt; bucket  you don't necessarily need the big man to run in transition. See Kevin Love &gt; Lebron/kyrie
Or kevin love or drummond lol
except in the finals against kevin love or against toronto
"I’m surprised to see that Kevin Love has a higher chance to get in than Kyrie (and Kawhi, for that matter)."
"How the hell does Kevin Love have a higher chance than Klay, Kyrie, and Rondo??"
This is the sub that said Lebron gave Kevin Love mental health problems
"Fair statement of course. Though I don’t think Ig and Draymond gave you a ton offensively outside of their IQ/ball movement, my comment was just in regards to pointing out that Cavs had pretty potent offensive weapons at the time as well. Nobody is shading off Kyrie and Kevin Love per se"
"Lol LeBron averaged 34/12/9 on 63.0% TS in the 2017 Finals and 34/9/10 on 62% TS in 2018. Cleveland's second best offensive player in the 2018 Finals was Kevin ""53.5% TS"" Love and his third was fucking JR Smith. Kevin Durant had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.   LeBron's performances were infinitely more impressive, especially when you consider the colossal gulf between Cleveland and Golden State's defenses. It's not even close."
Same could be said for Kyrie and Kevin Love? Or any supporting players that are good. I think extrapolating the comparison between to players out to other players is a never ending argument.
"Easy to do when you have the Steph Curry and Klay Thompson surrounding you instead of Kyrie Irving and Kevin ""39% from the field in 2017 and 32% from three in 2018"" Love"
Jeff Green could average 35 being defended by kevin love
"When you have three hall of fame team mates and lebron has a washed ass Kevin love and Jr Smith as his two best players, no shit."
Kevin Love game winner like 10 years ago against the Clippers
Where the fuck is Kevin Love right now?
"I love how Michael Malone gave Bol Bol his first real minutes of the year against Kevin Durant. Then he played him against Oubre the next game so he doesn't look like a complete dunce.  But nah giving a little run out to see if he is capable of shading this tall fucker that can't dribble or drive, only shoot 3s, that's asking for way too much.   Well I don't love it, it was some of the dumbest shit I've seen all year."
"This looks a lot like the shot he was trying to get off on Kevin Love in the Finals.  I like to think of that finals sequence as The Block, The 3 and The D."
"Yeah a lot people insist on a player's prime having to come at ages 26-30. Some peak earlier, some later, and the length of each prime is different. Maybe Zion will have more tools at that age, but will he be just as athletic and truly at his absolute best? Not saying it can't happen, but it's definitely not set in stone. Blake Griffin is a good example for this. Sure he got better at shooting and passing as he got older but I am still taking his rawer, younger version any day. Dwight, T-Mac, Gilbert Arenas, Kevin Love, Deron Williams come to mind as well."
"Who on the cavs was better than pippen when he left? Dwade was not better than pippen when he left Miami. And unless you telling me Kevin love is better than pippen idk what you’re trying to say about 2018. And regardless of all that it’s not the only factor in whether or not you stay on a team.   The overall situation has to be ideal which is more than just one teammate. It means things like location, teammates(not just one), front office, and just overall preference for where you want to leave your legacy. It has nothing to do with loyalty to a team they didn’t even have the choice of being a part of for the sake of satisfying an angry minority of fans. Because ultimately they will gain the fan base of whatever team they join and if they have more success they will gain fans outside of that. So there’s no real consequence to leaving except for the opinions of the few of won’t like it but that will always exist."
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
Kevin love was not a good third option
"I alway hate the “1-9 without pippen” Lebron had prime Dwade, Kyrie, AD. With great 3rd options in bosh and skinny Kevin love. D Wade won a championship as a first option while pippen had many championship caliber team and still came up short. Lebron still lost to dirk in the finals with prime healthy Wade"
"Yet you said warriors should have gave up Klay for Kevin Love who was basically a non-factor in all of the finals the cavs played lmao, godspeed."
"No, Warriors had the opportunity to trade Klay to the Wolves for Kevin Love and passed. Believed that they could develop their drafted talent and it paid off. Clearly Miami believes in their guys"
Lebron joined a Cavs team with Wiggins and sent him out immediately for Kevin Love. What stopped him from developing Wiggins into a Pippin like role? Jordan helped groom Scottie. Stars today don't wait around for young co-stars to develop either.
Hops doesn't have much to do with rebounds. Look at Kevin love and Reggie Evans.
"I like big statlines but if they come in a losing effort 50% of the time its not as impressive to me, like you could ship any of the top 10 guys to the worst team in the league and they would put up enormous numbers ala the kevin love in early Minnesota days"
"I love the little references to conversations verno  throws out sometimes, like the Kevin O’Cannabis after koc was talking about it the prior pod lmao"
"""Kevin Love that one time"" has entered the chat."
The Cavs were trying to compete. Gilbert said so both times. The first time he even promised to win a ring before Lebron. The second time he maxed Kevin Love.
That's not hate or felatio. The kid could not shake Kevin Love with his top 5 handles of all time. He is a great shooter.
He'll be forgotten but there's probably players better than him that will be forgotten. Dame might be one. PG13 maybe. Kevin Love.
"I don't think I really agree. While it's certainly possible have both, the vast majority of dudes at the top do so with athletic prowess. Not to say it means dudes are dumb, but I think the vast majority of the top players in the league are of average mental capacity at best. In my experience, the greatest sports minds are often role players. Some notable exceptions off the top of my head are CJ McCollum, Kobe, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love, Mike Conley, and I'm sure there's more but again, I'd argue they're the exception, not the rule."
Our biggest drop off this season is that we've gone from having 5 elite players with 1 always injured to 4 elite players with 1 always injured.  1 core Celtic always has to be injured.  We pretty much need another elite player just to pay off whatever voodoo curse we seem to have. Maybe having Kevin Love sit on our bench will redirect the curse away from our other guys.
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
In his prime LMA had a legit argument as the best PF in the league but everyone kept praising Kevin Love
Also Kevin Love was from that area and if i remember correctly him and Klay played baseball together and were friends too.  I think it is unprecedented the amount of talent coming from downtown LA.
Kevin Love would be a bust
Kevin love in shambles
"The parent comment didn't say to ""lead the team to a chip,"" it was just ""help the team win a chip."" First and foremost, I'm not sure if anyone would say that an (at the time) young, rising top-10 player in Kevin Love being willing to join up with LeBron and Kyrie in Cleveland wasn't a strong influence in LeBron going back to Cleveland. If that doesn't happen, where's the ring coming from?  Besides that, yes, Love wasn't good in the finals. He wasn't even on the floor half the time. TT definitely came up big and deserved to get paid. Love was more like the 4th or even 5th best Cavs player behind JR. But it's not like Love did nothing at all - being the 5th best player in a finals series is still helping the team win. Being a real 3-point threat on the floor as a big is still helping the team win. Locking down one of the greatest offensive players of all time and getting a stop to prevent a game-tying 3 with less than a minute left in Game 7 of the NBA finals is helping the team win. Not to mention he was a rock-solid third option in the playoffs leading up to the finals, averaging an efficient 17/10. I know, it's just the Eastern Conference, but my team sure hasn't been able to get out of it.  As someone who hated those Cavs teams for continuing LeBron's reign of steamrolling through the East every year, it's kind of crazy to me to see Cavs fans completely discredit an integral part of their organization's success like this. I get that Love is making 30M now while not even staying on the floor, but a ring is a ring, and the Cavs certainly wouldn't be winning one right now even if he and his contract weren't on the team at all."
a successful one: kevin love connects with bron vs the wizards. left beals hot ass girlfriend a gasp.
"mike breen, stacey, kevin harlan, i still love current hubie, richard jefferson, hum diddly dee from charlotte, raptors guy from the east coast. in that order."
That was a Cavs Kevin Love level pass.
Kevin Love literally exists
Jabari Parker probably. Kevin Love is on a really bad streak right now though. I love Bagley and Isaac but I’m scared that they could turn out like Jabari as well  Edit- can’t believe I forgot Chandler Parsons too
"Some famously injury prone players would be Blake, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, AD, Cousins and Kristaps. Some others would be Bagley, Kevin Love, Marcus Smart, Gallinari, and Aaron Gordon."
Did kevin love play against them too? i know he's a UCLA guy and he's like 32. It says he's from Santa monica too.   (not from cali so don't kill me if santa monica is nowhere near LA)
Kevin Love
Wasn't Clay thompson and Kevin Love in the same little league as well?
Russ then went to UCLA and dormed with Kevin Love. Would be interesting to see how that group went to college and what other nba players they crossed paths with.
He was pretty good in For The Love of the Game also. It was interesting seeing him act with Kevin Costner.
rip in pieces Kevin Love
"No he has 1 30 and 30 game.  Like Corey Brewer had one 51 point game, are we gonna pretend he was a dominant wing on that timberwolves team?  What is says about Sexton now is he’s better than Kevin Love right now.  I never once said he was better than Love in Minnesota or he has more accolades, right now he’s better than Kevin Love."
"His defense won them the game 😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Not Kyrie’s shot and Lebron’s block. Not Lebron triple double, Kyrie’s 26.  It was all Kevin Love😂😂😂.  If Colin spent 4 years with Lebron he would get multiple all star appearances as well.  If they happen to win a ring well then his one will equal Kevin loves.     None of these hypotheticals make Kevin a better player right now"
"It doesn’t matter if he passes it or doesn’t.  Because no one is saying who had a better career, they’re saying who is better right now.   And love got a ring for being in the right place at the right time, he didn’t lead a team.  He was the sidekick to the sidekick.   When you say something that doesn’t make sense you change the argument to find a way you can win.   Colin Sexton is better than Kevin Love. And he certainly has more heart"
"Kevin love isn’t averaging 18 and 10 for one. And two, he’s a scorer, he averages more than 20.  He’s on pace to be an elite scorer in this league, and he right now is better than Kevin Love."
How many other SG’s are you so worried about their assist numbers.  No one ever brings up Klay Thompson’s assist numbers as a reason to talk down on him.  Sexton is a better player than Kevin Love right now.  Kevin Love has not lived up to a $30 million dollar a year contract
Right now Sexton is a much better player than Kevin Love.  Whether he should have more assists or not he’s still a better player than Kevin Love.
Kevin Love grew up with Klay too I think
David Lee was as much of an all-star the same way Kevin Love was an all-star in 2018
"One, no he’s not averaging a double double.  He’s not a better player than Sexton right now.  Comparing rebounds between guards and bigs doesn’t make any sense.  Sexton right now, in 2021, is a better player than Kevin Love"
"5 time all star means nothing because Sexton is better right now. Kevin love hasn’t been an all star for over 3 seasons, Sexton is in his third season.  Since he’s been in the NBA he’s a better player than Kevin Love.  Right now he’s better than Kevin Love. Kevin love is not worth his contract"
And he hasn’t lived up the contract.  Sexton is much better than Kevin Love
Kevin love was also little league teammates with klay and played against harden with Southern California all stars
"&gt;22 million dollar Kevin Love's per game stats in the 2016 NBA Finals was 8.5/6.8/1.3 on .468 TS%.  Holy shit I thought that was a typo and you meant 18.5 ppg. That's ridiculous, surprised he doesn't get more backlash for that. That's worse than Harrison Barnes in the same series where everyone thought he shit the bed.  Can't really say K Love helped them win a championship, yes he was better earlier on in the playoffs but Kyrie and LeBron carried the load."
I wonder how they would have fared against Eric Gordon and Derrick Rose's AAU team. (Kevin Love might have spent time on that team too).
"Wolves fans have been telling themselves that for over 10 years and it probably is not true.  When the wolves hit on the right guys, they develop fine.  Kevin Love, Lavine (he was killing it before tearing his ACL) and KAT for example.  They just draft a ton of duds, simple as that.  Theres no evidence Curry wouldn't have killed it in MN .  Imagine Kevin Love firing outlet passes to Curry"
"Damn, was it that bad? I remember not thinking too much about Kevin Love during that series but shit          And people talk about the job that Gary Payton did on Michael Jordan in the 96 finals but Scottie Pippen was pretty fucking bad that series"
Kevin Love is awful ~~in the playoffs~~ in general.
Kevin Love is awful in the playoffs in general.
Colin Sexton right now is a better player than Kevin Love.
None of that has anything to do with the extension since 2018.  Which is the topic of conversation.  Since Sexton has been in the NBA he’s been a much much much better player than Kevin Love
Didn’t Kevin Love only average 8 points in the 2016 Finals??
Kevin Love looks like the kind of guy you expect to be a power bottom. Elegant and calm yet slightly aggressive.
Hot Take: Kevin Love defended the hell out of Steph on that last shot... he's ultimately responsible for the Cavs ring.
Yeah my thoughts exactly. Flipping Demar Derozan for Kawhi is an unreal basketball move. Signing Kevin love to this $120 million dollar contract only for him to severely underperform and rarely play is most certainly not a winning basketball move. They aren’t even remotely comparable decisions
"Considering he led them to the finals after they basically blew up the entire team at the trade deadline and Kevin Love missed most of the season, yes, yes I do."
"No. For the simple reason that Paul could have done the same.   New Orleans Paul playing with LeBron + Love and then LAC Paul playing with Durant + Harden is very likely winning a couple of rings as well.  As a comparison, Kevin Garnett has fewer rings than Bosh, but KG would have massacred the league if he had Bosh's teammates."
"yeah i'm with, you, i mean his uncle is Mike Love from The Beach Boys who is regarded as being the shittiest member of the band, I always just kind of assumed Kevin is probably an asshole too lol"
"I can also provide examples of players who peak younger than that. Kevin Love, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Rajon Rondo.  You can say guys get injured but that doesn't allow you to dismiss them from the data set, that's a big part of why they fall off."
"Sexton needs to sit down, Kevin Love helped break the curse in Cleveland, mans a god damn legend. Sexton would need to bring two rings to Cleveland to even be close to Kevin’s level of Cleveland love."
Warriors only ring was against lebron and some bums. Kyrie and kevin love were both out.
was the origin of that Kevin Love? that's kinda hilarious to look back on that people actually said that dumb shit. you can't give someone else depression I mean I guess maybe if you're bullying and tormenting them every day but otherwise not really a thing
"I love it, fuck Kevin Love"
what the fuck? it’s not nit picking to say “your numbers are wrong” tf are you trying to gaslight anyone about kevin love stats for??
I don’t think a single cavs fan thought signing Kevin Love was a good idea. We were going to be terrible and Love was certainly not going to change that or help us rebuild. The cavs management is a total disaster and always has been. Lebron is the only reason we ever had anything to cheer about. He won a championship despite them.
I really liked early Kevin Love but he fell off so fast and I grew tired of his underperforming antics
"Regardless of who did this “like” from his family, this falls entirely on Collin as it’s representing his name as a Cleveland Cavalier basketball player and when this type of shit happens, it causes nothing BUT drama. Big or small doesn’t matter. The potential is there. If I was the coach or GM, I’d pull Collin aside immediately and tell him to either close his social media or run it himself and take on the true responsibility to its fullest.   Sexton is a hell of a baller and upcoming, but as a Cavs fan, I don’t want this silly immature shit swirling around the team. Too old for this type of drama.   Plus, blame Dan Gilbert for the contract as it was us who offered it to Love for some reason. (I love Kevin, but I wouldn’t have resigned him to that amount)"
Colin Sexton is not even in the same stratosphere as Kevin Love.
I honestly can’t tell you a single Kevin love highlight other than talking to my cousin about anxiety
"What team is gonna want a toxic guy like that?  Also, Kevin Love isn't allowed to make money?  Gtfo with this shit.  Young kids are just straight up highschool level bullys."
"I don't think Kevin Love stole anything. He happened to benefit from a deal.  Does he deserve it? No.  But if I didn't deserve 120 Mill for sub-superstar performance, would I take it? Of course."
Kevin Love played very poorly in the finals.
"Yeah I agree, I like Kevin Love as a player and a person, and I certainly won't rag on anyone for accepting $120 million. But for some reason it's really controversial to call him out for doing stupid stuff on the court. Like who purposely turns the ball over cause he didn't have the opportunity to post up Tobias Harris?  I remember Rondo intentionally getting that 8 sec violation during his short Mavs stint and getting shit on for it - and rightfully so. Not sure how that stuff helps anyone except the opposing team."
"I mean, if he was on our formerly D3 college team then yeah sure. But are we acting like this isn’t the NBA? What did Kevin Love do exactly? Get mad over a missed easy bucket and then proceeds to sabotage the rest of the play? Like wtf"
Reddit when lebron says something about kevin love: HE GAVE HIM DEPRESSION   Reddit when someone else makes fun of kevin love: lol that's a good one
These are the same idiots that genuinely believed LeBron gave Kevin Love depression lmao
Why are we blaming Kevin Love when this is obviously Lebron’s fault?
"Didn't Dan Gilbert sign Kevin Love to an extension, because he wanted to compete. Everybody knew Kevin Love injuries were going to stack up once Lebron left."
" I think he would’ve meant in the sense Love just signed the contract then sat back and gave up on the team because we weren’t competitive.   Love also has more than once show displeasure with Sexton on the court and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was one of the voices behind the “he doesn’t know how to play basketball”  Ever since Love came back Sexton has been terrible, averaging 17 PPG on 34% shooting, down from 24 on 48%. I just think Sexton feels  he cant lead this team with a big voice in the looker room rooting against him.   Although I’m not fond of Kevin Love slander I do feel like he could’ve done more with this contract and wish he mentored the young ones a bit more"
"&gt;Love didn’t really appreciate being left with a bunch of kids  He could've been a professional and taken on a mentor role instead of bitching ever since the moment he got paid.  &gt; He should’ve been traded to a competing team long ago.   Nobody wants him with that contract.  &gt; Sucks to be a decent player who could compete on a rebuild tanking team.   Decent is generous, I'd rather have JaMychal Green today than Kevin Love. It's not 2009 anymore."
"Exactly, I have a hard time any player would actually be like ""I'm deciding between Boston and Cleveland.  Well, Cleveland gave Kevin Love that ridiculously large contract in 2019 so I think I'll go there"" that's probably very far down the list of deciding factors."
How dare Kevin love force the Cavs to pay him so much after he helped them win a championship. The audacity.
"Kevin Love also had one of the worst hair transplants in Cleveland, behind the one Lebron got. Don't athletes have access to better docs?"
FUCK KEVIN LOVE
"I mean, to be fair, they gave Kevin Love $120m so making good decisions probably isn't their strong suit."
Nice Kevin Love reference
"He's probably just roasting him, if Kevin Love were my friend I'd do the same thing for a laugh"
Kevin Love is an NBA champion. Kevin Love was part of one of the greatest NBA Finals of alltime. Colin Sexton isn’t a champion. Colin Sexton will be known for a singular moment in college.
"Cavs had a higher ORTG and DRTG with Jefferson compared to Love. And in case you forgot, 22 million dollar Kevin Love's per game stats in the 2016 NBA Finals was 8.5/6.8/1.3 on .468 TS%. That is objectively dogshit. I don't know why you fail to comprehend this."
"And I highly doubt Kevin love gives two fucks, as he shouldn’t"
"Good for him, he should repeat it in a press conference. Kevin Love took the money he knew he couldnt get anywhere else and asked out immediately."
"I just want love to get out of Cleveland, it would be better for both, and I don’t want to see Kevin rotting on the sidelines"
The shame of it all is if Kevin love really had wanted out he could’ve balled out and boosted his trade value. Now he’s stuck until two season from now when he can be bought out.
He needs to give Kevin Love a call.
The difference is even if Sexton is overpaid he’ll show up and try to live up to it. He’s improved every year of his career. Kevin Love since being paid hasn’t really done much of anything. Not his fault he got the contract offer but generally you expect a certain level of play (or really any play at all since he’s been MIA for 2 years).
"Whats up with the Kevin Love disrespect? Dude went to war with LeBron and brought Cleveland a chip. FoH Sexton. Put some time in, bro. Maybe make the playoffs."
Kevin Love absolutely quit on the team. He did it last year. It’s a shame he didn’t try and play to his potential because then he may have had a chance to be traded. He’s too expensive to buy out and he’s basically impossible to trade now.
"lol fucking thank you. I'm getting some harsh comments about how I'm taking these outlier actions by Kevin and making presumptions. and I just have to say, like, no, I think you can triangulate the kinda person he's being here pretty accurately. honestly I've been a K-Love fan since he's been in the league. but I do think it's fair to point out his failings here."
kevin love is busy starting companies about mental health he's not focused on basketball.
"dude your coach would've been like ""look mother fuckers that is NBA champion Kevin Love, you give him the ball on every possession, you kiss his ass if he asks you to so help me god, do not fuck this up for me this is a career opportunity"""
"Man I love kevin but this is just getting ridiculous, I mean trading is whatever dude just might want to hang it up at this point"
Kevin Love is nearly a 7ft tall center and CP3 is a foot shorter and weighs 75lbs less than him
"Seriously man, what happened to Kevin Love? Maybe its just me dramatizing what happened, but he was a superstar on Minnesota, and he seemingly just didn't do that anymore with the Cavs. Am I wrong? Genuine question."
"Sexton wasn't there when the Cavs won a chip, he has no idea what kevin love has contributed to that organization. With that being said, that's the shittiest contract in the NBA."
Kevin Love is probably thinking “Who is Collin Sexton?”
"One of them was Kevin Garnett, like he used to take and make a lot of long twos (like a step inside the 3pt line). Don't get me wrong I used to love watching KG and he was really great. But looking back at it now, I wonder how much better he would be if he exchanged those for legit 3s. I mean he is a step away for chrissakes"
Love don't cost a thing. Point Kevin?
You fuckin can't what? Kevin Love was borderline useless against the Warriors every year.
Dude Kevin love won’t do well on any team. He’s a grown man and knew what he signed up for re upping with the cavs. As if he was gonna turn down 4 yrs 120 mil after everyone saw how garbage he was in 2018 as a costar to lebron. He took the bag that never should’ve been given to him. No contender wants him cause he’s trash. Like i hate to be harsh but love throwing a bitch fit was just hilariously cringe. And then to try to embarrass a rookie by acting like a whiny bitch cause the rookie made a mistake. I don’t even like it when lebron does that poor body language crap but he’s lebron so he can do it. Kevin love doing it..? Lol. Someone needs to remind Kevin Colin Sexton is already better than him.
Sexton deserves every bit of shit that Kevin Love throws his way. It's insane that he'd even dare to call Kevin fucking Love a bad contract. He's a selfish idiot.
He was fools gold. Kevin love is the definition of empty stats.
Warriors should still be grateful for Kelly Oubre. He helped win them a title by injuring Kevin Love in 2014
"Miami's bench that time was solid! I like to think that NBA fans tend to quickly forget history like I've been seeing a lot of kobe slander lately, people have forgotten kevin love or some have forgotten that steph started the 3 point revolution but I'm really curious why people really can't forgive KD lol"
"I don't know the amount of credit Bob Myers deserves for GSW so far. He was hired in 2011 where they picked Thompson and Curry but so was Jerry West.   And we know how great of an impact West has, he was adamant about not trading Thompson for Kevin Love which proved invaluable. They got extremely lucky with the KD situation with salary cap increase.  Bob Myers got a lot of credit and he also took a lot of credit, interviews of him boasting how they were lightyears ahead of everyone else... Jerry West has shown time and time again he's a winning executive.    These next few years before Steph retires or the core of GSW dismantles will be interesting for Bob Myers legacy."
"I know right! Kevin Knox, Mo Bamba, DiVincenzo, and Grayson Allen. Great stuff. Love where this league is headed."
"LeBron with g-leaguers 😂😂  oh pls, they were way out of their league vs gsw, but the definition of g-leaguers is this warriors team. not george hill, kevin love, jr smith, jeff green, korver, clarkson. I’d kill to have ANY of them on our team over mfing Nico, Poole, JTA, Mulder, Wiseman, Oubrick."
The main thing is they were trading for Kevin love.  Which is a type of move the warriors should be looking into .  The Cavs had a sense of urgency with Lebron but it doesn't seem like GS does
"He's no Kevin Love on Steph, but it's not bad"
"It's pretty easy to find..  https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/24/kevin-love-tells-story-of-lebrons-message-to-the-cavaliers-during-2016-nba-finals-that-inspired-the-3-1-comeback/  https://www.fearthesword.com/platform/amp/2018/8/17/17715152/kevin-love-lebron-james-lakers-comments  https://cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/20/kevin-love-says-lebron-james-was-demanding-cavs/  And of course, how he felt about LeBron  https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2018/07/14/kevin-love-told-lebron-james-he-loved-him-after-move-to-lakers/"
Did Kevin Love say so
"To be fair, he puts his foot in his mouth a lot. See Kevin love anxiety situation"
"""What If"" is the stupidest way of thinking about this, especially with injuries.  ""What if"" KD and Klay didn't get hurt in the finals against Toronto? ""What if"" Kyrie and Kevin Love were there for the whole series in 2015?  ""What if"" Ray Allen was injured for game 6 in 2013?   This thread has really shocked me to find out how many people must actively watch and enjoy watching 1 seeds sweep 8 seeds in the first round. Like holy hell, can we have at least a shot at a little excitement in those seeds?"
"In my opinion, that has to be the greatest playoff run ever. I have never seen a collection of teammates seemingly conspire against their best player like that. I mean there is so much about that run already lost in history. George Hill, Clarkson, and Nance had straight up like complete dissociations with thousand yard stares all around. Rodney Hood had a nervous breakdown in the playoffs. TT had the whole kardashian drama that year and didn’t even play decent until the second round. Kevin Love got injured in the ECF. LeBron winning games with his next highest scorer being at like 12 pts. Scoring or assisting on nearly ever basket, etc. LeBron drug that Cavs squad kicking and screaming to the finals. There were games that Jeff Green and 36 yr old Korver were his 2nd and 3rd best players during that playoffs, and it wasn’t even their playmaking or shooting. They were just the only ones who looked like they cared on defense.   It’s funny now to see some of that squad’s careers play out. Like that playoffs forever has altered my opinion of Clarkson, George Hill, Hood, etc."
"In this theoretical world, the Mavs don't draft Luka by being bad. They draft him by paying the highest blind bid for his salary out of their remaining cap space. That means if they think he's a legit superstar, they have to pay him that from his rookie year by outbidding all the other teams. That bid counts against our cap space, thus hampers our ability to add free agents and top rookies in future years, so you can't afford to make a mistake and overpay a bust or you will set your franchise back. The Mavs essentially wouldn't have cap space now if Luka was paid fair market value.   If the Kings pay Marvin Bagley $20M a year and he's a bust, welp, tough beans. That's what you get for poor decisions and messing up your cap space for years to come. Fortunately rookie contracts have some early out clauses.  Right now teams can build superteams simply by stocking up on picks by being bad for years, then make a free agent signing before their rookie deals are done. If Cleveland had to pay Kyrie, Wiggins and Bennett market value in the post-LeBron years, it would have been harder to add LeBron back and then trade your now higher salaried players for Kevin Love.  So in this theoretical world your choice is a.) pay stars or b.) pay draft talent you think will be stars. Small market teams who can't attract stars can use cap space on rookies who may become stars instead of scrounging for the best free agents they can get.   In this scenario, nobody is ever incentivized to tank. You are incentivized to manage contracts, make smart draft and trade decisions so you don't overcommit to a non-competitive team."
Kevin Love also said he was the most talented player on the roster.
"Not true. Warriors still had  2 possesions left in that game.  The next possession was Lebrons What-If dunk on draymond.  Come on, nephew, this has been well documented and beaten to death.   Stephs been on record saying he [wished](https://syndication-bleacherreport-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2839462-look-kevin-love-responds-to-steph-currys-comments-on-2016-nba-finals-defense.amp.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16173765870390&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) he would have done the blow by and went for the quick 2."
Bam's so good he makes Kevin Love guarding Steph on that one possession look like Kevin Love all the other times he's guarded Steph
"Hey, if Kevin love can do it, I don’t see why Bam shouldn’t."
Dude looking like prime Kevin Love right there damn
How come bigs play great on-ball defense against curry during last seconds of the game? I remember this also happened in 2016 with kevin love defending him
Rumors said Dan Gilbert had a stroke when he saw Kevin Love play after giving him that 4yr 120mil extension.
[Serious] Did Colin Sexton give Kevin Love depression?
"No he wasn't.  He was disappointing because of his attitude, but he could play.  He put up 19 ppg in his first year in Minnesota,  but as Kevin love emerged as the franchise player, Beasley took a back seat and it became clear he wasn't a good fit (nor did he want to be) playing with Love"
Kevin love esque
Kevin Love Adebayo
"Goddamn, I love me some Kevin Harlan."
Dude is looking Kevin Love Esque out there
Casuals forgetting Kevin Love did that in a game 7 nba finals against Curry smh
"By your logic, Kevin Love is the goat since he shut down Curry in a pivotal game 7 nba finals and Curry bricked the 3 pointer."
Kevin Love is somewhere smiling
Almost worthy of being compared to Kevin Love
"Bam with the lockdown, 2016 NBA Finals Game 7 Kevin Love type of defence to seal the win. Love to see it. Bam is such a special player, gets it done on both ends of the floor."
"[wolves did it with Kevin Love, Pekovic, Ridnour, AK47, and some guy named Shved](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/14wlyq/allwhite_starting_five_for_minnesota_timberwolves/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)"
the most shocking thing here is that kevin love is playing
WTH Kevin Love is playing?
&gt;Love  &gt;back  Breaking: Kevin Love hurt again
Thats like picking Kevin Love over Shaq because he shoots better. Zion is just way more dominant. KAT is soft as fuck.
KAT is Kevin Love 2.0. Zion is a force of nature and true alpha.
We blame Kevin Love somehow.  And then blame LeBron for his depression.
"I always preferred the Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Ramon Sessions last name combo."
"It is Zeke. See my comments to someone asking why. As far as Harden is concerned, he plays a bastardized style of basketball. He plays for the foul, not the shot. Kevin Love got to Cleveland and paid for the type around him on an awful Wolves team. If we’re going to get bucket getters who take bad shots let’s add AI, Dave Bing, George Gervin, and gasp! Kobe."
"Breh. Isiah Thomas better be the Celtics one and not Zeke. Harden on here is fucking insane he's actually under rated. Jermaine O'Neal was a complete baller. And, who even rates Kevin Love this highly. The list should involve Carmelo Anthony, but I see your flair lmao."
Who overrating Kevin love lmao
"Love had those numbers in a bad team. So the comparison doesn't match. Cavs had a bad version of Kevin Love and in 2018 he was absolutely awful.  But hey, AD and Kyrie had super numbers with Lebron so whoever is underrating them is plain wrong."
"people act like kevin love wasnt a 25-12-5 guy when he left minny, too"
A lot of people will. The debate between a guy like Blake vs someone like Amare Stoudemire or Kevin Love will come down to who has a ring for a lot of people.
"I love Rondo but if that's considered a HOF resume, that's a low bar. Kevin Johnson isn't in the Hall and arguably has better individual accolades."
"Ohh like Dwayne wade, kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Kevin love, Chris Bosh?"
"So basically, and let me see if I'm reading this correctly, if the Thunder had Kevin Love scoring 8.5 points per game on 47% TS, they could have won that series?"
Cavs had Kevin Love. A multi time All Star and All NBA player. Just because he had a bad series does not make him a nobody
"&gt; They ran the offense through Tony Parker by 2007  This became true a couple years later but Duncan averaged more points during the regular season and playoffs in 2007. Parker (and Ginobili for that matter) were still very good to fringe all star level players at that point in time, whereas Duncan was still a first team All-NBA type player.  &gt; How is Duncan putting up the same numbers as Kevin Love on the Cavs ""the guy"".  Different era, different scoring averages, different styles of offense, different pace. Also just not true, Duncan averaged 20 points per game 8/9 times from 1999 to 2007, Love never averaged 20 a game in Cleveland and only averaged more than 18 a game once.   &gt; Even when the Spurs had near the best record in the league Tim Duncan wasn't getting any MVP votes from 2005 onwards.  Just factually incorrect, he finished fourth in 2005 and 2007.  &gt; It's like saying Rudy Gobert is the only reason the Jazz are good.  &gt; This year's Jazz is like the closest comparison to those Spurs teams  lol"
"Not really. They ran the offense through Tony Parker by 2007. How is Duncan putting up the same numbers as Kevin Love on the Cavs ""the guy"".

lol... I love how everyone ignores the racist angle too.   How do you think this plays out if Gordon Hayward DMs Kevin Hart with some “you dark ashy cum guzzling bitch”?
"Russell has 85 mil guaranteed and is averaging a triple double this season.John Wall is also guaranteed 85 and is considerably worse. Kevin love has 91 guaranteed, Tobias Harris has 148.   His shot selection is the same as its ever been and his attempts per game are actually down.  I don't watch the Wizards let's be honest most people don't, but I've watched a lot of Rockets games and I watched every Thunder game of the PG/Melo/Russ season. I'm familiar with Russ's playstyle and would take him on the celtics in a heartbeat."
Kevin Love has been a bum recently while Sexton has been grinding
Cavs giving Kevin Love a 4 year $120 Mil contract when Lebron left. It made no sense then and it damn sure doesn’t make sense now.
"It wasn't even a stretch tbh. Ford and Givony had him that high. Besides, people knew that OKC was going to take fit not BPA. Seattle/OKC was already invested in Jeff Green, they weren't going to take Kevin Love. SEA/OKC was always going to take a guard at that spot. So the only question was whether they would take Bayless or Westbrook. But if you were paying attention in March and at the combine, that was never a choice. Rose and Curry were the only other guards besides Westbrook that were getting people talking (Curry didn't declare)."
"Harden was absolutely not considered a reach. He was a consensus top 5 pick. Most expected him to be top 3 or 4 depending on how high you were on Rubio. I remember because I was writing on realgm suggesting for the Raptors to trade up for him. Here's Chad Ford mocking him to go top 3/4.  https://www.espn.com/nba/draft2009/columns/story?columnist=ford_chad&amp;page=MockDraft-090519  Westbrook wasn't a reach either. He shot up during the predraft process. I remember people hyping up his physicals as being better than Rose. Going into the draft, he was a consensus top 5 pick. OKC already had Jeff Green who had a decent rookie season so nobody expected them to pick Kevin Love even though Love was the star on UCLA. The only other guards that were hyped was Bayless and Augustin but Westbrook's physicals and combine blew them away."
"I don't know man his last year of college he was 3rd on the team in points/game and 1st in assists, and that was playing with a Kevin Love squad who made it to the Final Four."
"^^^ Kevin Durant is the realest dude in the NBA for better or for worse. There’s this expectation that athletes should act “professional”. Would be annoying asf imo. KD the only one that just says or does whatever tf he wants without caring what everybody else thinks about him.   And on that point, people love to say that KD cares so much about what everybody thinks. But, if I really did care, then why would I keep responding to mfs on the internet when that clearly has a negative impact on people’s perception of me."
"Fun fact, the Minnesota Timberwolves best PPG season is 26.1 by Kevin Love, Towns would have beaten that in the 19-20 season but he didn’t nearly play enough games to qualify"
"I don’t care how wrong it is, I will always love Kevin Durant for leaving Oklahoma (I’m a Sonics fan) and now he’s my favorite player of all-time because I think Michael rapaport is an insufferable prick."
"This is it.  I'll always love KD's game and I'm actually more sympathetic than most to the fact that he's ultra-sensitive (ppl are born that way imo, yes you can work at it, but let's not pretend we're equal... ALL of us know a dude who was unflappable since they could walk - KD seems at the opposite end of that spectrum)  But damn dude, I wish for his own sake he would just ignore these fuckers. Your Kevin Fuckin Durant...  Rappaport is an amusing clown at best. Ignore him.  Then again, I'm also not all hOlY sHiT cAn U bElIvE tHiS!!11! about this dustup, like everyone else seems to be. KD has literally gotten into twitter feuds with high school trolls. This doesn't seem all that crazy to me."
"I mean Wiggins and Bennett allowed them to get Kevin Love, which lead to a title in 2016. Their other 2 #1 picks (in the past 20 years) got them Lebron James and Kyrie Irving. Nephews on some weird shit atm"
"Fuck Michael Rapaport, that is all.  Fuck kind of man with a family gonna talk shit online about another man, but when it gets spicy, he gonna post DMs on some bitchmade shit.  ""Look what Kevin Durant said to me.""  :PacSpit:  Rapaport ain't good in these streets, I be in NYC constantly, somebody need to give him a love tap.  This shit better be fake."
"Do you think he was a better rebounder than Rodman, fat Kevin love, or Drummond?"
"Cavs would be mega dumb to first give a depleted Kevin Love a max in 2018, then to trade for max contract Andre Drummond as a lottery team, then finally to buy both of them out."
"Not disrespecting Harden whatsoever, but if you compare the 2 teams... there’s a huge difference in having as your 2nd best player Chris Paul instead of Kevin Love (who was terrible that season). I’d prefer having guys like PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela over JR Smith, George Hill and Tristan Thompson any day of the week"
Kevin Love: Malibu  Westbrook: Clippers   John Wall: Glue Factory  Al Horford:  Lakers/Warriors/Heat
Kevin Love- Timberwolves  John Wall- Wizards   Al Horford- retires and takes up crocheting  Russell Westbrook- Thunder
My hot take for that series is that the the Cavs were better off without Kevin Love. They were able to give TT and Mozgov more minutes which counteracted the Warriors small ball lineup. Love would’ve been better served coming off the bench for Cleveland in that series but due to his star-status if he would’ve started. The Warriors were a horrible matchup for Love.
&gt;Thankfully his game isn’t based on his athleticism  All that running around he does to get open isn't athleticism? Neither is his lateral speed on defense? The jumping in his shooting motion?  Klay isn't the Kevin Love post up in the corner and wait to get open type of guy. Klay uses his athleticism to get open.
Fat Kevin Love was something else. Superstar level production (despite the lack of Ws). Sexy skinny beardy Kevin Love ain't putting up 30-30 games.
"Kevin Love really stuffed the stat sheet, but he did so in a way that was just a “better version” than traditional bigs. It’s also important to note that prime Love wasn’t raining threes and competing with the skill set of current Love. Jokic is significantly more unique than  Love because of how he generates offence for his team and his passing ability. This uniqueness is why I give the edge to Jokic, but it depends on how you value each skill set"
"Depends on who holds it. A team looking for a long term star would probably never do it.  Cavs got Kevin Love for the first pick, back when he looked like a number 1-2 option and was a full on star of his own.   So, whoever holds the #1 pick would have to be a team planning to contend immediately, otherwise it's hard to argue against 8 years of a team controlled star."
"The crazy part is they could have been off the contract but ever since they wanted a package for Kevin love, champion, all star. Not ok we’ll take him and save you some money."
"You know who owns all those jackets? That’s right, Kevin Love bought them all with his ill gotten gains just to make a point that he is the Fleece Phantom."
"Lebron won his first ring with bosh and dwade against a young okc, kawhi won his first ring with a elite spurs team and then his second ring against a warriors team without durant and then klay, and curry won his first ring against lebron with no kyrie or kevin love."
"the problem wasn't him, he had a better net rating than Kemba. the problem is the bums that everyone Ainge drafted and Kemba's contract thats only better than Wall's contract at the moment and Kevin Love and maybe westbrook"
Kevin love status
Kevin love 120 mill 4 years and has only play in 82 games in 3 seasons
"Not even close. Kyrie was gone after 2017, and in 2018, IT played only 15 games for the Cavs and Wade (11 ppg) went back to Miami before the 2018 playoffs. LeBron had only Kevin Love in the 2018 Playoffs."
It’s because a lot of Lakers/Lebrun fans will create any sort of marketable to make it seem like Lebrons facing the Monstars in the finals.   A 53 year old Shaq could join the nets and these same people would be like ‘THIS IS SO UNFAIR! SUPERTEAM ALERT’   But a 28 y/o Kevin love will join Lebrun and average 19 and 11 and get called trash.    That’s just the way it goes.
"He literally had Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Isaiah Thomas, and Dwayne Wade all on that cabs team at some point. Just stop.   If that was KD and he got all those player yall would be crying about how a ‘super team’ is being formed just to beat lebron again regardless of how far out of their primes they are."
"Hey I'll give you that but LeBron chose Cleveland, Kyrie was already drafted there and Cleveland went out and got Kevin love to complete their team. Cleveland made that team possible and a situation LeBron would be interested in coming back to.  &gt;I'm not saying I have a solution, but it's been a consistent problem fans have harped about and I'm sure the NBA could find a solution if they actually cared.  And I just don't know what the solution could be, actually I do but it would involve lowering the salary cap for big markets lol.  Honestly big market bias has been an issue in every major team sport I've followed. There are just so many outside factors including but not limited to city life, marketability, and a big one: sponsorships. Sponsors pay more money to put their brand on Lakers gear than say Timberwolves gear, they pay more for players to advertise their brands in New York than in Utah. To me it's less of a NBA problem and more of a capitilist society/power problem. Dudes follow the money, we follow the bright lights, and as the game grows so do those things.  But hey, do you want to know the team with the highest winning percentage in the history of the NBA? Its the Spurs. There is still value in savvy organizational structure, but the NBA is also a copycat league.  A big move for us was picking up Sean Marks who was part of the Spurs organizational tree. He has given us the advantage of savvy front office with the benefits of being stationed in New York.  It's a tough problem to fix lol."
"holy shit, i forgot Kevin Love isn't retired"

"I mean its not the worst take. Most people have kd ranked higher tho. been elite for longer. More accomplishments- and was considered the go to guy when both were together. Its hard for curry to be as good just because of his size. Late playoff games are decided by iso ball. the game slows down plays break down and the only place to create space is the midrange. last 4 championships have been decided by midrange iso players. kawhi kd kd and lbj/davis. its harder to create space when you are small as you cant shoot over players. Also lebron stated that kd was his nemesis. Kerr stated that lbj kd and kawhi were better than curry in those years too. A two way wing is always gonna have more impact than a small pg. here are his words. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr isn't playing favorites, but he also isn't shy about naming the best player on his stacked title squad. Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
"What bad contracts are even out there anymore that a team would want to trade?  Wiggins? I don't think the Warriors are going to trade Wiggins into space - they probably want a decent player with matching salary back. They're already limited in salary as it is.  Westbrook? I highly doubt Washington does this and his contract wont be that bad. They're not unloading picks with westbrook, they'd rather keep him.  Wall? Houston has almost no assets to trade with Wall and I don't think Wall is a negative asset anymore - more of a neutral asset.  Kemba? Ainge won't give up Kemba+pick because of how Ainge is.  Tobi? He's actually playing his contract well this year.  Kevin Love? I don't think Cavs are that despo to trade him even though they want to move him."
"Unlike Gobert, Bill was the finals MVPs on those teams. So you can’t compare the two. Gobert has literally been benched in the playoffs because that improved Utah’s odds of winning those games. That would never happen to Russell.   Again regular season is pointless when talking about what it means for players legacies. Why do media heads go around looking like fools proclaiming the Utah Jazz as the team to beat when we all know they’re getting their ass wooped in the 2nd round? They spent so much time hyping up the raptors in 2018 for being the first seed and talking shit about Lebron and saying he doesnt want to win all year because he had a dogshit roster without kyrie and Kevin love underperforming and he wanted to add more pieces until he swept that overrated ass team without even trying. I’m not saying I’d take Westbrook over Mitchell and I’m not saying shaq is super well informed but his mentality is that he’s taking guys who have performed well in the playoffs over reg season sensations. Imo it doesn’t apply to Donovan vs Westbrook because Donovan actually performs really well in the playoffs but it’s the same reason why the media keeps gassing up Giannis (and Embiid this year) just to see them get their ass beat by players who know what the reg season is for."
Kevin Love out 4 to 6 weeks
"He leads the entire history of NBA in rebounding percentage so yes, it's not hyperbole at all. But the top 10 also consists the likes of Reggie Evans, Enes Kanter, Kevin Love so it's not the best defensive list."
"So we’re just gonna ignore the fact they only went there to play a with a prime lebron James, kyrie Irving and kevin love?"
The 2017 Cavs were the best version imo. Kevin Love seemed closest to Timberwolves KLove in the playoffs that year
How much do you think Kevin Love has played this year
"Plus, these are not situations like the Melo thing were he was out of the league for a long time and it even looked like he might retire. Blake and Aldridge have been active. Yeah they're not in the prime of their careers, but getting them that cheap is a total scam. With a team this stacked, with three fucking all stars, these two folks will have all the liberty to succeed in a role player role.  It's as if suddenly anyone could sign Kevin Love for $2mil he'd go from one of the worst assets in the league to one of the best."
"In fairness, that Warriors team that added Durant just lost the Finals, and who knows what would have happened in 2015 if Cleveland doesn't lose Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. They had a 2-1 lead and their 2nd best player was Matthew Dellavadova.   So maybe they needed KD?"
"The whole 2015 playoffs were a mess.   -Klay Thompson comes up small on offense in his first finals appearance. -Kyrie breaks his knee cap in game 1 of the finals.  -Clippers choke against the Rockets -Defending champ Spurs get eliminated on a Chris Paul game winner. -Noah and Gasol both get injured against the Cavs. -Cavs avoid going down 3-1 in the ECSF because the refs swallow their whistle when David Blatt calls a timeout he didn’t have.  -Kevin Love gets injured on a cheap shot from the Celtics in the first round.  -That Hawks team overachieves to the 1 seed and then gets smoked in the conference finals.  -Then the cherry on top, Steph Curry doesn’t win finals mvp despite checking all the boxes for finals mvp."
Kevin Love boys and girls
getting Kevin Love backing down CJ Miles PTSD
I’m pretty sure there’s been more than 98 players in NBA history that are better than Kevin Love
"lol right, as a fan i never thought any of those casey x derozan led teams were gonna make it out the east. lebron was just too much, even with a washed kevin love he made quick work of the raptors year after year. i was just more irritated with how we lost more than anything, it was beyond embarrassing and frustrating to watch. case is lucky to have a job in the league after all that, shouldn’t even be speaking on playoff basketball tbh."
When the Lakers actually took the lead and held it during Game 7 and Artest hit that 3  06/16/2010  Same feeling When Kevin Love was actually competent guarding Curry at the 3pt line as the game clock wound down in 4th quarter of Game 7 06/19/2016
"I mean the high profile FAs you’re taking about were Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. I love Randle and given his age and contract I do think he’s ultimately a better signing for the Knicks than Durant or Kyrie, but he’s not better than either of them."
I think Kevin Love can give Jokic a run for his money at making outlet passes.
This is what fat Kevin Love could've been if he didn't lose so much weight.
Lebron dragged Kevin Love and JR Smith to the Finals a few years back.  Nobody wants to match up against him.
"lol, casual u face lebron thats bound to happen alot espically if ur coach puts cj miles on kevin love"
Kevin Love was useless in the playoffs during his prime. I doubt he’s useful now that he’s past his prime.
I think a team with kevin love as it's best player is a bad or mediocre team
&gt;Kevin Love is and has always been cute.
Kevin Love is and has always been fool's gold.
"I love how Thunder fans are the battered wives of the NBA.   A decade ago, their franchise had Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  Their brilliant front office loses Harden then Durant.   The Thunder fans are left with the very least of the three.  Yet here they still are, defending Russell like hes going to come back to them and once again lead them to a sixth seed and first round exit.  Russell Westbrook is incapable of playing with another great player and making them better.  Just ask Paul George, or Kevin Durant or James Harden.     I guess you weren't a fan of the Thunder way back in 2019.  You should look up Oklahoma City and their lone playoff series from that year.  You can tell me some more about Westbrook being better than Lillard."
"Shaq did not suck at all. Are you crazy? He was a nightmare for the Mavs. They focused so much attention on making sure he didn’t dominate it gave Wade the freedom he had.  Yes absolutely Kyrie was better than Shaq but the rest of the Heat outplayed the rest of the Cavs. Kevin Love was maybe the 5th or 6th best player on the Cavs. They had to dig up Richard Jefferson’s corpse so he could take 24 of Loves minutes every night. It all balances out. Cavs had better top 2, Heat had a better 3-6."
"That makes sense to me apart from the Nurk comparison imo. Allen is a better rim protector/finisher and more of a lob threat than Nurk is, but Nurk is a much better passer and it’s not close. Also, hopefully Okoro can blossom into that kind of defensive wing that they need. He’s a little under sized at SF but he’s shown some promise and if he can knock down open 3s at a higher rate things may start to click. Kevin Love has to go though, they need a younger PF that can move his feet and hit 3s, maybe through the draft. Like a JJJ or Jonathan Isaac would be sick for this team"
"Two differences are the hand check is not allowed in basketball anymore, unlike any player before the late '90's early '00's. It prevented people like MJ to score fifty points on a regular hasis. The other difference is lack of physicalness taken out of the game. Steph Curry would have gotten the Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen treatment by either the Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, Indiana Pacers, New York Knicks or even the Los Angeles Lakers in the '80's and '90's. The intentional foul has stopped so many concussions as a positive. You're not going to do those crazy moves and embarrass the other team, for the next play you will get a hard foul and possibly knocked out of the game in 1980s and 1990s. A elbow to your ribs or a ""love tap"" to your head would stop some of this foolishness. Kevin McHale, Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer, Isiah Thomas and Mahorn are just some people who would do this.The battles with Shaq and Hakeem, Shaq and Ewing, Shaq and Mourning and Shaq and Mutombo were legendary. It was the best era of big men physical centers. I do miss watching the great era of inside scorers. If Giannis wants to improve his game, he needs a post move."
"Money doesn’t mean as much when it comes to mental struggles. Too many examples to count, but look at how open guys like KAT, Kevin Love, and Dame have been in terms of mental health. It doesn’t matter who you are or how much money you have, it comes for anyone and everyone. Money can’t protect you from your own mind all the time."
Pippen finished 3rd in MVP voting and led the Bulls to the 3rd seed during the first year without Jordan. He's not some kind of Kevin Love. He also deserved the Dream team spot.
"1. John Stockton 2. Tyler Herro 3. Rick Barry 4. Kevin Love 5. Nikola Jokic  Hard working, lunch pail type of guys who are always first in last out. Not the flashiest players, but constant performers."
"Westbrook, young Kevin Love, Steve Nash, Hakeem, and Ray Allen for me."
What happened to Kevin Love?
"&gt; LeBron had no real ""basketball reasons"" to go there  Wow. He saw an opportunity to form a new Big Three after his first one got old. Kyrie was an up and coming multiple All Star point guard with superstar potential while Kevin Love had just come off a 26/12 season and was also a multiple All Star as well as a two time 2nd Team All NBA. Yes, his *third* wheel in his new big 3 was a two time All NBA and muliple all star stretch forward who was breaking all kinds of records in his recent season before joining up with LeBron.               If you think those aren't 'basketball reasons' then you're just a little deluded...."
"Ugh Kevin Love was definitely hurt, you also left out the fact it was a 73-9 team they came back against, something that has literally never happened."
It goes wayyy deeper than this.. KAT to the Timberwolves after Kevin Love Kyrie to Cleveland after LeBron  Davis to New Orleans after Chris Paul Griffin to Clippers after Elton Brand Dwight to Orlando after McGrady And there were many more incidents of teams losing their star and immediately getting the first pick
"I was thinking about Kevin Love actually when this came to my mind. The dude is stuck on the Cavs and I feel like they don't actually want him, nobody wants his contract pretty much and i think he is miserable there and I just thought, why won't he just retire at this point lol. I always liked K Love but the situation he is in basketball wise is just weird. I see he was playing the last few games and had some decent numbers but considering all the nagging injuries he had over the years i would think he is drained mentally... i don't know"
"Not really. Wasnt in first cleveland run and definitely not in 2018.   And those 15-17 Cavs were absolutely not a super team. When it was formed it was supposed to be a super team, but that doesn’t magically make it one. Kevin Love wasnt as good as people thought he was, he just wasn’t. Anytime they faced good teams in the playoffs he would shrink and get bullied. Couldn’t rely on his health either.  There’s no doubt they meant to make a super team but they picked the wrong third wheel. Luckily they still got a ring out of it before KD went to Golden State.. but Love was arguably the 6th best Cav in that finals.   The Cavs literally had to dig up the corpse of Richard Jefferson so he could play 25 of Loves minutes every night....   So come on cut the shit dude. That’s like called the 90s rockets a super team. Yes, when they formed that team it was supposed to be one, they all where coming off the best stretches of their careers, but it never panned out, Drexler just wasn’t as good anymore."
Kevin Love.
LeBron giving Kevin Love depression
"LeBron in Miami and Cleveland was exactly like Harden. Pound the rock for 18 seconds, drive and finish or dish it out at the last second for an assist. Not a knock on him since obviously it worked but not everyone can handle being relegated to a spot-up shooter ala Kevin Love/Chris Bosh"
"Yeah tbh KP is a 3rd guy on a championship team. He is their Kevin Love in more ways than one.   2 problems: 1. He doesn't seem ready to accept it. 2.  They also need to find that #2, not sure how."
"Nah, lebron was expelled out of kevin love's orbit. Love is still with the cavs while lebron is with the lakers."
Kevin Love.
Kevin love with or without concussion?
Kevin Love
"no god no, like Kevin Love on the Cavs except the defensive focal point."
"His haters expect him to play on Kawhi's tier because he got paid, but he still makes less than Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris and Kevin Love, and &lt;$1m more than Steven Adams."
"Nah. KD is good, even great. But the small things like his behavior and how he carries himself is a joke. Building an all-star team to beat Lebron is pretty pathetic. He obviously doesn’t believe in himself. His incredibly razor thin ego really knocks the crown off his head. He was never better than Lebron his whole career. He walked on to a what? 72 win team? His two chips hold no weight in my opinion. In fact a lot of people’s opinion. Imagine if Jordan went to Detroit or Lebron going to Golden State or Boston. KD being a scoring champ multiple times is great. But he was never a winner and his personality makes him impossible to love. I bet Carmelo has more fans than Kevin. Seems to me at least talking to other fans. Carmelo might be one of the most beloved players in my generation. Lebron, Kobe, Carmelo, Giannis, Curry, Kyrie (changing quick), Westbrook then KD, Dame, Harden in the B tier. (In my opinion)    First Ballot for sure. But don’t you dare put him in the same conversation as one of the goats like Kareem. That’s just disrespectful. Kareem has done more than most players ever. In highscool, college and the pros. Magic as well. Bird as well. Top 3 probably Kobe, Lebron and Jordan. Top 5 add in Kareem and Magic(?). Then there’s a few more to round out the top 10. Curry being one of the greatest shooters of all time. Obviously in there. Bird or “The Logo” go in there. Shaq and Wilt belong up there. Tim Duncan belongs in there as well... boy I’m not sure if he even makes the top 15. Bill Russel has got to be in the top 20 at least. Maybe top 15. He needs 2 more chips. I’d even put D Wade in there before him and he had to retire early. Sheet AI is probably above him too and he didn’t win anything. His impact alone is beyond legendary. Damn this is a hard one. Going to Oakland was such a bitch move I don’t have him in my top 15-20 probably. But hey, I’m sure there’s plenty of snake fans LOL."
"They hate him from I've observed around the trade deadline, but also they never tried anything else than putting him in the corner like Kevin Love."
Kevin Durant. Polarizing figure among nba fans but his game undoubtedly embodies skill and finesse. Also love watching Dr J highlights cause his dunks make him seem like a ballerina with a ball.

Kevin Love literally did a sports science segment trying to make this shot in an empty gym and couldn’t manage it in like 70 tries. This mf gets this close in one try in an actual game oml
"Hahahahhaa classy individual I’m sure Kevin love, jokic and Grayson Allen would’ve responded with supreme class ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻"
I guess he really did give Kevin Love depression.
"Ik this sub hates to hear it but Steph was partially injured in 2016, it really limited his ability to drive in for lay ups which in turn hurt his efficiency. I mean cmon would fucking Kevin Love really able to box up a fully healthy Steph?"
"&gt; Curry is a reason those teams were world beaters.   He's not the GM. They were world beaters because they were fucking stacked. One guy alone doesn't make a team ""stacked"", that's not what that means.  Biggest moment of his life and the dude got locked up by noted Defensive Stalwart Kevin Love.  Steph goes 1/10 and KD bailed his ass out after that."
"&gt;T Wolves have had 12 top 10 picks since 2006 including 3 #1s. That's a shit ton of high end talent they've had the opportunity to accumulate. Idk any other franchise that has wasted so many top picks.  2 #1sts. We traded Kevin Love for Wiggins.  &gt;That's a shit ton of high end talent they've had the opportunity to accumulate. Idk any other franchise that has wasted so many top picks.  Kings,Warriors before Steph,etc"
"Kevin Love just passed Mark Price for 2nd place in Cavalier 3 pointers.   More of a sign of the times with the volume shooting, but Love has played 220 less games for the team than Mark Price, former back to back 3 point champion, did."
Not really. [This sub was also crying](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/m5vpda/collin_sexton_likes_a_tweet_saying_kevin_love/) about Sexton liking a negative tweet about Kevin Love not too long.
"Yeah but it was against the Cavs when both Kyrie and Kevin Love were injured so as much as people don’t want to admit, there is a little bit of an asterisk there"
Kevin Love - football passes
"Still will always love KD, but let’s not pretend Steph needed him for success. It was the other way around. Steph was a champion and 2x mvp without KD. He balled out in those finals series against Cleveland for sure, but the defensive focus of those opponents were selling out to stop Steph, leaving KD the most space he’s had in his career (also had Klay on the court w him freeing him up even more). The discussion is old news, but right now Steph has proved more by himself as the sole star than Kevin ever has"
"/u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show *(featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament)*.   MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose *(the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06)*.  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT *(14-25)* on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's *(ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans)*. That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers *(and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots)*.  **26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG%** Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  **17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG%** Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  **19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG%** Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. [Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.](https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rose-dwarfs-other-improvements-with-defense/?_r=0)  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales *that* heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas **37 times that season.**  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;*""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""*  **Jason Kidd**  &gt;*""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.*  **Steve Nash**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""*  **Tyson Chandler**  &gt;*""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""*  **Magic Johnson**  &gt;*""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""*  **Michael Jordan**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""*  **Scottie Pippen**  &gt;*""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""*  **Kevin Love**  &gt;*""MVP. He's my MVP.""*  **Z-Bo** after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  &gt;*""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""*  **Mike D'Antoni**  &gt;*""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""*  **Frank Vogel**  &gt;*""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""*  **Charles Barkley**  &gt;*""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""*  **Mike Breen**  &gt;*""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""*  **Jeff Van Gundy**  *""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""*  **Scott Skiles**  &gt;*""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""*  **Stan Van Gundy**  &gt;*""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""*  **Doc Rivers**  &gt;*""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""*  **Phil Jackson**  &gt;*""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""*  **Gregg Popovich**  &gt;*""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""*  **Juwan Howard**  &gt;*""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""*  **Chris Bosh**  &gt;*""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""*  **Lebron** when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;*""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""*  **Brian Scalabrine**  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"&gt; nuance people. nuance   Implies that the outcome of a series may not be the whole story. If Kyrie and Kevin Love were healthy in 15 I think it's pretty likely they win. Golden State may not have been as hobbled as the Cavs, but they were also missing Bogut and did lose Drey for a game (and in a series that went to seven games every one counts), and Steph was not playing at 100%. He wasn't as injured as Kyrie or Kevin Love but he was playing hurt, and based on how close that series was it's also likely they win if injuries went the other way. Nuance works both way homie"
"Ur underrating Kevin Love, the man averaged 26 and 12 and was a consensus top 10 player."
"***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  1992 Dennis Rodman and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)  Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. First and foremost, you have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball which allows him to do so much with so little, truly raising the ceiling. He straight up has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. The chefs ridiculous shooting is just the quintessential necessity in these lineups. The reason he's so important and a starter is that he offers something no other player in the history of the game can offer. Not only this but he has an array of assets and skills that make him super important. He's super clutch and is very reliable down the stretch and is a good team defender. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. He can pick up steals and act as a good leader and with his off ball movement, he's essentially unguardable. His shooting can shut the doors on a match with how nuclear hot he gets and his gravity can seal a win in any match as the triple teams he forces can be exploited. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better, and more efficient in many ways, among many reasons.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He may not have the consistency of 2013, but he can dial in defensively when needed as he is still a living freight train in terms of build. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. If he's in a lineup of bigs and shooting is required, he can fufill that requirement. The 40% 3P% in 2013 seems like his best but it was on 3.3 attempts, he was shooting 37% on 5 attempts in 2018. Same story with FG%. His higher spacing in the Heat days gave him more room to shoot and drive through open lanes, he didn't have that luxury in 2018 yet he still did so well. When you need an instant bucket, you have potentially the most dangerous finisher of all time ready to ram through defenses, and these traits stayed in the playoffs. Essentially, he's acting as a jack of all trades. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. It's precisely the reason I chose 2018. His mix of more experienced playmaking and much higher BBIQ makes him better suited than his younger days. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own drive into the lane, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way. Imagine Draymond in 2016 but on steroids, or Magic with Karl Malones body.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have the 2 clutchest players in Bird and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan. Jordan really completes the team because of his pure transcendence in the field of scoring. Not only that but he has a very versatile skillset. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (The team is too smart to have him be the one shooting from 3) He is GOING to be the leader of the team and thats invaluable. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. His insane athleticism allowed him to process things at an insane pace. His consistency in his midrange came from his ability to find a good spot thanks to his good handles and speed, jump so high nobody can contest the shot and go into his form mid air. This ability to leap and use his incredible reflexes was imperative to his finishing as well as his incredible free throw drawing, absorbing contact and finishing through it. He mixed his ridiculous athleticism with potentially the deepest bag of moves of any guard ever, most notably the fadeaway. All of this allows him to benefit even more from all these elite passers like Magic, Bird, Russell, ect ect. The best thing about him is his postseason success. He was not fazed by pressure, he more so than anyone else in history thrived in it. He lived in the moments where games were decided, holding practically ALL of the playoff scoring records. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. His passing matured as he played more and is now super underrated as he improved his shot selection and court vision. He rebounds excellently thanks to his constant motor, the same motor that helped him earn a DPOY and become the greatest defensive guard. His off ball movement meant he could use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (There are SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Now, you might see Garnett and be confused. He seems REALLY out of place, doesn't he? You usually have someone like Duncan there. Most lists don't have Garnett here. Well, for you, I'd recommend Thinking Basketballs Kevin Garnett: Greatest Peaks video. It is super awesome and useful in telling you how good he was. He was a 7 footer with the agility of a guard, footwork like Hakeem and offense like a guard. His greatest skill was perhaps the fact that he had the greatest fire and spirit out of anyone he played against. As you might have noticed, all of my players have either elite passing or elite bbiq, with exceptions for ridiculous players like Shaq. Garnett easily has that BBIQ. His help defense is absolutely insane, seemingly knowing what the enemy will do before they do, and arriving to obliterate shots as soon as the ball leaves the enemies hands, sometimes before. His positional and court awareness allowed him to prey on mismatches, read schemes and outrebound anyone. This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him. With so many faces on the team who want the ball, Garnett won't be someone who holds the ball often, probably only for spot up shots and for some smart passes here and there. High BBIQ, remember? Garnett will be focusing his energy on rebounding, 1 on 1 defense and team defense."
KAT is a modern day Kevin Love
Kevin Love was injured for half his playoff games and trash in the other (mainly cause he would get injured in like the first quarter lol). I dont know why people include him
"Josh Jackson had Sexton cross his whole field of vision running up the court and still chose to stay fixed to Kevin Love at halfcourt, only turning as the ball passed him.  Love was already pointing up court and Jackson still didn't even turn around."
"Lebron’s 2016 team was closer to the KD/Russ/Ibaka Thunder team than it was to the current Nets or the KD Warriors. And Kevin Love put those stats up on some incredibly bad teams. Kevin Love is nowhere near Klay Thompson in terms of overall ability, let alone Steph Curry or James Harden. Call Lebron’s team a super team if you want, which it was *at the time*, before KD joined the Warriors and took it to the next level. The KD Warriors were the most stacked team of all time. 4 All Stars, all in their primes. The KD Nets have two of the most prolific and capable scorers in the history of the game. Lebron has never played with a teammate performing at the level of Steph Curry or James Harden. Period."
With no Kevin Love and an injured Kyrie
Can't forget passing. Bird was probably the best full court/long range passer of all time. Imagine if Kevin Love made his on the money full court passes one handed in traffic on the regular.
Kevin Love basically has been hurt and done absolutely nothing since getting that huge contract.....They prob can't wait to get rid of him.
And Kevin love was absolutely horrific for the most part every Finals. Only reason he ever even made a playoffs was because he was on a team with Kyrie/LeBron.
"Magic Johnson, Kevin Love, Mahomes (football but wtv), Josh Hart, Baron Davis, Natasha Cloud"
Kevin Love played power forward alongside Tristan Thompson. It's not like they didn't play with a defensive big at most times
"I'm tired of this lie. Kevin Love was a shooter before Lebron. He was chucking them before. Actually his 3pt attempts went up after Bron left lol.      What happened was he became a third option. And incase you weren't watching, they *were* giving him post touches except he wasn't as good at that because he became smaller. TT was looking like a better post and role scorer at times lol.         He's been average to shit for 7 years but everyone's blaming it on having to space for Lebron? Plus his Wolves seasons are overrated af. He did and won shit all but ppl wanna pretend he was elite. Zero playoffs appearances btw."
Kevin Love?
&gt;You rarely see a max player playing with the timberwolves   False. I think only in the brief era between KG and Kevin Love we didn't have a max worthy talent on our roster.
"We know what we've gotta do. I hear Ray Allen is trying to assemble a team in Seattle consisting of 2016 Kevin Love, Patrick Beverley, Prime Tony Allen, Seth Curry and St Jude herself. That should do the trick"
Hahaha what? Just watched it back to make sure and he 100% locked Steph down there. Steph literally spent the whole shot clock trying to get a decent look on him and he STILL ended up getting an off balance out of rhythm contested 3 which he bricked. And if Kevin Love was ass in the finals that just makes Steph look worse.
"Steph didn’t get locked down by Kevin Love. He created a good look from three. The shot just didn’t go in.   People really need to stop giving Kevin Love credit for this. His defense was solid, but Curry still shook him to get a good look from three. People need to just start admitting that Kevin Love was complete ass in the finals and stop trying to prop it up like he made significant contributions to Cleveland’s championship."
It’s his fault he couldn’t score once in 5 minutes with his legacy on the line and got locked down by Kevin Love. It’ll haunt him forever. Sad.
"Probably Steph or Klay when they hit 60 points and are not being held out of the 4th. You also never know who it could be as guys like Kevin Love and Pascal Siakam have dropped 30 in a quarter before, they just have to stay hot for the rest of the game"
Why add LA? Also kevin love is extremely overrated. When comparing mvp level talent KD has played with more.
"Russ/Harden were obviously not MVP caliber in KD’s first 7 years in the league. Harden didn’t even make All Star while he was playing with KD. Russ wasn’t MVP caliber till 2015. But KD was hurt. So he only had MVP caliber Russ for 1 year.   While Lebron had MVP caliber Wade for multiple years.  But the real difference is the 3rd Star. Lebron had a third star in Bosh and Love for 6+ years. KD never got the 3rd Star in all his years in OKC. It was always just him and Russ. Plus OKC had crap depth. That is why they had to start crappy players like Kendrick Perkins, Andre Roberson, and Thabo Sefalosha. After Harden got traded their best guy of the bench was Dion Waiters and Kevin Martin.   Yes Russ was real good but after that KD didn’t have much help."
"He said that he might vote Jokic as MVP this season, but ultimately championship teams don't have offense-oriented centers that are mediocre on defense.   He cited opponent fg% at the rim when Jokic challenges (it's high, Kevin Love territory) and Jokic's inability to switch. He talked about how his defense was exploited in the playoffs last year.   He also said that it might very well be possible for the Nuggets to just outscore other teams on the way to a title, but until seeing that happen it seems wise to err on the side of history."
"Kevin Love is the most questionable, but yes I think he'll make it, and I definitely don't see anyone else on the list that has any possible chance of missing the HoF."
You think Kevin Love is going to the hall of fame?

"Draymond isn't a true part of the big 3.  He's a great supporting cast player, he has never and will never be able to score like Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, Steph, Klay, etc etc etc.  Draymond would be the worst player of any ""big 3"" Ever."
Kevin Love was a beast and an All Star.  Have fun rewriting history.
"Kevin Love didn't play in 2015 finals.  When he played in the 2016 finals the Cavs won.  The Warriors went and added a top 3 player in the league to get back on top.  The Warriors Big 3 never beat the Cavs Big 3.  Durant robbed us of the greatest rubber match ever.  No 2 teams in NBA history had gone to 3 straight finals against each other with a 1-1 record until 2017.  Instead of trying to win the 2/3 legit the Warriors and Durant took the freebie.  Can't blame them, but also can't make some legacy argument for the Warriors because of it."
Jokic sucks they should trade him to the Cavs for Kevin Love.
"They had to trade Kevin Love for him, pretty big difference than winning the draft lottery"
I’ve always thought that games shouldn’t end on free throws unless it’s Kevin Love no call level  Just my 2cents
They don't count as All Stars when people defend him. Go tell a causal fan Kevin Love was an All Star
"What? I’m saying Bosh and Love were better when they joined up with Lebron than Kyrie was when he joined up with KD. Harden is better than all of them. Again you must have never seen prime Kevin Love lol. Your account is 28 days old, is that when you started watching basketball?"
My lanta! we got a boy on record saying chris bosh and kevin love in their prime were better than Kyrie in his prime
Imagine watching fat Kevin Love at the beginning of his career in Minnesota and being told he'd have a shooting game like this
Kyrie was already at Cleveland   Wade was already at Miami  Are you saying Kevin Love or Chris Bosh are the equivalent of James Harden or Kyrie Irving
Kevin Love is the only other dude I've seen who every so often just cannot miss anything. He hasn't gotten that hot in a while though
Kevin love
"Dwane wade, Kevin love, isiah thomas, tristan thompson, bosh, illgeskias, snow, jr smith, kyle korver, AD, Brandon Ingram, Julius randle, mike miller, ray allen,   Every player I named has an NBA career achievement award, weather that be an all start, 3 point contest, 6 man, etc... Lebron has had all of these, and keep in mind he picks his team.  KD never picked his team, he was recruited.  Lebitch still picks all these players, and still can't win.  There is a lot more I forgot too"
"That's whack.  Bosh is 100% in.  Irving too if he plays another year or two.  Bosh is an 11x all-star with a 2nd team.  Irving is a 7x all-star with a 2nd and 3rd.  The cutoff for the basketball HOF is usually around 5 or 6 all-stars and 1 all-NBA team.  They both clear that easily.  Kevin Love is the only questionable one with 5x all-star and 2 2nd teams.  I think he would eventually make it, but the others are almost guaranteed to make the hall.  &amp;#x200B;  They all have a gold medal in the Olympics each, so that really puts them over the edge."
"Chris Bosh and Kevin Love are overrated... You guys have to stop mentioning them as some all time players... Yea they put up good stats on sorry teams but someone has too... When it mattered most, Bosh got dominated by Roy fricken Hibbert and Love’s defense is just horrible... He can’t defend anyone and provides no rim protection... Pick n roll defense is horrible... Also lost too much weight to bang in the paint... KD has played with 3 mvps during their primes..."
"right but you are sitting here just arguing semantics, right? You say his criteria is wrong, and it probably is in the context of what most people consider a super team, but your next sentence is nonsensical. Giving finbarr the benefit of the doubt he is saying that if you roll through your conference in playoffs you are a superteam, well the Bucks never did that so of course they arent.  Obviously as I wrote, many people agree the definition is 3+ bonafide stars, but it gets pretty tricky when you are comparing whether Kevin Love or Bosh is ""good enough"" to be a 3rd star to consitute a superteam while completely ignoring every other guy who plays. Like what would you rather have to complement your top 2 - Kevin Love, JR Smith, TT, and the rest of the cavs, or the entire Clipper roster after PG/Kawhi? I would rather the Clipper roster (or if you dont like this example, use it for any other team in history that had a great roster after 2 stars) so I can see why calling the Cavs team with 3 stars a superteam but the Clipper team with 2 stars and a better supporting team (theoretically) not a superteam doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  To bring this all back, maybe Finbarr's criteria isnt that stupid. if the criteria is - dominate your conference in playoffs - that almost might make more sense than - 3+ stars. Not saying I agree just something to think about."
"Kevin and Lebron. I did it. Kevin BEAT Lebron twice in the Finals and won FMVP twice. KD is up 2-1 versus Lebron in the Finals. Deal with it. Kevin played with Kendrick Perkins, Andre Roberson, Thabo Sefalosha, and Perry Jones. Lebron played with Wade, Bosh, Ray Allen, Irving, Love, and AD."
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
"As a homer, I was hoping Kevin Love didn't get that record and beat Klay. But as I watched it, I was so let down that that was the main reason he didn't end up getting it."

Maybe JR Smith or Kevin Love? They come kinda close. Steph too
"ok, but kevin love didn't have a young, overly enthusiastic fanbase and yet his dirty play early in his career pretty much disappeared in collective memory whereas it sticks with black players."
Kevin Love is a basketball player for the National Basketball Association
People still think Kelly Olynyk -intentionally- made that play where he got locked arms with Kevin Love as if he was a BJJ black belt trying to take him down.
who else he aiming for? kevin love at the top of the 3? lmao
It's okay we still have Kevin Love
Kevin Love averaged a double double off his own misses. So anyone can do it.
"The Lakers are 5-11 because even with Davis they're hardly a playoff team.  Their role players are one dimensional who can't do shit without a playmaker.  Kuzma must be loving how Drummond is the scapegoat, he's been straight ass since the All star break but all eyes are on Drummond now who has always been a Kevin Love type of player- big, empty numbers on a shit team."
"i think team B is getting looked over a little. the series would be close, but javale mcgee and kevin love are getting scored on every time by shaq and tim."
"I mean When Kevin Love was on the Wolves, He never made a Playoff Appearance. Or When DeMarcus Cousins was on the Kings, He had No Playoff Appearances."
"2 titles were because KD joined a 73-9 win team  Currys other title is due to kevin love and kyrie irving being injured  Aside from shooting 3s Curry really doesnt have much of a legacy  No finals MVPs, no championships that were actually earned, no game winning playoff shots"
Like when Kevin Love was going off and Kyrie stopped passing.
Didn’t Kevin love come close with 36?
Shades of Kyrie ignoring Kevin Love
Hmm what’s the difference between him and Curry’s unanimous MVP season???  Seems like there is 43 differences.  Huge stat line on a horrible team— Kevin Love with the Wolves a prime example— mean nothing.  Zion doesn’t stretch a defense.  He doesn’t put the constant strain on a defense Steph does with his constant movement.  I just don’t think a person understands basketball if you are using those stats to make a comparison like this.
"Not to turn this into a ""Iguodala vs CP3"" discussion, but I disagree. I think everything went wrong for the Rockets in that series and they very well could have won.  They didnt, that's all good. CP3 fit great with Harden on that team, and CP3 was definitely the closer as you say.  Harden/Kyrie/KD have proven they step up when it matters. Argue that Harden hasnt, that Kyrie hasnt at times, and that KD needed the Warriors... but they've all been huge contributors on deep playoff teams.  Best the Sixers have done is a 7 game loss to the champ Raptors (should be my flair) where the best Philly player in that series no longer plays for that team (Jimmy B).  The 6ers have something to prove and they wont be the underdog. The Nets have something to prove in a sense, but they have a tonne of talent, and there's one tried and true notion in playoff betting - the team w the best player wins. That player is Kevin Durant.  Love the bet and the banter, hope this series happens even more so now!"
"Yeah I didnt see the ""series he played in"" qualification my bad.   ["" One George-to-Cleveland deal fell apart when the Cavs declined to make a future first-round pick unprotected, a concession they felt they couldn’t make without assurances from James. It is unlikely that the Cavaliers would’ve traded Kyrie Irving with James and George together on the Cleveland roster.""](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/29/report-cavaliers-wouldve-traded-kevin-love-for-paul-george-if-lebron-james-committed-long-term-last-summer/)."
"I think Love had individual good series but I dont think they ever needed him. Ran through the east in 2015 without him I just think the gap between the Cavs with Love and without Love was far too small for what the Cavs needed.   &gt;I don't think there's a finals series that he played in where the Cavs were like a tier 2/3 star away from winning.  Interesting way of putting it. I do think the 2015 Finals was very winnable. Idk if they win that series with Kevin Love(lean no) but I think there are a number of players who were gettable at 2014 for Wiggins that couldve put them over the top. I think 2016 needing all that it took for the Cavs to eek out a win was a reflection on Love.   Also here's an interesting hypothetical. Paul George almost got traded to Cleveland in a 3 team trade for Love in 2017. I know Woj has said if that happened its unlikely Kyrie is dealt. 2018 Cavs with Kyrie/LeBron/PG, that I think definitely wouldve had a shot vs 2018 GSW. And I think Woj saying that Kyrie likely stays also highlights the fact the Cavs players knew Love wasnt enough, that they needed a meaningful jolt, and had they gotten one things might have been different."
"Kevin Love’s defining legacy is letting Curry create a shooting window to get off a potentially game tying three and Curry just happening to miss it.   It was solid defense in that Curry had a tight window and didn’t get fully open, but it isn’t the lockdown defense that it’s made out to be as Curry has hit tons of those shots in his career.   The play would also be called a foul on Love in the post Kawhi/Zaza era as Love didn’t give Curry a safe landing space."
as evidenced by people as recently as this offseason thinking that Kevin Love is a positive asset to trade
"Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Hakeem Olajuwon, Sabonis, Lamar Odom, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis, Andrea Bargnani, Boris Diaw, Nikola Jokic, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony-Towns, Bam Adebayo, Rasheed Wallace, Kevin Love, Nikola Vucevic and more all have fadeaway jumpers in their bag."
"My point was that it took the second best of all time to get your garbage ass franchise a ring. I’d argue there’s more luck in the fact that the  second best of all time happened to be born in Akron than anything else. Oh and what a coincidence, the Cavs had the first pick in ‘03 hmmmm. Overall it’s a trash franchise and a trash city. I feel bad for Kevin Love. Enjoy watching the Cavs and the Browns for years to come."
"Oh trust me, as a Wolves fan I’ve been saying it every year since Kevin Love.   This year though I plan on putting 1K on it because the team is actually different now."
"All the LeBron bots and stan accounts on twitter made up the “asterisk” titles as excuses for their hero losing in the finals. Like they’ll whine and complain that Kyrie and Kevin Love were hurt in 2015 and they surely would have blown out the Warriors but then they don’t want to hear about Steph Currys ankle injury, Boguts broken leg, and Draymonds suspension (which clearly swung the series) in 2016"
"I like KAT, but...there's not a lot of proof he can win on the pro level. Yes, it's a terrible franchise. But, the Wolves are beyond awful routinely. The guy's contract averages to $30+ mill a year. Is he another Kevin Love (stats guy on bad teams - unless he's playing with LeBron, and then people act like KL is the second coming of Tim Duncan)?"
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
"I think you're crazy if you think Lebron wouldn't have won a ring in the first stint with Cleveland if he had one more legit All Star.  I agree with you on the part about how people make all of Lebron's opponents sounds like the greatest competition to ever grace the Earth (especially considering that Jordan's East was way tougher to actually get to the Finals).  &gt;To wit, if you compare Jordan's greatest teammate - Scottie - to Kevin Love's stat line in the Finals, particularly the ones in which the Cavs lost, it's not that different.  Scottie played 20 years prior and is a beast of a defender, so that's not really helping your argument.  This isn't like how people have retconned Kyrie into being carried by Lebron because they hate him now, even at the time it was pretty well acknowledged Love was kinda playing like garbage."
Because it didn’t have to do with Kyrie   His legs were shot jumper was off the entire postseason. Back issue also yes   Dude put up video game numbers in 2018 playoffs round 1 with Kevin love playing with a busted hand and then game 6-7 vs Boston when Love was out. “Needed Kyrie” lol
"One hit wonder... let’s think critically here.    Warriors can’t help that Kyrie and Love were out.  Okay that’s fine. They won pretty handily and won 3 games in a row none being insanely close. Curry came through every 4th quarter and had one of highest 4th quarter ppg in finals ever.    2016- it took an injured Curry who was objectively hurt, Draymond missing a game, Bogut their main rim protector being out, Andre back spasms. Plus Lebron having one of the best series EVER AND still it came down to final minutes of a game 7. Curry wasn’t able to drive past Tristian Thompson and Kevin love in 2016 yet in 2017 he was cooking the shit out of them.    Can you in good faith say the Warriors if everybody is healthy don’t win 8/10 times if the series is played over and over in 2016?"
Shake Kevin Love for a game winner. Lock down Kyrie to prevent a game winner.
"&gt;  He's gonna have to. There is a reason Gobert has never done well against the Rockets lmao. Its because his drop coverage gets him played off the floor. Kyrie, James and KD will kill him that way, be it easy mid rangers or pull up threes. Harden will get possessions with him on the perimeter. They simply do not have enough to slow them down.  The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen.  If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint.  Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  &gt;  Lmao and if one of Harris or Thybulle are in there, either there offense suffers or there defense suffers. Danny Green also cannot guard Harden one on one either. He will absolutely be pulling that extra defender be it iso or pick and roll, never mind that in your scenario Kyrie or KD(two of the best iso players in the game) are still getting one on one coverage at the end of the day lol.  I'm more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers.  Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender.

If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  &gt;  Yes it is, that's literally what spacing is, what are you talking about. We had decent spacing in Houston, not great. Turrets? We had average to below average shooters who took a lot of 3s. That was pre floater Harden and Harden being the only all star on his team. Damn...its a shame Harden has never beaten a team with a great rim protector....Gobert lol. Kyrie and KD dont have to run around any screens, we didnt do that in Houston. Harden can get them open looks by them standing still. But just to be clear, KD and Kyrie to get around screens that;s a lie. Harris will be playing plenty of minutes.  No, that's not what spacing is.  Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping.  And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot.  If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers.  You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule.

"Again who is he who to demand a trade? He wasn't KG or Kevin Love, he was there for a season."
Kevin Love averaged 18 &amp; 9 on 46/42/88. Find a new slant.
"Oh yeah. Duke Maryland have had some classics too. There’s a Kevin Durant/Mario Boggins battle that I love watching, too."
"We played against Klay for 90% of the series and were winning.  No fans and quarantine = asterisk.  If opposing players being injured means that your championship has an asterisk, then the following championships also have asterisks on them.  2015: Kyrie and Kevin Love   2017: Kawhi  2018: Chris Paul"
"Which one. The one he won with Anthony Davis? Or the one he won with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love? Or was it either of the ones he won with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh?  Replace Jimmy Butler with any player, even a clone of Lebron James, in that final against the Lakers and you think that player would win the finals against a Lakers team of Lebron James + Anthony Davis lmao?"
I thought Kevin Love went through another miracle weight loss transformation
Have you watched any Cavs games last couple of years? Kevin Love isn't filling up any stat sheets these days.
Wasnt Lebron playing with AD yesterday? Wtf is this shit? Kevin Love 2.0
"you guys don't need Bron, you have Kevin ""I Can Still Carry A Team"" Love."
Kevin love has entered the chat
"Players being more involved in organizing the players they play with and how the team plays in general.   Lebron broke the norm when he signed a 3 year deal after his rookie contract was up, Wade and Bosh also did this. This was clearly organized and discussed beforehand in order to set up teaming up. They wanted Melo to do it, but he wanted his money and guaranteed so he got the full max with full years, like every other player out there.  From there he went to the Cavs but only on the conditions that they're willing to give him more control with who is on the team, ensuring they spend as much as possible, and making sure they trade for Kevin Love.  In terms of his best friend running an agency, they're able to essentially tamper without tampering and make one another money. That setup is magical as they're using Lebron's status to recruit, Lebron praises players signed with Klutch more often, and teams Lebron is on often sign those same players almost solely because Lebron wants it. KCP signed on an inflated contract with the Lakers almost solely due to the clutch connection.  Other players like Durant have even credited him for starting this trend while other old time players blame him for it. This type of arrangement and thinking definitely shows forethought and strategic planning to maximize they're control and power in a league where the power for team management was always on the front office's side. Kobe couldn't even get the Lakers to trade Bynum when he wanted."
don’t forget Kevin Love and Alex Caruso
"Y’all act like we didn’t put a great team around him also...kyrie, Kevin love, JR, Shumpert...the Cavs were also a solid team in the 90s and before, but nah, Cavs bad."
Tbh I feel like kevin love stories to haven’t come out because we can publicly see him being a malcontent
The question remains who is better? Fat Jokic or Fat Kevin Love?
"He wasn’t on the court at the end. Kevin Love won them that game. Nate lost the Pacers that game. He doesn’t make adjustments in crunch time. But I don’t need to tell you that, you’ll learn all about it soon enough"
Likewise I'm waiting for some really fucked up Kevin Love stories about Cleveland.
Remember when Larry Nance Jr. refused to give an autograph to that kid and Kevin Love came to his rescue? Nance Jr. was on top of the world at that time too.
Knicks are my favorite broadcasting team other than Eddie Johnson and Kevin Ray on the Suns. I love Charlotte’s and Atlanta’s broadcasters as well.
"I mean, if we're posting single plays against to make points:  &gt;Kevin Love [""I'm better than any big when I really try""](https://youtu.be/XC-mTgXRfm8)"
"Uhh yeah cause those are equal to Kyrie, Kevin love, and KD being out for the series"
Look man if you want to keep ignoring the fact that Nate McMillan is not good in the playoffs then go for it. I hope for you guys he is better but nothing in his past says he’s a good coach come playoffs.  Also we didn’t lose in game 7 to LeBron James. We lost the game with LeBron off the court somehow. We were in control of the game until he left the court. Nate couldn’t figure out how to guard an offense being run through Kevin Love who couldn’t do anything but stand in one spot.
"Kevin Love hasn't been the adult in the room for a while, seemingly."
"Lol, did Kevin love do a few tabs to experience ego death and shit the bed on the court."
"No I’m not, go watch the damn games. We were the better team in that series. I think we had a point differential of about + 35 and we blew game 7 when we had control because Nate McMillan let Kevin Love score like 9 straight points on pick n pop 3s while LeBron was off the court. Our offense that entire series was Oladipo isolation and Bojan Bogdanovic chuck up a 3 at the buzzer."
"You aint wrong, but i think this guys takes the cake, i literally don't see any reasoning for some comments other than him liking white people more than black people like saying kevin love has abetter contract/player than sexton, and some other dumb ass takes."
"No you're just ignoring the part where actual NBA players were saying its gonna be respectable ring. So are you saying the rings won by the warriors were weak also? They faced a lot of injured teams in that run. Zaza injuring kawhi, Conley being injured, Chris Paul being injured, Kyrie and Kevin Love being injured Im sure im missing some more."
Maple mamba is RJ not Kelly “let’s shake hands Kevin love “olynyk
Kevin Love and Tyler Herro belong on the all-scrub team this year

"Kevin Love, There must have been a debacle about calling him white and disrespected because of that or babied because of that."
"Kevin Love is this sub's villain atm, people here aren't going to actually pay attention to context when this post fits their narrative."
"I mean +/- isn’t a great stat according to stat heads most of the time anyway, Kevin Love hate is at an all time high right now so I guess that’s why it’s gained traction on this post but I wouldn’t put any great weight on +/- anyway."
"Kevin Love has had a weird career, I wonder how he'll be looked back on in like, 20 years?  Overrated? Underrated? A What-If? At least he has the Steph-Possession and that one 20 pt 15 rb season."
What is this? The Kevin Love era?
It’s actually more like:  ~~Kevin Garnett~~ ~~Al Jefferson~~ ~~Kevin Love~~ ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ ~~KAT~~ ~~Jimmy Butler~~ ~~KAT again~~ Ant
"I never said anything about Kevin Love other than you making him being white an issue, you racist."
Kevin Love -45 in 26 minutes. Jeez
"the 15-16 season was one of the most fun times I had in this subreddit. The whole warriors 73-9 was great to follow here. No one was really salty and while you had some repetitive jokes they were light hearted like posting WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWarriors during their streak and so on. I agree with you after the finals and KD decision I did see a rise in toxicity, first I thought people were mad at KD understandably but then it continued and now we have things like Lebron gave Kevin Love depression or a thread with 400 comments shitting on a rookie because of a bad game."
Kevin Love is -19. Already. WOOF.
Kevin Love going to try and sneak on the Portland bus after the game
Kevin Love
"One thing I took note of while rewatching this game (on nba youtube channel) is that while the Raptors were making their comeback in the second half it looked like Nick Nurse was leading the huddles over then head coach Casey. He was likely responsible for much of their adjustments to get them back into the game, and what cemented the Raptors' decision to go with him as HC moving forward.  There's an alternate timeline where Toronto makes this a competitive series had they taken this game, but after dropping to 0-3 vs Lebron they probably lost all hope. Most people like to frame this series as an easy win for Cleveland given that it resulted in a sweep, but games 1-3 were all pretty close and could have went either way. The difference between this series and the other two vs the Pacers and Celtics is that Lebron actually had some help and Kevin Love actually kind of resembled an all star."
"Shaq: “Here‘a my top NBA players... #1, my man, LeBron James. Wish I helped him win in Cleveland, but he’s helping my Lakers win big. #2, my man, Anthony Davis. Big fella, feasting on BBQ chicken like yours truly. #3... Giannis... what can I say? Big fella like yours truly... #4... here’s what I’m gonna say, Joel Embiid has gotta step it up if he wants to win a championship... rings, Erneh... and the fact is when guys like KD and Giannis are in the East, you gotta fight harder and play in the paint... what team is Kevin Love on again? Anyways, that’s my list, I think my man, Anthony Davis could go back-to-back this year, unlike you, Chuck... who never even had one back, much less than two!... Dame’s pretty good, also... not as good as me, though.”"
Gotta love how AD is already getting the Kevin love treatment
"Love, Kevin Love"
so we getting Prime Kevin Love? i'm down with it lmao
Obviously trade for Kevin Love
Blake griffi or kevin love
Kevin Love was never known for his defense but somehow he’s gotten so much worse
"The issue I see with this is that the Cavs are definitely tanking now, debatably for a lot of the season. Kevin Love being bad could be viewed as a positive."
Kevin Love by a country mile. I have no idea why he tantrums when his competitive spirit is as fiery as a wet log.
"Kevin Love is def a front runner, but shout out to Eric Bledsoe"
It’s Kevin love but I’d like to ensure some second place votes for Aaron baynes
"Kevin Love, James Wiseman, and Andre Drummond come to mind"
Kevin Love
'It's nothing but love here.'  Confirmed. Kevin love is coming to GSW.

"Another case of no one watching our games ever.      Try explaining how having Darren Collision guarding Kevin Love in the playoffs makes sense.       Try explaining why we shot the most midrange 2's and the least 3's in the league.    Try explaining why every inbounds play was an iso (that never worked).        Try explaining why we never played any new talent when we were struggling.          You can't.      I applaud his success now, but Nate choked the second he could when it mattered most."
"Also, you're just never going to keep them out of the game. And people don't wanna see natty athletes anyways. I don't want natty runningback's in the NFL that are 5'10"" and 170. I want absurd Dalvin Cook monstrosities. 5'10"", 210lbs and 10% body fat with 4.3 40's.         But anywho, yeah, you just won't keep them out. People in sports have always abused things to give themselves a competitive edge. Amphetamines in baseball in the 70s/80s, simple PEDs like deca and test in baseball in the 90/00s, and the complex things + HGH in the 10s/20s.       You love that Kevin Durant is still able to play at a high level? Cool, me too, and you should be grateful that HGH and what it can do for connective tissue growth and recovery. That's one of the main reasons he is able to be at the level he is, yet practically every other player's career before his was ruined by that same injury."
Kevin Love is such a shitter oh my god
I want to laugh but I drafted Kevin Love this year
"I think if we've learned 1 thing, it's to never doubt LeBron. Every year it's the same thing ""He's [x] years old"", ""Team doesn't have chemistry"", ""He didn't high five Kevin Love"". There's some concern, but he's more than earned the benefit of the doubt.  Heck his ankle was injured (albeit a little less) in 2018 right before the playoffs and he had probably the greatest playoff run ever lol"
"Idk, I think Kevin is all out of Love"
He plays with Kevin. He gets more Love than most players.
He’s a ballhog who won’t pass to Kevin Love
Trade you Kevin Love
Then Lakers should trade for Kevin Love.
"As a die hard Cavs fan. This franchise is fucking pathetic without Lebron. Koby Altman should’ve been fired after trading KPJ for a top 55 protected pick. For character issues, while Kevin Love acts like a baby and gives the ball to the other team. The NBA should fine the Cavs for this move."
For Kevin Love?
Nah he wasn’t a winning basketball player high stats low impact type of guy same as Kevin love until love changed his game.
Yes but remember that LeBron gave Kevin Love depression
The Cavs are paying Kevin Love $30 million to be a janitor
Uhh Kelly Olynyk on Kevin Love ring a bell?
I mean Dragic tried all the same the first play I thought of when I saw this was the Kevin Love one.
Jokic Pau Gasol Marc Gasol Yao Ming Cousins Kevin Love.
"Jokic and Yao Ming are tops, though edge to Jokic  Pau Gasol and Mark Gasol  Kevin Love  DeMarcus Cousins"
Nikola Jokic   Pau Gasol  DeMarcus Cousins  Yao Ming   Marc Gasol   Kevin Love
Want the Cavs 2.0 experience we have a gently used Kevin Love on the market?
"Jokic, Yao, cousins, and gasol brothers and finally Kevin love."
Jokic  yao ming  pau gasol  marc gasol  Kevin love  demarcus cousins
Jokic &gt;&gt; Pau Gasol &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yao Ming &gt;&gt; DeMarcus Cousins &gt; Marc Gasol &gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin Love
"""Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"""
"Lets look at the timeline of events, shall we?  -	Cavs parts ways with David Griffin for….. some reason -	Interviews none other than Chauncey Billups for the GM job -	Kyrie forces his way off of the team. We get the corpse of IT, Jae Crowder and their first round pick (Colin Sexton) -	New GM Koby Autman starts a signing spree of random misfits: Derrick Rose and D. Wade (both on minimum contracts) -	LeBron calls Trump a bum on Twitter -	D. Rose steps away from the team mid season for personal reasons, considers retirement, had a weird report about him in a gym by himself -	Rose came back. Turned out he got married during his absence? -	Lue takes a leave of absence for health issues -	Cavs hold a team meeting. IT and Wade reportedly called out Kevin Love for leaving a game early due to an illness. Turned out that Love had a concussion -	Report comes out mid season that Kyrie threatened to get knee surgery if he wasn’t traded -	Love fractures a bone in his hand in mid January. -	An ESPN article “reveals” that LeBron may consider leaving the Cavs to join the….. Warriors? -	Feb 7: IT pleads the Cavs not to trade him. Says he is tired of being traded -	Feb 8: IT gets traded -	Cavs also trade Wade for basically free and sends Derrick Rose to Minnesota. In return, they received Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, LNJ -	JR smith throws a bowl of soup at Damon Jones -	TMZ revealed TT cheated on a Kardashian -	LeBronto sweeps the raptors -	JR Smith loses game 1 with one of the worst plays in NBA history. LeBron had a historic scoring night -	LeBron punches a white board, breaks his hand. Cavs lose the Finals  Yeah, I’d say that was definitely a weird team to say the least"
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
“Remember when Kevin Love locked down Curry?”  Great example my ass
Porzingis for Kevin Love.
Only guys (from the 40 highly-paid players this season) that might be in the conversation for that title are Otto Porter Jr and Kevin Love.
kevin love wasn't really a star player
"I mean every chip Lebron won had AD, Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade.  He had two finals runs in the east as a solo star but got **swept** **both times** by real contenders (spurs/warriors) when he faced them.  I don't think any nba player, even lebron, can get it done on a 1 star team."
Kevin Love would be good on the Mavs tbh.
I'd take Kevin Love over KP right now
Kevin Love says hello
Would you be interested in a well used Kevin Love?
At least Kevin love won them a ring.
Kevin Love vibes
"Ya, you're downplaying the Raptors championship when they went through Philly who was stacked and a flawed but good Bucks team.   Ya the warriors got hurt but then you can point out so many other championships like last year's Lakers when Dragic and Bam got hurt, 2018 warriors when CP3 got hurt, 2015 warriors when Kevin Love and Kyrie got hurt.  Besides, what does that have to do with Casey? You clearly never watched him coach in the playoffs if you think he wins a championship with the same roster. He literally made 0 adjustments during the playoffs in his time with the Raptors whereas Nurse did and they all actually paid off."
Lfg Kevin love that attitude! Get aggressive
Almost as cringe as “Lebron gave Kevin Love depression”
The same Kevin Love that averaged 8 points on 26% shooting in a Finals.
Maybe because Lebron and Kyrie were the better players who were more important in winning a championship than Love. Why the fuck would you want Kevin Love taking more shots when you have Lebron and Kyrie Irving
"Yes, Kevin Love who averaged 26/12 the year before joining the cavs."
"KG, KAT, Kevin Love."
My favorite is when he made that 3 against the Wizards. Idk what year it was but it was after a full court pass from Kevin Love with around 2 sec. to play.  That was one of the most incredible shot I've ever seen. The looks on the crowd's faces told me that that was the case for a lot of people.
"Kevin love has always been a great rebounder. WB is the best rebounding PG outside of simmons, and harden is a good rebounder for a guard in his own right."
Damn that gave Kevin love depression
Kevin Love is up there
i don't know man. Supreme leader Kevin Love owns the East...Robin Lopez will certainly be crucial in this war
"Or if they can't sign new players they can trade for a veteran player. Someone like Paul George, Kevin Love, Porzingis, Wall."
"Nah, there’s way too much money and press involved in the league. Its not a knock, but we won’t get MWP/Artest freakouts , but probably more Kevin Love like breakdowns."

My point being theres been big men with great stats that didn't translate to winning. Kevin love Anthony davis are also examples of this
Kevin Love missed game 6 and 7 too. Crazy
"I do deny that. I’ve been on this sub for like almost a decade and I distinctly remember people clowning on Kevin Love. And he’s far from a loved player in the league right now within this community.   For reasons that he brought upon himself. Just like PG13. He’s made some clown comments in the past that people didn’t like and it has nothing to do with his race. They call him Pandemic P because he hit the side of the backboard. Not because he’s black.   And he’s getting clowned now because he blamed everything on Doc and is about to get swept by a team they tanked to play. Not because he’s black.   You’re always going to have outlier idiots who are straight up racists, but be careful labeling an entire community anything."
"r/nba as an example. Constantly bullies and talks shit about Paul George. Other plays as well (Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell, etc.,) but mainly PG13. When he has spoken out about his mental health and how he deals with anxiety due to all of the jokes and vile comments about him on the internet, r/nba ridicules him and spouts off about ""pandemic pee XDDD"" jokes.  Compare that to Kevin Love. r/nbas mental health darling. Not saying that this sub is racist, but definitely racially insensitive. You can't deny that. That's not even going into the plethora of people who refer to black players as thugs or shit like that."
"Hayward wasn’t nearly the player Melo was. Kevin Love was traded for.  There is obvious racial bias in the world and in sports, but this isn’t one of them."
"Nah, it won’t be. That’s like saying Pippen’s, Pau Gasol, Chris bosh, Kyle Lowry, Kevin love, Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, James Worthy, just to name a few all have tainted legacies too? You’re just being a Unibrow hater."
"Harden played with Chris Paul and had an arsenal of great shooters around him. LeBron had Kevin Love and he was in the East. Curry played with Draymond Green who’s useless unless he has a great team around him, and was in the West. LeBrons 2018 run was still more impressive, but Steph definitely definitely deserves a pass for this season."
Wait so does that mean the warriors ring in 2015 is fake? Kyrie and Kevin love were hurt
"Lol Ja Morant on Kevin Love was obviously a foul too. If you do a huge poster, it's blithely accepted, even if there's a foul, cause it's so cool."
Kevin Love would like a word.
Kevin Love?
"Kevin love and Hayward were quality players in their prime, love made a couple all NBA teams and all star teams"
Kevin Love and Gordon Hayward probably the closest. Chet Holmgren coming up tho
John Stockton? Larry Bird? Steve Nash? Kevin Love?
"41% on 2 less attempts a game.  Steph Curry creates his own shots, his off ball movements to get open looks is unparalleled. I love Klay, but he benefited greatly from the gravity of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant generating open looks for him. I severely doubt his ability to shoot that effectively as the number 1 option of a team."
AD is a great rebounder and known as soft. Same with Kevin love.
If Kawhi leaves? PG stays because they'll have no choice.  PG will instantly become Kevin Love in Cleveland with his contract. His career would be on hold until that runs out IMO.
Kevin Love for Kennard and two seconds
Kevin Love is arguably the second best flamethrower in the league behind Klay. He's had a 30+ point quarter and tons of other quarters where he couldn't miss. But I'd look dumb as hell if I tried to claim that he was as good at offense as James fucking Harden.
I still think the warriors win that series. Kevin love was absolutely useless against the warriors and the warriors were actually healthy in 2015 as opposed to 2016  The Cavs in 2016 were also just better as an overall team than they were in 2015
If a player has 40% chance to hit a contested shot to win ... that means he has a 60% chance to miss and lose the game. Give me the 60%. Even Kevin Love was able to stop Curry for one play
"Miami Heat: Dwyane Wade (13x All-Star, 1x Finals MVP, 8x All-NBA, 3x All-Defensive, 1x Scoring Champion) and Chris Bosh (11x All-Star, 1x All-NBA, HoF 2021)  Cleveland Cavaliers: Kyrie Irving (7x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, 50-40-90 club) and Kevin Love (5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, NBA MIP, 1x Rebounding Champion)  For almost all of the series with that heat team, Dwyane Wade would have been the best player on the court without LeBron. Some series Chris Bosh would have been the best behind them too. Kyrie would have been the second best player in the Atlanta series and the Detroit series in 2016. Kevin Love was also better than anyone on Detroit and probably Atlanta too. DeMar DeRozan was incredible in 2016 but although he was considered ahead of Kyrie, it's not open and shut 100%. so there's an argument that LeBron's team still had the best player on the court without him all the way until they faced Curry in the finals  He's LeGM for a reason"
"LeBron had to take his ass to Miami because he couldn't win shit and Cleveland, then bounced back to Cleveland to team up with a promising Kyrie and Kevin Love(who was actually good at that time and not a catch and shoot player) then bounced when things were hard on the Cavs! Sign with the Lakers and missed the playoffs then recruited AD and trade a bunch of players! Fuck off with the bullshit about ""KD joining a 73 win team to win a championship"" like LeBron hasn't been jumping teams and going wherever he thinks he has higher chances to win.   KD is coming off an Achilles injury and it's putting great numbers on great efficiency.  If you think KD is not valuable to the team he has played for just look at OKC and GS after he left them, both team missed the playoffs several times."
"Same issue with Kevin Love, joined Lebron and just was not nearly as great. He was an all star, but not dominant by any means like Kyrie who can take over a game"
I love Kevin Harlan
"Big 3 Celtics, Big 3 Thunder, Big 3 Spurs. Those are all superteams especially if you're counting a team with Kevin Love as a superteam. Lord knows who you think the 3rd star on the Lakers is."
"a better player cant join a lesser player? there is a reason kd was the one winning the finals mvps when they were together. and just to quote kerr.Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."" also he once said “I would say Kevin (Durant) is ... when you factor in everything, size, speed, athleticism, I think he’s the most talented basketball player I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kerr said.  “It was more just a level of basketball that I’m not sure had ever been reached before.”"
I love the duo of Reggie and Kevin
i love people in here saying what boston should change. bruh. we are gonna get destroyed either way. they have KYRIE. KEVIN DURANT. JAMES HARDEN. and a bench. the league is broken. its over theres nothing we can do
LMAO Kevin Love is fully DOGGING it. He's not even hiding it anymore.
Like Kevin Love and Al Horford?
Joe Harris is like a reliable Kevin Love
Kevin Love actually
All you need is good PF next to KAT - you should try Kevin Love!
I'm fine mate. what if i said some BS like kevin love never won any meaningful games. do you agree? Because you said arsenal underacheived and you thought they 'won very little'. It makes no sense.
Nuggets: Jokic  Jazz: Mitchell  Blazers: Roy  Thunder: KD  T-Wolves: Garnett  Lakers: Kobe  Kings: Bibby   Suns: Nash  Clippers: Kawhi  Warriors: Curry  Spurs: Parker  Mavs: Luka  Grizzlies: Gasol (Marc)  Rockets: Harden  Pelicans: Davis  Bucks: Giannis   Pacers: Miller   Pistons: Drummond   Cavs: Kevin Love
"Lebron's had as many injuries as anyone particularly ankle injuries. He has just played through them. Chris Paul pulling his shoulder in game 1 would be enough for some guys to miss the whole playoffs like Kevin Love did in 2015.  &gt;Not even sure what this means, or how it relates at all.  Because it takes mental toughness to take all the criticism he does and not go crazy.  &gt;Or show up to defend getting swept in the Finals with a cast saying your hand is ""basically broken.""  He was hiding that injury until the media found out.  &gt;Sam Amick of USA Today reported that James “only wore the cast because he had already been told that the news was out.”  &gt;Amick also reported that news of the busted hand did not come from LeBron’s camp.  https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation/  This site has pictures of hand through the series. You tell me if he was injured or not.  &gt; Or decide that all of a sudden you have a limp?   No idea what you're talking about. Just because Op from that post from yesterday says Lebron is walking with a limp doesn't mean he is. He clearly wasn't."
For real how trash the Celtics gotta be for Kevin love to drop 30/14 on them
Though one IMO.   Also If you swap Kevin Love and Draymond I’d pick the Cavs over Steph Klay and KD
"“IS THIS THE DAGGER”    “OHHHHHHHHHHHHH”  That moment was made legendary by the call, love you Kevin Harlan"
Kevin Love. /s
So he's a Kevin Love great stats for a bad team type player?
"This is ""he gave Kevin love depression"" levels of insanity. Jesus Christ reddit go fuck yourselves for upvoting this shit"
Wanna know who would be a great fit next to Zion?  Kevin Love
"It kinda reminds me of what we had with Jerry West. Even though he was just a consultant, his opinion was highly regarded on pretty much all front office decisions, most notably the potential Klay-Kevin Love trade that he strongly vetoed and the KD recruitment. Having that kind of figure with a magic touch in your front office is huge. We haven't been the same since he left"
kevin love. he would hurt the cavs chances by not being on the team and would be a plus on the warriors
"God i fucking love kevin harlan, can him, mike breen and ian eagle just commentate every game lmao"
Floor-spacing big man with playoff experience?   # ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE KEVIN LOVE
LMAO Lebron dragged Kevin Love and JR Smith to finals. They should have made the playoffs with the talent they had it was a failure. Can you imagine if Lebron would miss the playoffs 2 years in a row?
I also would have accepted Kevin Love posts up CJ Miles 3 times.
"So this has nothing to do with any other player. And like I just said, he can do whatever he wants.  LeBron simply gets too much credit for contending every year. Casuals see the consecutive finals appearances and don't see the price the franchises paid to contend. The Cavaliers post-2018 lost Kyrie, overpaid Tristan Thompson. overpaid Kevin Love and have been awful. LeBron didn't have to deal with any of that. He went to Los Angeles, teamed up with Davis and won another ring.  The Cavaliers are going to be paying for that championship for years going forward.   It's unsustainable to contend. It drains every bit of assets a team has. When it's over, the team is in shambles usually.   LeBron is able to contend so much because he's not responsible for that cost. It's not his problem."
"Never forget how he pretended to read The Godfather too, made sure he got caught reading on camera, and then when asked his favorite part he hit them with the “Oh man there’s too many to choose from”   Or when he called out Kevin Love with the “don’t fit out, fit in” Instagram selfie   Or when he waited until after the finals to come in with a cast on in the press conference   The list goes on and on"
"The box out by Chris Paul reminded me a lot of the one Kelly Olynyk had against Kevin Love in the playoffs. I never know how hurt Lebron is, it always seems like he’s playing it up but he never misses time due to injury"
"I watch plenty of ball but nice try at gatekeeping. You also gave the most braindead 10 year old undisputed take and acted like cuz u watch get up in the morning ur dropping knowledge.   If “knowing more than me” entails thinking the best way to utilize ad the same way u utilize bosh and fuckin kevin love, have fun in ur trove of basketball knowledge.   36 year old lebron isnt the same as 28 year old bron bud, the lakers offense needs to work around him and utilize ad not as fuckin kevin love lol. It aint hero ball."
Bro I have hated Jelly Olynyk with a fiery passion ever since.  Robbed us of what I think would have been an all time great finals with a healthy Kevin Love. It’s no bull shit no matter if it helps the team you are rooting for or not.  My downvotes are from salty fans of mediocre teams/franchises that don’t want me shitting on their few mediocre “accomplishments” 😂
"&gt; You think LeBron just lacks the vision to find gaps in a scrambling defense? Really?   LeBron's teams have run the offense LeBron wants to run. If LeBron wanted to find scrambling, moving guys, his teams would have scrambling, moving guys. I'm not going to say what LeBron can't do, I'll just talk about what he chooses to do, and chooses to not do.   When everybody's moving, the passer has less control over the timing - LeBron CLEARLY wants the offense to flow on his tempo. Generally I think most teams are much better off with players moving and cutting all the time, but I think a LeBron-led team might be the exception, because of his unique passing greatness, which leverages the threat of his physicality.   LeBron's had guys who could shoot on the move - Kevin Love and Kyrie clearly aren't Curry and Klay, but Kevin Love was generally much better and more valuable on the move than just standing at the arc, LeBron wanted him standing at the arc. In fact, you might remember, if you were watching back then, how it was a point of contention how he turned Love into a jump shooter.   I think that this is because LeBron focuses his attention on the help defender, and so he wants the offensive player to be exactly where he expects him to be. But that's just speculation based on years of watching him play. Nobody's asked him about this, to my knowledge.   I wouldn't be playing Drummond much (or at all) either, if I had complete control of the lineups of the Lakers, but for all you clearly want to blame Vogel for that, the reason why the Lakers play Drummond so much isn't because of Vogel."
"The Kevin love part is perfect.  He put up all star stats on a bad team. Same as young and booker.   When it came time to playing really good teams in the playoffs, he couldn’t stay on the floor in some matchups   Booker and young need to prove it in the playoffs, until they do, you can’t give them that credit/reputation"
yeah prety much. Kevin love is the perfect example. He was putting up 26/14 but he was never good enough to be a true offensive engine or elite first option and then his defense was so bad at an important position that he couldnt contribute as a secondary player.   A guy like trae is clearly good enough offensively to be the #1 guy for a championship team. It still remains to be seen whether his defense will be enough to be covered for but he can clearly command a top level offense. And booker has shown he can be a top level scorer as well.
"The rule states that people on the bench must “remain in the immediate vicinity of their bench,” not that you can’t place a single foot in bounds ([source section VII Part C](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-12-fouls-and-penalties/). I think he was clearly in the immediate vicinity of the bench and absolutely 0 risk to add to the fight from there.  The league set a similar precedent for this when they [didn’t suspend Kevin Love](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/06/01/kevin-love-not-suspended-game-2-nba-finals) for being on the court during an altercation in game 1 of the 2018 finals."
"Don’t forget that was kyrie’s first playoff stint, he wasn’t as polished as he is now. He was only averaging 19/3.8/3.6 over 13 games on bad efficiency during that playoff run. Not to mention Kevin love was kinda underwhelming that year and the following year in the playoffs"
"Exactly. Oh let's not forget AD, D Wade, Chris Bosh, and Kevin Love."
Bruh he had Kyrie and Kevin Love. lmao. Kyrie in fact made the clutch shot that let them win that chip.
Do Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving not exist to you?
"2020 - Heat had Bam and Dragic banged up last year (Lakers still probably would have won, but no guarantees)  2019 - Raptors you acknowledged already  2018 - CP3 going down for the Rockets in the WCF up 3-2  2017 - Kawhi going down for the Spurs in [game 1](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201705140GSW.html) in the WCF after being up 20 points at halftime. (Warriors likely win the series still but this injury made it a sweep).   2016 - An underrated storyline of Cleveland's comeback from 3-1 is that  [Andrew Bogut](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html) went down in the NBA Finals and the Warriors had no rim protection after that. Given how close the series was, very well could have been talking about the Warriors completing the best season ever.  2015 - No Kevin Love and Kyrie going down in Game 1 of the [NBA finals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html) against the Warriors. Given how LeBron played this series if they are fully healthy I think the Cavaliers win instead of losing 4-2.   2014 - No major injuries that I can see that would have really changed anything  2013 - None that I can see  2012 - None that I can see  2011 - None that I can see   ----  I would say that injuries have played a fairly big factor since 2015"
i love angsty emo kevin
Didn't Kevin Love get injured against Boston in 2015?
Kevin Love would like a word.
2015 Kevin Love against the Warriors scored 16.5 PPG on 67% TS%
Kevin Love is a non-factor but Kyrie looked like the difference. And it showed the following year.
KD haters...LeBron got his titles with  2-Wade and Bosh 1-Kyrie (ironic). (Kevin Love too but he was injured for thhe finals 1-Anthony Davis
I didn’t realize that Bam and Dragic equated Kyrie and Kevin Love… hmm.
"Offense is more important than defense, and both 2015 Kyrie Irving and 2015 Kevin Love were net positives when they were on the floor."
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Kevin love at 5th in the 08 draft as well.
If Kevin Love doesn't get hurt in that Boston series then game 1 of the Finals doesn't go to OT and Kyrie doesn't split his kneecap.
"How is he still on your cap? The CBA allows a player to retire for medical reasons (which Deng obviously qualifies for) and his salary (which he still gets in full) comes off the cap one year after his last game played.  I keep hoping Kevin Love will do this, but with only two years left on his contract it would be too late unless he medically retires this summer. If he'd retired this way last summer, we'd be done with his contract now and probably also have the best lottery chances in the upcoming draft."
Kevin Love says no
"Can't always get Kevin Harlan unfortunately. I love Doris though, my favorite fake news headline was that one that said she was ballin out with Harden at a strip club."
Some surprising entries here were:  - Boris Diaw with a 11/16/11/3/2 statline - Vucevic with a 20/29 (!) game - Kevin Love with a 31/31 (!) game back in his Wolves days   - Defensive specialist Lou Williams with a 31pts 10 STEALS game
"Would love to watch Kevin Costner play Kevin Durant in a movie. They’re both Kevins, it makes sense to me."
"Kevin Love wasn't the best return, but LeGM definitely helped the Cavs out by getting rid of Wiggins and Bennett. Those guys would have been crucified in the playoffs and Wiggins probably would be a worse player than he is now."
So you are saying Kevin Love is not being referenced here by Dray
So not Kevin Love then? If you're going to say Love you kinda have to say Bosh too.
Kevin Love and soon to be KAT
"There's so much wrong here lol but I'll just ask, do you seriously think that 2018 Cavs teams wasn't a terrible situation? Also, Kevin Love simply wasn't nearly as good as he was in Minnesota, he consistently underperformed in those playoff runs, he shouldn't get much more credit than a really good role player does for what he contributed. Just because you played good defense on Curry on a possesion doesn't mean we can just forget that he averaged 8 ppg on 36% shooting during the series.  And although Bosh was much better during his time with Lebron, he also had a decline and there were multiple series in which he was really underwhelming and sometimes Lebron had to carry the team. He got completely outplayed on both ends by Roy Hibbert in the ECF and then went on to have 0 points in a game 7 of the Nba finals. Again, he deserves credit for serving the role of an amazing role player during that series but this idea that Lebron had players around him performing like stars all the time is ridiculous."
"Bird joined a 29 win team - it wasn’t a super team until he got there, then won 61 with him as a rookie.  They had all the same starters outside of Bird the 29 win year...  Lbj added 18 wins as a rookie, more than half of Bird. When lebron and Bosh joined the Heat, it only added 11 wins though. When he joined the Cavs in 2015 (with Kevin love and lots of veterans), he added 20 wins."
Suspended Amare and Diaw for a pivotal game 5 in phoenix in 2007 against the Spurs after Horry hipchecked Nash into the scorers table. A decade later in a similar situtation the nba decided not to enforce the same stupid rule. https://arizonasports.com/story/1546265/steve-nash-wonders-nba-bench-rules-nba-finals-kevin-love/
And I don't think having JR as a teammate was all that fun for him. It would be like Kevin Love getting to play with Olynyk.
"C Larry Bird's shooting ability and just the way he shot the ball is such a matchup nightmare given his size, very good defender in his prime, and extremely high basketball IQ and Magic Johnson is the greatest passer of all time, it's not crazy to say Larry Bird is second so to have both Larry Legend and the Joker on the court as passing threats combined with how they can put the ball in the bucket, would be great ball movement and totally fuck up the defenses         And I I'm going with magic for the Clippers, it's very obvious that the Clippers have a leadership issue so the greatest point guard of all time should help , I would have picked Kevin Garnett just because I would love to see how that locker room would look lol but I had to make an honest election"
Kevin Love and Chris Bosh
Kevin love
"Jerebko played in the NBA until he was 32. Quinn Cook played this past season. Bell is still on a two-way contract. Alfonzo McKinnie is still in the league. Looney is still in the league. Zaza, David West, and Livingston all retired. I’m not arguing that the bench was ungodly, but you’re point that the bench isn’t in the league even though they’re “in their primes” is simply incorrect.   Iguodala played 3 games. And losing Iguodala at that point wasn’t nearly as important as the Rockets losing CP3.   Losing a star player if you have two isn’t less of a big deal just because you have a better replacement player to put in. 1 All Star + a decent bench player isn’t better than 2/3 All Stars + a bad-to-average bench player. And it’s not like the Cavs bench was full of studs. Lebron losing Kevin Love for the whole series and Kyrie after game 1 is MUCH worse than the Warriors missing Iguodala for four games against the Rockets or missing Draymond for one game of the finals lmfao. The only year Golden State got fucked by injuries was against Toronto.   If you’re just going to use the “rigged” argument, I don’t know what to tell you. Draymond earned and deserved his suspension. Both teams were called for the same numbers of fouls, and the free throw disparity was 3. It wasn’t a close game. The Warriors scored 11 points in the first quarter. How exactly did the refs make that happen? It’s not like it came down to a last minute possession. Warriors got whooped.   The best team on paper doesn’t always win the championship. You’re acting like the Warriors just ran through the playoffs with no struggles for five years, and that didn’t happen."
I really love watching Kevin Durant. Not sure if people actually hate him or just like to clown him though
I bet you as soon as they ship Kevin Love he will start playing way better and actually produce. Just like Blake Griffin
the Kevin Love contract is one of the most baffling contact extensions i’ve seen in a long time.
CJ for Kevin Love and Prince who says no
Kevin Love. Due to his injuries and his contract people hate him. He managed to make the T-Wolves semi relevant for awhile and that alone is a miracle worthy of praise. He also was a huge reason the Cavaliers won a title.
My hatred of Kyrie Irving and mild dislike of Kevin Durant has made me love James Harden
"Kevin Love, but mostly for his off-court mental health advocacy."
"&gt; In any case, both of them were considered noticeably inferior to LeBron and Kyrie respectively at the time.   By the time they reached the finals? Are you insane?   By the time they reached the finals everyone understood Steph &gt; Kyrie and there was serious debate between Klay vs Kyrie with a sizeable # of people edging towards Klay because of his defense.  Also you keep going on and on about how the GSW crew was unestablished - Kyrie and Kevin Love **HAD LITERALLY NEVER BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS BEFORE THAT SEASON.**  Kyrie had never even won more than 33 games in a season before LeBron showed up ffs"
"So if you can't draft all your players then too bad? There are a variety of ways to build a competitive team and even ""super teams"" do it in different ways. If a front office is able to do quality trades or woo players to their org in free agency, I just don't see what the problem is. Hell the championship teams do a bit of both. The 2016 Cavs drafted Kyrie, signed Lebron as a FA because they had/made space, and used their assets to trade for Kevin Love. Is there anything wrong in building your team that way? It gets into this weird convo of what the ""right"" way to build a team is and it discredits how hard it can be to build a team in general."
Weren’t 3 of the 5 starters drafted by the Cavs though? 2 of those 3 were superstars too in Kyrie and Bron. The only non-drafted by the Cavs somewhat superstar star was Kevin Love. Shump and JR were far from stars at that point in their careers. I wouldn’t call that a super team.
"2014-15 was definitely one of the weaker MVP runs of the past decade. Steph winning that and Klay making the ASG was largely attributed to the team being surprisingly good at the time. In any case, both of them were considered noticeably inferior to LeBron and Kyrie respectively at the time. And Draymond was considered a defensive specialist that was nowhere near the established star status of Kevin Love. They were talented but the Cavs had markedly better top end talent."
And Kevin Love (a much more impactful player than Bogut) got a concussion and went AWOL. Tired of this excuse
Kevin love
That title will belong to Kevin Love.
Shaq: “… ain’t Kevin Love on one of those teams?”
"I love Chuck. He was hands down my favorite player growing up. I agree with this take. But... he probably shouldn’t be the one to be harping on this. In his second season, he was on a team with FIVE other Hall of Famers (Maurice Cheeks, Julius Erving, Bobby Jones, Moses Malone, and Bob McAdoo). In his first season with the Suns, he played with five guys who had at least one All-Star selection in their career (Danny Ainge, Cedric Ceballos, Tom Chambers, Kevin Johnson, and Dan Majerle). His first season with the Rockets, he played with Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, and two seasons later, they replaced Drexler with Scottie Pippen. And sure, he was traded to those teams and not a free agent, but if you think he didn’t have any say in where he went, you’re nuts."
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"&gt; Giannis, for the love of Christ, stop shooting threes.  I thought I was losing my mind. In what world those Giannis attempt the same amount of threes as Kevin Durant??"
"I wanna say PG, but he has a lot of time left.  Kevin Love"
Fuck Bud run a set for the love of god we shouldn’t be running more ISOs than a team with fucking Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"Kevin Durant couldn’t punch a hole in styrofoam, I’d love to see tucker kick his ass"
"Dwayne Wade and Lebron were two all NBA players before they teamed up and after they teamed up. Paul Pierce and Ray Allen weren’t in the couple seasons before they teamed up. Kevin Garnett was. Paul made it in the early 2000s, but wasn’t on it until the championship season. Everyone likes to say what you said, but no one recognizes this. Like do y’all not understand how big the decision was? I feel like people don’t recognize how good Wade was for the first half of his career. As much as I love them, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce were not consistent top 15 players. Dwayne Wade and Lebron James were."
"No NBA team from the 90s had close to any of the talent in 2021 or 2010s. The game exploded in popularity and talent because of MJ. You literally are harping on LeBron for things set in motion by MJ. LeBron went vs dynasty teams in Spurs and Warriors, 6 of his Finals appearances were vs those teams! MJ played vs a Utah team twice, Suns, Sonic, Portland, and a washed up Lakers. All these teams were good and had good players but none of them are the dynasty of Spurs or Warriors. They were playoffs exits with one or two Finals appearances, then the team gets blown up. Worst loss and really the only series LeBron should have lost was vs the Mavs, and even that team was a pretty good team, and LeBrons first year with a new team. Otherwise he lost to the Spurs and Warriors. You want to talk about staked talent? Look at that Thunder, Spurs, Warriors team. There's 3 Hall of famers on those squads atleast, and dominate players now. Who you got from MJs defeated Finals teams?2 on Jazz, 1 on Suns, 1 on Portland, 1 on Sonics, 2 on a washed Lakers  And you can keep that 6-0 scope on forever, but don't diminish what the Bulls team had as a consistent TEAM, and then try to harp on LeBron for being upset about the way the team is being ran. Barkley, Payton, Malone, Drexler all chased rings. Shaq dipped out of Orlando. Kobe was about to dip on the Lakers if they didn't get their shit together. Garnett chased. Ray Allen too. Kevin love, Bosh, hell even  Kareem. You act like these guys just want the full weight of the franchise on their back, and you don't even realize how hard that is I guess for even MJ. I mean the whole story is about overcoming the Pistons, so obviously MJ wasn't carrying his teams to the Finals, nor would he have won many if he did in the early years. He even realized he had to get better and the team had to get better around him. Not sure why you think that dimishes MJ, it just further shows the strength of the Bulls. It's like the Lakers with Shaq/Kobe, yeah they were dominate, but you needed guys like Fisher, Horry, Fox, etc to step up and bring the skill floor up, instead of raising the skill ceiling. Guys like Grant, Kerr, Rodman, Pippen, Kukoc.   That's exactly why these franchises rely on their stars like Dame in Portland. Dames great and amazing, but the dropoff is huge after that."
"Would you count the 2015 Cavs as a superteam? They obviously signed Lebron in FA, and they also traded for Kevin Love who was at the time widely viewed as a top 15 player and was coming off of a second team All-NBA selection. They went from a single star to a star trio including the best player in the world in a single offseason."
he was basically a throw-in in the kevin love trade after his rookie year lol
"I don't know about who would, but I can tell you who won't....  Kevin Love."
"I guess we’d protect Sexton, Garland, Okoro, Allen, Nance, Hartenstein, Dean Wade, and Lamar Stevens. Have fun with Cedi and Kevin Love!"
"Well its the system that wins games and championships. Kevin Love as a #1 or #2 option isnt winning basketball. (Thats who im assuming you're talking about) Because if anything all those players careers are much better with a ""NBA Championship"" on their resume. Chris Bosh could have went anywhere else and just score a bunch of points but then he'd just be looked at as ""empty stats"" guy for his whole career instead of a proven Hall Of Famer NBA Champion."
God I fucking love Kevin Harlan
We also coulda traded g Harris etc for kevin love
I think this list makes sense. At first I thought I read Kevin Love and I was like what's wrong with you😂
"Lol yeah lets just ignore:  ""LeBron gave Kevin Love depression""  ""LeBron started superteams""  ""LeMicky Ring""  Not to mention everyone repeated misrepresentation of the hong kong comments, where LeBron was referring to Morey being uneducated about the possible consequences to the NBA and its employees in China, both financially and physically, not being uneducated about what's happening in hong kong   Im not trying to compare it to how Jordan was treated because social media and the internet has wholely changed the medias role in literally everything, so thats a stupid comparison to try to make, but the media just cares about clicks, and NBA media has unfairly grilled LeBron plenty of times for clicks"
"The vast majority of those people don't truly know him. People used to say LeBron was a horrible teammate, that he gave Kevin Love depression, etc; but it seems as though most of his former teammates love him. He's definitely made mistakes, especially with that Morey incident, but he's human.   Objectively speaking, he does a lot more good for the community than harm, considering the biggest criticisms people have against him are things he said, not actions he takes."
"more than 2....  Nash, Kidd, Kevin Johnson and now Chris Paul... they also had Stephon Marbury, Bledsoe, Dragic... Suns love their PGs."
Kyrie &amp; Kevin Love
Kevin Love
I love Kevin Harlan so much
"I love you Kevin Harlan and Reggie Miller (wait, I take that Reggie Miller love back, I ain’t forget what he would do to us in the playoffs)"
"Scene 3 - JR Smith shows up at the apartment with a Tupperware full of Hennessy-soaked beets and Kevin Love as his ""date""."
"Ohhh, my bad lol.   &gt;I'm just saying it's completely different from LeBrons superteams.  Yeah it's different in that KD wasn't traded to Golden State. Not sure how that is better though? AD was traded for the 4th pick, an All-Star, and then some. Kevin Love was traded for Andrew Wiggins(highly valued at the time lol). Not saying it's worse either. Neither Golden State or KD had any obligation to compensate OKC for KD leaving. Just saying that it's still superteam buidling."
Fair points. How would you feel about a Kevin Love swap? Intriguing
"Kevin Love is on maybe the worst contract in the league. Plus, he’s had issues with the young players"
"$24m is a fucking bargain for a guy who still the best help defender in the league, one of the best overall defenders in the league, a guy who isn't just a great individual defender but tells his whole team where to be, calls out sets and coverages, etc.   It's a fucking bargain when that guy is also one of the best passing/play-making bigs in the league, not that far from LeBron in assist percentage (i.e. he's the guy racking up most of the assists while on the floor, helped by some Curry gravity of course).   Would you rather be paying...  $27.5m for Al Horford?  $31m for Kevin Love?  $28.5m for Otto Porter?  $19.2 for Gary Harris?  $36.6m for Blake Griffin (his salary this season before being bought out)  $15m for Andre Iguodala?  $17m for Rickey Rubio?  $24m for LMA, his salary before his heart issues forced him into early retirement?  Here, I'll even get controversial, is Russell Westbrook at $41m really more valuable than Draymond at $24m?  Draymond's extension was 100% team friendly."
"Using CBS rankings only taking American players ranked 75 or after could field a team of   PG: Derick White, Pat Bev  SG: Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry  SF: Joe Ingles, Mikel Bridges, Otto Porter  PF: PJ Tucker, Jerami Grant  C: Kevin Love  &amp;#x200B;  Team would get wrecked by the American # 1 Team, but its not bad"
"Also the fact that Blake was All-NBA in 2019, when was the last time Kevin Love was good?"
"&gt; I'm not sure what use the clippers have for him though.  Kennard's '22 salary + Pat Bev's expiring contract add up to $29 million.  Could be used to trade for a disgruntled vet like Kevin Love, Al Horford, maybe even KP if the Mavs change course and decide to move him.  I'm not saying that that's likely but it's one way his salary can be used.  Clips have their '21 1st round pick and a boatload of early 2nds to sweeten any potential deals.  I actually like Kennard as a player.  He seems to have gotten over the bi-lateral knee tendinitis that slowed his development in Detroit.  I feel like he could be a Joe Harris type player in a couple years but with more playmaking ability."
"We don’t want Kevin love lol, he’s just worse older porzingis   I’m not the biggest kemba fan but cmon, that’s pretty garbage"
"only the cavs say yes to this. lol wtf. the last thing the mavs need is an aging, undersized scoring guard that is starting to show wear and tear.   celtics don't want kevin love either."
Kevin Love fit in better
I don't think you've watched Kevin Love play recently
"Luka demands a trade if they do this. Kevin Love is an older, worse version of Kristaps"
Everyone besides Kevin Love would say no
Meaning you need to do better than those two and Kevin Love is most certainly not that.  Williams in particular is probably going to bust out big time next season.  He just changes games when he's out there on both ends of the court.  In 23 minutes as a starter this year he was putting up a 10/8/3 with 2 blocks while limited by an injury.  Only thing holding him back from being an absolute force is his health.  Last thing the Celtics want is some over the hill vet to take minutes from Williams next year.    And TT is a perfectly solid tough/rebounding big when needed.  Celtics front court is not the issue - they were actually a good rebounding team.  Health and Kemba were the big issue this year.
"That's a stretch in my opinion. We're comparing a dude who's now fighting for a legit championship (who mind you was considered an absolute abomination just a few months ago)...to a dude stuck in CLE. Kevin Love on BKN would be absolutely nasty. Him stretching the floor alongside Kyrie, KD, Harden and Harris would be even more impossible to defend....Right now I like that Griffin's playing relatively good D and if Love was anchoring the defense there's a good chance he'd be obliterated by Jrue/Giannis, but I think it's an unfair comparison."
Kevin Love is Blake Griffin with temper tantrums at this stage of his career(ie a backup) so would be a no from me if I were Boston. Hell Blake is arguably better
"yeah but in his prime he couldn't stop KD, and that's not a knock against PJ because I absolutely love him  god has not yet created a human being physically capable of preventing kevin durant from scoring for any length of time"
"It's pretty sad, like the gratification they get from bad games from him is definitely weird now  Especially knowing how he spoke out about how it was affecting him mentally in the bubble. Same subreddit that upvoted that ""LeBron gave Kevin Love depression"" thread 😂"
Never forget that he also gave Kevin Love depression.
1. Kevin Love was well in his prime at that time. 2. I did say KD did it better did I not? My point is that both did superteams. was there another team you thought was favored to beat the Cavs then?
"ahh the Derozan led Raptors? where Kevin Love averaged 20/11? and JR shot 77% from 3? damn KD wishes he had that kind of spacing and got to play Derozan in the West  Lebron def carried against the Celtics...led by an 18 year old Tatum? is that really the best competition the East has to offer? KD was beating the defending champ Mavs, Duncan-Spurs, and Kobe-Lakers at 22  why are you just looking at the Warriors? I asked if you name any season in his entire career twhere he performed poorly with proper spacing? can't you find any in his 9 OKC years?"
"If you think Kyrie + out of prime Kevin Love is even remotely comparable to Draymond + Steph + Klay, then you're probably dull enough to be convinced of anything."
"You can say hingsight all you want, but Kevin Love at that point was a top 3 PF in the game. It was him, Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge. It's funny how Bosh was also a top 10 player in the NBA when the Heatles came together and in that team, his numbers also went down drastically and most called him overrated. Now, Bosh was better than Love as he could actually move his feet and defend, but he was usually the scapegoat when things went wrong for the Heatles."
"And Lebron played with Prime Dwade and Bosh, Kyrie and Kevin love."
"I’m not sure what you were watching but they certainly let Curry play 1 on 1 for the majority of the series . You’d think if he were getting doubled and tripled curry could get above 7 assist especially during those finals games when it matters most but nope not even with the amazing shooters he played with. Even if the Cavs were playing let’s focus on Curry and Curry only who’s going to stop him Kyrie Irving , jr Smith , Kevin Love ? Stop it ! As I stated Shaun Livingston played much better when Curry was off the floor , not next to curry but when curry was on the bench . For those games Curry had an average plus minus of -5 , he was hurting his team more than helping them. I’m using stats because what else am I going to use to prove he isn’t unguardable… he’s getting shut down by Delly a nobody and Irving a below average defender! imagine he played in a more physical era where guys like Gary Payton and Dennis Johnson could hound him the second he crosses the half court line . Curry has some major flaws all together especially on the defensive side of the ball but that’s a story for another day . I’m just sick of people overstating how great he is when he couldn’t even lead his team to the playoffs this season …. Yet people were calling for him to win the mvp ? absolutely delusional thoughts by fan boys. To make matters worse people try disrespecting the true all time great players by saying Curry is a top 10 player of all time , someone needs to stop the madness because 7 prime years doesn’t get you close to being a top 20 let alone top 10 all time great player . Curry has had great success in the nba and in the playoffs for sure he’s a no doubt HOFer just need to pump the breaks with saying he’s unguardable and he’s an all time top 10 player because those are such bogus , biased narratives that completely ignore the nba’s history !"
That pick helped us suck enough to get No. 1 Wiggins pick to trade for Kevin Love who stopped curry but is now a contract albatross soooo thanks?
Kevin Love also had LeBron. D Wade also had LeBron. Bosh also had LeBron. Why are you punishing Kyrie for playing great and ignoring All stars that regressed in play when they played alongside LeBron?  Kyrie and Harden have KD right now. What is your thought process?
"If forced to take a player between Wiggins and Kevin Love, all 30 teams would take Wiggins right now in a heartbeat."
"Boogie probably would have been similar to KAT now in Minnesota and Kevin Love/Boogie Cousins duo would have been something and Minnesota probably built a franchine around those two;  as for Grant, he most likely would still be announcing."
“Is Kevin Love going to walk away from tens of millions of dollars?”   No.  savedyouaclick
Because Kevin Love is doing his job. He has not performed to the level of even a 5 million dollar player much less 30.
I’m gonna guess you’re talking about the least valued number one pick? I’d say the Bennett draft and the answer is half of Kevin Love
"Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, and Andre Iguodala."
He can't guard any position never mind his own position. Meanwhile he can be locked up by anyone. The fantasy of having Kevin Love draw out centers to the perimeter disappears when teams just put a guard on him and he can't do anything to exploit it.
Kevin Love isn’t what he used to be obviously but he’s still a solid player when healthy he gets too much hate
The owner and GM saying they will be a playoff team is an obvious thing to say to sell tickets. But the team after Lebron left was: Sexton/ Hill - JR - Rodney Hood - Kevin Love - TT. If you thought that was a playoff team you're on crack.
They did give it an honest attempt. It's funny how you think the Cavs have a master plan to tank. They publicly said they were not tanking. Kevin Love was maxed. The whole crew from the previous finals run was brought back except for James. They just sucked.
What I'm talking about with Kevin Love has not thing to do with his play. Its is attitude and behavior on the court and in the locker room that seems to get excused
"Both of those have proven to be the correct judgements given that both guys would have left.   Just like when Celtics fans were mocked for not wanting to trade the Tatum and Brown picks with Smart and Crowder to pair Demarcus Cousins with IT. And the same package for Kevin Love.    Or when they didn't want to trade Smart and the Brown pick for Okafor and Nerlens Noel.   Celtics fans have been mocked for ""over valuing"" these guys but now they have two of the best, most valuable, young wings in the NBA."
Kevin Love  And we’ll throw in a 2nd rounder
Ideally that would be the case but no one seems to do this with Kevin Love.
Damn when did Kevin Love get bought out?
We kept Kevin love but not ty lue
"Kawhi is gonna have a Kevin Love/ LaMarcus level decline due to his injuries, sad but true"
Take your Suns for example.  I'm sure the coaches would want option to play Kevin Love instead of Frank Kaminsky if Ayton was in foul trouble.  Gives them extra flexibility.
Kevin love outlet pass better than anything yall can think of on god lol
Kevin Love
Kevin Love on vet min would benefit every team in the league imo
"Based on what? Kevin Love hasn’t played meaningful minutes in what, 3 years? Plus his attitude is complete shit. Why would anyone want that on their roster"
Kevin Love got hurt. He's just way too talented/smart/skilled to be done. Dude might not be what he once was but he can totally be that guy who joins a contender and shows up in a few massive moments to push them over the top.
"Yup, the problem is having Kevin Love who was terrible matchup wise against the Warriors. If the Cavs could replace him with AD, I think they have a fair shot but it's nowhere near a guarantee they win. If you also add Kawhi, they win  EDUT: Wait fuck, the 2018 Cavs didn't have Kyrie. I was thinking about the 2017 Cavs. Well in that case, I don't think any single player would allow the 2018 Cavs to win - they'd need 2 (still replace Love with AD and add Kawhi)"
I’m not sure Kevin love has ever loved this game.
"Yes. It’s a real concern among Heat fans, which is why we’re pushing to flip him for Kevin Love, a proven champion."
Kevin Love to the Nets confirmed.
I’m tired of people acting like other people are stupid for saying Kevin love sucks bc he sucks ass
Yeah this particular quote sounds like it’s straight from Kevin Love
"A frontcourt of KAT and Kevin Love? In the west? Sign me the fuck up, all the bigs would feast on those 2."
An unofficial one online here on Reddit would be interesting and a shitstorm in the comments! As long as you're just judging playing ability and not saying racist shit I think it's fine to talk about. I was trying to figure out with my wife the other night who's the best white American guy in the NBA and it took us a long time. It was Kevin Love for a long time. But now? Brook Lopez maybe?
"Which is fair, and I should probably temper my ""Kevin Love shouldn't have..."" with a strong dose of ""the Cavaliers shouldn't have..."", but I have problems respecting someone who takes the bag and decides not to give a shit because the situation that he chose isn't up to his liking."
Kevin Love is giving off some serious Mike Love vibes
Lol is Kevin Love or anyone else gonna deny the bag when they offer? Grow up Peter Pan
"He dunked once and everyone thinks he's back to being a top 20 player.  I doubt KLove will retire, but he needs to get bought out or something, he is *not* worth his contract.  Also, Blake Griffin basically dragged the Pistons to the 8 seed in 2019 and played 35 minutes a game. I don't think Kevin Love has had a season like that in quite a while."
No the entire point of sports is to win nothing else matters. If you know for a fact no matter how hard you try that your team is going to win 30 or less games why try at all? Okay might as well go and collect your check and go home like Kevin Love already does. Maybe if you are a young player you should give effort so you can get better but someone like Love there is no point in it at all.
Kevin Love was so good in Minnesota. It's unfortunate that injuries and age have robbed him of so much. He had a higher vertical at the combine than Blake Griffin. He was one of the few dudes who could get you 20 boards while hitting 5 3's in a game.
"Yes uh, I’ll take one Kevin Love on the minimum please."
Kevin Love outlet passes
How were the Cavs supposed to compete when their best player was a totally washed Kevin Love lmao? Not like he was holding up his end of the bargain.
"for &gt;!kevin love!&lt; i went on bbref and started at this year's stats and sorted by ppg and went back until i found an identical ppg, rpg, and apg, as for &gt;!barkley!&lt;, someone else on here said it was him so i checked his stats on bbref and found the matching season"
I agree Kevin Love wipes Barkley
Kevin Love and Shaq’s punching bag
It’s time to accept that Kevin Love is a top 5 Power Forward of all time!
I can see the syracuse.com headlines now:  “NBA has-been and token white guy Kevin Love found face down in Onondaga Lake”
I'll never blame Kevin Love for saying yes when the Cavs offered him $120 million
i haven't been in a kevin love/cavs adjacent thread where people DIDN'T shit on k-love
"LeBron won his first MVP when Duncan was averaging 19/11/4 and All NBA Second Team. LeBron came in 2nd for MVP voting in 2006, Duncan was still only 29 years old. Only 6 of Duncan's 19 seasons was LeBron not in the league. LeBron was also a star by his second season, so Duncan played against MVP contender LeBron for 12/19 seasons, Duncan himself was an All NBA/All Star caliber player for 8 of those seasons.  Duncan and LeBron definitely had overlap. Even Durant was averaging 30, while Duncan was making All NBA teams. And the two of them had about 6 seasons of overlap where they were going head to head for All NBA spots.  For your Kobe comparison, I'd say Steph is a little different, because they did have 7 seasons of overlap, but in those 7 seasons, Steph didn't become a star until about 2015, not to mention Kobe missed an entire season and was ass his last two years. They really didn't overlap in their primes. Same with Kyrie, who wasn't even drafted until 2011, him and Kobe had like 2-3 seasons of overlap.  As for Westbrook, he 100% counts, he was an all star caliber guy by 2010, him and Kobe were competing for All NBA spots for a number of seasons, 100% a valid comparison.  Boozer was a 2x All Star and the best player on a team that made the WCF. Sure he's not a HOF guy, but he was still a solid player who was putting up 20 &amp; 12. Marion too was nothing to scoff at. 4x All Star who peaked at 22 &amp; 12 with great defense. Kevin Love was averaging 26/13/4, finished All NBA 2nd team and had two MVP finishes. Just because these guys aren't top 10 players of all time, doesn't mean they didn't have great seasons. You're really diminishing the impact some of these guys had.   PF being a historically weak position (which is a debatable claim at that) doesn't really matter, Duncan didn't play from 1950-PRESENT so it being 'weak' in the 50s and 60s is irrelevant. He spent his prime going head to head with 4 other PFs who are consensus top 25 players of all time.  Kobe spent his prime going against solid guards, but none of whom are really considered top 25 players outside of Wade. Nash and Kidd are pretty consensus top 40 guys, as is Iverson.  You can't seriously think that 00s guards were more stacked than 00s forwards. Part of guards being worse in the 00s at least early 00s was due to handchecking rules, those being removed allowed guards to dominate more a la Deron Williams, Steve Nash, Steph etc..."
Ah. You chose 2014 Kevin Love.
"Yeah, when I watch Kevin Love play basketball, the first thing that comes to mind is how much love he has for the game."
 JOHN WALL FOR KEVIN LOVE
"Kevin love has sucked for years now. He keeps getting injured, he’s slow, and he can’t protect the rim. He’s not gonna be a productive player on a good team again unless he like pops out skinny next season somehow"
"Yeah I think that’s what some people are forgetting about all this, Love was far and away the best player on those teams until Sexton’s second year. As we’ve seen before, if Kevin Love is your guy, then your team isn’t likely to go to far."
Player A = &gt;!2013-14 Kevin Love!&lt;  Player B = &gt;!1988-89 Charles Barkley!&lt;  lmao
"Kevin Love, Charles Barkley?"
Kevin Love looks like player A?
"You really out here talking about Carlos Boozer, Zach Randolph, and Kevin Love being ""stacked"" lol? Shawn Marion? lmao  And KD, Lebron, etc were after his time. I might as well say Kobe was going against prime Steph Curry and Kyrie and Westbrook..  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The 5 greatest PFs of all time  That's not saying much, PF is the historically weakest position"
"&gt; Not sure where all the ""you just can't lose Kevin Love for nothing"" are now.  As a Cavs fan and sub member...I can tell you your claim is something I rarely, if ever, saw. No one thought we couldn’t lose him for nothing, it was more we were fine overpaying him to say thanks for sticking with us, teach our youngins, be our tank commander. I was personally ok with it despite the realization it was a gross contract. If love stayed a great 20-10 guy with a super great attitude for our young guys I’d still make the overpay. But he veered off into sulk mode which really highlights the overpay."
"Kevin Love was supposed to be next in line in a long history of a Cleveland tradition.  Overpay a guy from the glory days to be the fan favorite, the loyalty guy who sticks around. It's a close cousin to the ""one last ride"" contract guys, like bringing back Delly last year.  When the contract was signed, I figured love would fall off, but he'd still a hardworking vet who said the right things and bridges the fans through the rebuild. The fact he was also a handsome white player probably also helped this idea focus group well amongst certain segments of Ohio-based fans.  Couldn't have predicted he'd fall off this hard and hate Cleveland this much. As a guy who lived my first 18 years there and couldn't wait to get out, can't say I'm completely surprised that him feeling stuck made him depressed."
Kevin Love cussed out the GM said fine me idc I get paid enough.   Smacked the ball out of someone’s hands during a game.   Leaked stuff in the locker rooms.    Didn’t inbound the ball.   Took the ball from a teammate and passed it hard at another fucking the play up.   And Kyrie has done what exactly that matches that type of on court disrespect.
"Kevin Love is producing a short film to follow Kobe's Dear Basketball titled Love, Kevin."
Kevin Love gonna end up on Brooklyn for cheap if the Cavs do this as badly as I think they will lol
Kevin Love... Uh.. 8 years ago.. mr outlet... I admit some of them were pretty badass.. but what happened to them? And the 25 rebound games?
There’s taking a backseat and there’s underperforming 4 years in a row during the LBJ era and whatever the fuck he’s been doing the past couple of years. Chris bosh took a backseat to win but he showed up and after Lebron left was still putting up 20&amp;7 before the clots. Kevin Love was putting up numbers on a bad team going nowhere
it’s cause r/nba thinks kevin love is more “classy”
Kevin love outlet passes is the only answer here. The man looked like a quarterback out there.
"Motherfucker gets a calf sprain and can't play for years?  Come the fuck on, the biggest place Kevin Love is injured is between the ears."
"If any other player quit in the middle of a game like Kevin Love, he’d be obliterated by the media and fans. His career is over"
The problem with Kevin Love he's he provides 0 defense at the 4 spot.   That's just unacceptable...I can't think of another power forward with this problem. I'm not sure how you build a decent line up around that without a guy like LeBron on the court as well.
"What's hilarious is all the people in this sub who were making straw man jokes saying saying only LeBron is worth the max.   Realistically, unless a player is top 10 or GM knows he is able to acquire one to pair with a top 20 max player already on their team, those contracts are absolutely horrible for teams in conjunction with the cap.  Not sure where all the ""you just can't lose Kevin Love for nothing"" are now."
"Kevin love doesn't want to be in Cleveland, Cleveland doesn't want Kevin love, but thier both stuck with each other because of a massive contract. There should be a rule about trade and renegotiating a contract"
Kevin Love doesn’t have sexual assault allegations in the past
"To be fair, making the playoffs when your best player is supposed to be Kevin Love has never happened."
"Huh?? Forwards were absolutely stacked in the 00s. All NBA are two forward slots, not just PF.  Dirk, Duncan, LeBron, Garnett, Pau, Stoudemire, Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Webber, Karl Malone, Barkley, Peja Stojakovic, Wallace, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion, Tracy McGrady (Houston he was a SF and was All NBA as a Forward), Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Carlos Boozer, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Zach Randolph etc.. all competing for All NBA honors.   Forward Slots were a lot harder to attain than Guard slots in the 00s. 10s not so much, but 2000s was the era of PFs. The 5 greatest PFs of all time (Duncan, Dirk, KG, Malone, Barkley) all played at the same time, and Dirk, Duncan and KG played for nearly 15 seasons side by side.   Kobe played 2 seasons alongside peak MJ, most of his career with Wade, and missed out on almost all of Harden's prime and wasn't playing when Jerry West was active. Kobe receiving more All NBA first teams isn't so much a matter of him being better but rather his position being less stacked during his prime."
"&gt; They thought about profit over anything else.  Giving Kevin Love $120 million to do nothing is ""thinking about profit""? They would have $120 million more profit if they hadn't done that."
"If we could just take a step back for one sec - Kevin Love is only 32 years old. He's not 38 or even 35. He should be on the tail end of his prime and his game by all means should have aged pretty okay.   I get the mental health stuff but I feel like he's mostly responsible for sabotaging his own career. He didn't have to sign a ludicrously lucrative contract with Cleveland, but he did knowing they were going to be the worst team in the league for the next five years (which anyone with a brain knew too).   Doing that then being pissy the whole time for the situation you agreed to is  wrong imo. I don't doubt he could still be a good backup big for a playoff team but the only way that's going to happen is after this upcoming season and only if he grows up and does his best with this Cavs team."
"It’s funny because DeMar was talking about mental health issues even before Love, but for whatever reason no one cared until Kevin said the exact same things."
"Robert Horry probably up there, but def Kevin Love is goat outlet"
"Kevin Love is by far the best outlet passer I've ever seen, he's pretty average at most every other type of pass though."
"&gt;The world where he signed his contract 4 years ago and his salary is not considered 'max' anymore. Max contracts are far more expensive than 30 mil per year. Do you consider CJ Mcollum to be on a max contract? Or kevin love to be on a max? They're paid the same amount. Only thing is Wiggins contract is shorter than both of those players.    Just because he's not on a supermax doesn't mean he didn't get maxed.  &gt;Lol yes it is. Jesus christ. They're trying to trade for a superstar. Teams will love a contract like Wiggins that provides matching salary and is a soon to be expiring that they can then flip for more value. Not even considering his value as a 2 way player with great defense.     You do understand that he's not a positive asset?  &gt;No, he's a good player. You have such extreme bias lol.  I've watched actually watched him play this year unlike you and I've watched him also play for years so I'm more qualified to speak on him than you."
"That's the Kevin Love story since LeBron left. Pretty pathetic, and I don't feel bad for his situation."
"Kevin Love is not going to walk away from $60M. Goddammit, he could sit on the bench, do nothing, take the buy out, donate $55M to Cleveland’s Boys and Girls Club and still take home more in the next two years than I’ll earn in my lifetime."
"&gt; In that world is being paid 30m+ not max money?  The world where he signed his contract 4 years ago and his salary is not considered 'max' anymore.

Demarcus Cousins Isaiah Thomas Kevin Love Russell Westbrook Carmelo Anthony
this thread gave kevin love depression
Curry is older than Kevin Love which doesn’t seem possible to me
"He's been done as far as people ever expecting some kind of Return of ""Minnesota Kevin Love"", that guy is dead and buried, but I still think he can be a valuable role-player for a playoff / contending team, but he's getting paid like 30 million dollars a year, there's going to have to be some kind of contract restructure or something lol"
"Off the bench to do what? On a contender no less? I mean he’s been on the decline since he got to Cleveland; when you talk about those Cleveland teams or the 2016 title who tf brings up Kevin Love? He doesn’t really add anything and his negatives outweigh his positives. He can barely move,can’t play D, no post presence, and an titled attitude. He’s probably had one of the steepest declines we’ve seen in the NBA considering at one point people were thinking he was the best PF in the league."
"Is it just me or is Kevin Love not kinda getting scapegoated a bit here by the rest of the organization?  The problems with Colin Sexton early in the season went far beyond K-Love to the point we started to see Love acting out on the court, but there were reports many people had issues. The Cavs young players felt attacked and had started to band together a bit as a separate unit.  As one of the oldest and highest paid guys who signed on to be a leader, yeah it's his responsibility in a sense, but he was also probably told ""You need to keep these guys on track"" and the entire team thought Sexton was constantly going off-track and ruining the team dynamic.  https://cavaliersnation.com/2021/05/02/report-cavs-teammates-frustrated-with-how-collin-sexton-hogs-the-ball/  there were tons of these reports early on. And by early on I'm talking about going back to when Sexton was drafted.  Why is it just Kevin Love who's the bad guy now?"
"Kevin Love, BIG3 MVP"
Kevin Love just simply quit on a team and is getting a complete pass for it.
Yeah fuck Kevin Love tbh dude has been robbing the Cavs dry and showing/doing nothing for it.
"This is just silly.  It's a fully guaranteed contract; anything and everything can happen (including the player quitting on the team like Kevin Love, or getting fat and out of shape), and the player still receives the full value.    More importantly, players are free to negotiate no-trade clauses, but doing so typically means accepting less money, b/c the contract loses some value to the team.    Trading a contract, when doing so is expressly permitted by the contract, is not a breach.    The more interesting discussion is why don't more (or almost any) Max players demand no-trade clauses.  Any player w/ 8 years in the league is eligible.  The very concept of a ""Max"" contract is that the player is being underpaid - they would receive more than the Max w/o the cap - and they could recapture some of that value with full or even partial no-trade clauses."
"&gt;The contract doesn’t require him to be excited to play or play with gusto. It just requires that he get out there and play.   And the contract doesn't require that the owner put together a championship contender. It just requires that they pay the player the amount specified.  I don't think this is an ethical issue. Meaning that they are ethically entitled to anything, but I also wouldn't say that any players have done anything unethical by demanding a trade and withholding their full effort. I just think it's immature. When Jimmy Butler destroyed relationships with his teammates to force a trade I thought that was immature. Could he do it? Sure. Do I have to respect it? No, and I don't.   Players can do things within the bounds of the contract to cause me to lose respect for them. It works the other way too, by the way. If the Cavs started publicly calling for Kevin Love to retire. I'd think it was kind of shitty. Probably not unethical, but kind of shitty. Same thing if they tried paying him with dump trucks of loose pennies. Something doesn't have to be technically prohibited by the contract to be a shitty thing to do. So when players don't try to win or actively try to sabotage their team, I think it's shitty and unprofessional and I lose respect for them."
"Mom, can we have Bradley Beal and Kevin Love?   No, we have Bradley Beal and Kevin Love at home.  Bradley Beal and Kevin Love at home: javale sniffs his fingers and another dude that averages 13 ppg"
"Lol a 2018 all-star? You mean like Lamarcus Aldridge, Victor Oladipo, Al Horford, John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Love? How is being a 2018 all-star relevant at this point?"
"LA got AD. Toronto got Kawhi. The Suns got CP3 and the Bucks went out and got Jrue. Before that, the Cavs traded #1 pick Wiggins to get Kevin Love to win now. The only recent championship team that didn’t sacrifice some of their future is the Warriors, and that’s just because they didn’t have to"
Who is showing up to see kevin love? Kevin love is producing almost no revenue for the team yet gets paid.  So the truth is teams pay the players.
Some players generate most of the revenues.  Do injured players generate revenue? But they still get paid.  Nobody is showing up to see kevin love yet he still gets a nice 40M a year.
The owners pay the players.  When Durant sits on at home rehabbing his achilles who is paying him?   What ticket is he selling when he sits at home doing nothing?  What tickets is Kevin Love selling while banking 40M a year?

Kyrie not passing Kevin Love the ball again when he had 34 in the 1st with a minute left and Kyrie wouldn't pass him the ball again.
"Kevin Love, Chris Bosh, Alex Caruso, and current Russell Westbrook aren't superstars."
You like Kevin Love?
This is the moment where Kevin Love got depression
Kevin Love and Chris Bosh
"He has that Kevin Harlan quality where he sounds like he’s just legitimately into the game, just even more emotional. Lol. I absolutely love it. Just sounds like a fan with a quick wit and a good voice."
"Definitely De'Andre Jordan.  Demarcus cousins dominated the shit out of the ball and lost 55 games a season.  Same with pre-Lebron Kevin Love, current Zach Line.  And Rudy Goberts offensive holes and the Jazz's systemic reliance on him despite that has hampered the Jazz as a legit contender in the playoffs for years  * Not to mention none of them have ever lifted a team the way Russ did in his MVP season"
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
"i watched the entire thing at 6x speed. it's not THAT bad of a list  how is andre drummond #165? how is he above al horford, bradley beal, jrue holiday, john wall, KAT, brad daugherty? kevin love over yao ming? billups over reggie miller? moncrief over miller?"
"His March madness was incredible. I felt pretty good about my bracket - I’d picked UCLA to go all the way, that team had Kevin love, Westbrook, Darren Collison, and Mbah a Moute. Memphis wrecked them, and ya I know Memphis had some other great players, but it was Rose that did it and it was incredible to see - he was like one of those kids that you usually only see in 12-and-under play who might have hit puberty earlier than their peers or have better coordination earlier and are able to do whatever they want against anyone their age.   That ‘if I have the ball in my hands there is nothing you can do to stop me, this is a game for me’ type skill usually tapers off by college, in most years the ‘best’ player is pretty subjective - but the only other college  players I’ve seen make every other player in the country look like a joke were Reggie bush and tony Azevedo  I don’t remember the final score,"
"Kevin Love. He's actively bringing his team down and it looks like he's barely even an NBA player at this point. He a total negative.  A lot of people are saying Wall, but at least Wall is a serviceable NBA player, and it seems like he can be a good influence on the young guys on the Rockets while they develop. I'll take a good vet over a guy who shit talks his teammates to the press any day"
Curry was clearly playing through an MCL sprain that series. Couldn’t even drive past Kevin Love.
Strong argument for Kevin Love 120m/4 and he has contributed less than J. Wall.
"Reading this report, first thing that came to my mind was the Game 7 shot against Kevin Love. It is Stephen Curry but I can never get rid of that memory from my mind. Everyone at that moment knew it wasn't going in, you could just feel it."
John wall is still a better basketball player than Kevin Love. it’s Love.
Kevin Love
John Wall stands to make around $20 million more than Kevin Love next season. It’s Wall.
Kevin Love
Kevin Love?
"Yeah he’s a perfect example. Gilber Arenas, Kevin Durant, Kobe, and Draymond Green are my favorite people to listen to talk about basketball- but Arenas especially. I love this clip of Arenas talking about what makes Kobe so special: https://youtu.be/1bu7u6-2zlM. We’re so fortunate he has a podcast, he drops gems on the regular and his insight is top tier."
"&gt; which of the 3 weren't All-Stars if they weren't defending champs then?  Kevin Love. If he wasn't a part of the 2016 fairytale he'd never make another allstar team. Jokic, Aldridge, Horford all put up similar or better stats that season and all were better players than Love yet they didn't make the allstar team but Love did. And I'm not whining, I don't have a problem with him making it. It's just the truth. Love made it because of his role in the 2016 title; not because of his 2017 talent level relative to other allstar caliber players.  ----------  &gt; no it's yall revising history with 20/20 hindsight. when the Spurs were up 25 against the Warriors, people were saying the Spurs would've won the series if Kawhi didn't get hurt.  Perfectly valid point. The series possibly goes seven games with healthy Kawhi. We will never know but at the same time it's perfectly reasonable to say the Spurs had a chance cause they definitely did.  ----------  &gt; They weren't unbeatable, the Cavs just disappointed  Lol. The Cavs definitely didn't disappoint. From October 2014 to June 2018 the Cavs made four consecutive NBA Finals and won one NBA title. Their 2015 loss can easily be attributed to injuries (their second and third best player got injured; no team has ever managed to win a title this shorthanded). Their 2017 and 2018 losses are perfectly understandable since their opponents were way more talented, actually stupid talented because of a once in a lifetime cap spike that allowed them to have a max slot to add a top 5 player/MVP candidate into a 73-win squad."
"Kevin Love, his utility has taken a huge dive.  He plays with confidence even if he falls short and seems to get injured regularly."
"&gt;Kerr on Cavs being heavy underdogs: “I saw the quote from Kevin Love. I’m surprised too, like what the hell is everybody talking about? Are you kidding me? They’re a great team, they’re the champs."""
Oh well as long as Kevin Love said it
"why was it unfair?   &gt;    Kevin Love says he doesn't feel like #Cavs are underdogs. Both teams match up well with one of those defending a title.   &gt;""The whole underdog thing is funny to me. At the end of the day we are defending our title. We're trying to repeat which is so hard to do. I think we will use it as fuel. We'll use it as motivation, but as far as the idea of playing into it it's tough for me to say that is the case. I don't think we're underdogs. I think we match up well with them and I think they'd say the same about us."""
"Let’s see, made the Finals, then technically were the 8 seed. Still higher than the Cavs and more importantly still have 75% of their stars where I don’t think Cavs have 75% of anything from that Finals team, not even 75% of Kevin Love"
The Warriors are more retooling than a full on rebuild. They honestly can make the 2nd round with their roster right now. The Cavs are just plain awful and I do not understand their obsession with undersized guards or Kevin Love. Trade someone…anyone. It seems there is no real direction to even touching the playoffs.
Yeah the Playoff P jokes were fine until they were going at his health.   It was bizarre and really shows why this sub shouldn’t be taken seriously.  “Did LeBron give Kevin Love depression?”
"Not to mention Dwane Casey being replaced by Nick Nurse.  Casey is the 2nd best coach in franchise history by a considerable margin, and he was an amazing regular season coach in Toronto, but he's one of the worst playoff head coaches in the league.   His awful rotations, and complete lack of in-game adjustments, and the fact that he was out-coached by Randy Wittman in 2015 says it all.  Honestly, having CJ Miles on Kevin Love (Casey let him score 12 straight points without calling for a timeout), and giving Bebe crucial playoff minutes over JV during an elimination game (Game 4 vs 2018 Cavs) were some of the worst coaching decisions I've ever seen."
Yeah I threw a hex on the thunder. Fuck clay bennet and fuck howard shultz. I love Kevin Durant.
You think multiple time All Star Kevin Love and multiple time All Star Kyrie Irving were trash? The lengths people go to pretend that LeBron has never played with anyone good is nuts.
"I feel weird saying this but even if they were the first, I think it was far more important for Kevin Love to say it. Dennis Rodman and Metta World Peace clearly had a lot of issues, but Kevin Love seemed like a guy who was living the best life winning a ring, dating a model, and making millions. He certainly normalizes"
Maybe so. I’m glad it is taken a lot more seriously these days. Kevin love and derozan both have voiced these issues as well and I’m glad they didn’t get the backlash the ones in the past did.
Kevin Love.
Cavs Kevin Love may have been a touch too far though. His post game completely disappeared
Kevin Love didnt want to ruin the moment by playing real help defense
"&gt;“I could believe it because the refs were missing a lot of that tonight,”  I would love to ask him, ""A lot of what?""  Players running 15 feet out of bounds?  Where are those clips?  I don't think they exist, Kevin.  In fact, this play is potentially unique in NBA history.  Other calls have been missed, of course, but this is arguably **four** missed calls, since that's how many times Durant steps out of bounds before reaching the ball."
Has he seen Kevin Love lately?
Dropping some weight can do wonders for somebody’s game.  Look at what happens to Kevin Love when he came out of UCLA.  Became a completely different level of player once he slimmed down after entering the NBA.
It has to be Kevin Garnett (KG) for me  He created the position less NBA that we know and love today. He was a pretty good basketball player too 😉
I always felt that Kevin Love is a worse version of Laettner
Debatable of course. None of those guys ever proved that they could carry a team like that though. Love kyrie and love Kevin. But they were putting up empty stats on bad teams.
Kevin love loooool. The rest are monsters though.
that kinda proves the other ppls points no?  who was brons 1b? the guys up there saving kevin love?
"Gotta love how you don't say anything of substance and just repeated the same thing you originally commented, just in more words while also basically ignoring everything I laid out.   Here's a specific excerpt on his Lob City days per Kevin Arnovitz at ESPN:  &gt; After Paul exited for Houston, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer reached out to his former point guard. As a relatively new owner, Ballmer wanted to learn from his organization's mistakes and invited Paul to share his thoughts about the current state of the franchise and, more pointedly, his reasons for leaving. When the two met over breakfast, league sources say, Paul stated that Rivers was one of the contributing factors  &gt; The Clippers teams with a core of Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan had a reputation for locker room drama and for perhaps not liking one another.  &gt; But multiple people from the organization indicated to Arnovitz that ""Rivers became as prominent a character in the workplace drama as Paul or Griffin or any other member of the roster. And as the authority in charge of managing sensitivities and arbitrating disagreements, Rivers increasingly grew entangled with the rest of the egos.""  &gt; The piece paints Rivers as something of a locker room politician who had ""a tendency to placate a player by telling him what he wanted to hear"" or even critiquing a player behind his back to another.  &gt; While a level of politicking is normal in any locker room, many Clippers reportedly saw Rivers as somewhat fake  [Source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2769961-chris-paul-reportedly-told-steve-ballmer-doc-rivers-contributed-to-clippers-exit)  Didn't lose his locker room ""at all,"" huh?"
And yet you never heard of boobie Gibson ever again   Just like Kevin love on his “super team”
serious question: who was better Cavs Kevin Love (only during Lebron years) or Toni Kukoc?
"He’s had Dwade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, AD, and Kevin Love."
"Just to be clear, do you mean a healthy Kevin love or a prime Kevin love or at least all star level love on the lebron cavs?"
Kevin Love.
It's not that simple. LeBron was so good early on that the Cavs didn't have enough years at the bottom to add quality talent around him. It's also hard to attract free agents to small market teams in the NBA. Boozer screwed over the Cavs by lying to mgmt and leaving. Obviously that was a bad move to trust him but unlucky regardless.  Bennett was definitely a horrendous pick (surprise David Griffin move) but most of that draft class was pretty weak. And any player the Cavs drafted that year would have been dealt to Minnesota in the Kevin Love deal anyway. Kyrie was obviously a great pick but he and Williams were considered 1A and 1B by most mock drafts. So the Cavs could have screwed that one up.   Waiters wasn't a good pick either obviously especially since Lillard was still available. However Lillard was the only superstar left available in that draft as Davis and Beal were already gone. Charlotte and the Kings also passed on him. It may seem worse to you because LeBron is and was such a great player but every team has a list of terrible draft picks.
surprised Kevin love is who gave Obama the short instead of bron or lue
"If it was a franchise problem that all these all stars are just hiding in Minnesota, then why did Kevin Love get worse when he left? How come Garnett’s best years were in Minnesota?  The fact is Wiggins is one of the only exceptions in the salvageable lottery pick group. And let’s not overreact, he’s really not that good anyway. He’s okay 3 and D, but teams dare him to take 3s, I hope he would shoot 38%. He’s fourth best player (at best, maybe fifth) on a contender that is costing 30 million a year"
The dude is having an eerily similar Kevin Love like career on Minnesota (stretch big &amp; poor defense) I won't be surprised if he wins a chip if he gets traded to a contender.
"Lmao i really dont care dude. curry chokes in big moments, as he did nearly against OKC and against CLE. How you gon let a young kyrie and washed kevin love show you up"
Yeah Kevin Love ate that series
"He gave Kevin Love depression, remember?   /s"
"You didn’t go back to 2000 like I would have wished. Some of these finals have obviously better 3rd options I don’t think were necessary to list and I would never argue against. It would be easier to only list the players that are obviously worse or arguably so like (including but not limited to) the 2020 Lakers, 2018 Cavs, 2003 Spurs, 2001 Sixers, 2007 Cavs, 2006 Heat, 2006 Mavs, and numerous other teams that had realistic championship aspirations and fell short of the finals. There are other contentious players including a few you did list that I’d disagree with but I don’t view the separation in our opinion to be so egregious as to spend anymore Saturday discussing them.  I can also tell we have respectable differences in opinion on who even was the 3rd best player in some of these series on either team. I don’t think delving into those is beneficial for either of us. This really all stems from us seeming to have a different evaluation of Eric Gordon’s value from the late 2010’s which is a difference I’d probably have with many NBA fans who mostly view him as a 3 point shooter. A label I find to be underselling his overall value and the rarity at which a single player has as much versatility on both sides of the floor. Putting him closer or in my opinion above someone like Kevin Love (who hardly played in the 2015 postseason mind you; a very different finals roster than what entered the postseason) who’s post up offense has declined in efficacy on his own and in relevancy the opponents they faced later on in the playoffs and how Love’s ill fit at either 4 or 5 in different lineups on defense degraded at his effectiveness as a part of the larger Cavs lineups.  It also doesn’t matter but you put the 2010 finals twice in place of 2011."
"If Anthony Bennett was any better the Cavs wouldve had a better 13-14 season record and likely don't get first pick, which means they don't draft Andrew Wiggins (who was seen as the next big superstar at the time lol) and the Kevin love trade doesn't happen. Cavs might not win a ring if this happens."
2021: Jrue Holiday/Chris Paul  2020: KCP/Dragic  2019 Klay Thompson/Pascal Siakam   2018 Klay Thompson/JR Smith  2017 Klay Thompson/Kevin Love  2016 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2015 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2014 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2013 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2012 James Harden/Chris Bosh  2011 Ray Allen/Andrew Bynum  2010 Ray Allen/ Andrew Bynum  2009 Rashard Lewis/ Andrew Bynum  2008 Lamar Odom/Ray Allen  The only one I could compare Gordon too is JR smith and that team got swept.
"The thing is the Kevin love isn’t going to have a huge legacy regarding his career anyway, the best way to build a basketball legacy is to endear yourself to one team and that could have been the cavs."
He aint shooting over no one when hes getting defended and didnt Kevin love defend him in the finales? I remember watching that over and over lol

Kevin love and its not even close pls.
Kevin Love gotta be one. Dudes act like he was a superstar in this league when he couldn’t even place as an 8th seed his whol career before LeBron. Even after LeBron he can’t place 8th.
Kevin Love is negative. You need at least one more all-star
"what about   LeBron, Bruce Bowen, Jae Crowder, Duncan, Kevin Love  What would you predict that team will do against 2017 Warriors? What would the betting line be in Vegas."
"Every year I say, ""this is the year we see Kevin Love return to form"" and every year there is something that prevents him. Be it injuries or other mysterious circumstances...I am left feeling utterly confused.  The way things have shaken out, his 4 for $120m has to be up there with the John Wall contract being one of the worst in the league."
"Don’t think anyone outplayed LeBron in 2018, I mostly agree with the rest. LeBron had 2 game winner Buzzer beaters, swept the 59 win 1 seed, all while averaging 34/9/9 on 54/35/74. The next highest scorer on the team was Kevin love who averaged 14/10 on 39/34/92.   Absolutely monster run."
"You clearly watched none of 2015 I take it - Kevin Love arm ripped out of socket round 1 - Kyrie hurt knee in round 2 - Was in and out of the lineup from there.  Played 59 total minutes of Bulls clincher + Hawks sweep, including 2 DNPs  Lebron basically swept the ECF without Kyrie"
Kevin “Andrew Bynum” Love
"&gt;Kevin Love is still good enough to be a dope 6th man imo if he's willing to accept the diminished role.  What's your basis for that evaluation? He didn't look good with team USA.   This will be his age 33 season, a time when most players see substantial decline.   His scoring and efficiency took a real hit last season even on a per-minute basis. His offensive rebounding has not been good, and his defensive rebounding (and remember, when he was a star his rebounding was his best skill) is also in decline.   He was a negative on/off differential in 2020 (albeit not in 2021). His multi-year RAPM shows a steep decline, his EPM was negative last year.   It's literally been, what, six years since a team regularly said to him, ""Go get us a bucket."" What evidence is there that he still has that skill in his bag at a decent level?"
Who’s giving Kevin Love $8M a season?
"Kevin Love is still good enough to be a dope 6th man imo if he's willing to accept the diminished role. If he gets a buyout somebody will snap him up sharpish. he can give you say, 13 &amp; 7 with decent passing that's gotta be up there with most 6moty contestants surely?  I'd enjoy seeing him on the Knicks. Who's their backup big rn anyway, Taj? What you lose on defense you make up for in scoring, spacing &amp; playmaking."

The people running teams think they are damaged goods or past their primes, I don't know. I'm a huge IT guy cause that Celtics run was magical, so I dunno. They seem to be well liked (save for the alleged IT situation with Kevin Love), hard working, going down the list there's nothing wrong with them. So hard to tell."
"In all fairness, 2014-15 is not the same as now. If he went public, most basketball fans would call him weak and soft and would say he deserved it. It took a NBA champion like Kevin Love and an All-star caliber player like DeRozan to hammer the point of players having to deal with mental issues on. And even now there's still the stigma, and some ppl have not received the message i.e. Simone Biles and all the crap she had to endure because of her decision of not compiting at Olympics"
"Why would I be upset  at Kevin about that move instead of the Blazers front office? Truth be told I've been a fan of Kevin since I first seen him at Texas, I love his game, on raw talent he's one of the best ever. I just don't have blind eye with it comes to his career."

No wonder why Kevin Love is great in Outlet Passes.
"They don’t even stop the games for severe injuries like torn ACLs, torn Achilles, or broken limbs. I mean Kevin Love got his shoulder ripped out of its socket on national TV in 2015 and they didn’t even stop the game for that. So I don’t know why they would stop the game for what is essentially just a fight. You break it up, throw the guy out, make sure everyone is okay, and you finish the game."
"No, but it would cause huge ratings for the next game.  While arguably not an ""attack"" Kelly Olynyk essentially did this to Kevin Love in 2015."

"I love John Collins, but saying Kevin Love and KP are making that money isn't really a good argument because everyone agrees those are 2 of the worst contracts in the NBA. I want a max player to be able to create his own shot, which Collins can't. 77% of his points this year have been assisted. He also isn't a real presence on defense. That said, I won't be upset if we give him a max because his chemistry with Trae is what makes the team tick and he really is a great player."
"He's 23, athletic, can shoot, and decently good on defense. He's not gonna be a focal point offensively but he's a great piece to have. A max for John Collins is about 32M/year or about what Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, and Kristaps Porzingis are making right now. I don't see why he shouldn't get that much money."
Kevin Love probably gets in
And Kevin Love is Stan Love’s son
Curry beat a Kevin Love/Kyrie-less Cavs team and then had KD join the year after he failed against a healthy Cavs team. Not sure he belongs on this list.
"Trading an a bench player (George Hill) for 2 guys and a pick is not the same as trading Kyle Lowry and Chris Boucher to move up 1 spot. You're far more likely to get Fultz or McDyess than you are Luka.  Raptrors are absolutely a contender, whether you want to call it injuries or selective tanking no player played over 61 games. You're putting your team into potential NBA purgatory to move up 1 spot.  Kevin Love is a negative asset. You'd have to attach a pick just to get rid of him.  If you want a rebuild do it:  A Pick(s) for Lowry A Pick for Boucher Multiple Picks for Siakam, VanVleet, and even OG too. A Pick for taking on Love's contract.  You could walk away with a Thunder style haul. It's all moot, the Raptors are obviously planning on competing, They traded Powell for Hood not a pick."
I like kevin O’Connor but I can’t help but feel like this is posturing by him to try and will his favorite player Luka some help. Kawhi left a team that just won a title to go to LA. He’s clearly a big city guy ( yes I know Dallas is a big city. I’ve been there several times and I love Dallas.) he’s not going to Dallas
"I'm not holding my breath for a kawhi hole run trade but I'm maintaining DeMar level assets in siakam and fred to make that move.  The contract I am taking on is Kevin love.  I thought he had one yr left but he has two.  I'm not so crazy about that but I think Mobley will need it.  He's an expiring for me the next yr anyway and I still have other assets if I have to get rid of him immediately but I don't anticipate it.  Again, boucher is not a core piece for me and he's expiring.  I don't see us as a contending team.  Maybe that league seems a little open now and with Lowry we could contend but I don't think so bc we don't have a #1 option or a #1 defense.  Until we get there, we are just treading water.  I don't want to win 8-9 playoffs like with DeMar.  Raps want chip and nothing less imo.  If u like a guy logic does apply to contending teams imo.  Hill was a key piece when spurs traded for kawhi."
"Sure would like to be CP3 right about now. It's one thing to achieve something,  that makes you feel good enough in and of itself...BUT PROVING PEOPLE WRONG IN THE PROCESS??? Jesus it's no better feeling. Because think of how he must of felt when Houston lost in the '18-'19 playoffs, a team having to be ""bribed"" to take you on  with everyone (including me) thinking it's over. He couldve said ""fuck it I got 40-44M a yr coming towards me I could mail it in (like Kevin Love), it's what everyone expects"". But no doubt he used it as fuel so big ups to him, sorry for  doubting you Chris."
Kevin Love 4/120
"I mean, LeBron is an “aging star,” so that’s definitely not the same as washed. I thought Blake Griffin was washed. Kevin Love is washed.  Udonis Haslem is washed. CP3 wasn’t in that list, he just seemed overpaid"
"You’re blinded by a hate boner,Kelly olynyk done the exact same play and injured Kevin love"
That Kevin love thread is one of the best this sub has ever had. The amount of ass shown in there puts bootytalk to shame
"Kevin love sucked, and Wade was traded away before the playoffs.   That 2007 might have been the worst team ever to make the finals."
"That shit was low, even for this sub. It’s hard to take any of these jokers seriously after the infamous thread where they decided that Lebron caused Kevin Love to develop clinical depression/anxiety"
name the two teams that he lead that didn’t have an all star.  last i check 2007 cavs had big Z. 2018 had kevin love and wade
I want the uncensored true story about the Kevin Love knuckle push-up debacle.
I love Mike Breen but Kevin Harlan is honestly better at this point even individually. Breen has had a noticeable number of brain farts in the past 3 months inexplicably. Harlan also just gets me more hype for the right plays.
I could tolerate Pat Bev and his tenacious defense if everything else he did wasn't so demonstrative and grating. Like dude just wins so much screentime and it's not like he's Rick Fox or Kevin Love
"These guys are such narcist, no you sucked and got lucky. It's like the Warriors were saying they were lightyears ahead when they tried to trade Steph, then tried to trade Klay for Kevin Love, and Draymond only started because Lee was injured."
I assure you there are more controversial Chuck quotes out there than what Jalen said about Kevin Love.
"Tbf out of all the things jalen said this is not even bad, certainly better than the shit he said bout Kevin love and the Olympic team lmao, I mean at least I can understand him wanting to back his friend"
Jalen Rose also said that Kevin Love only made the Olympic team because they didn't want an all black team. Jalen Rose needs to go.
"Kevin Love gave an interview I think last year where he said Ty Lue is fantastic, especially in the playoffs. He said something like the regular season is meh but in the playoffs he is always making adjustments and just on another level."
"The thing is, maybe it wasn't as crazy as this year but almost all of the recent NBA finals have been influenced by injuries - 2019 KD and Klay out, 2018 Chris Paul out in WCF, 2017 Kawhi out in WCF, 2015 Kevin Love and Kyrie out, on top of my head I can't remember anything about 2020 (which had a big off season before the playoffs) and 2016 (well there was that Draymond's suspension).  And those are only the years I know personally (didn't follow NBA before that)."
He'd be 2014 Kevin Love on steroids with defense and better shooting. Either that or some version of Jokic
"A shorter yet stronger version of Giannis with a better jumpshot and rebounding ability yet lacks Giannis defensive acumen. In this league where numbers are more inflated than ever he could hover around almost Giannis numbers like 28ppg and average about the same rebounding numbers as a prime Kevin Love or Andre Drummond - 15rpg easy. He also has one of the best true shooting percentages ever for a guy not giving a damn about advanced analytics. In this era of advanced analytics, if he does give a shit - he'll probably be the NBA's most efficient scorer with Steph."
Kevin Harlan's voice is the best. Love listening to him on any broadcast.
Jimmy Butler would legit bully Kevin Love for his mental health issues
"You gave Kevin Love the bag he didn’t deserve, might as well give Sexton the bag he deserves🤷‍♂️"
Yeah that KP/Kevin Love front court is a defensive powerhouse.
"Don't forget Kevin Love getting injured in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, same postseason as Kyrie getting hurt in the finals against GS."
Kevin Love duh
Kevin Love 👀👀👀
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"

"If there was ever a championship that deserved an asterisk, it was the 2015 Warriors. Beat the Cavs without Kyrie or Kevin Love. If the 2015 Warriors don't get an asterisk, then no one gets one."
"&gt; Kevin Love doesn’t deserve to play on team USA cause he’s played like hot garbage this year, and was selected because he’s white  Fixed that for you, definitely not the same thing Rose was saying. Idk if I agree but you’re intentionally misrepresenting the point"
Same for the Warriors in '15 then -- no Kevin Love or Kyrie makes for a really easy Finals series.   At some point it gets kind of absurd.
"Yes. And they still could have lost with Klay. But they had no chance without him. Stacked or not, that was the team we had, and injuries affected who won. What people don't seem to realize is that before we had KD, we had Harrison Barnes. When we lost KD to injury, we didn't have either. So we were playing a bench player at that position. Not trying to take anything away from the Raptors but every championship has injury issues. We beat LeBron the first time without Kevin Love and Kyrie."
We don’t need to compare reasons. But the ability for someone to live their lives with money or less money is huge. Kevin love can get himself better treatment than the average joe  Depression is real but Kevin love is beating himself over for decisions he made. He signed the max contract cause he wanted a big pay day and now he isn’t happy playing on a bad team. That is the situation he put himself in
That's why Lebron and Kevin Love are still great friends to this day...
"Does Casey even get to the Finals? Raptors had to go through the 76ers and Bucks. Kawhi was a huge part of that, especially against the 76ers, but so was coaching. Nurse outcoached guys like Bud on that run. I'm not confident Casey even gets to the Finals. Even the Finals Nurse was throwing out wrenches like the box-and-one. Casey was throwing out nerf guns like CJ Miles on Kevin Love.      I want to reiterate that I respect Casey and think he's a great coach and I hope he gets another shot at contention with the Pistons. But he showed over his time with the Raptors that he would get outcoached and make many questionable decisions that would ultimately be key factors in losing winnable games. I don't believe he wins with Kawhi, but I respect what he did to help develop the team and I hope he has learnt and become better because he is good."
"Casey got swept by the Wizards and the ghost of Paul Pierce. He didn't just lose to LeBron. The Raptors kept him far longer than they had to. They gave him chances. He got outcoached. [He put CJ Miles on Kevin Love](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/94okck/kevin_love_absolutely_abusing_cj_miles_the/). The Raptors didn't just lose to LeBron, they got swept in back to back years while other teams gave the Cavs more of a fight. Lose to LeBron? Sure, like you said, everyone did. LeBronto? No.      Of course we have no idea what would have happened, but I'm quite confident Casey doesn't win with Kawhi based past performances and decisions he made."
"&gt; exceptional amount of injuries for the warriors including their top 3 players. Seems silly to pretend otherwise.  I actually think you might be pretending that. Which does seem silly, cause the injuries to KD and Klay were exceptional enough.   Breaking it down:   Klay played 188 mins that series, 3rd highest on the Warriors behind Steph and Draymond and around the same as Danny Green and FVV, he was injured with 2 mins remaining of the 3rd quarter of Game 6 - the game where the Raps won the title. He was cooking in the game he went out, and **could** have won the game for GSW in the 4th, but people now act like he missed the whole finals and wasn't playing in 4 of the previous games before the elimination game. That's one.   KD is the other obvious one, he only played 12 mins before the Achilles injury. That's two.   I'm curious which injured Warrior you think is better than Steph and Draymond? They led the series in minutes played, so if they were injured, I missed it.   The Raptors got lucky, for sure, I don't see how it's 'exceptional' though, that's just sports. KD and Klay played 200 total minutes in the 2019 finals, Kyrie and Kevin Love played 44 mins total in the 2015 finals vs GSW- was the Warriors 2015 exceptionally lucky too?"
Seems like Green's stock has risen to be the #2 guy at the very least.  I don't know how to feel about the fit of Mobley and Wood on the Rockets - both strike me as guys that don't have enough bulk to protect the rim.  I'm also not sold on Mobley's fit on the Cavs either; Love is deadweight obviously but they're probably going to extend Allen and Larry Nance Jr is a super solid stretch 4.   Would the Cavs trade Sexton and #3 for #2? I guess that would depend on Houston not being super high on Green and if they have faith in Kevin Porter Jr being their big point guard of the future.
I hope Kevin Love listens to The Beach Boys due to his history
"One bad first round game when they were already up 2-0... Plus all of this are way way blown out of the proportion, thanks to lunatic lebron fans.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19220425/tyronn-lue-cleveland-cavaliers-upset-media-portrayal-kyrie-irving-kevin-love-benching  Kyrie dropped 37 the game before and 30 the game after yet no one talks about that."
"Winning the finals is an all or nothing thing for me. I wasn’t penalizing him for losing IN the finals. My point was just that he didn’t win. I don’t care if you lose in the first round, or in the finals. It’s an all or nothing thing when you’re arguing greatness. Jordan won 6 in a decade while being the undisputed best scorer and a top defender. LeBron does not have a stretch where he was as dominant.  “He makes teammates better”. That’s such a nebulous claim. Yes because Kevin love and Chris Bosh were SO much better playing with him. His prime has been two decades and he’s been on plenty of stacked teams. He should have more to show for it if he’s the best player of all time."
I mean I guess? The point is they made a black man get up and apologize to a white guy who is 3x as rich for making a comment that isn't offensive at all... it's 100% on point. Love doesn't even deserve to hold the towels for team USA. It isn't offensive to have an opinion like this unless it's the other way around and you're punching down on an oppressed or racially discriminated class of people. This is Kevin Love who has been rich and spoiled all his life getting an apology from someone who saw the situation for what it was. A total joke to me.
I respectfully disagree. The only PFs better then Rodman is Dirk and Duncan.Maybe Kevin Love.
Cleveland Kevin Love gets no love in the post
Isn't skinny Minny Kevin Love just Cleveland Kevin Love?
The same 2015 where Kevin Love got his shoulder pulled out in the 1st round? The year where Kyrie was playing through a knee injury all playoffs and Lebron was playing through a back injury all season?
Kevin Love though.
A human being is a human being.  See the difference in support for Naomi Osaka for example.  Hell even DeRozan and Kevin Love got less heat than PG for their depression comments.
He’s more like a thinner Minny Kevin Love
kevin love is no better than Jeff Green was for the Nets this postseason
"* 2020 - Jimmy, Bam, and Dragic get injured in the first half of the finals. * 2019 - Kevin Durant missed half the playoffs, tears his Achilles in the finals, and then Klay Thompson tears his ACL in the finals. * 2018 - Chris Paul gets injured in the Western Conference finals, swinging the series. * 2017 - Kawhi is blowing out the KD Warriors and then gets Zaza'd. * 2016 - Andrew Bogut breaks his leg in the finals and Draymond gets suspended for nut tapping LeBron. * 2015 - Kevin Love gets his arm snapped by Kelly Olynyk, Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in the first half of the finals, and the refs don't call a technical foul on David Blatt for calling a timeout with no timeouts left."
"I was being a little cheeky sure, but my ""assumption"" is based on literal daily experience where I watch people make heinously racist comments and then turn around and pick apart the nuances of when a person of color says anything even a little out of line and makes it seem like the end of the world. It's blatant hypocracy. I'm just encouraging people if they're really bothered by it to keep the same energy against heinously racist remarks. You sound like you do, and that's great, but not everybody does and that's an unequivocal fact. I could give you daily screenshots of it happening if I wanted to. And that's racism itself, thinking that ""well the literal president of the United States laughed about immigrants getting shot at a Florida rally so that must be equally as racist as Jalen Rose insinuating that Kevin Love had an unfair advantage making the Olympic team"". Those aren't equivalent comments (especially considering a gunman later massacred Hispanics in El Paso, you wonder where he got the idea from) plus that racism is about historical and persistent discrimination based on race. Jalen Rose's comments might have been poorly said and stupid and that's fine to discuss, but people seemingly rushing to make it seem like a white person would never get away with making a racist comment even though we watch them do it daily and that racism against Blacks must be some myth now is laughable. Don't believe me? Take a look at the most upvoted comments on this post or read almost any comment section on any YouTube video or Facebook post that basically has anything to do with a person of color. I'm telling you, racism daily.   And while we're on the topic of assumptions, when did I chalk up white people's opinions to racism? I said racism towards minorities which could certainly be minority to minority racism which I see a lot too. I didn't even say white people so you might watch what you're accusing me of there and calling me the problem. The real problem is people thinking their racist fucking ideas are just sweet innocent opinions that everybody is entitled to. Which well, they are entitled to them, but then we're also entitled to call them out as disgusting and damaging."
That's gold medalist Kevin Love btw
Like Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love (to an extent). I know I'm missing some of the others.
How did Kevin Love make it on the Olympic Team Over The Red Mamba Huerter?
"More star teammates?  Jordan had pippen,  at worst a top 50 player all time. Lebrons cavs team had Kevin love... also how is it lebrons fault jordan lost in The playoffs before getting to the championship his first 6 seasons and tried to go play pro baseball and wasn't very good at it, then came back a year later and lost in the playoffs in the 2nd round to Orlando. also lebrons fault jordan failed to get the wizards to even .500 the 2 seasons with them? Also don't come at me about lebron either,  he also isn't I the top 3 all time."
"Also I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I do agree that it is harder for black people in this country right now, I 100% believe that. But that does not give Jalen Rose the authority to say that about Kevin Love or any player of another race. Kevin Love may fit the bill for the type of player they need since he fits into that classic European type of basketball player that can shoot and rebound well. AND I'd like to say that I 100% agree with every firing or suspension of a white announcer or player who has made racist comments of their own, it's flat out not right. I hope you all will repost my post and make this a huge topic because it needs to be addressed. It's just not fair for anyone to be talked about that way and its not fair that a black guy can apologize and keep his job because he is black and a white guy can apologize and still get fired for basically the same thing, that's injustice. I really wish we lived in a world without these injustices and comments and maybe one day we will but as long as we have ppl running the government who were old enough to remember the Civil rights movement in the 60's we'll never get there. Remember these people have racism ingrained into them because they were raised that way by their parents who were racist. If us younger people who mostly don't see color these days were running things I feel we would be in a much better place socially. It's up to all of us to rid the government of these old bureaucratic white ppl who do things the way their grandparents did, it's getting us nowhere. The Bidens and Trumps of the world need to go and we need 35-40 year olds (fresh blood) in Washington to help fix the problems. Just one man's opinions thats all. Thanks for reading."
"If you really look at it Kevin Love is a great fit for the European game and thats why he should be on the team. He shoots really well and rebounds the ball well, his defense at this point in his career is almost non existent but that shouldn't matter bcuz he should have an easier time against 2nd tier talent. That comment that Rose made really pisses me off. As a NBA fan who is white who's played basketball his whole life (not street ball but for high school and college) i find this to be extremely offensive. This notion that all black players are somewhat racist is false because in my years  playing i was the minority on my teams and never once was i treated any different by my black teammates. As a matter of fact i was protected more by my black teammates it seemed bcuz I was the minority on the court and they spoke up for me when I was called a ""honky"" or ""cracker"" or ""white trash"". It meant a lot to me that they had my back and wouldn't stand for the racism and this took place in the deep south in Louisiana, one of the most racist places in America where there's plantations on the road to school that we passed up everyday. And ppl call this comment Jalen made ""reverse racism"" because it's a black man saying something about a white guy, racism is racism, this is a racist comment and honestly had a white guy who worked at espn said something like this about a black player he wouldn't have had the chance to apologize he just would've been fired on the spot!! So I also find ESPN to be offensive as well in this situation for not either firing Rose or suspending him. Racism in any form shouldn't be tolerated, there should be equal punishment and all treated the same. I won't be happy until Jalen Rose loses his job with ESPN. That's exactly what people would be saying had SVP or Max Kellerman had said something along these lines about a black player. Everyone needs to be held to the same standards. This is pathetic and gives me a reason to actually get up off my but and speak out, I won't rest until Jalen gets some form of punishment for saying what he said, I will start a Facebook page, Twitter, any type of social media about this injustice. Kevin Love is a great player,  great ambassador to the game, and for mental health in this country and it's not right to say he doesn't deserve to be there and he's just a token white guy. It is possible these days to get confused, especially us young ppl under 35, that racism doesn't just exist in a white against another race....it exists all ways black on white, Asian on black, Mexican on white, white on black, white on Mexican etc. Just no one wants to admit that there is racism against white people as well and to me what Jalen said was a racist statement and if other people are losing their jobs for racist statements they've made he should lose his job plain and simple, he shouldn't get away with an apology. That's all I have to say on the matter and I hope this post isn't taken out of context, I believe what I said to be fair and equal on all fronts. If my high school/college teammates were mature enough to never make comments like this and were mature enough to have my back when I had racist comments thrown my way then Jalen Rose has NO EXCUSE!! HE'S A GROWN ASS MAN. So the movement starts here #fireJalenORboycottESPN -Thanks for reading-"
I haven’t read much people happy or defending Kevin love being on there.
I mean the argument you're trying to make is that he was selected for being white and not on merit... which makes no sense. You really think Kevin Love is on the team because of his skin color when 10 guys with black skin said no already?
"Kevin Love also got hurt, I don’t see you mentioning that"
I don't think current Kevin Love really commands any minutes
"Kevin Love is not nearly the player he was a few years ago. I mean he is still the best 12th best player on any Olympic team, but he's nowhere near as good as any other player on this team. Shooting is important but not important enough to have Kevin Love on the team."
Kevin Love is another one.
Ray Allen wasn't an All Star when he was on the Heat btw. Kevin Love would be a better comparison.
Someone correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Kevin Love get minutes taken away from him and were given to a 40 year old RJ?
this guy makes Kevin Love look durable
"Your flair says youre a Cavs fan so how are you so wrong about who was on that 2018 playoff roster?  Shumpert, Dwade and Rose got traded at the deadline, Dellavedova didn't get traded back to the Cavs until the next season when LeBron already left the team. It seriously looks like you just googled 2018 Cavs players and didn't check when they were actually on the team.  Kevin Love is ok but hes not nearly the same productive player he was in Minnesota where he built his reputation. Even after Kyrie left for the first time and Love should've had to carry more offensive responsibility for the team, he averaged worse stats on lower efficiency in 2018.   Here's the contribution the Cavs got from the remaining roster of players you seem to think were good:  Hill: 9 / 2 / 2  JR: 9 / 3 / 1  Green: 8 / 2 / 2  Thompson: 6 / 6 / 1  Nance: 5 / 5 / 1  Clarkson: 5 / 2 / 1  Not saying this roster was horrible. But they had absolutely no business making it deep into the playoffs."
I mean I disagree with his take but there’s really no reason K Love deserved to make the team over Randle lmao and this is coming a Nets fan that’s all for Kevin Love joining the Nets next year if he gets bought out lol
"Really not true.   It’s the same perception as calling players in bad teams “good stats bad team”. You think any coach can make an adjustment when he was the Hawks against a Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love championship Cavs? How about the fact if they beat the Raptors in 2019 they likely beat the Warriors as well (assuming everything else is equal).   You can’t say “Bud actively puts his team at a disadvantage” when he has consistently had his team completely but in to every role that they have been assigned, and they are favourited to win it all this year."
Didn’t he have Kyrie and Kevin Love with him on the Cavs???
"If Kevin Love was good, Jalen Rose wouldn't have said that he was picked due to tokenism."
"i mean kevin love definitely sucks though, unless literally NOBODY else wanted to go, just about anybody would be a better pick... tellin me youd rather have kevin love than reggie jackson this summer"
"kevin love is an extremely head-scratching pick for team USA jalen isn't the only person wondering whats up with that choice  besides he apologized, and I'm talking about his basketball analysis anyway"
jalen rose not that good anymore called kevin love tokenism ws wild. love fits way better for team usa than julius randle. pick and pop 3. juluis would need the ball more in his hands to be effective.if it was mason plumlee sure i would agree but kevin love was a quality player and still be serviceable in 10 minutes
Didn't know Kevin Love was a superstar.
"Fair to need evidence.  Here are my thoughts.  1.  The gifts you describe are as a player.  Logic doesn’t hold whatsoever to think those translate to gm or executive success.  Obviously they COULD....but to assume they do is not a safe assumption. Basketball iqs and team leaders were also sky high for: Michael Jordan, magic Johnson, Kevin Mchale, Elgin Baylor, isiah Thomas, Willis Reed, Wes unseld and others and their performance in the front office was abysmal.  Now they are not Lebron so that’s not enough to conclude anything - but your statement about basketball iq and leadership meaning he has feel for selecting other players doesn’t hold weight to me based on a long history of others performing horribly when they try that transition.    2.  His achievements definitely speak for themselves, as a player.  Not as a team builder or in a sense playing gm/player with influence that we know him to be.    A list of roster moves and player issues that lead me to believe he is a horrible “gm” are:  - most recently prioritizing schroder, kuzma and then Drummond who was unplayable during crunch time.  There were many players available to get better and all 3 of these hurt their chances in 20-21.  - still on Lakers, trading away lonzo and Ingram while keeping kuzma.  Yes they got AD so that is the main thing but they kept the wrong guy, and that has hurt them for years to come in terms of building a roster around AD and Lebron as superstars.  - losing kyrie from the cavs and the trade for IT.  Huge deal that set Cleveland back many years.  Painful.   - on the cavs building around guys like JR smith and Kevin love not only set them back while Lebron was still there (jr smith finals issue), those moves are STILL setting Cleveland back as Kevin love continues to sap money without contributing   -  on the heat, there weren’t tons of player moves possible or required after they got the big 3.  Now Lebron surely helped the big 3 come together based on his playing influence, but it didn’t require an eye for talent or management skill to know that Chris bosh, wade, Lebron, ray allen, etc were good players to pursue a championship   - while on the heat there were few successes when actually selecting personnel.  For example, he was really high on Shabazz Napier and that failed miserably.   - I won’t keep going back year by year but in the early cavs years the same issues existed in my opinion.  Building around “his guys” led to teams that were average as supporting casts but could have been much better...and forced Lebron to win in spite of the talent around him.   These all only enhance how good he is as a player - I have heard countless times “how did he make the finals with ___ as his best players?”  But they are indications he does not know what he’s doing with roster building.   Those are my reasons.  I am failing to see the evidence that supports his gm skills or eye for talent.  What do you think lends credibility to saying he knows what he’s doing off the court?"
Except they had Kevin Love and Isaiah Thomas coming off an injury as their 2nd &amp; 3rd best players as opposed to Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook
"That was my thinking going into last year, but I loved our squad from last year. If it was just a team full of vets and we were getting bounced in the first round, I'd agree with you. But RJ, IQ, Mitch, Obi, and now Grimes and McBride... I like the idea of putting these guys in a winning environment and in the best situation to succeed (though w/Obi it's a little awkward, I admit).   Plus, what salary could've been dumped to us this off-season? What team was willing to unload a salary + give us a pick? Kevin Love has 2 years left on his deal and would've created a logjam in our frontcourt. That's the only contract I can think of. I'm good with running it back with most of our squad from last year, gaining Fournier, losing Payton/Frank (I hope Frank can find a way to succeed in this league, just wasn't meant to be for us). I'm sure if a team came to us with an enticing enough offer, we would've been open to a salary dump."
And stomped by Kevin Love: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA4FIE0tOrs
Ben Simmons is pretty tradeable. Kevin Love is a better example

Team USA could use Kevin love honestly
"He was a major talent and despite that didn't show much material improvement from the time when he was 19 until he was about 25.  His biggest jump in efficiency came after his second stint in China.  Partially this had to do with off court problems.  Partially this had to do with being shuffled between playing the 3 and 4 for wildly different ball clubs.    The Heat desperately wanted Beasley to be a 3 and play face up more.  It was a tough transition for him, his ball handling wasn't up to scratch, his release is a bit slow for a 3, he had to play outside in instead of inside out.  His first step against wings was no longer considered elite.  He was faster, stronger, more skilled than every player he faced in college and he was probably faster and more skliled than most bigs in the NBA, but he would get killed on defense because of his lack of size at the 4 and his lack of lateral mobility at the 3.  When the Heat jettisoned him for Lebron, the Wolves picked him up as a 3 to play along side Kevin Love.  This would become a huge shit show.  Beasley needed good PnR partners to succeed in the modern NBA.  The Wolves had the chance to draft a lot of great point guards and blew it.  So Beasley would get isoed on the wings a bunch and he would score in bunches, but with pedestrian percentages.  After awhile wolves brass gave up on Beasley after yet another weed possession incident and sent him to Phoenix where the wheels really fell off.  The transition from college to pros was not nearly as smooth as Beasley and his camp envisioned.  You can tell he never really played a full time man to man scheme in college or high school.  He sucked at it and Miami's team defensive scheme is one of the most complicated in the league.  He wanted to stay in school and have more fun but most of his huddle wanted him to go out and earn as quickly as possible, and frankly he wasn't ready.    From Houston to New York, his career went in the right trajectory.  His shot chart changed.  He took less dribbles before he shoots, he took less mid range shots.  He knocked down his open shots in NY and had a respectable 52/39.5/78 in NYC.  He also took very difficult shots near the rim and made more than his fair share.  He had some good tutelage about help D with Milwaukee, mostly under the mentorship of Greg Foster and co, then he went to the Knicks where he had to play man to man under Jeff Hornacek's schemes, and this time the lessons seemed to stick.  Beasley had a bad bad year with the Lakers.  If you look at the roster you would see that between Brandon Ingram, Lance Stephenson, Hart, Lebron, Kuzma and Svi all played the 3/4 spots and Lakers brass was trying to show case Ingram, Kuzma and Hart to get AD.  By then between a clearly ill defined role and his mom dying from cancer, his percentages dropped way off.  In order for Beasley to have a job in the NBA, he must be one of the top 30 scorers in the league.  He wasn't that in the Lakers and the rest of the league went to look elsewhere for microwaves.  He had a rumor with Detroit, another try out with the Nets but he came down with covid at the bubble.  And after that the teams quit calling for awhile until Portland signed him to a summer league deal."
Where's Kevin Love? I thought they needed him for his rebounding?
We thought Kevin Love was up for the challenge
Clearly the problem is that they don’t have Kevin Love. Kevin Love is the missing piece and there is nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.
"I'm just appalled that, when making this team, knowing we needed some centers, we took Kevin Love and Bam...  Then JaVale...  Just mind-boggling honestly"
"2019 Cavs had Sexton, Cedi Osman, Rodney Hood, and Kevin Love."
Kevin Love sends his regards
"LeBron, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Carmelo and Russ were all in the 2012 All Star game, as was Luol Deng who is also still technically on their roster. Recent Laker Rajon Rondo was also in that game, as were buyout candidate Kevin Love and current Lakers target Andre Iguodala. AD made the 2014 game:  Westbrook, James, Anthony, Davis, Howard.   Rondo, Iguodala, Deng, Love, Gasol.   TL;DR: Finalise Melo and Iguodala, bring Rondo back, wait for a Love buyout and get the decrepit corpse of Luol Deng back on the court, boys. We're winding back the clock."
"Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Isaiah Thomas, Jeff Green, Richard Jefferson..."
Anytime back in the day there would be reports that Kyrie actually is weird as hell but LeBron keeps it all under wraps I thought it was a bunch of LeMedia bs. Now I realize how much he did.   Also lowkey same applies to Kevin Love just like 1/10 in comparison to Kyrie.
That’s Kevin Love money
Yeh he gave up like 14 mill to ring chase. Kevin Love already has a ring; don't think he's giving up that much of his bag.
"He's an exception. Not many players give up that much money in the buyout. Dude gave up almost 14 mill, plus he's ring chasing when Kevin Love already has one.  Especially knowing he might not get a big contract again, I doubt it."
Goran Dragic  Kevin Love

Kevin Love.
"[""No. The truth is, the deepest sense of joy and peace that I’ve gained in my life doesn’t have anything to do with basketball. It definitely doesn’t have anything to do with money or fame or achievement.""](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/kevin-love-mental-health)   Quote from Kevin himself. Again, I doubt the man would miss the 8 mil if it meant he was happy. And that's a hypothetical number based on BG's buyout, for the record.  Read that whole article, by the way. Let's see how happy he is 4 months into the season when his entire time is spent at home on the couch while the young guys are prioritized.   I ain't projecting shit, my argument is just a helluva lot more sound than **M O N E Y**"
[Praise Jerry West](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/11/jerry-west-klay-thompson-kevin-love-deal)
Kevin Love and Andre Drummond also average double doubles
Definitely curry. Can’t carry a team with less then 2 HOF players and has 0 fmvps. And choked in the finals to a flash earther and a depressed Kevin love
This argument said so much an it is amazing that no one ever learns from the phrase. The Cavs paid Kevin Love and Tristian Thompson because you cannot lose something for nothing.   Paying role player not wise in mist cases.
Still blows my mind ya'll spent that much money on a guy who literally only had 0.5 great seasons on a bad team with no other options.  He has always been a solid starter and didn't even put up Kevin Love on the Wolves kind of empty numbers and you're paying him a fifth of a billion to revert to his old form.
"Gonna be waived mid season to get a buyout player, in predicting Kevin love"
"Jarrett Allen is 23, he’s a lot easier to move than Kevin Love"
"In 2 years, when Mobley is your full time center, you're paying $20M per year for a 15 mpg player. I don't think that sounds like a good investment. And by the way, that contract is NOT tradable. Similar to the Kevin Love contract"
"Damn, he got the Kevin Love deal"
youre comparing Draymond missing 1 game and a roleplayer missing 2 and a half to Kevin Love and Kyrie missing the entire series lol
Kevin Love wasn't 23 lol that move never made sense
lol ok ill rephrase it because you think you cute.   so you would proclaim to be fastest in the world if you beat usain bolt in a gold medal race when he pulled a hamstring coming off the block? you would say kevin love is an all defensive player because he locked down curry(injured) during the final mins of game 7?
I remember reading similar comments when they extended Kevin Love.   Free cap space is better than a bad contract.
Remember how critical everyone was when the Warriors refused to give up Klay in a trade for Kevin Love?
they thought we wouldn’t notice they recast kevin love with anthony davis
yes? the only other large contract we have is kevin love. sexton is a RFA anyways we can go over the cap if that wasnt the case.
"""prioritizing his statistics""  Save us all the time and just say you have an irrational hatred towards Russ or you are in love with Kevin. We don't need the rest."
Fuck you Larry! You didn't give that kid an autograph!!!! Kevin Love the GOAT!
I know a guy who did molly with Kevin Love
"Hes not worth it, if hes worth that then Kevin Love is actually worth his contract."
"Lol since 2010, LeBron has always had all-star teammates and that should not take anything away from him. Bosh and Wade were definitely both all-stars in Miami and so was Kevin Love? He averaged 19 points and 11 rebounds."
I’m not going to not count Kevin Love because you don’t want me to lol he was part of all those great Cavs teams that made 4 straight finals. The Cavs also enjoyed the revolving door of veteran free agents willing to sign for peanuts.
Is this the run where Kevin love and kyrie were injured in the finals 💩
"No lol  New Orleans Pelicans starting PG Jrue Holiday was limited to 55 minutes total and missed one game of the Warriors' sweep entirely coming off a stress reaction in his right tibia. Memphis Grizzlies starting PG Mike Conley missed Game 1 of the series with Golden State because of a facial fracture, and starting SF Tony Allen played just five minutes over the last two games because of a sore left hamstring. The Houston Rockets played without starting PG Patrick Beverley and backup F/C Donatas Motiejunas, while starting C Dwight Howard played through a torn MCL and torn meniscus suffered during the Western Conference finals. In the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without starting PF Kevin Love because of shoulder surgery early in the playoffs and lost starting PG Kyrie Irving to a fractured patella late in Game 1."
Kevin Love also had some good stats when he played for the TWolves. Did he also contribute to winning basketball?
"Quick list of players drafted with the pick immediately after the Wolves for reference - 2008: Rus Westbrook (Kevin Love),  2009: Stef Curry (Johnny Flynn, Rubio),  2010: Demarcus Cousins (Wes Johnson),  2011: Enes Kanter (Derrick Williams),  2013a: Giannis (Shabazz Muhammad,  2013b: Rudy Gobert (Traded pick),  2014a: Nikola Jokic (Glenn Robinson)"
Ja Morant over Kevin love
Kevin Love lol
True Kevin Love is gonna be in the Hall of Fame
"Resurrect jr smith, and enchant zombie Kevin love, sign a necromancer to summon gooden, and varegao. Solid"
You 100% just shit all over Pau placing him lower than Kevin Love   Don’t back track   I’d be embarrassed if I did that to one of the greatest to ever play for my team   Gross tbh
Kevin Love turned into prime Gary Payton there.  His footwork to stay in front of Curry should be taught to kids lol
"Stephs shot against Kevin Love.  73 wins, MVP and a ring.  Warriors greatest team ever, and KD doesn’t sign so they maybe don’t become greatest team of all time"
"Well the Durant one is fresh but it wasn't a missed shot , so for the modern era I'm going Steph Curry , if he makes his shot against Kevin Love the game gets tight again, maybe that changes how the rest of that game goes in a possible overtime and maybe they win it and no Kevin Durant to the Warriors and all those ramifications    I'm going with Frank Selvy game 7 in 1962, if that shot goes in the Celtics don't win eight straight, Elgin Baylor gets a ring , Jerry West gets one earlier , and the Lakers probably win a couple more championships to close out the decade oh, I believe after a while the Celtics just got in the Lakers heads to where they couldn't even beat them with Wilt Chamberlain, and all those finals loss has gotten their head as well because they had their issues with the Knicks afterwards"
*laughs in Kevin Love*
The Kevin Love special
"If you exclude 97 and 98, Jordan only got paid $30.5 mil in NBA salary in his career.  That's less than what Kevin Love got paid just last season."
"Lol when they had +7 year contracts everyone complained.  A team would sign a player that wasn't worth it to a +7 year max and tank their team for a decade.  Imagine if guys like Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, Kemba Walker, and Gordon Hayward signed +7 year max deals."
"LeBron James - $346,203,575182   Kevin Garnett - $334,304,240223   Kobe Bryant - $323,312,307204   Chris Paul - $299,909,419165   Shaquille O'Neal - $286,344,668196   Kevin Durant - $264,153,846147   Carmelo Anthony - $259,881,402188   Dirk Nowitzki - $251,646,362219   Russell Westbrook - $244,370,5241310   Dwight Howard - $242,500,7921711   Tim Duncan - $242,024,8002212   Chris Bosh - $239,063,6221613   James Harden - $224,349,7341214   Blake Griffin - $223,359,0121215   Pau Gasol - $220,990,7661916   Joe Johnson - $215,017,1541817   Al Horford - $212,136,7681418   LaMarcus Aldridge - $210,744,2281519   Stephen Curry - $208,955,3821220   Mike Conley - $206,087,9861421   Kevin Love - $204,003,1781322   Zach Randolph - $196,597,2451823   Dwyane Wade - $196,388,4731624   Paul Pierce - $195,132,0322025   Kyle Lowry - $190,048,6981526   Paul Millsap - $189,898,8671527   Tyson Chandler - $187,576,1011928   John Wall - $184,827,1081129"
Kevin Love and Blake Griffin just aren't the same caliber of player. You really shouldn't compare them.
I hope the Lakers stay far away from Kevin Love.   He's likely to take the bag then sprain is hangnail and sulk for the rest of the season.
The Kevin Love buyout later this year is going to stir some feathers
"Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith, and a bought-out Kevin Love joining them, with Chris Bosh being hired as a player development consultant, and Channing Frye/Richard Jefferson taking over as exclusive commentators for every game they play."
"Dude Kelly O was playing like prime Kevin Love, I want him back to us"
Kevin Love had 31pts 31rebs in 2010
"That's just narrative. The Mavs legit had a better team than the Heat. A better and more experienced coach at that time and more depth with a lot of veteran players. Plus Lebron played like a role player in that series lol. Only Wade legit looked like a star for the Heat. Bosh was already a role player in that system. Cause he wasn't a guard or a wing and can't consistently create his own shot. I actually think a healthy Nets team is much more devastating offensively than those Heat teams could dream of being. Wade couldn't shoot to save his life and Bosh regressed a lot on offense in that system, just like Kevin Love when he joined Lebron and the Cavs."
"Again I can cherry pick bad playoff performances from love too but I think I'm done with this convo this isnt going nowhere   &gt; When Klay can get to all nba second team and lead a team to 40 wins as the first option he'll have an argument, until then he'll always be below love whether you like it or not.  Considering most people agree klay will end up in the hall of fame one day and most people dont even kevin love has a hof talent, I think this is in reverse most people have klay higher all time than love lol"
Outside of the raptors series kevin love felt more like a role player more than a complementary star next to lebron during that playoff run. People were arguing if that was lebrons worst cast he's ever been around there's a reason why its viewed as an all time carry job and not the other way around. Also he made an all star team similar to how mo williams made an all star team with lebron    Love and Klay swap places (even assuming love was healthy) and the cavs are a dynasty not the warriors and the warriors probably dont even make the finals in 2016 and the cavs most likely 3 peat with lebron kyrie and klay.
I agree. The sentiment that they weren’t a super team is hindsight. Kevin Love was considered pretty good and him being hurt is why LeBron lost in 2015. LeBron won in 2016 with the help of Kevin Love. Kyrie has always been seen as good help.
"&gt; Oladipo didn’t take a jump until the next season  He was still a solid defender, shooter and 16ppg scorer. And then you have Horford, who was an All Star talent at the time.  &gt; Kevin Love would be far more effective against the Thunder than he was against the warriors.  How?"
Can we be honest? Oladipo and Horford didn’t guarantee anything.  Oladipo didn’t take a jump until the next season. Besides I still think OKC would lose to the cavs. Kevin Love would be far more effective against the Thunder than he was against the warriors.
Kevin Love made it when the PF position was weak and the best players at that position were a bit older outside of blake griffin if you really want to go there  Love has accomplished almost nothing significant without lebron and klays +2 rings are over love's 2nd team all nba appearance on a losing Timberwolves team
KP averaged 20/9 this season on career efficiency from every area of the court. He is not Kevin Love.
Laughs in Kevin Love.
"That's just a play on the old fanfic that Westbrook and Kevin Love would team up on the Lakers from around 2013. In that universe, Durant was a straight up trade to the Clippers for Blake Griffin (they had similar value and contracts) during the Lob City era, which made sense because Griffin had played in Oklahoma during college.  Also there was the CP3 to team up with Dwight Howard on the Hornets rumor that never panned out.  NBA is fun fanfiction."
&gt;kevin love + sexton  Yikes
"You wouldn’t pay a productive Lowry 30 mil, yet you would pay the corpse of Kevin Love the same amount?"
"yea like that wouldn’t happen with lowrys old ass getting paid 30m a year lol. nope as opposed to moving dragic, herro, and precious for kevin love + sexton."
Lebron has legit one year that can be defined as a carry job in those 8 straight. None of the heat year were a carry job and the first 3 in Cleveland he had Kyrie and Kevin Love. All at a time when the East was trash. Get a grip man.
"But by all other accounts besides r/NBA opinions, Windhorst is exceptional at his job. He writes a lot of big stories for ESPN and corroborates many others. The big Jerry Colangelo-Kevin Love drop was all Windhorst.  r/NBA just doesn't like the way he talks or looks. And quite frankly, it's probably self hated manifesting. It's their chance to make fun of someone who looks like them.  Windhorst's point was about the Pelicans being on a tight clock. You might not like it but it's true after this much instability right away in Zion's career. Windhorst didn't make the point cogently but he was out of it the whole podcast because he's in Tokyo time doing a podcast during American hours."
I think KAT is a better defender than he gets credit for.   It's just Minnesota so he doesn't give a fuck Ala Kevin Love.   Disclaimer: I haven't watched a bunch of Wolves games.
I love Jeff green. He torched Boston in game 7 when he was playing in place of Kevin love.
"Dunno why you're getting downvoted. This reach got them Kevin Love. They could have reached for anyone in that draft, it didn't matter because they were getting traded."
"Tim Legler is fantastic love him not very visible on ESPN though sadly. Zach Lowe has been awesome for a while now. Kevin O' Conner is great. Dreamerspro is pretty good on youtube; he really hates basketball media and gets a bit too mald over it, but when hes talking x.o's he certainly gets it."
[Serious] Did LeBron give Kevin Love WineMom-itis?
"Called Kevin Love a ""token white guy"""
"I don't really think it's on Colangelo. The statement was dick, but if he followed all the same procedures they had for years and Kevin Love just lied than it's more on Love to me. Kevin took advantage of the fact that he is a veteran gold medalist and they historically take someone like him at his word. They don't work these guys out and all of a sudden they're going to? Kevin actually ended up playing the final stretch of the season as well, so it's not like a player that was supposed to be injured at the time either. I don't understand what vetting he was supposed to do more if he went through normal procedures."
"Lol ah yes the 4-0 sweep of curry, klay, KD, draymond vs Lebron and the amazing Kevin Love. Such a difficult team for Durant to overcome. What a legend!!! Let’s just call the east weak as shit but forget about KD joining a 73-9 team to get his titles. Couldn’t do it without another 3 stars. At least lebron got his titles with only 2 other stars and 1 other star on the Lakers. If Kevin Durant is the best player why couldn’t he carry the nets to the playoffs. 2007 Lebron carried his shitty team to the finals then did it again in 2018"
"Bosh told Kevin Love it would be ""extremely frustrating"" playing with LeBron"
LeBron gave Kevin Love depression.
Kevin Love Thy Neighbor
"I just matched those points. How do you know benching DeRozan was the right decision? I’m not disagreeing with it, per se, but how do we know he doesn’t hit his first 3 of the series in that quarter? Or something to that effect.   And again, how many of his minutes matched up against LeBron, and, in this case, Kevin Love? Very easy to have a terrible +/- with Bron and his designated partner wreaking havoc when you’re on the floor. Lowry also finished that game with a negative +/- even leading a 20 point comeback."
"Draymond is such a high BB IQ guy, coupled with being very articulate. I was wondering if he would consider being a coach in the future, but it looks like he’s already rationalized why he wouldn’t, and it’s a very thoughtful response:  https://fansided.com/2021/04/09/warriors-draymond-green-coaching-future/  &gt; “I think about it, and I don’t think I will,” said Green said on former teammate Kevin Durant’s “The ETCs” podcast. “One — the lack of competitiveness in players bothers me more than anything, and I don’t know how I would handle that as a coach.”  &gt;“When I’m done playing basketball, I don’t know if I want to be on a basketball schedule. I’ve been on a basketball schedule my entire life.”  &gt;“A coach’s schedule — they’re in the gym as much as us, plus a bunch of film, plus this meeting [and] that meeting. Their schedule in some ways is more strenuous than ours.”   I would love to see him be an analyst when he retires. He has a nice mix of bringing thoughtful responses, candor, and fun bluster to a show."
Did Kevin Love personally shit in your Cheerios or something?
Bro nets are loaded. We need one more buyout guy because of the nets. Hopefully Kevin Love.

"People are getting it from Chris Bosh, for one.   Here he is talking about getting fewer shots when moving to Miami.   &gt; ""You just get your entree and that's it. It's like, wait a minute, I need my appetizer and my dessert and my drink, what are you doing? And my bread basket. What is going on? I'm hungry! It’s a lot different. But if you can get through it, good things can happen. But it never gets easy. Even up until my last year of doing it, it never gets easier.""

"Al Jefferson, Kevin Love, Demarcus Cousins"
"I understand what made it so effective, but Barnes was an average starter and if I remember correctly was usually being used to guard Kevin Love. A man much bigger and taller than him. This wears you down. It isn't like Harrison dropped in quality for no reason, he had to bang against K Love.  Injuries happen every year to playoff teams and you MUST adjust. Lebron lost his 2 stars in 2015 so tried to utilise Mozgov as much as possible and punish the warriors with size. The Warriors had lost Steph in playoff games before and guess what, they adjusted. Now they did have a choice in this and they chose to stick with the game plan as, like you say, it had been working throughout the regular and post season. But Warriors fans throwing Barnes under the bus and acting like he is the entire reason they didn't win in 2016 is just plain wrong."
Kevin Love
"Yep one left, thats for the last past all star above 30 year old slot in kevin love"
Kevin Love was targeted by the Warriors on that play they forced that switch. Love was the Cavs worst defender and if he wasn't in the game Curry would have had to deal with a better defender.
"That was less Kevin Love and more of the entire Cavs team fouling Curry offball while he played on a sprained MCL. Love put up a really inefficient 9/7/1 that series, so I think most replacement level players would have also won."
"I know DeAndre doesn't exactly move the needle at this time in his career, but shit is so sad. It's a two state league.      Can't wait for the Kevin Love sweepstakes when the time comes."
"There still were Pau and prime Marc Gasol in the league. Tim Duncan had one down year but was still a great player with the entire arsenal. LMA was still young and was Portland's best player. Kevin Love played some all-time seasons with the Wolves operating as a post players almost entirely, Boogie Cousins was emerging and AD was drafted the season after '12. Chris Bosh dominated the post but played a different role in Miami. Al Jefferson was a post maestro and in his prime, David West played really well and Paul Millsap was averaging 17 with a great post move arsenal. Oh and Dirk was still All-NBA level.  Not saying he didn't have a argument for one of the best post players but saying no guys with good post moves were in the league until Jokic and Embiid is way off."
"Kevin Love was his only mistake. The lakers didn’t have the option to get anyone better than Russ, it’s not like Russ was his first choice for a star.   Wade and Bosh were fucked by injuries it wasn’t a bad decision  But yeah I think the Cavs coulda gotten someone like Paul George instead of Love for Wiggins"
"LeBron texting Kevin Love right now like ""look man if you take that buyout I'll pay the difference and throw in some Klutch equity, this arms race is getting heated"""
"It’s the Year 2077, the Cold War between Brooklyn and LA continues.   Kevin Love signs for a vet min in LA.   JJ Redick signs for a vet min in Brooklyn.   They’re trapped ultimately; the gravitational pull of the big market too much for their feeble minds to comprehend.  The cities of Detroit and Minnesota have gone bankrupt. Decades of buying out and freeing washed up players from the shackles of the small market have left the cities barren. Ash falls on the lake."
&gt; Coaching the Rockets to 1st seed in the West ... is already better than Bud's whole career.  He managed to get the 2014-15 Hawks to a 60-22 record and best in the East over the LeBron/Kyrie/Kevin Love Cavs. The backcourt was Jeff Teague and a 33-year old Kyle Korver.
This feels exactly like the Kevin Love for Klay Thompson + Draymond Green speculation way back when Love wanted out from Minnesota  People underrate the Hawks assets because they haven't gotten their chance yet and think the Hawks need to make a move to get to the next level. They just need to keep the core together as best they can.
Kevin love got a ton of shit his entire time in Cleveland
Agreed but he’s not good enough to force a small list of teams and honestly is having a Simmons who refuses to play worse than having Kevin Love on the roster. One of them you have to pay and the other one you get to fine and don’t have to cut game checks to.  Just a thought.
People also assume that the ability to lock in for a possession or two means they can defend like that all the time. Kevin Love has never been a good defender in his career. But he played textbook defense against Curry the last possession in the Finals. They assume that statistical outlier is the new normal
"Dude he's playing with first round picks, ofc his stats are good. And yes. It's by far the worst contract in the league. AND THERE IS JOHN WALL, HAYWARD AND KEVIN LOVE. And yeah, my bad. He won't even be a fringe all star. Top 100 at best. My bad."
"I’m so tired of this narrative. What has Kyrie done without LeBron? And Kevin love? Really?   LeBron went back to Cleveland to make things right, and he did. He could’ve gone anywhere in 2014."
"Only trolls will say it didn't make a difference. The argument is it can't be used as an excuse because he was like the 6th most important player, and on the other side Kevin Love got a concussion and was straight ass the whole series."
"Kevin Love has okayed good D in 'select moments'. He's a liability dude, he doesn't move at all"
"Festus Ezeli locked eyes with his point guard, leaped past two defenders and threw down an alley-oop dunk.  It was late September, and Ezeli — more than 4 ½ years removed from his last NBA game — was playing pickup in Sacramento. As he followed that alley-oop with chase-down blocks, offensive rebounds and putback dunks, he realized that, for the first time since knee issues had ended his professional career at just 27, he was moving with ease. Gone were the fears about stepping the wrong way and aggravating an injury.  Finally, Ezeli told himself, the time had come to contact teams in hopes of returning to the NBA. When the G League season starts next week at a bubble environment in Orlando, Ezeli will be part of a waiver pool that allows franchises to claim him. At any point over the following month or so, he could receive a call from someone asking him to pack his bags, board a flight to Florida and play his first pro game in nearly half a decade.  At age 31 with an extensive injury history, Ezeli is an unlikely member of basketball’s striving class. In 2016, while with the Trail Blazers after the Warriors renounced his rights in order to sign Kevin Durant, he was diagnosed with a defect in the cartilage of his left knee. Doctors told Ezeli that he needed experimental surgery. His playing days almost certainly seemed over.  As Ezeli spent six months post-surgery confined to a wheelchair and relying on help to use the bathroom, he sank into a deep depression. Basketball had become fundamental to his identity. Without it, he felt lost.  “Depression is an understatement,” Ezeli said of that dark period. “Until that point, I never understood the importance of mental health. … But not being able to walk on your own for half a year, you definitely become close friends with depression.”  After Ezeli underwent surgery on his right knee and missed the 2013-14 season, he helped Golden State win the 2015 title. Little more than a year later, fresh off careerhigh averages in points (7), rebounds (5.6), blocks (1.1), minutes (16.7) and field-goal percentage (54.8) for a team that reached the Finals, he signed a two-year, $15.2 million deal with the Trail Blazers in free agency.  “The trajectory of my journey has always been about overcoming seemingly impossible odds,” Ezeli said. “I mean, I went from getting cut from my high school team to playing meaningful minutes in the Finals.  Ezeli was waived by the Trail Blazers in June 2017 without playing a game for them. As he built up the muscle in his left leg and re-learned how to walk, he went two years without shooting a basketball. In that time, the NBA embraced a position-less style, prioritizing speed and versatility over size.  Traditional centers like Ezeli were replaced by basketball unicorns: interior defenders who also can hit 3-pointers, pass and guard any position. Even Ezeli’s close friends and family encouraged him to consider other career options.  Genial and articulate, Ezeli could find success in broadcasting. There also was the economics degree from Vanderbilt he had yet to use.  His message of perseverance resonated with many who hadn’t even followed his career. In April, Ezeli created an Instagram page with the handle “@RebuildingTheBeast” and invited people to share their stories of resolve. In less than 10 months, the account has featured more than 300 posts about everything from living with physical disabilities, to dealing with personal tragedy, to navigating mental health issues.  The Instagram page has nearly 3,000 followers. Ezeli plans to soon publish a “Rebuilding The Beast” podcast series, with interviews from people who’ve overcome personal challenges. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, whose father was assassinated in 1984 by two gunmen outside his office in Beirut, is one of Ezeli’s first guests.  “I love his zest for life,” Kerr said of Ezeli. “His desire to play, his engagement in trying to make that happen. I love all of that, and I sure hope it happens for him.”  At least five days a week, Ezeli arrives at a gym near his Los Angeles-area home by 6:30 a.m. After 90 minutes of basketball, he does yoga, Pilates, weightlifting and rehab exercises intended to strengthen his left leg.  His body fat is below where it was when he was in the NBA. In pickup games, Ezeli flashes the same hustle and explosiveness that made him a key part of the Warriors’ rotation.  Overseas clubs recently inquired about signing Ezeli, but for now, he’s focused on the G League, from which 35 players were called up to the NBA last season.  “My goal is to play in the NBA again,” Ezeli said. “Whatever I’ve got to do to get there, I’m willing to do. I don’t like to regret things, so I’m just going to leave it all on the table and see what happens.”"
"Can all these unsigned or unwanted players all gather and form a 31st NBA team somewhere, say, in Vancouver, BC? I'd buy season tickets to see the Vancouver Coyotes comprised of Simmons, IT, Drummond, Cousins, Dennis Smith, Kevin Love, etc."
"Apparently, the Cavs don't get the benefit of the doubt on that one. Love's injury caused him to play terribly. 8 points and 7 rebounds a game on 36% shooting is awful for an all star whose best qualities are shooting and rebounding. Warriors fans will go on for days though about how Andrew Bogut's 12 MPG was the real difference maker.    The clown you're responding to called Bogut the best rim protector in the league, then said the Cavs were better without Kevin Love lmao. Totally not biased"
Cavs weren’t just banged up in 2015 tho. Kevin love was out from the Celtics series and kyrie broke his knee towards the end of game 1 of the finals. They did not play at all. Not the same as iggy being banged up or bogut missing the last two games
What about Kevin Love being concussed? Did that not make a difference?
I don’t see Kevin love giving up any money in a buyout since he already has a ring.
PG: Kevin Love  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Evan Mobley  C: Tacko Fall  Who needs good NBA players when you can just do netball passes to other seven-footers all day lmao
"Man I remember that shit.  He had some abysmal games leading up to the final games. I think he played like 10 minutes in game 6 before leaving and I was like alright this is the game he's gonna come back and show everyone why he's an All-Star. He'll be well rested, fire in the eyes!  I put $100 for Kevin Love to get a double-double by the end of the game thinking this is the easiest shit ever. All the haters kept piling and somehow the Vegas line made it that much easier for me to bet. He secured three rebounds early but he also got two fouls so he had to sit out first quarter.   Teasing the shit out of me all game, he finally ended up with 14 rebounds... 9 points. Same guy torched the living shit out of us in 2016 ECF that concussion must have took his soul away."
Kevin Love had brain damage in games 2-7
Lol wasn't there a poolside meeting to get Love to stay too? Kevin Love having to consider staying with Lebron is hysterical in hindsight.
Kevin Love would look great in a suit on the Sixers bench
Who exactly are Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook supposed to be? Are they not all future HOF locks lmao?  The moment you even said that dumb shit you invalidated you’re entire point.   Social media didn’t create shit. A lot of us weren’t born in 2003 and actually grew up getting to watch both Jordan and Lebron lol
"Kevin Love was considered around that level when LeBron recruited him, actually. Rankings from prior to the 14-15 season start have him around Top 5-7  ESPN  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/11752977/2014-nba-player-rankings-7](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11752977/2014-nba-player-rankings-7)  BR[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2398741-br-nba-200-ranking-nbas-best-players-of-2014-15-season](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2398741-br-nba-200-ranking-nbas-best-players-of-2014-15-season)  Also the point he made wasn't whether the players remained Top 5 throughout his time there but rather if they were when he joined them"
Cavs because he really made people buy into the fact that he went back to Cleveland to win a ring when in reality he went back because they had Kyrie and enough trade assets to get Kevin Love.
Guess I need to photoshop pics of Kevin Love in a Suns jersey
"&gt; Games also regularly ended with a score far below 100.   Which era you talking about? 1980s had faster pace than current era and even 1990s to mid 90s is comparable to today's pace, and faster than 2016 pace.   &gt; Scoring averages aren't the best metric  Okay so look at it per 36 min and per 100 possessions. It's insanely downplayed the kind of caliber players LeBron played with throughout their careers, they're top 10 scorers in the league with AD being a DPOY candidate as well. That's like Curry facing against two other players that can score nearly as much as he does while he got Klay, who is an inconsistent catch and shoot shooter. Kevin Love's ability to stretch the floor is underappreciated throughout the entirety of LeBrons run and his numbers would have been way higher outside of that system, this is why Chris Bosh told Love that it would be 'extremely frustrating' playing with LeBron."
shocked nobody here's said Kevin Love yet. yeah he's still on the Cavs payroll but it's obvious his heart isn't in it anymore.   but who knows? he might pull a Blake Griffin if he ever leaves cleveland.
"Kevin love wasn’t good on the cavs though. It’s not a superteam when one of your players used to be great. I’d take bulls rodman or cavs love every time, and i’d take pippen over kyrie every time."
"&gt; for a lottery team in Cleveland, granted they added Love  this is so disingenuous. lebron fucking james isn't leaving the miami heat to go to a lottery team. he went to a team with kyrie irving, a top 10 point guard and all-star talent and kevin love, a top 5 power forward of the time. if you really think you can convince people lebron went to a shitty team after he left that shitty team years prior, you're just biased.  he leaves teams when he sees he can be in better situations. that's it. point blank. not much to it. it's a knock on him legacy-wise  lebron is a helocentric player, just like harden is, when teams who have one guy who does pretty much everything on offense leave they will obviously falter since the whole roster is created to maximize the guys talents. it's no coincidence that the rockets and cavs sucked after the 1 guy left because that 1 guy was literally their whole system  that's not a knock on lebron but it's not some gotcha moment when the whole roster was top to bottom created to bolster his game. why would you have a ball dominant star player next to harden/bron when all they need are spot up shooters in the corner who can defend and rebound?"
"These teams had some assets but they still weren’t some star studded casts. There are plenty of teams he could’ve gone to with more assets, especially when he went back to Cleveland. What happened to the Heat and the Cavs was also unusual and out of his control. Wades body started deteriorating earlier than expected and Bosh had his unlucky blood clots. Kevin Love is only 32 but might be a minimum player and Kyrie ended up being the NBAs most eccentric player and forced his way out. Maybe if these guys aged gracefully like Manu and Parker next to Duncan, or Kareem and Worthy next to Magic, or Scottie and Rodman next to MJ, he wouldn’t have needed to leave."
"I think it just further reinforces the fact that poverty breeds more mental health issues and sadly Detroit is and has been a pretty poor metro for a while now. I made this post mainly as a joke, and I’ll poke fun at some of the weird things some of these dudes did, but at the end of the day for most of the people that have been named here they clearly have mental health issues and it’s a good thing that people like Kevin Love and Demar Derozan talk about that shit now and hopefully it can lead to people being in better situations in the future."
"Calling Kyrie Irving and a healthy Kevin Love ""role players"" is definitely insulting lol."
Cavs did not have Kevin Love before Lebron came.  Also Kyrie and the Cavs did not make the playoffs 1 time before Lebron.
"You're right, Kevin Love, Wade, Rose, IT, that 2018 Cavs tean were way too unfair! Their talent rivals the 90s Bulls for sure.   Why stop there, you forgot to mention Melo, Big Z, Rondo, Mo Williams, Drummond! LeBron has truly stacked the deck lmao."
"2 other top 5?  Bosh was not top 5.   Lebron at age 22 dragged a moderate team to 66 wins, beat the dominant Detroit pistons in the ECF.   Who  was top 5 when Lebron went back to Cleveland? Kyrie was not top 5 and neither was Kevin Love.   Also who did he have when he moved to the Lakers. Literally no one. He got Anthony Davis (fringe top 5 at best) and.. who is their other top 5? Please remind me.   ""The only other player Kobe has played with Shaq"".. lol he got 3 rings with a guy who's peak is as high as MJ and is a top 10 player of all time. Also his other 2 rings he got when the Lakers acquired Pau Gasol from Memphis who was arguably a Chris Bosh type.. and better than him. Not to mention Kobe also had a healthy and willing Andrew Bynum.   Yeah Kobe's team were ""organic"". Let's just forget the fact that he FORCED his way to the Lakers on draft night."
Y’all want Kevin Love? He’s only 6’8 and we gotta get taller people on the roster
"Can someone please explain to me why Cleveland re-signed Kevin Love? They had already lost LeBron and that roster was trash even with LeBron on it (remember the 2018 playoffs?) A week into the season they abruptly changed their minds, fired Lue, traded Korver, and cut JR, so Kevin Love had basically 5 years of a max contract left on a terrible team he was never going to carry alone and then he got hurt.  I'm just trying to fathom when this contract ever made sense? If he was on a shorter deal, he already would have been bought out/expired and signed a minimum deal to go play with LeBron again, he couldn't even make the Olympic team when they asked him to play."
What are you talking about? Lebron definitely looks around the same height if not a bit taller than Kevin Love.
"That's genuinely a very fair point but I think the issue is that people are taking the difference between Pippen with and without MJ to mean Pippen without MJ would have been out of the league and that's just not the case.  Pippen would have been more like Kevin Love or Chris Bosh or Pau Gasol in regards to how his legacy would be viewed if he played by himself, good enough to make an All Star team once or twice, but could not get a team to the playoffs without help.  Pippen with Jordan was a borderline MVP candidate and one of the 50 greatest players of all time.   Nobody in their right mind is ever going to call Kevin Love one of the 50 best players of all time, even after playing with Lebron.  I would go on to argue that Lebron makes players better when they are actively playing with Lebron, while Jordan made players better permanently.  To your point,  other players benefitted from playing with MJ in practice everyday and went on to do arguably better things because of it like Horace Grant in Orlando before he got hurt, or Steve Kerr on the Spurs."
kevin love averaged 17/10 in 2019
"Cleveland Receives: Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxsey  Philadelphia Receives: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, 2 FRP (Protections)"
a gently used Kevin Love
"&gt;even 2018 kevin love was a better player than anyone on the 2007 team minus lebron  He was but he wasn't that much better, he shot like 40% from the field as a guy who can't play defense.  Outside of Lebron/Love everyone on that Cavs team was absolute shit on both offense/defense."
who do you think was the 07 cav's solid #2 option? larry hughes? who averaged 11 points in the playoffs?  even 2018 kevin love was a better player than anyone on the 2007 team minus lebron
"Oh come on.  Kevin Love is clearly the best ball handler, passer and shooter in that bunch.  He needs to be the PG.  JEeze.  Some people."
2007 Cavs were actually a good defensive and 2018 Kevin Love was an all star so imma go 2015
"I don't think it was exaggeration. I believe this was a result of (1) the NBA changing measuring official heights to barefoot from previously with shoes, which is pretty much a 1.5"" difference, and (2) the effects of rounding to whole inches.   At the 2008 combine Kevin Love measured 6' 7.75'' without shoes, and 6' 9.5'' with shoes, which when properly rounded was 6'10"".  https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?sort=HEIGHT\_WO\_SHOES&amp;dir=1&amp;SeasonYear=2008-09"
There’s no footage of Kevin Love locking Kyrie up I’ll say that much
"I know this is 3 days late but I had some dude tell me couple weeks ago here that ""lebron froze out Kevin Love that's why he was so bad during the 2018 playoff run minus the raptors series"""
Take out Kevin Love and then we’ll talk
"&gt; incredibly mild comments  Sorry. A HC saying anything publicly after a big playoff exit other than ""This was on me, I have complete faith in every player"" is definitely a betrayal. The formula is for everyone to say ""it's on me"" in public then fight in the locker room and they all know it, which is why when these things come out in public it's a big deal, because it means it's been simmering in the locker room and finally boiled over.  As for your examples: Kobe and MJ kept their locker rooms at a constant boil on purpose. Obviously it worked out okay, but the rules are different when they're around. LeBron tried to mimic that ploy, but otherwise tries to be a ""lets all bring it in"" type guy, so the betrayal of that tweet murdered Kevin Love's confidence in plain sight. So yeah, in retrospect, Love should have demanded a trade that very day."
"Nothing... People just like to shit on the cavs.  Mobley is our starting PF.  Allen is our starting C  Lauri is our backup PF/C  Kevin Love is going to get paid to chill at home.  Tacko is a non-guaranteed, training camp deal."
Put Kevin Love at the point! He's a very good passer
"It still wasn't a perfect team but compared to like, Kevin Love shooting 40% from the field the Cavs had no consistent offensive help. So I guess I should say good *comparatively* because Ibaka, Adams, and Roberson (on defense mostly) is not terrible compared to what LeBron had"
Collin Sexton and Kevin love
very bold of you to assume Kevin Love is going to play at some point
"They'll have to get someone to replace that manlet Kevin Love. Only 6'8, psshhhh"
"Regardless, it was a good-faith contract, and it didn't pan out. I'm not trying to say there weren't reasons for it at the time. I personally didn't hate the signing, but it was laughable to think that a team of leftovers led by Kevin Love was going to accomplish anything. Or constitute a $120 million deal for him... There were some emotions involved there."
"The people acting as if this is the first time a coach or teammate has criticized a teammate's play or conduct to the press were either born yesterday or are just being incredibly dishonest.   Ben Simmons has been coddled by the Sixers his entire career. He has straight up ignored the team's development plans for him since he got there and he's refused to change his game despite the fact that his teammates have done so for him. The team were gassing him up and defending him to the media all year long. People were clowning Doc the entire season for defending Simmons and saying he was fine the way he was.   Embiid and Doc's incredibly mild comments weren't some stunning betrayal or unprecedented faux pas. It should have motivated him to get his act together and prove them wrong. This isn't coming out of thin air, the Sixers have been fighting an uphill battle to get this guy to do what he's supposed to, and when he won't even do the things he claims to be good at, what are you supposed to do? Those comments should have motivated him, not prompted him to quit on the team.  Ask yourselves; should Pau Gasol have demanded a trade from the Lakers when Kobe told the media Pau needed to be more aggressive? Should Kevin Love have asked out of the Cavs when LeBron passive aggressively tweeted that he should fit in? Should Pippen have given up on the Bulls when Phil Jackson criticized him to the media for asking out of the final play in Game 3 v.s. the Knicks? Those comments were all inarguably worse than what Simmons got. Should they have asked out, or were they right in sucking it up, improving and winning all those championships?"
"Y’all literally still have Kevin Love on your pay roll and you are worried about a “price tag”?  Would you rather get absolutely nothing for your max contract, or a basketball player who actually plays basketball? Lol"
"they should send him to Cleveland for Kevin Love and a 2nd round pick  Enjoy, young socialite"
NO WAY we would take Kevin Love bro. He's a buyout level player + there would be a Horford situation once again. Rather call the Wolves for DLo.
Kevin love refuses to play but he's still paid
I mean even after 2010 he ended up making Kevin Love depressed
Soon they'll have Kevin Love too
"Russ at 44 million is a nearly untradeable contract.  Ask Houston who traded him for a guy with one knee.  Wiz swapped one untradeable contract Wall to another in Russ. And then was able to flip Russ for 3 assets plus a draft pick,  plus cap space that was used to get Dinwiddie.   There is probably no other team in the NBA that would trade for Russ' contract besides maybe Cleveland with Kevin Love"
nah but he is the dopest player and has the wettest shot and all my homies love Kevin Durant.
Kevin Love   And I know I'm going to get some hate for this. But dude needs a change of scenery. He can still ball
"What 44 million dollar collection of things would anyone give up for John Wall?  I wouldnt even give you Kevin Love for him.  Not because I think Love is better, but because 44 million is just SOOOO fucking much."
"I mean, citing 2016 in your argument isn’t helping your point. Steph was clearly banged up and couldn’t get past Kevin Love. That’s a big red flag that can’t be ignored. That’s like if Kyrie had failed to score on Brynn Forbes. I would assume something was off and wouldn’t shit on a hobbled Kyrie."
Jerry West threatened to walk if they traded Klay for Kevin Love.
Not having complete agreement was the main reason they didn't trade Klay for Kevin Love. I'd say they took the right strategy.
They said healthy LeBron and Kyrie. Never mentioned Kevin love.
PG: Evan Mobley   SG: Lauri Markkanen   SF: Kevin Love   PF: Jarrett Allen   C: Tacko Fall
"I don’t get why people get SO worked up and have to resort to insults immediately. It’s Reddit, *relax*.  I singled out 2013 specifically because that’s when we got Allen, who was still lethal at the time. I already conceded 2012 too. I watched almost all of the 2011 season and our bench was just pitiful, I won’t move off of that. It showed when we got to the Finals and Dallas smacked us around.   As far as Cleveland goes, K-Love was *good* yes, but it’s funny how Love sucks unless it’s to argue that LeBron’s Cavs were super teams. Love put up numbers for a Wolves team that couldn’t win anything, great. Love wasn’t even an all star the last 2 years LeBron was in Cleveland, and a fringe All Star the previous 2. Again, Love was *good*, but I don’t think adding Kevin Love to your team makes you a “super team”. I remember the memes and all the K-Love clowning from when he was scoring 0 points or getting yelled at by LeBron for underperforming in Cleveland.   The Lakers teams weren’t super teams, although people still like to think so since AD is there.   Also, any LeBron comment that isn’t “HaHa LeBrOn 4-6 FiNaLs JoRdAn 6-0” or some variation of that is usually met with downvotes and bitching. It’s to be expected."
"A Superteam can be seen as 3 All-Stars with all being capable of being number 1 options or 2 Superstars with an all-star to back them up.   Wade, LeBron and Bosh was a Superteam.  KD, Westbrook and Harden despite being homemade was a Superteam.  Kyrie, LeBron and Kevin Love in 2017 was a Superteam.  Steph, KD, Klay and Dray was a Superteam.  2021 and the 2022 Nets are and will be one.  2022 Lakers are a Superteam."
LeBron gave Kevin Love depression
"I know, I'm talking about Kevin Love."
Casey putting CJ Miles on Kevin Love in 2018 had me pulling my hair out lol.
"Since the 1982-83 NBA season, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Willis, Enes Kanter, Dwight Howard, Andrew Bynum, Kevin Love, Barkley, Mutumbo, Rony Seikaly, Michael Cage &amp; Charles Oakley are the only players to grab at least 30 rebounds in one game.  Dwight Howard &amp; Kevin Love are the only ones to score at least 30 points while grabbing 30+ rebounds in the same game.  Rodman had 5 30+ rebounds games in his career while Kevin Willis had 2."
Steph and Lebron had a heated rivalry but it was mainly Steph who won. I wouldn't say that Steph is way better than him because Steph had both Klay and KD in their primes. Lebron had a rookie Kyrie and just prime Kevin Love.  Thoughts?
Kevin Love had a few of these with Bron
"&gt; unlike Bosh who could play good defense if he was having an off night offensively,  I mean he was way better than kevin Love on defense, but he still under-performed in a lot of series too. His defense wasn't that good to make up for the shortcomings on offense. His 2013 playoff run was so poor, and definitely not good enough for someone making so much and considered to be part of a big 3.  and in 2012 he missed half the playoffs and only averaged like 14 and 8  Bosh is pretty overrated on here. That is supposed to be one of the best 3rd options of all time? 14 and 8 in 2012 and 12 and 7 in 2013? Not like he was ever close to be all-defensive team level."
"Unfortunately, good players get forgotten all the time. Ask anyone on this sub about Michael Finley's posters or Ben Gordon getting hot. Kevin Love was better than them but it was the same case of being stuck on bad teams."
"It's the other way around..   Some people tries to take too much away from LeBron, without providing the CONTEXT   &gt;   The Kyrie shot was insane. Made Curry look like a fool too, and dropped the shot in his face.   But without that SUPERHUMAN LeBron chase down block (that took an insane effort, especially that late in the game when everyone was quite dead in energy),  the Kyrie shot never would've even happened, or mattered.  The GSW would've taken the lead and it'd have been a whole different ball game    &gt;   People forget, that NEITHER of the teams had scored even a single point for the whole 4-5 minutes in the end of that FINALS.. It was extremely tense.  That GSW bucket would've been the ultimate ice breaker, but LeBron hunted it down like Black Panther    &gt;     Then LeBron was the one to give the ball to Kyrie, and do his thing.  That's always been his leadership. Zero selfishness, but all about MATCHUPS. He saw that Curry is on Kyrie, and that was it..    &gt;    Kyrie did his thing, and drilled the shot. Boom   &gt;    **Kevin Love is the one who actually doesn't get enough credit**..  In the final minute, HE LOCKED DOWN CURRY ON THE OTHER END FOR SO LONG.. while Curry tried his best to dribble and dance, just to get enough space for the 3 ball. But nope. Lock down"
"Game 7 was a big team effort overall. JR’s run, Lebron 11 points in the 4th to lead all scorers, Kyrie’s shot, Bron’s block, Kevin Love getting the stop on Curry and having 14 boards, Kyrie with 26/6, Bron with 27/11/11. They all did their parts and made invaluable contributions"
[Also Kevin love locked steph down](https://youtu.be/XC-mTgXRfm8)
Yes. It blows my mind when people forget how good Kevin love before he went to the Cavs since that was only 7 years ago. That doesn’t seem long enough to completely forget that.
"I know Lebron fans have a tendency to diminish his former teammates. For example, Chris Bosh gets disrespected despite being an amazing player for the Heat and one of the greatest third options of all time. He was inconsistent in a few playoff series, but for the most part he was great. But when it comes to Kevin Love, I don't know how you can say he was anywhere near a special player on the Cavs. He had a bunch of extremely subpar playoff series, and unlike Bosh who could play good defense if he was having an off night offensively, Kevin Love was consistently *terrible* on Defense every single playoff run. He was also really mediocre whenever they gave him post touches (which was supposed to be his specialty). At most he was a good role player for them because he was always great as a rebounder. Kevin Love wasn't anywhere close to playing like a star for them."
We’re at a point now where people are starting to remember those cavs teams way differently than what they actually were. There are actual people out there that try to act like Kevin Love was a bum and not a special player before he got to the Cavs. It’s mind blowing.
"Yeah, that's the part that really stuck out. What the fuck are they talking about? There's one play and Curry just missed the shot. All Kevin Love did was not fall down."
&gt; Kevin love defense on curry he became prime Scottie Pippen on defense
"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
The times when Kevin has still love for the game
"The real Kevin love has attached ear lobes, nice try. This is Keith Hate, a doppelgänger who confused all of us while the real Kevin was chugging a litter of Ayahuasca in a Russian dive bar in Montreal. They only have red and blue party lights in there and are surprisingly polite. Good day"
"Considering some people have said Kevin Love was once a top 10 player, then peak Draymond was clearly a top 10 player."
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?   Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
I want to get paid millions to sit courtside or do absolutely nothing like Kevin love
I might be a terrible person but it’s not because I think Kevin love is soft af mentally.
This is someone reporting Amico answering a question about Kevin Love.  1. Amico = AmicNO  2. He was clearly being facetious when someone asked about a Simmons/Love swap and randomly threw out Rubio  3. If you take points one and two together then you definitely get the Sixers trading Simmons for Love
Kevin Love 30/30
"Kevin Love, career is full of empty stats."
Prime Kevin Love 30-20
Kevin Love 30/30 :)
Nobody here have a shit about Kevin Love but KG winning one with Boston and shouting out Minnesota after he won… that was special.
Absolutely isn’t getting 50 rebounds or averaging 50 ppg in today’s game. But if Kevin Love can do a single 31-31 game I think Wilt can probably do a few plus a couple 40+pt/30+reb games.
"The Kevin Love: 30 points, 30 rebounds"
"Yeah it’s one of those things I love Nique, but those teams never had any great players alongside him it was always Doc Rivers, Kevin Willis, and Tree Rollins very good players who were nowhere near stars . So we can’t really assess what he could’ve done with a supporting cast like Bird ( multiple titles in my opinion.) but this team now is designed around Trae and playmaking and dribble penetration"
Klay’s 37 point quarter isn’t some unattainable record. Kevin Love had 34 in a quarter and could have beaten it if they gave him the ball in the last few possessions
To add to this - IT was trying to call out Kevin Love after the dude had to leave the game with a panic attack.
what kevin love incident?
"Depends on how you think of superteams I guess. Like, what’s more of a super team: The Spurs when they had all star quality Manu, borderline all nba/all star Tony and all time great Tim or all star Kyrie, all star Kevin Love and all time great LeBron?   If one’s not a super team then what’s the difference?"
"Kawhi was actually injured. Completely different scenario. He was injured to start the season, then the team doctors cleared him while he still felt injured. And we know now that he has chronic leg problems so he sits out even when he's playing for a team he wants to play for, so we know he wasn't just making it up to hold out from playing for the Spurs. When Kawhi actually formally requested a trade around June of that year, it took less than a month for the Spurs to move him.  Kevin Love wasn't refusing to play, and he was on a lottery team, not a team with championship aspirations. Not moving Kevin Love didn't conflict with the Cavs goal of tanking. Completely different than with Philly who has an MVP and a playoff team looking to make the leap to championship contender.  So yes its literally never happened. Closest was Vince Carter who got traded during the season he mailed it in. No team is going to wait a full season to get rid of a guy that doesn't want to be there."
"the Spurs kept Kawhi and waited until season ended. and they didn't trade hin where he wanted to go.  the Cavs still have Kevin Love.  literally never happened, huh?  good point on opportunity cost tho. my reply to that is i guess morey thinks the opportunity cost of waiting is cheaper than the cost of losing ben for cheap. i'm sure he knows his cost-analysis."
"There’s a lot of resentment that lingers. Kevin Love has picked up the torch a bit, but the resentment remains. Ungrateful fans man."
"That's a fair question, I'd say generally the court of public opinion will decide if he's actually trying or not. If he's making Kevin Love-esque in-bound plays on the regular and shooting 10% from the floor, it'll become a national story and the pressure will come for him to change.  There's no threshold for that necessarily, but people know it when they see it."
"I love the warriors, but dray's 3 is never coming back, something happened after he nearly lost to kevin hart on all star weekend :("
What is hi toxic personality? And why won’t he be a good vet presence? Honestly want to know. I won’t be excited to have him join a team that I like but Im not so sure exactly why people consider him as toxic? Was this kevin love incident the one that made u dislike him?
"It's just not right. He played such a key role in the Celtics rebuild, had one and a half amazing offensive seasons and really brought the fans back after Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen were gone. It was almost like our version of Linsanity.   What Kevin Love incident? Are you thinking of Kelly Olynyk?"
Kevin love swap!
"i really do not understand the “nba did him dirty” opinion, his skillset is unfortunately not enough for the biggest place at this age and his size.  loved his game at his prime but after that kevin love incident i’ve lost most of my respect for him as a person. the way he records his every move and lives with a filmin team is just petty. thanks for the good memories tho"
"2 words. Elective surgery.  Kawhi's done it, Kyrie's threatened to do it, I think Kevin Love did it if I'm not mistaken."
"Not so sure about that. Kevin Love tried to ""toxic"" his way out of Cleveland. Even yelling ""trade me"" after a game or practice IIRC. They basically told him to shut up and play."
"Melvin and devin Booker, Gary trent and Gary trent Jr, Larry Nance and Larry Nance Jr, Stan and Kevin love, Mitchell and Andrew Wiggins, doc and Austin rivers, Wes and Wesley matthews, Gary Payton and Gary Payton II, Terry and Ed Davis, there are way more"
Will Kevin Love make the HOF?
"Incoming season where Ben Simmons plays like Kevin Love and phones it in just enough to not lose game checks, I’m sure Joel will love that 😂"
"The only people who report these are offered + assets are people with 76ers / Morey connections. For example, people with connections to the Kings have only said Hield + Bagley and Bagley is not an asset, he is a rehab project. If they were willing to give ""assets"" too then there would be talk about them as a third team.   Same with Sexton, the only reason there is talk about Cavs picks attached is because getting rid of Kevin Love would be part of the trade too.   Pacers denied the Brogdon rumor.   Wolves said they want to keep their big 3 which includes DLo and is smart since Ben Simmons already showed he can't help get a team to the ECF when he's the 3rd best player."
Kevin love.
Kobe by a mile  The other day a guy told me he was barely better than kevin love
"Moses Malone is #1 all-time in offensive rebounds, and has 2133 more offensive rebounds than Robert Parish, who is #2. 2133 offensive rebounds is more than Kevin Love has pulled down in his entire career."
"It literally wouldn’t be the first. Vince Carter did it before and that was before players had all this power.   And what exactly would the league do huh? What did they do with Kevin Love not trying again? Lol… what did they do with players claiming injury to not play? History has shown the star will get his way. Bringing up Hardens situation only adds to the history I’m talking about lmao.   Kudos for being somewhat optimistic but unless something happens that shows Ben can bite the bullet, I’ll stick with history."
"Chris Bosh. Dude has 1 All NBA nod in his entire career and got easy all star game nods for playing in the East. Don't get me wrong he's a great player, but if he plays in the West he's a 3-5x all star and in the Blake Griffin/Kevin Love tier, instead folks on here overvalue his defense, remember him as a much better shooter than he was, and put him as a top 10 PF of all time which is ridiculous. Give me Pau Gasol 10/10. Hell I'd take healthy Amar'e over Bosh."
Lol wall for Kevin Love.
"because it fundamentally makes no sense for anyone.  Houston is rebuilding and doesn't want to send out assets for another rebuilding team to take him.  And competitive teams definitely don't want Wall on his contract.  The only way I could imagine this working is trading Wall for another terrible contract like Kevin Love, but Wall wouldn't want to be in Cleveland either, and Cleveland is already overloaded with guards."
"It's not gonna come to that. The Sixers have zero leverage here. The organization itself helped tank Ben's value, so they have themselves to blame for this situation. Assuming the relationship is beyond repair like it seems to be, then he's gonna get traded. If they don't trade him before the start of the season, he'll most likely sit out games, either by his own decision or Doc's, until he does get traded. He's expressed that he's prepared to take the fine, and it'd be absolutely idiotic of Philly to keep a max contract guy on the bench. If they threaten him and he *does* play, then you better believe he's gonna put zero effort in like Kevin Love or Vince Carter. They don't want him there, and he doesn't wanna be there. This situation is not the same as an AD or Harden situation."
if they force him he'll probably play like [Kevin Love last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXaJ3bIm-gE) which is not going to help lol
"The league would have to allow teams to be able to amnesty one player every season/two if we’re keeping the contracts fully guaranteed. Then that brings up the issue where John Wall, Kevin Love, Al Horford etc. all get amnestied and join the Lakers bench on minimum deals, eliminating the parity we were trying to create in the first place.  A better plan would be allowing teams to go over the cap, but being a little bit more strict on how it’s allowed. I’d be curious to see what the potential impact would be on teams losing bird rights if they are over the luxury tax line."
"It's just the reality of the NBA and fandom. Melo is going to end up being *relatively* forgotten among the generation we have been watching since the turn of the century because of his own actions.  We'll be talking about Steph Curry and Lebron and Wade and Bosh and Kevin Love for years, Melo is going to be an afterthought."
Kevin love.
"Kyrie is real. He is a real one. Lebron is a robot. MJ is a time travel hoax. Tim Duncan is a giant plant. Kevin love is a hallucination. I feel you, kyrie is real"
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
The anti Kevin Love
OKC did this but presti shouldn’t be the standard  Kevin Love was injured for most of the games he’s missed
"Kevin Knox, would love to be wrong but it's looking like another bust of a Top 10 pick"
"It’s surprising how fast all-star players can turn into role players like Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Cousins, etc. before they even get old."
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"Like what? LeBron making Kevin love depressed? Jerry rice getting into it with Deion?   The fact is being a dick here and there doesn’t make you a bully. Especially when those guys I mentioned have also been good teammates and supportive. Doing it consistently though, that makes you a bully. Jordan and Kobe are documented assholes."
Kevin love for klay Thompson the warriors would have sucked with love since ir would diminish draymond's role
"no shit  son said gimme every penny o'dat FOH  johnathan ""kevin love"" wall"
You put 2020 Dwight Howard over 2017 Kevin Love lol  Also Shaq over Bosh? what
"Wtf is this shit post. Kyrie was drafted by the Cavs in 2011 when LeBron was on the heat.   Kevin Love was well known to be underutilized during the LeBron second Cavs stint. They mainly using him as a stretch big who could pass offensively. Kevin Love barely got to use his post game and rim finishing. He never averaged over 20ppg since he left minny.   Similar with Love, Chris Bosh sacrificed and was religated to be more of a stretch small ball center. His ppg immediately shot up after LeBron left.    Wade LeBron combo is pretty notorious for their overlapping skillsets. Both being ball dominant players and providing not much off ball offensively."
I thought for a moment that you were listing possible Kevin Love pairings
Something tells me we're still waiting on Kevin Love to change his mind about a buyout later in the season
"The 25 they are adding will be insane. There will be snubs guaranteed.  KG, TD, Kobe, Dirk, Lebron, Steph, Giannis, AI, Nash, Wade, CP3, KD, Westbrook, and Harden are imo locks. That's already 14 names.   Likely additions: Kawhi, Melo, Bosh, Pau, Jokic, and oddly enough Luka.   Borderline cases: Klay, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Tony Parker, Manu, Kyrie, AD, Dwight, Paul Pierce, Kevin Love, and more players I can't think of right now. Fucking Dominique Wilkins was not on the NBA's original top 50.   Let's just move on from the fact though that the Thunder had three of the 75 greatest NBA players ever on one team. Makes me want to kill myself  An interesting case will be D Rose. Regular season MVP all but guarantees admission to this list but injuries absolutely decimated him after winning that MVP."
"There is no point in the Cavs trying to trade for an expensive star right now, their roster is young af and not ready to compete.  They will probably attempt to dump Kevin Love either before or during the 22/23 season when he's on the last year of his deal, which will be a lot more palatable for teams to take on an expiring deal and Cavs won't have to tack on so many picks to get rid of Love"
They have a better chance of getting a decent return just trading Sexton alone than packaging him with Kevin Love who's a complete negative asset/salary filler at this point
Even if he does he'll be off the team at the deadline so we can get someone better from the buyout market \*cough Kevin Love cough\*
"if Russ doesn’t work out for the Lakers then nobody will want his 44 and 47 million, Cleveland would rather keep kevin love on his 60 million contract then having to pay millions more in luxury tax"
He told me Kevin Love wears a g string under his shorts
"And Chris bosh did literally none of that whole winning thing until he had Wade and LeBron  You don't think Dame would win some rings with LeBron and Wade?  Bosh is just several tiers worse as a player. It's like putting Kevin love on here. Just doesn't belong.   Bosh was never getting MVP votes or in 1st team all nba conversations, or in top 10 player conversations etc"
Kevin Love is kind of the same story. Chris Bosh was going down that road too but he was instrumental to introducing positionless basketball in Miami.   It's weird because these guys have high motors and pile up stats during the regular season with bad teams. But then they play on good teams and they're mediocre. I guess they just forget how to be a good teammate. Kevin Love was just so injury prone and slow.
Wait isn’t there a similar play with Kevin Love? Or have I been mistaking the goat Zizic for Love this whole time
Kevin Love and a second round pick swap in 2027
Damn Kevin Love for Ben Simmons really happening
I remember he seemed like he's getting to an All-Star level at one point. Him and Kevin Love were a nightmare to deal with in 2K.
Those Kevin Love outlet passes
"I'd say that this is a bit of an anomaly since the recent US Men's Olympic Basketball team was not the highest of caliber. Last minute roster changes, Kevin Love resigned and Stephen Curry declined to play for reasons involving Covid/rest. I know Curry wanted to play since he never has."
Kevin love having a concussion in the 2016 finals and averaging 8 ppg? 2020 ring wasnt a superteam either.
"&gt; That's why ranking players based on team success is really stupid. But I still think those 3 aforementioned greats are still significantly better than the 3 scorers  The greats are very easily better. Not even a debate for me.  &gt; There are plenty of guys I think get underrated by their lack of team success, I just don't think it's those 3, they are well suited to getting points but not to high level success.  That was my point. It's really hard to compare guys in a team sport based off winning and stats. And stats don't tell all.   You can look at guys like Adrian Dantley. He had a peak of a handful of years where he was scoring 30 average, on like mid 60s TS%. In a different era without a 3ball game.   Now I don't think he is better than KD, not close either. And it would be dumb taking any of those 4 scorers over KD. But they can rival KD in terms of raw scoring, and in some seasons have slightly better offensive numbers ( AD has a peak of 2 seasons where he is at 30ppg on 65+ TS%) . King has a few seasons of similar stats.   AD had the same reputation that Melo had of massaging the ball and being a blackhole. While KD does not, and that is while having a higher usage rate than AD, though neither as high as Melo's usage rates. Really weird and I don't know of a stat that would clarify as to why so.  &gt; A lack of team success I think leads to guys like Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash, Charles Barkley, David Robinson, Chris Paul being underrated.  This is my view and I may have been too verbose in communicating it. I just love these types of threads. Your list is actually close to who I would have picked. Steve Nash was sniffing a finals before Robert Horry did decided to take him out with a hockey check.   Other guys like Payton, Malone and Stockton (they just happened to run into the dynasty Bulls and The Dream).   I'm sad Chris Paul did not get a ring even though I am thrilled Giannis got one. I think Giannis is the best PF ever, or on pace to be. His peaks from 22 until now beats Chuck, Malone, Timmy in terms of impact and advanced rates at the same ages."
"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There they go! There our championship dreams go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of unpleasant disappointment. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got [expletive] swept now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Magic Johnson hugged him and said, “Everybody get up, it's time to slam now.”"
"To me, the Cavs were a superteam because the expectation was that Kevin Love would be a star and that he would turn them into a superteam. That’s why they traded a highly touted #1 pick for him. The intention was there to form a superteam. Intentions and expectations are what I think should be weighed into account when talking about superteam a. Same reason why homegrown teams aren’t considered superteams usually, they’re never intended to be superteams and are never expected to be superteams until they become insane."
lmao no they werent the Heat took the Lakers 6 with injuries and Lebron had AD who played like a top 5 player on that run. Meanwhile the 2015 and 2018 Cavs 2nd best player was Delly and a washed Kevin Love
"That’s not how things stand. That’s how you evaluate players. So if it’s unfair why not reassess how you do that 😂  And prime Kevin love was a top 10 player in the league, an all nba player, and objectively the opposite of an empty stats guy given his impact"
It is crazy to think that we threw $120 mil at Kevin Love but won't give Sexton the max.  Sexton's improved every year in the league.
"they weren’t a superteam, kevin love isn’t and/or wasn’t good enough to give them that title"
"I think they were a superteam, but the arguments needs to be consistent when talking about Kevin Love specifically instead of just using him to underrate/overrate Lebron."
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Not saying LeBron didn't desire new challenges but tbh with LeBron it always seemed like once a franchise was no longer useful to him in terms of being a contender and winning titles he jumped ship. Left the Cavs the first time because they couldn't attract top flight free agents or make enough moves to put them over the top so he went to Miami. In 2014 after the Spurs drubbed the Heat in the Finals LeBron saw the writing on the wall with Wade's star fading due to injuries and their cap situation not getting better. So now that the Cavs have Kyrie and the number one pick in Andrew Wiggins (who they traded to get Kevin Love) he goes back to Cleveland and delivers a legendary title. By 2018 with Kyrie gone and once again the cap situation blowing up he goes to LA where they have a plethora of young tradeable talent (which he got AD with) and a situation where he will never have trouble attracting free agents or convincing players to join the most popular NBA franchise ever in one of the most desirable locations to play in.   For Shaq it was definitely about proving critics wrong. He went to LA because the Magic lowballed him and the people of Orlando said he didn't deserve all that money. He wanted a trade out of LA because they chose Kobe over him. Then it felt like he also hopped onto potential title contenders like the Suns, Cavs, and Celtics to end his career."
"I duno, would you rather pay prime MJ a vet min or pay Kevin Love 30 million"
Kevin love vs. Chris bosh as lebrons 3rd fiddle
"I took Pau gasol's middle year on the Lakers. which was 2010-2011 season, where Kevin Love was on his third year doing 20/15.   If we went back to 2009-2010, I could easily add 2-4 more players onto this list, like Brandon Roy.  And even if it is the case that you took those 3 off, you're still left with 20 players.   lol. you just put him at #20"
"Pau definitely better than a sophomore Kevin Love, a not drafted until 2010 John Wall, and a Blake Griffin who was injured his rookie season lmao"
"Lebron James,  Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
"Such a shame. If Kyrie does intend to retire if being traded, then they might as well trade him for John Wall or Kevin Love. The Cavs and Rockets are the only teams who are looking to get these players off their books but won’t buy them out."
No they were trying to trade Kevin love for Paul George
Adding kevin love makes it less enticing for the 76ers
...And Kevin Love
They traded OJ Mayo (3rd pick) for Kevin Love (5th) right after the draft on the same day so they did end up getting that draft right at least.
"Shaq is pretty much plug and play, he went from playing with Penny to Kobe to Wade with much success. It is well documented Chris Bosh and Kevin Love have had to dramatically change their game once they had to play with Lebron. Even KD noted this on why players turn down the chance to join Lebron in free agency."
"Full court is rarely ever full court when it's described  There's only a handful of guys that can actually do full court passes consistently that I've seen  Kevin Love, LeBron, Jokic probably but I haven't seen it"
Jrue completely wrecking Kevin Love was probably my favorite thing he did the last year he played for us. It was a Masterclass in Disrespect.
"&gt;Yeah, I think reasonably, since I saw the Bucks’ playoff offense that year.  You mean the offense that won them a league leading number of games, that we turned on its head? That's some selective rationale right there.  &gt;I don’t give Lebron a ton a credit for sweeping the 59-win Derozan Raps or beating the 60-win Hawks either.  You shouldn't lmao. Neither that Raps team nor that Hawks team were as good as that Bucks team. Not to mention our years with excellent regular season win totals were on the backs of an incredibly weak Atlantic division. Not to mention Kyrie and prime Kevin Love are probably the best players on those Raps / Hawks teams.  I'm not saying we had the hardest path, but to exclude that Bucks team makes 0 sense."
We resigned everyone in the current generation  Harrison Barnes  Buddy Heild  And Holmes   I think being able to be in California is a huge advantage even if it is Sacramento  You still get great weather and are close to everything.  Free agents sign in 4-5 markets and mostly it has to do with money and basketball not the city  Cleveland signed Lebron and Kevin Love as free agents and that city is miles below Sacramento
David Lee + Ryan Anderson offspring = Kevin Love
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"To be fair, the reason Kobe Bryant has those 12 all-defensive teams you mentioned is solely because of media members like this. Look at his actual defensive numbers, particularly his advanced defensive metrics, they're not only not good, they're awful. IIRC he isn't even in the top 500 all-time in defensive rating. He ranks 1 spot above Kevin Love(yes, Kevin Love) in defensive win shares/48."
"Credited evenly? When the Cavs went down 3-1 in 2016, there were like a million Kevin love is getting traded articles."
DAE just sit and think about Kevin Love sometimes?
"I mean sure that is like saying ‘no team has ever won a super bowl by ONLY passing’  And that is an obvious conclusion because having a one dimensional offense is in general bad.   I’m mostly saying that since Kerr has been coach, these warriors teams have made an amazing effort to consistently score inside and take the easy baskets that come when the opponent really is afraid of the three.   The warriors, esp without kd, were incredibly reliant on a 4v3 situations with Draymond  having the ball and getting to make a read off a high screen action with Steph ( the defense is so worried about a Steph 3 they usually have to either switch or double which leads to easy offense for someone else), so yes having Dray miss any game is a big deal. Having it be arguably the most pivotal game in a seven game series (game 5) then yes I think it really does matter.   Momentum is a big thing, and with those warriors having a lot of younger talent back then, having a strong mental is important.   No one expected Barnes to shit the bed like that for example, the cavs for a monster game 5 from Kyrie and then Lebron had a huge game 6 and even after all of that Steph had a chance to steal the series with a shot over Kevin Love.   Yes, I do think if they don’t give Cleveland that one extra inch for game 5 they realistically take the series in 6."
Kevin Martin should be added instead of Kevin Love. They would be way better.
"Biased but I love watching Kevin Porter Jr atm, excited to see how his season turns out!"
The Kevin Love for Klay Thompson trade that almost happened in 2014. The trade was so close that on ESPN it was breaking news that the Warriors and Timberwolves had an agreement in principle. Until the Great Jerry West stepped in and said nah. The trade fell through after
"If you're a top 5 player in the NBA, you're a threat to win a ring every year. If you're a top 10 player, you'll be able to carry your team to the playoffs most years.   Top 10 players make their team good. KAT's had some decent players around him over the years. He's an overrated numbers stuffer like Kevin Love was."
"CP3 has demonstrated so much more than Westbrook on the Rockets, Thunder, and the Suns. Zion is his 2nd year and hasn't had the privilege of playing with KEVIN DURANT.  Don't get it twisted I love Westbrook and don't think he's overrated you just provided two shitty arguments"
"Kevin is definitely number one. While Kevin’s dominated the second half of NBA history (thus far), Bobs dominated the first half  PG- Bob Cousy  SF- Bob Love  PF- Bob Pettit  C-Bob McAdoo"
Kevin  KG-C McHale-PF Love-SF Durant-SG (lol) Johnson-PG
Man Kevin Love robs that much in a few months
"Is it crazy for me to think that on 2015 Lebron and healthy Kyrie could beat the Warriors but Lebron, Kyrie and Love would lose to the Warriors? I always saw the Warriors abuse Kevin Love and his lack of defense."
No contract is untradable in the NBA unless you're Kevin Love. And he's better and much younger.
how many wins can this lineup get?  pg: Kevin love  sg: Evan Mobley  sg: Jared allen  pf: Chet Holmgren  center: Victor Wembanyama.
I say trade Kevin Love for Ben Simmons
"[peak male performance](https://images.solecollector.com/complex/images/c_crop,h_468,w_677,x_73,y_32/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_1200/omkvnzeravpg3ue3vxol/kevin-love-high-school-sneakers.jpg)"
"Guys like Kevin Love, Tyler Herro, Jokic, Doncic, Porzingis. Class acts"
I was one of the guys really hoping we would get Westbrook and Kevin Love back in like 2015. Then KD left and I was excited to see Westbrook unleashed. I still defend his MVP.
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
"Bosh is the most overrated player in the last 20 years. 1 All NBA selection but he was able to rack up All Star games in a super weak East where he was competing with old Kevin Garnett, Paul Millsap, Roy Hibbert and Rashard Lewis for all star spots. If he plays in the West he probably has 2-3 all star games, no way he's making the ASG averaging 16 &amp; 6 over Dirk, Duncan, Amar'e, Boozer, Pau, Blake, Love, West, Durant, Melo, Marion etc...  No way is Bosh better than Wilkins or a top 75 player imo."
"you mean because of antivax stuff, right? Like, that's where it stops being sports hate and starts being literal human resentment. I think there are a big fraction of r/nba denizens who are sitting the vaccine thing out and have zero problem with Wiggins, Irving, Isaac, or any of those guys.  In terms of basketball, everyone thinks **Dwight Howard** is a clown at best, and an insufferable moron at worst. Does anyone stan for Dwight Howard? Kevin Love is probably up there, too."
"You could play CP3 with 3 other guards and have him guard Kevin Love, that doesn't make him a PF"
"Those late 2000s, early 2010s Rockets teams were so darn scrappy. They didn't have star power but were incredibly deep and seemed to always draft well and have good player development, and they refused to bottom out/always had a pretty decent or good record. Very Nuggets-like. I will say that I enjoyed when Kevin Love stepped on Luis Scola's face though lol. I never liked Scola."
"With the way this roster is built, I have my doubts.   You guys were playing to fast, may I interest you in a Kevin Love anchor?"
"18-64  Ben would get his feels hurt by Kidd and sit some more.  Kyrie &amp; Beal could only play 41 games.  Kuzma would shoot and talk a lot but not make so many.  Kevin Love would old.  Joe Harris would be fine for 5-15 mins a game but after that the effects of the post game beer would wind him.  Porzingis would be hurt 1/2 to 3/4 the season if not the entire season.  So you're down to Schroder, Isaac, Gobert, Drummond, Herro and that's kinda okay except fatigue would lead to naggy injuries at best, so on a long rest or against teams ""load managing"" you'd have a chance, but otherwise you're just fully fucked."
"With zero medical expertise, I think he might not want to get skinny like Kevin Love. Then again, maybe it's different when you can jump out of the gym."
Why is it a hot take? Cuz Lillard has never made a clutch shot like Curry did on Kevin Love in 2016 game 7
"Cavs have drafted 8, 8, 5 and 3 over the last four seasons and gotten Sexton, Garland, Okoro and Mobley out of it. Arguably, we have done better with this not-great draft capital than when we had three \#1 picks in four years. We also got Jarrett Allen for what will essentially be a second-round pick (Milwaukee's first-rounder next year). Beilein was a ""who cares?"" mistake that was *quickly* corrected, and Koby hasn't pissed away any assets to get rid of Kevin Love when there's no reason at all to do it.  I don't know what else people expect of a GM in this kind of situation. I also think he's done a fantastic job, but I would expect onlookers to at least think he's done *OK* and is not worthy of being fired and replaced with ... whom? And what is that whom supposed to do differently other than draft as well as you can and not make pointless short-term trades?"
"Sorry, what I meant was accepting the offer, as it's the best financial decision right now...and then leaving in free agency or asking out down the road.   Players remember these types of slights and it wouldn't be unprecedented. A similar situation caused Gordon Hayward to leave Utah, and Kevin Love was upset that the Wolves wouldn't max him."
"The Lebron experience was what drove Kyrie nuts, just like how he gave Kevin Love depression /s"
"It doesn't help being a ""shit tier franchise"" when you have batum the bum making superstar money and just deciding be didn't wanna play a lot of the time. Dude was basically on the Kevin love tier in Charlotte. How many do you think the raptors would've won if instead of kawhi you got superstar money batum?"
"Casey also got canned that summer and it really felt like his limits to coach that group got exposed for the last time (repeated Kevin love post ups on mismatches). So more uncertainty in if a coaching change was to be made, who would it be, and if anyone could turn it around."
Kevin Love is in the video for like half a second and people commenting how he doesn't seem happy to be there based on that
"What time zone are you in? I'm in EST  Roughly how often do you browse r/nba? At a bare minimum 5-10 times a day. Since i work remotely as a product manager, probably around 15-20 times a day.  How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team?  I would say heavily in the past 3-4 years. I think I’d be a good addition to the mod team because I have a great grasp of the culture of the community- from the timing of jokes to the trends in how the community is feeling, i think r/nba is one of the rarest subs out there that has such a great community sense, and is oftentimes more informative than National media like ESPN or FOX.  Moreover, the reason my karma is 7.0K is actually mainly just from one post I made in the r/sports sub about Dwight Howard not believing in protection 😂 (check it out), so I’d like to think i have a solid grasp on what can go viral/gain traction and understand trends of what makes a good comment in the community.  Is there anything you'd like to change about the subreddit?  I think having better setup with sponsorships or AMAs. I remember the Anthony davis thread was sudden and seemed ill prepared, which felt like such a missed opportunity when i saw it. I’d love to work with reps to help spearhead the whole engagement/partnerships side of the thread and engage with people who love the thread as much as i do (ie Simu Liu, who apparently reads r/nba everyday)  What is your favorite NBA memory?  Watching the Celtics win the 08 final. I remember being allowed to stay up past my bedtime and seeing Kobe and the Lakers lose, and Kevin Garnett tearing his Jersey and just screaming, and then actually going to the duck boats parade in person to see rondo just snag a ball and sign it so effortlessly. That was what got me to love watching basketball.  Do you have any particular skill set that could benefit our subreddit mod team (coding, graphic design, etc.)?  I’m a product manager at a large tech company so I think I could help with strategy/prioritization in any way, technical or non technical. I also have an engineering degree, so can code.  Are you familiar with python/PRAW?  I've used Python in undergraduate for about 5 years now. Ive done research in machine learning, and even have applied for a masters in computer science at Georgia Tech. Are you interested in helping mod the sub in discord?   Yes, but am more frequent on Reddit. If I were to mod the discord, I’d expect a time split of about 70:30 - 80:20 tbh."
"They might not want Kevin Love but lowkey, might not be a bad pick up for them. He can space the floor giving Embiid room to operate freely in the paint, knock down 3s, gives them another solid rebounders, good passer. Can spend some minutes at the 5 if need be. Defense and movement will be a problem. But I think he could be a asset and Sexton gives them a starting point guard."
"He didn't say that though? He said that Net Rating specifically doesn't tell anything about Simmons individual play.  Take Embiid off the floor and its obvious that the Sixers will be worse, he is one of the best players in the game, but for Simmons individually he scores more while being more efficient and having no drop in his assists numbers.  They don't fit, Embiid needs a point guard that can shoot and distribute (a Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley type) while Simmons needs a stretch 5 that will give him space to work in the paint (a Kevin Love or Vucevic)."
"lol I love Valentine's reaction to the ""Denzel Washington"" quip. Cleveland looks like they have a lot of fun guys there...and Kevin Love"
Pekovic without injuries is a decent what-if. He was a powerful player and seemed like a good 5 next to Kevin Love.
"Nah LeBron is one person I always thought was either a legit 6ft8 guy or even 6ft9, there is that time he had a minor scuffle with KD in the finals I think were he stood face to face with him and he did not look shorter at all. He also is literally the same height as Kevin Love, in his scuffle with Enes Kanter, Kanter does not tower over him"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
Cavs should be ecstatic! This actually counts as one of the games that Kevin Love will play in this year.
"Then the Cavs weren't a super team, because Kevin Love was no better than Tobias Harris has been the last 3 years."
"&gt; Pretty sure the game in question was just after Kevin Love was announced to be out due to injury  He's talking about the last game before the trade. He only played 20 minutes, but he did indeed go 0-6 from 3 vs Minnesota"
Most surprising part of this video is they’re still having Kevin Love take new media day shots
Kevin Love was not good and literally nobody could handle the ball at even an average level other than Lebron. Without Lebron they would have been worse than the current Cavs.
"lmao ""Smile Kev!""  *shot of Kevin Love with the fakest smile you've ever seen, grinding his teeth thinking of home and his paycheck*"
You’re right but it’s a full team of solid role players and Kevin Love when he actually gave a fuck. Far worse teams have made it to the finals.
Pretty sure the game in question was just after Kevin Love was announced to be out due to injury. Him getting the more meaningful minutes was them making a point that they saw him as an asset to the team.   He wouldn't get traded until February of next year to LA.
"This could compete with ""LeBron James gave Kevin Love depression"" as the dumbest shit I read on r/nba"
Kevin love and porzingis aren't alike at all it's not even a good comparison. The only thing they do similarly is shoot 3s when someone passes to them on the perimeter. They don't even play the same position. Please stop.
If as a center you want to pull up from 3 then you need to expect to be treated as a guard/wing. KAT isn't open like Porzingis. Kevin Love is similar to Porzingis when on the Cavs he made 48% of 3s that were wide open Lebron's final year.
Kevin Wayne Durant love his game so smooth and fluid.. top 5 all time to me
"Not even Jordan could do what LeBron did  Not a knock on Jordan, but LeBron is literally the best player to carry teams in history so i just don't see anyone else doing what he did. Having to carry so much of the scoring *and* playmaking when your best help is Kevin Love shooting like 40% from the field is not exactly easy"
I was going to argue Kevin Love but I think his contract technically isn't a max
"My favourite part about this is people shit on Jerry Colangelo for the while Kevin Love thing, but give a pass to the 76ers for what they did.  They're both basically cases of ""you're not wrong, but maybe you shouldn't be saying this out loud""..."
&gt;made Silas almost have a mental breakdown  Getting some strong _LeBron gave Kevin Love depression_ vibes right here
How? LeBron had Kevin Love who was a legit all-star level player at the time. Tim Duncan in 2003 didn't even have anyone on the ballot and beat the Shaq/Kobe 3-peat Lakers...
Yeah. Kevin Love and Ray Allen couldn't read the scoreboard either.   Ray Allen sure as hell didn't know what the score was when he made that 3 for the tie that saved the Heat!
Correct. Wiggins traded for Kevin Love before the start of the season.
Tacko Fall  Lauri Markkanen  Kevin Love  Evan Mobley  Jarret Allen
"I'm a huge fan of the podcast and to me its a top 5 basketball podcast and probably the most immersive experience you can get for day to day high level basketball updates.  To enjoy it however you simply put have to like all components of basketball - analytics, front office news, cap mechanics, player evaluation and then ALSO the actual game of basketball.  This is not meant to be a pretentious statement - I love the game of football, but all that other shit I could care less about in that context.  There are better color commentators for the sport but Danny, while clearly not a traditional media personality, does A LOT of research in the same vein as Kevin O'Connor and Nate Duncan is pretty well established in getting resources for the pod.  The best podcast and content in my mind still comes from Thinking Basketball.  Everything Ben Taylor produces is gold and his work has siffused the entire basketball world indirectly and his name is mentioned on more popular pods periodically with respect.  Definitely check him out."
&gt;  the 2nd best TWolf of all time  KG  KAT  Kevin Love  Guess we throwing hands...
Kevin Love?
"- Ben Simmons is basically unplayable in the playoffs and thus is essentially worthless.  - Duncan &gt; Kobe. Advanced stats are not kind to Kobe, ‘03 carry job, fundamentals, volume scoring overrated, etc.  - “Moses Malone is the most disrespected old player.”  - Your personal all-time list: MJ basically has to be #1, LeBron and KAJ 2 and 3 in any order (you can also claim that it’s KAJ at 1 and MJ at 2, some real old head shit, but LeBron cannot be ahead of MJ). Have Bill Russel, Hakeem, and Duncan pretty high. Underrate Kobe, Wilt, and Steph/KD. Throw a random old all timer like Oscar Robertson ahead of newer players. Be highly opinionated on Magic vs Bird, even if your opinion is that they’re basically even.  - Talk about various styles of PnR defense. You don’t have to learn what each one is, just learn the names (Hedge, Ice, “Switch everything,” etc.)  and throw them out there at random, whoever you’re trying to impress probably won’t know any better.  - “You would know X if you actually hooped.”   - The winning coach “made adjustments.” The losing coach didn’t.  - Any contested shot that goes in: “Good D, better O,” or “that’s still a bad shot.”  - Any halfway decent pass: “Great court vision/BBIQ.”  - Winning team has “good spacing.” Losing team does not.  - Guy gets an open look: “He’s so good at moving off-ball, underrated skill.”  - Commentators you like: Mike Breen, Kevin Harlan, Ian Eagle. “Gus Johnson is the NCAA goat tho.” - Commentators you hate: Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Dick Vitale (college only!) basically everyone else. “Marv Albert is one of the greats but he’s literally senile.” - Also have a strong opinion about JVG. You can love or hate him but you can’t not care.  - Analysts you like: Zach Lowe, the Inside crew (but you mostly just think they’re funny). - Analysts you hate: Skip Bayless, Stephen A Smith, any overly dramatic ESPN type person.  - Like JVG, you have a strong opinion on Bill Simmons in whatever direction.  - NCAA specific stuff: complain about conference changes/blame them on football. You hate some combination of Duke, UNC, Kentucky, and KU. Complain about one and dones. “I can’t believe these guys will finally be able to get paid!” Virginia lost to a 16 seed."
* Bulls are frauds and miss the playoffs * Raptors get back in the playoffs and takes the Knicks spot * Indiana and Charlotte also make the playoffs * Ben Simmons gets traded for a garbage package * Nets end up getting John Wall and Kevin Love when they get bought out * Kawhi returns by the playoffs
"I'm far from an NBA historian but I'd wager the '15-'16 Cavs simply because there isn't much depth relative to other championship teams imo.  I'm not sure if I'd bet on that team getting to the 2nd round without LBJ.  PG - Kyrie Irving, Dellavedova, Mo Williams  SG - J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Dahntay Jones  SF - LeBron James, Richard Jefferson, Jordan McRae  PF - Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, James Jones  C - Timofey Mozgov, Channing Frye"
"Given the mental challenges that they both face, will Ben Simmons have more successful career than Kevin Love?"
"When I read that Simmons didn't care about losing 33 Million. I already knew it was a serious case. And had everything to do with mental health. Suffered a burn out myself. No amount of money in the world could send me back to the work environment that caused me to experience that burn out.  Tbh I'm very proud of Ben. Don't care what the Media says. This is still a kid. He's only like what 24?  That's why guys like Ben, Michael Porter Junior and Kevin Love experienced serious mental health issues.  The pressure is unimaginable. Not always does money come first. Especially if you're already a millionaire."
"If we are talking about chips , you refuse to take into account level of competition . LeBron had harder competition   San Antonio Spurs with Greg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kawhi Leonard. There's 5 hall of famers right there and LeBron had to face them 3 times. The first year, he had Boobie Gibson as his second best player haha. Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant (for 2 years). LeBron had to face them 4 times. The first year he lost Kyrie and Love for the whole series. The second year, Warriors went 73-9 (all-time record) and was down 3-1 for the biggest comeback in the history of sports. Third and fourth year, that 73-9 team added Kevin Durant. One of those years, he had to face the Thunder that had Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka and then the only team he was favored to beat that he lost to, was Dallas Mavericks, who collectively outperformed the predictions by beating Portland, sweeping past champion Lakers, and beating OKC who had Durant, Westbrook, Harden."
Kevin Love - First recorded victim of being given depression by LeBron
"I never liked the ring argument.  You had players like Kevin Love, who averaged 8 points per game in the Finals, but getting a ring had little impact on his life.   Then there are those like Gary Payton, who won at the end of his career but had a fantastic career even if he didn't.  Rings only matter with reasonable context."
"Welcome to the NBA. There are a few historical basics:   1)Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Many people including myself believe that Lebron James can catch him but it'll require a few more accolades.   2) Some of the greatest NBA teams of all time are the 60's Celtics, 80's Lakers, 90's Bulls, 99-03 Lakers, and mid2010's Warriors.   3) There have been more and more rules introduced to make it harder to play defense because flashy offense is what crowds love and brings the big $$$ to the league.   4) Lakers-Celtics is one of the biggest and most competitive sports rivalries of all time.      Now some points that are relevant to this season and more recent times:   5) The Warriors team mentioned above was so good largely due to having two of the best three point shooters of all time. They helped influence the league to dramatically increase its rate of three point shooting.   6) The Lakers and Nets are the championship favorites this year.   7) Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Luka Doncic are currently regarded as some of the best players in the league.   8) Enjoy the NBA! During the season there are games every night so there's always some NBA action to watch. It's a beautiful sport. I hope that the Lakers become your favorite team."
"My only thing is don't be selective. Kevin Love has a ring. Everybody remembers him winning it, but he doesn't get credit for it in the same way a player who hasn't won gets discredited."
“Lebron gave Kevin love depression” energy
r/nba did diagnose Kevin Love with depression
"He sprained his MCL. His lateral mobility was clearly substantially lowered. Evidenced by his inability to blow by Kevin love on numerous occasions. Bogut barely played except his replacement was ezeli who was a massive negative on both sides of the floor. Iggy hurt his back like bogut I believe though he played through it. Though I could be mixing up my years. Bogut was starting centre for the entire season. He didn't play huge minutes but was a big positive. And Iggy was obviously a massively impactful, so him not being 100% obviously hurt. Although it alone obviously didn't cause the losses.   And a weaker cavs team? The cavs team was better in 2016. It was actually good defensively that year. In 2017 and 18. They were bad defensively."
CLE fan - Kevin Love is pretty good at the 'jump into a fly by defender on the 3pt shot' move.
&gt;  if Paul George played with LeBron for a decade  No one in NBA history has had better teammates than lebron and he's still only 4-6 in the finals  HALL-OF-FAME TEAMMATES  LeBron:  * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Russell Westbrook * Carmelo Anthony * Derrick Rose * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal  Jordan:  * Pippen * Rodman * Kukoc * Parish
"Scotty Pipen and Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant vs  Dewayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and AD"
"Not disagreeing with you, but that also has Giannis below Kevin Love."
I still wish he would've finished that dunk on Kevin Love. that shit was gonna be GLORIOUS
"Dude almost jumped over Kevin love, if anyone gonna do it it’s ja."
"Are you really trying to compare Rose and Russ? That’s laughable in and of itself in terms of where Rose was at in his career at that point, and where Russ is currently at. But to even try to compare AD to the 2018 version of Kevin Love is just downright blasphemous and where I realized that you weren’t someone worth actually engaging in conversation with pertaining basketball."
D rose.  And ad playing very kevin love esque since last season lol.
"Except we have Anthony Davis. I know people are down on him currently, but he's a superstar, an ideal fit next to Lebron, and proven in the playoffs. Obviously there are injury concerns, but you can't just straight up ignore him. The second best player on that Cavs team was, who, a washed Kevin Love? George Hill?"
He talks a lot a shit for the third best guy on those warrior teams. Chris Bosh and Kevin Love werent like that.
"Kevin Garnett for sure. The guy was arguably the greatest PF that ever played the game regarding raw talent, a beast on both ends just like Duncan, but with even more athletic ability, his MVP season was super impressive... but all that talent was wasted by a very pathetic organization. I think Dwight Howard could also be mentioned, even if he was able to carry Orlando to the finals once, the franchise never gave him a allstar duo to compete with the Celtics and Lakers. The Celtics were injured and Dwight took advantage, good for him, but here it comes the 2010 season and what is the answer from the Magic front office? A freaking 33 years old Vince Carter, lol that was so ridiculous, it felt like a bad joke. I love Vince as a entertainer, but at that stage of his career, he was not a allstar duo material, not at all"
"The Cavs are getting a little frisky. Daresay... spooky?  Mobley ROTY  Rubio MIP  Even though the shots aren't going in yet, I've liked the game over game improvement we're seeing from Markkanen. The effort is there, he's playing hard and not losing his confidence.  Minor sub-plot for the Cavs this year: is Kevin Love finally buying in to being the vet/mentor we've wanted him to be the last 3 years? Early returns are positive!"
Kevin Love adjusting to a new role playing fewer minutes… last year played no minutes first half of the season
"He wasn’t even the best big on the Pelicans when he was playing with Cousins. I’m absolutely baffled at the amount of respect AD gets, he’s basically early career Kevin Love (good but no way an all-timer)"
"Lmao the difference isn't THAT big  3 games out of 7 is huge, that's like the difference between prime MJ and current Kevin Love or something"
"Is Kevin Love more engaged than usual, or did I only see lowlights last season?"
Does Kevin love have grey hair now?
Kevin Love.
because kevin love had actual depression for years and it's pretty obvious ben just doesn't want to play for the sixers
Kevin McHale would like a word. Love might be fourth
they all think AD was carried during the championship run  lebron wouldn't won it without davis.  AD was the best defender and the leading scorer of that team and every one acts like he played like kevin love.
"I love how you have all these excuses for the Warriors. What about All Star Kevin Love getting concussed, missing a game, then playing injured? He averaged 8 points on 36% shooting for the series as a result. Oh, but Andrew Bogut and his 15 minutes per game was the real difference maker.    And Curry was looking pretty damn good in the WCF when he averaged 28 ppg on 61% TS in the WCF. Hell, he even had 38 in game 4 of the Finals to go up 3-1. I’m baffled that anyone could act like he wasn’t capable.   Golden State had 3 straight chances to close shop and they simply couldn’t muster up a win, due in large part to Bron leading both teams in every counting stat, Kyrie popping off, and role players stepping up. You’re a certified clown if you don’t think the Cavs deserved that win"
Why is it when Kevin love has mental health issues people call him a hero for coming out but when Ben Simmons says he has mental health issues people call him a whiney bitch?  This sub loves to play both sides of this kind of shit.
Imagine being Kevin Love and only being the 3rd best power forward named Kevin associated with the Timberwolves
"KG stands well over them, but Kevin Love and KAT are just further proof that team fails it’s stars."
"Idk about making them look better. He’s had all star teams before and a lot of players end up looking worse. Younger players players have been helped but you look at Kevin Love and Chris Bosh and having to change their styles definitely made them look worse. And like I said his teams have almost always had plenty of former all stars and quality, experienced role players. Way more than most teams in recent history"
"He’s never never had a ball-dominant, horrendous shooting PG as his third guy. Kevin love and Bosh both not only accepted the 3rd role, but also had games that allowed them to take that role"
"Bring honest I have no clue. Like others said, most people act like kareem  never existed lol. Then others said the 2016 ring. I find it pretty funny. Lebron was projected to beat them  if Kevin love and kyrie weren't hurt.    It's a toss up to basketball fans until he passes him in scoring. Which if kateem didn't have to play college who knows how the scoring record would be"
"KG Kevin Love and KAT have all been failed by the Wolves, they are hands down the worst run franchise in the last 30 years. If the Mavs don’t make some changes stat they will be wasting the talents of one of the greatest talents the league has ever seen. How the fuck do you have Luka and surround him with KP and THJ, and now strapping the dead weight that is Kidd as his coach, it’s just sad"
And even Kevin Love before KAT
Man it bothers me Love got so bad over the years and he should be in his prime. Yes I know injuries and mental health thing are a big deal but he is just a memory of a player he used to be. I miss young overweight 25/15 Kevin Love

It’s so funny how everybody was all aboard with Kevin Love and supporting the mental health of players… and then proceeded to absolutely murder Ben Simmons for months on end
"Barnes is expiring, Hield is someone they want to get rid of and Kevin Love though trash would be a good piece for them, they'd also get Cedi Osman otherwise the trade wouldn't work who is a decent piece and can atleast be an ok defender and that 2028 LaL pick could be worth something at some time"
"Lakers receive; Barnes and Hield, Kings receive: Kevin Love, Cedi Osman 2028 unp LaL, Cavs receive Russel Westbrook"
"Lakers receive; Barnes and Hield, Kings receive: Kevin Love, 2028 unp LaL, Cavs receive Russel Westbrook"
Not much. He's still incredible. Compared to 2018 Kevin Love it's a massive upgrade.
"I love Klay and despise PG13, but you're out of your mind. ""One of the 2 main reasons"" is a cheesy way of saying the 2nd best player. Even then, before KD, the Warriors only won 1 chip against a Cavs team with no Kevin Love or Kyrie.   Plus Klay has barely played in literal years. I'm sure him not playing recently has hurt his chances of being on the list."
Kyrie less Cavs are still worse and you had that whole lebron gave depression to Kevin love debacle
Back in my day we debated if Aldridge or Griffin was the best PF in the NBA. Of course you had some lunatics suggesting it was Kevin Love
Kevin Love stinks
"Definitely horrible in terms of actual play on the contact, but the reason it isn’t mentioned much is that it’s not really ruining the cavs franchise. The Cavs aren’t getting any free agents anyways to pay, or actually trying to contend, and their players are young and only just now are some getting extensions so Kevin love isn’t really detrimental to their cap space plans just yet."
"I can't help but wonder how much of this ""first option"" stuff is just situational though. Klay has never had the chance to be a first option because he's always been on Steph's team. Is that a legit knock against him? I feel like that kind of criticism is what makes some players feel like they need to go be ""the man"" somewhere. Like just being a great team player doesn't really do it for a lot of fans, so they feel like they need to go prove they can be the best player on a team somewhere.   Ray Allen was the number one option for a bunch of years, but it's not like those were championship winning teams. If Klay had been traded for Kevin Love way back, could he have led the Wolves to the playoffs as the team's best player? Maybe. I can't say for sure that he couldn't have done that.   Some players are best suited to be the second best player on a team rather than the best. Some players are best suited to be that number one option, but that doesn't automatically mean that team will be great with them in that role. There's a lot of guys who are alphas on teams that don't win. Should we give them more credit than the second best players on teams that *do* win?   To wit, are guys like Allen Iverson or Carmelo Anthony better than someone like Scottie Pippen or Anthony Davis just because the former guys were best suited as #1 options and the second group were best suited as #2 guys? Or to bring it back to Ray Allen, was he better as the #1 option or when he was the #2, #3 or even #4 option?   Some guys get drafted into situations where they don't have the chance to be the team's best player just because there's already someone there who's better. Is that a knock against them? Should someone like Klay have demanded a trade to go be the #1 option on some other team? Is his legacy being penalized for not having done so?"
"There aren't that many super teams, but to answer the question:  * The Lakers traded all their young players for Anthony Davis and then got vets willing to take a pay cut * The Nets got one partly in free agency (though those partly involved sign &amp; trades) and then traded the rest of their young players for Harden and then go vets willing to take a pay cut * Milwaukee drafted Kris and Giannis and then traded most of their depth for Jrue * The Heat did a sign &amp; trade for Butler, a sign &amp; trade for Lowry and drafted Bam.  * The Sixers drafted Embiid and Simmons, and signed Horford before the extensions kicked in, and then traded everything they had for Harris and Butler. Harris and Embiid are all that's left there.  * The Warriors got KD because of once in a generation surplus of cap scape due to CBA rulels * The Rockets traded for Chris Paul * The 2nd Lebron James Cavaliers drafted Kyrie, signed Lebron into space, and traded for Kevin Love.   Basically, unless you trim your roster down to the bone, it's very hard to enough space to sign two full max contracts. Typically what you have to do is sign one, and then trade for the other one."
You might be right.  I feel like there was a short period at the end of Pau's prime after those guys had slightly declined when we all agreed that Pau was #1 at the position.  But he started declining soon after that and Blake Griffin and Kevin Love were probably the best
"Lets just say Kevin Love in 2016 not today, would you take him on 30m+ per year for 4 years? He's not as good a defender, but he's at least a good rebounder and 3 point shooter (and still isn't bad even today)"
"You're moving the goalposts though. You asked if we would take current Kevin love at age 33 for free as an attempt to make a direct comparison to Ben Simmons at 25. Not only is that ridiculous, but additionally big men  peak earlier than point guards as a whole and Kevin Love never came close to having the potential upside Simmons has, or the defensive ability Simmons has. Your new point isn't particularly strong either but I'd prefer if you spoke to the original point rather than moving the posts like you did.   Let's take your new argument at face value though. Love's stats peaked around 25 but then he was moved to Cleveland and took on a very different role so his stats suffered. Arguably he was as good of a player at age 28 on Cleveland as he was at 25 on Minnesota but of course the stats are lower because he was with LeBron and Kyrie. So if we compare this to Simmons he should have at the very least a couple more years of improvement even if he wasn't a point guard, but adding that factor on you can expect 3-5 years of improvement or atleast that many years of current ability plateau.   Kevin Love is now 5 years beyond his final arguable peak and has a big contract with two more years on it. He's never been as athletic as Simmons or as much of a defensive stopper and his athleticism and physical ability have only drastically deteriorated over time. Regardless of mental health issues it's normal for a big man at age 33 to not be nearly as good as they were at 25-28. Love is only making 3 mil a year less than Simmons so frankly I don't think these things are comparable at all given their ages, ability, potential and athleticism."
What age did Love peak at? What age is Simmons? Was Love's peak better than Simmons has been so far? Why has Kevin Love been worse since then - is it due to mental health issues? Is it in Ben's interests to be considered a possible mental health risk when teams are considering if they want him or not?
Come on man you can't compare current Kevin Love and his contract to Ben Simmons. There is a massive gap there currently in ability and his youth and trajectory make that idea even more laughable. You could have said John Wall to make a slightly better point but even that wouldn't really work because of his injury history and age as well.
Dude Kevin love came out about his mental health issues and everyone praised him for it. I’m sick of hearing this whole idea that society isn’t willing to listen anymore
Kevin Love is the softest big in the league
"But if you connect the dots it’s not hard to see why he could have anxiety/depression or any other mental health problem. His team wanted him gone, his city he lives in is shitting on him like its a religion, he had that thing with his half brother and sister, he underperformed in the playoffs, he’s getting slandered left and right.  I dunno about you but those seem like ingredients to someone being miserable.  This sub claims to be all for mental Heath when demar or Kevin love speaks out but when Ben mentions it its “stop being soft”. Kind of odd."
Klay is a great defender though. Not just on perimeter but even against bigs like Kevin Love. I may still go with Miller based on the longevity of his career but Klay can close the gap if he can stay healthy.
Kevin Love admitted to his mental health issues and never pulled shit like this.
"Kevin Love scored 34 points in a quarter playing with Kyrie and Bron but could not do much winning being ""The Guy"". Klay obviously is a talent beyond system but that does not change the fact of his role being significantly easier than guys who have to carry a heavier load. I do not think this is a snub at all"
&gt;  so the team he gets traded to doesn't have to gut itself  at the very least they'll have to pay his massive contract though. If Ben looks like absolute shit on the court there might not be teams that want to take on that contract even if they're giving up nothing.  Would you take Kevin Love right now on a two year max deal for nothing?
Kevin Love had a legit panic attack during a game. I don't think anything we know of the Ben Simmons situation compares to that. Being anxious because your fans will boo you for passing up a dunk isnt inherently mental illness or disability.
"Lebron James gave Kevin love depression , lebron James and his toxic atmosphere . But the whole city from news caster , to little kids have been shouting at this man , and he is faking it ."
"I already saw Tobias say he'd welcome him back, that's Tobias for you :)  Don't get me wrong - I absolutely think he deserves to get help if he needs it. I just am wary of him, and Klutch, potentially digging deeper into the bag for this knife fight with Morey. But if he needs help, I hope he gets it. Kevin Love is a fantastic NBA example of a great player who had it all bottled up for years and finally came out with his struggles, which really helps highlight how anyone can be affected."
"He was a fringe all-star who got all-nba (1st) during his 2nd year in the NBA. He’s only on this list for being on a Knicks team that won the finals.  It’s comparable with Kevin Love. Love has 1 more all-star, his 2 all-nba teams are for 2nd team, and he played in 3 straight finals (team went to 4).  Monroe got the benefit of playing with Frazier and Reed."
"&gt; it would be an extremely scummy thing to take advantage of this loophole while NOT suffering from mental illness  I mean, is Simmons not suffering? He's got a solid argument that he's experiencing extreme anxiety at the thought of playing in front of Philly fans again.  Simmons has as good of an argument as Kevin Love does."
Kevin Love has no physical ailments and is getting paid not to play.
"Big time pro athletes are people just like everyone else.  You don't get some sort of immunity from it, and shit happens that can break the strongest of folks.  He could be lying,  but the city he is supposed to play for also hates him.  Hell, Kevin Love was very open about his mental health struggles in cleveland, faced far less scrutiny, and helped them win a championship."
"Yeah if he pulls a Kevin Love and starts acting like a complete asshole after citing his mental health as an issue then I have no sympathy. If you know you have a problem take care of it, people won’t care if you have anxiety problems they’ll just think you’re a douchebag if you act like one."
Look how this sub treats Kevin love and that will tell you how much it cares about mental health.
Every day I think of Ben Simmons a little bit more like Kevin Love
"Real talk? I'd believe it if he sat down, and did an interview like Hayden Hurst for the Atlanta Falcons. It was an amazing, deep dive into issues he'd had for years. Alternatively, an op ed like Kevin Love would work as well.  Is it possible given the shitshow last year in Philly? Sure.  Do i currently believe it? Hell no."
"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."
"This list is about the best PLAYERS. We rank them off of individual success, not team success. Tony Parker being on that incredibly well-run spurs team does not mean he is better than AD, who has been on awful awful teams until he got traded.   &gt;his resume looks like Kevin Love’s   Bro stop it. K-Love never made an All-NBA 1st team, and has 3 less all star appearances. He also has never even made All-defense."
"Parker ran those championship teams to multiple titles. AD coasted in NoLa.  I think AD's best years are ahead of him and he was safe to snub because he can make it onto the NEXT LIST. Parker and Dwight cannot.  I don't think you can tell the 'full story' of that Spurs era without Parker, whereas AD doesn't need to be mentioned until the COVID season title.     So far his resume looks like Kevin Love's, ok? Kevin Love: 5 time All Star, won with Lebron."
Kevin Love isn't rebounding as much nowdays. Markannen definitely not rebounding lick. And Mobley's a rookie. This height conversation needs context.
"C - Hakeem(a lot of people saying things like he's the greatest center ever, probably has 0 rings if Jordan didn't play baseball)  PF - Garnett(couldn't ring until he formed a superteam and still didn't collect finals MVP)  SF - Carmelo Anthony(what has he actually accomplished in his career besides chucking a lot?)  SG - Kobe Bryant (somehow has like 15 all-defensive teams but isn't in the top 500 in defensive rating and is underneath Kevin Love in defensive win shares/48, shot about 40% in NBA finals matchups and about 30% in the clutch over his career)  PG - Magic Johnson (regularly see him in top 5s, but was absolute garbage on defense and shooting the ball)"
Why though? Kevin Love of all people locked that dude down on arguably the biggest possession of his career.
I love watching games called by Kevin Harlan
Ray Allen.  Carmelo.  Jason Kidd.  Sheeeed..  Gasol brothers got traded for each other.    Porzingod. Toby and Bobi was mid season right?  Westbrook and Wall.  Kevin Love.
Blake griffin and Kevin love shoulda made it but injuries spoilt them smh
"I mean, probably, yeah.  Players are usually unanimously praised for being open about their mental health (See Kevin Love), so it'd a) give Ben some good will and b) make the Sixers look bad if they push back on him. It also c) is difficult to disprove, unlike a physical injury, so it gives Ben an excuse to be away from the team without technically sitting out."
I would take Westbrook for Kevin Love in a heartbeat
Kevin Love and Eric Gordon are both gonna be Lakers by March book it
"Bro if you could do that Kevin Love, John Wall, Westbrook (if LAL could open 44m in cap space they would do it) and any other underperforming massive contract you can think of would just get suspended for bullshit reasons. It would be fucked up but if it was allowed why not."
"Honestly, I think Simmons for Kevin Love and Collin Sexton would be great for the Sixers. Sexton/Maxey/Green/Harris/Embiid with Curry and Love off the bench."
"A regular season record. Jazz were the #1 seed and so were the 76'ers. Look what happened. People ignore the season performances until they need it for an argument lol. Not to mention, the injuries GSW had, and the ejection on Draymond helped them turn the tables. Also, just proving my point he had Kyrie Irving the #1 pick and Kevin Love on his team. Kyrie averaged 27 points, helped lock down Steph at points, scored 41 points in an elimination game 5, and made the game winning shot."
"John Wall and Kevin Love are 30+ guys with extensive injury histories their teams signed up for. I'd agree Kevin Love has been a little bitch about it too, but he's on the legacy ring contract, we all knew that would age like milk"
Kevin “Difference maker” Love has entered the chat
"The same Pippen who was garbage/average the first 4 or so years before they won their 1st chip? Unlike AD, D Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, and in some regards Kevin Love?"
I mean Kevin Durant exists my dude lol  Spoiler: I love KD
"Why are people acting like Kevin Love isn’t containing Ja at the nail in the clip? The point is to cut off his driving lanes, force him to pass, make his teammates punish them. Like it wasn’t a defensive clinic or anything but I don’t think he did anything egregious."
"Toronto when Durant went down in the finals. Bill Walton, Portland Trail Blazers, 1978 NBA Playoffs. Kyrie Irving/Kevin Love, 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers. Bill Russell, Boston Celtics, 1958. Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks, 2003 NBA Playoffs. Derrick Rose, 2012 Chicago Bulls.   Injuries happen. Bucks were still a top team in the league and have arguably been the best team in the league, record wise, the last 3 years. Cry more."
"Well if it was Luka, Jokic, Caruso, Kevin Huerter, Poku, Joe Harris, Kevin Love then the questions would be all serious and nobody would be trolling. But When AD came on here there was nothing but trolls ... hmm I wonder why that is"
"&gt;	You're really trying to argue that an achievement based on doing something the most over a period of time isn't a longevity award when that is the actual definition.  Again, somehow trying to fault LeBron for being able to stay elite for longer. No one told Jordan to retire multiple times. Jordan himself said he needed the rest to recover because he was mentally and physically exhausted. There are plenty of players who have played just as long, if not, longer than LeBron and they aren’t close to the scoring record.  &gt;	While hilariously talking about context, while you ignore that Lebron has an inherent advantage over past players who did years of college before the league because of era and modern players who are forced to do 1 year of college.   LeBron is not the only one to skip college to go to the NBA. Moses Malone went straight to the NBA from high school. The reason why other players have to go to college (prior to the 1 and done rule) is because they weren’t good enough to go straight to the nba, including Jordan.  &gt;	Your argument has no ""context"" because you completely ignored me saying that the points record has never been an argument for Kareem's goat case but somehow it's one for Lebron when Kareem has a resume in the same span of time.  What? Having the scoring record has been a big part Kareem’s goat argument along with his other accolades. For you to say his scoring record has *never* been used for him is completely disingenuous, which is probably why it was ignored.   &gt;	he was only taking 2/3 more attempts than the next highest guy  I love how you casually gloss over this lol *only* 2/3 more shots a game (closer to 3/4) as if that doesn’t play a huge part in separating scorers by ppg. For example, In 2006, LeBron averaged 31.4 ppg and didn’t win scoring title. The two guys ahead of him were iverson and Kobe. LeBron took 23 FGA/g while iverson shot 25 FGA/g and Kobe shot 27 FGA/g. 4 points separated Kobe and LeBron for scoring title, while Kobe took 4 more FGA/g. You don’t think if LeBron shot four more shots a game, not even counting the extra free throw attempts he would inevitably get, you don’t think he’d close the gap?  For his career Jordan averages 3 more shots per game than LeBron. LeBron is 3 ppg less than Jordan for his career. Shooting 3 more shots a game would make a huge difference. The record would’ve been broken earlier. The best example would be the playoffs scoring record. LeBron passed Jordan years ago. He played more games to pass Jordan, but he did it in less shots. So increasing his shots per game, he would’ve done it sooner than he did.   &gt;	If scoring titles were earned simply because people took the most shots then lebron would have more of them than guys like Kd and Curry considering he took more attempts than them in a number of years but he doesn't.  If having the scoring record was simply because of longevity, then guys like Kobe, dirk, Vince carter, Shaq, Moses Malone, Kevin Garnett etc. should be close to winning the scoring record or have the scoring record because they played more years than LeBron, but they don’t.   It goes both ways."
"You clearly don't watch basketball and only get your takes from the top comments of social media. I mean look at you, you use emojis so immature.  Caruso is not a bench warmer, he's a great role player. Y'all love to meme about him because he looks like the modern day Brian Scalabrine but that could be any farther from the truth, Lakers unironically took the L when they let Caruso go for Westbrook.  Kevin Huerter was a cold MF in Game 7. Elimination game and I did not expect him to step up. Trae wasn't the only dude doing damage, in fact if you look at Trae's shooting splits in game 7, he was kinda sus but hey keep ignoring how good the Hawks and their pieces around Trae are.  As for our Jokic at home...this dude was in Sac jail and Minny jail most of his NBA career. Was only used as a stretch big to space the floor but apparently, only the Warriors utilized him as something more. Dude can actually drive, pass and shoot given he's in a good system."
What happened to Kevin Love?
"I think people here on Reddit are having a hard time grasping why players like Sharman, Arizin, and other league pioneers are on the list. Sharman and Arizin were already in the 50 greatest list by the way. We need to look beyond the numbers for some of these players. Hell, George Mikan, for being the first NBA superstar, retired with “only” had 10K+ career points in his BAA/NBA career. Even players like Bill Walton and Wes Unseld need to be looked at carefully beyond their numbers. Bill Walton never played 50% of the possible games he could’ve played in his entire career and scored less than 10K points for his entire career. I’m already reading comments questioning Unseld’s place on the list.   They’ve all made significant contributions to their respective franchises and the league as a whole. Sharman was not only a great player for his time as part of the early years of the Celtic dynasty, but also a great coach, especially for that ‘72 Lakers team. Walton brought the Blazers their only championship, showed what a great passing big man could do, and redefined the 6th man role for the ‘86 Celtics. Unseld was one of the great defenders in the 70s, made outlet passes that inspired players like Kevin Love, and was a significant part of the Washington Bullets/Wizards best era (including winning the ‘78 title). Pitchin’ Paul was one of the first players to use the jump shot in his arsenal, won the Warriors their first title, and could’ve had better career stats if he didn’t lose two years of his prime due to the Korean War.  Part of celebrating the 75 greatest players is including the pioneers and those who you may not immediately recognize or understand their contributions to the game. I’d advise those who are unaware of these other great players to look them up and watch videos if they’re available. Hell, watch the NBA at 50 documentary. While it passes certain details of the history of the NBA, it does a good job summarizing the journey of the league all the way to 1996."
"I think Ja is still mad he couldn't finish *that* dunk over Kevin Love  Though he's sort of moved on to bigger targets, such as his obsession with trying to dunk on Rudy Gobert"
Kevin Love dude wtf are you doing  simply putting your arms out isn't defence
Is there a reason Kevin Love is on the court? Are they tanking already?
kevin love is so washed
Found Dan Gilbert's burner. Yeah next time don't pay an aging vet (Kevin love) a contract extension when he has no intention of playing for the team. We are supposed to be in a rebuild but the front office thought k love would draw people to the stadium and that him and sexton would be enough to get into the playoffs. So I think you're the one with a shit take Mr. Gilbert. Just my 2 cents from a longtime cavs fan. Do better
If LeBron gave Kevin Love depression imagine what he'd give Simmons.
"Give me Kevin Love over young Wiggins any day, especially with how that team was constructed."
I'd love to see a former player who retired only in the past few years come and be an analyst similar to what sportsnet has with Kevin Bieksa for the NHL. He has so much fun insight and analysis talking about strategy and decision making of the players. Just the other day he was talking about how he played with the Sedins and they would literally change the spin on their pass depending on who they were passing too. Stuff like that is really cool and shows you how technical and skilled these pro athletes are.
He needs Kevin Love to coach him a bit. Kevin turned shit around weight wise REAL QUICK
"This is not a new, nor should it be a particularly controversial take.  I dont think it would be unexpected for him to have anxiety issues given what we have seen over the years.  And although there was nothing particularly wrong or uncalled for in the comments by his coach and MVP-level teammate after game 7, or his GM reportedly shopping him around quite openly in the offseason, or even the boisterous responses he gets from Philly fans, it is pretty easy to see he has apparently responded negatively to each of these. Again- there is nothing wrong with the any of those things, and most players would react differently to how Ben has, but I think its almost certain that these have all been factors to his decision to request a trade and try to avoid being anywhere near the team (as much as he can).  And you would hope there also isn't a problem if Ben were to come out and say he is suffering from anxiety, similar to Kevin Love and Demar before him. But unfortunately I am not sure if people will be as forgiving towards Ben as they have been to others."
This is the same place platform that wrongly accused some innocent person of being the Boston bomber.  It’s a terrible platform.  Not even surprised they legitimately believed that Kevin Love thing.
Remember when this sub said that he gave Kevin Love depression lmfaoo
Unless it’s Kevin love right bron? If so then be very hard on yourself!
Had r/nba spent 5 months shitting nonstop on rui or Kevin love? This sub and Twitter are so quick to distrust simmons because all y’all do is talk about how awful ben simmons is lol. Now you want a pat on the back for not shitting on other people
"How do you think they got KAT to start with? They couldn't produce a team around Kevin love, they couldn't produce a team around Wiggins (more his fault), they can't produce a team around Kat (except bring in his buddy D'angelo). Maybe it's cuz I'm a Canadian raptors fan, I can see it a little clearer (or maybe it's my biased). Nobody wants to live in minnesota. I believe the front office is doing an decent job considering. Not as good as Toronto has. We've had a little help with drake upgrading our image (don't blame me, I don't like the guy, but the kids do). The proof is in those Prince inspired wolves jerseys. They're trying. But still, it's minnesota."
Kevin Love 2008-2014  Kevin Garnett 1995-2007
"I mean what else are they gonna do?   They've sucked, got lucky in the draft by getting the 1st pick, and still can't put together a top 10 seeded team:  \#1 Ant Edwards, #6 Jarret Culver, #12 Dario Saric, #5 Kris Dunn, #13 Zach LaVine, KAT #1, traded for Wiggins #1, Rubio #5, Wesley Johnson #4, Derrick Williams #2, Kevin Love #5   Out of all their lottery picks ones that have ""hit"" are Ant Edwards (likely), Lavine who they traded for Jimmy, KAT, and Love who they traded. Wiggins and Saric are also decent NBA players but they traded those guys too."
No one disbelieved Rui or Kevin Love. I mean Rui was completely MIA until a week ago wasn't he?
Love it. I’m in Brooklyn and I can see Kevin fucking Durant and James Harden still for 10 bucks. Only a little more expensive than the (very fun) Dlo years
He’s probably tied with Kevin Love
"I do believe that emotional duress and mental anguish, are real injuries. Face it.  They were real injuries when Kevin Love claimed them, they were real injuries when Simon Biles claimed them, they were real when Ben Simmons and Naomi Osaka claimed them. So, they should be real injuries now if they haunt Ayton over Sarver's illegitimate *extension*\-refusal and especially over Sarver's racism which Ayton has absorbed."
"And you do, mr insider? Tell me, what does Ben talk to his counselor about? How he built a brickhouse in the playoffs and decided he didnt like being held accountable so hed fuck around with the front office and get paid simultaneously? But then they didnt do what he wanted so he faked mental illness, that Kevin Love and Demar DeRozan have played through for going on a decade now, and claims he is unable to participate due to it... nah, thats too many red flags and conveniently timed narratives. Ben Simmons set back owners taking mental health seriously by 20 years."
We're cursed.   IDK what's going on anymore. Still have the same issues we've had since Kevin Love was traded to the Cavs.  This is our deepest and most talented roster in forever but still can't close out games or move the ball around
Even healthy I think we’re still one move away. A Kevin love Buyout type of move. A stretch 4 or someone else who can hit a shot consistently. Porzingis would be amazing but that’s a long shot (maybe even a wish on a star).
"My opinion is they don’t have enough size with Covington and Nurkic just isn’t the same after that gruesome injury.   If the Cavs will every buy out Kevin Love, I think Portland would be a great fit. He’d give them more rebounding and a scoring option with size."
Damn I love our three point shooting this game. Kevin is K’von again
"Getting 50 points in 35 minutes on 28 shots?   Blows my mind.   This season, we are really seeing what separates great talent and basketball smarts from guys who just game the system.   I'm not a Trae hater. Love the guy actually. Hope he rebounds from his slow start and looks like his former self, but you see a guy like Curry who never cops out of an open shot by trying to draw a foul, and he just keeps on playing well, while the guys who relied on the rules to score are struggle. This game is a perfect contrast between the two.   Trae still had a great game. But you see how much better the guy who has always relied on talent and hard work is playing now that the rules have change. No difference whatever for Curry.   We see the same thing with Kevin Durant, though, in his case, the other end of the spectrum is his own teammate in Harden.   We see it with guys like Paul George, who is playing every bit as well as he ever has despite rule changes.   Love to see this. It's great for the game."
Kevin Love behaved worse than Ben Simmons? How? I agree with the Kyrie comparison though.
I read this as Kevin love and was very confused
Kevin love would’ve broken it if kyrie weren’t a dumbass
"Just saying, the Cavs have two literal male models in Cedi Osman and Kevin Love, plus Ricky Rubio who’s a beautiful man, and then Jarrett Allen looks like the lead in a 70s detective movie about a murder at a disco. Honestly Mobley and Markkanen aren’t too bad either, it’s just DG and Collin kinda letting the side down there."
Anyone cheering for Kevin love at this point has to be a racist
"Also, a lot of Serbians are defending him. Which brings up a good point, is it being racist if your defending a countryman just because he is from your own country? Is it racist for an African American to cheer for Kieff? Is it racist for a white guy to cheer for say Kevin love? A Spaniard to cheer for Rubio? I don’t have a stance on the topic but it’s an interesting debate."
"I’ve been called a Lebron hater in the past but I 100% wanted Lebron to deck Kelly Olynyk after what he did to Kevin Love. I even shouted at the screen that I’d give LBJ a blowjob if it meant he’d slam Olynyk into the fucking stands. It doesn’t matter which team or player you support, hatred over dirty players come first and foremost for most nba fans"
"This isn't discrediting, it's contextualising.   Sure go ahead and account for those things. Just remember to account for the commonly thought of as top 3 all time player who played alongside magic. Those Laker teams were the equivalent of having 90% of peak Curry-KD Warriors in the 2010s eastern conference lol   Kevin Love being injured was actually a blessing for the Cavs, he always massively struggled against the warriors offensive schemes defensively and his level of offense always dropped in the playoffs. Kyries a big loss for sure but the Warriors in the finals that year won big and lost small, the Cavs would struggle to turn those large deficits into wins. The series would become a toss up imo"
&gt;steph won a ship without  Yeah without kyrie irving and kevin love on the other team  &gt;best player of that era in kereem  I completely disagree with this kareem was the best player of the 70s but NOT the 80s
"I'm happy that someone else is saying this. People act like the Cavs weren't favorites coming into the 2014 season. Kevin Love was a top 10 player at that time. The Warriors were willing to give up Klay + Barnes to get him, until Kerr and Jerry West shut that down."
"Why’s this sub all about mental health when someone like Kevin Love talks about it, but with Ben Simmons he’s an idiot."
"Using this list and your assists #s above, here's assists per game (from most):  * Anthony Davis:	2.05  * Kevin Love:	1.59  * Chris Bosh:	1.35  * Kyle Kuzma:	1.35  * Zydrunas Ilgauskas:	1.22  * Dwyane Wade:	1.15  * Drew Gooden:	1.15  * Mo Williams:	1.04  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:	0.90  * J.R. Smith:	0.89  * Kyrie Irving:	0.84  * Anderson Varejao:	0.71  * Mario Chalmers:	0.64  * Daniel Gibson: 0.62  * Tristan Thompson: 0.55  * Eric Snow: 0.45  * Sasha Pavlovic: 0.38"
"His FGA are down right now but I don't think that's particularly indicative of where they were going to end up. I think he would be getting more attempts if he wasn't struggling so much. I mean does anyone really think Lauri should be taking as many shots as Sexton, especially since he's slumping even worse right now? I don't think Kevin Love is an offensive piece that should be getting all the touches he does. So I have questions about the shot distribution that's leading to so many shots being taken away from him at the moment. There are also times were we really need the bucket, and we pass around pass around, and suddenly it's Wade or JA on the elbow dribbling.. or some other set I just fundamentally don't understand. I just don't know why we stray away from sexton for so damn long at times- entire quarters or halves where he isn't getting the ball to do anything productive. In the game against Portland, sexton had gone like 7/10 in the first half and was playing great defense. Then it was strange, we just refused to let him do anything on offense for nearly 2 quarters. Now it's the end of the 4th and we are fighting in a close game for the W and suddenly we're giving sexton the ball to iso on the perimeter after not touching the ball for 2 quarters.. because now we need that iso scoring in a half court set. Shocking he wasn't as hot as he was earlier! He did make a bucket, but also a turnover and then a jump ball.   I understand promoting ball movement and more guys getting the ball, but if your improved ball movement is ending up with worse players taking harder shots then I don't think it's a success. That was really my biggest issue with the offense this year is that Yes, more passing is great. But we are not always getting to better places with it. I am frequently seeing bad (career wise, game wise, just bad) 3pt shooters end up with spot up shots or isos rather than our best and youngest players getting the chances to drain a bucket or develop. The offense has not found a rhythm yet, and that was definitely hurting sexton a lot this year. I think there was room for us to be better as a team and have better ball movement while he still gets more chances to do his thing and us be better for it."
I'll concede that Jaylen Brown would better than our Kevin Love centered package
"I know Ben been acting selfish but reddit is insanely hypocritical about mental health.  Loves to make funs of people without a second thought behind anonymous usernames yet praise people like kevin love or demar for battling mental health.   I'm not saying ben is not faking it, but not everyone battling their own issues need to come out publicly. What if ben ends up killing himself? How bad would y'all feel? You never know what/when someone is going through that.  Have you ever had millions of people constantly make fun of you?"
For Kevin Love and Sexton
"LeBron isn't coming back unless he can force the Lakers to trade him for Kevin Love.  We don't have the cap space to sign him.  He could always play a vet min season with us but I feel like that championship would always have a massive shameful asterisk next to it.  That's as blatantly cheating as you can get in the NBA.  Furthermore, do we want LeGM back?  Do we want him to force us to trade Isaac Okoro for Carmelo Anthony?  This team is built to be good for the next decade, we shouldn't be blowing that up just to get a championship run in now.  But you know LeBron doesn't care how the team's gonna look when he's 45.  I think he'll sign on a ten day and retire a Cav to end his career, and that'll be the last we see of him."
"“I love playing in Toronto, the fans have been amazing to me”  Kevin Durant yesterday. Weird how he feels that way about the fan base and yet you are still mad on his behalf lol"
"Kevin Love was a top 10 player at the time and the 2nd best Timberwolves player of all time after KG. To go from that kind of offensive production to the numbers he put up in Cleveland was just wrong. He was literally in the middle of his prime years, it just wasn’t a good fit. If they wanted elite defense, there were many other players that could be had for cheaper too. Love was a rhythm player who needed the ball in his hands and needed touches early to get going. He isn’t like Kyrie, KD, Steph, who can play off ball and still be elite. Keeping Wiggins and developing him to be a 3&amp;D wing would even have been better. Or trading for a defensive big to catch lobs and protect the rim."
"Kevin Love was certainly not a terrible fit on the Cavs. They were 1 Kelly Olynyk arm pull away from a ring and eventually won 1 with him playing elite defense in game 7. Sure, he wasn't 26 and 12 Kevin Love but to say he was a terrible fit is plain wrong."
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Evan Mobley and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Ricky Rubio gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Mobley hit the locker room door, former NBA great LeBron James hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"I get that the lakers FO has to respect LeBron’s demands but the dude doesn’t have a good track record when it comes to team construction. They should’ve convinced LeBron to do things their way. LeBron was the one to recruit Kevin Love to the Cavs, and that was a terrible fit as well. LeBron always thinks that slapping three first option stars on a team is the way to go. He did it in Miami, Cleveland, and now again in LA."
Is that Klay Thompson for Kevin Love trade still on the table? Lol
The closest - 2020 Cavs:  * Kevin Love son of Stan Love * Larry Nance Jr son of Larry Nance * Darius Garland son of Winston Garland * Dante Exum son of Cecil Exum (drafted in the 9th round by the Nuggets) * Coach J. B. Bickerstaff son of Bernie Bickerstaff
"Kevin Love gets reunited with Westbrook, LeBron gets reunited with all of Cleveland.  Who says no?"
"kevin love says no, too depressing"
"Not to mention our starting 3 (Lauri,) backup 3 (Okoro) and Kevin love."
they already did that by having the Cavs win the 2014 lottery so they could trade for Kevin Love
Kevin Love has played more than 70 games just 5 times in 14 years. If it wasn’t the Olynyk play chances are he would have been injured anyways
Kevin Love was injured by Kelly Olynyk. It wasn't some random injury.
I mean LeGM is also responsible for the Anthony Davis trade which lead to them winning the title. The same can be said about the Kevin Love trade.  Prior to this Westbrook thing LeBron has made the right choices.
Kinda makes sense to waive Kevin Love right now.
They should trade Westbrook for Kevin love
"And my question is, who’s getting bought out this year? If John wall, the rockets would either have to eat $47m, or wall gives back a ton, and I don’t think that’s likely, this is his last big contract. Maybe Kevin love, but he’s not very good anymore.  Like, I think people overestimate the importance of the buyout market. LMA and Blake didn’t get it done for the nets, Blake was serviceable. The Lakers are not going to find a decent 3&amp;D wing on the buyout market because those guys are valuable.   And the severely hampered any trade potential because it’s much easier to package Kuzma and Harrell (and Kuzma is decent/youngish) than to try and trade Westbrook.   And honestly, for what the Lakers need I do not understand how you wouldn’t rather KCP, Kuzma and Caruso.  Honestly, if Lebron and AD are healthy, am I crazy for thinking I’d rather have role player Caruso than high usage Westbrook at this point?"
Yeah but I would take Kevin love and which ever point guard they want to release. They have 3 of them
"Literally Lebron. The Sixers wouldn’t want to be near him and I don’t even think the Lakers can trade their 2026 pick. Even then no first round picks for the next 4 drafts, one bottom 5 contract, and no great young prospects get you nowhere. You couldn’t acquire anybody for that, not even Kevin Love."
"You guys can probably get Kevin Love or John Wall, but then why would houston want Russ back."
Is Vucevic less glorified cavs Kevin Love now?
That Ja dunk over Kevin Love.
do you really want to argue with somebody who compared Jok to Kevin Love?
"Klay took a much bigger than expected leap between 13-14 and 14-15. That’s why the Kevin Love deal was even on the table and why his big contract that offseason was met with skepticism. Besides that, Draymond Green was at best a backup tweener forward. David Lee’s injury granted the opportunity, but Kerr and Adams’ switching defensive scheme and the audacity at the time to use him at the 5 turned him into the league’s best defensive player (still a travesty that Kawhi won the 2015 DPOY). The team may have gotten marginally better due to the real improvement by the players, but the gap between where they would have been and the all time great dynasty they became is entirely due to Kerr."
Lol twolves k love. Talk to me when kevin love drags Markus Howard and Austin rivers to round 2 in the playoffs.
His team is .500. If he pulls this for a quarter of a season then people will start talking about it. But right now he's Timberwolves Kevin Love. Giant stats on a team that's not winning.
I think it just varies how they round heights and whether it is with shoes or not.     https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/34789/kevin-love-and-height-liars-in-shoes
"I just found out Kevin Love is 6'7, that blew my mind. Swear dude used to average like 15 boards a game in Minnesota. I thought he was at least 6'10"
He was healthy enough post injury to play up to standards and beat okc in a grueling physical 7 game series but not healthy enough to score on Kevin love or throw a proper pass?
"The difference is in the 2021 first round harden was playing his best ball and right after his injury he was a shell of his former self.  With curry, he played well until game 7 where he choked. So he was actually capable of playing well, he just couldn’t and got clamped by Kevin love"
"Cavs offer Kevin Love, Collin Sexton and a 1st."
Who is “hazing” or making Mobley do rookie duties on this team..? Kevin love? Rubio?  Mobley is already one of the best players on the team and part of thier future. I don’t think he has normal rookie duties
"Yeah losing a game because of the refs is frustrating. 9 to 19 free throws, and sexton traveled. Also, kevin love is hawks chandler parsons at this point."
"Fair enough, but Barnes played the entire game and looked great in the first half and then went cold. We were also missing our starting SF, SG and Kevin Love.    Also, Is siakim really a top 30 player either? I guess maybe, idk."
"Lmao neither of those guys are as good as Siakam, and neither of them would’ve done any more than what their replacements did in the game.  Refs handed the cavs two free throws for garland tripping over himself, not to mention the blown call on sexton’s travel.  Also, imagine listing Kevin Love not being out there as anything but a positive for his team. The dude is toast."
Sucks its just like Kevin spacey I love most shit he's in but really dislike the dude
"Do we doubt that he has mental health issues? I mean isn't that obvious from the free throw line?  BUT. There have been players who were literally scared for their lives from anxiety while stepping onto the court, and still did it.  I think Ben is hurt that the 6ers didn't go to bat for him in his worst moment, and he isn't the most confident guy to begin with. Now he wants to leave because he doesn't feel supported, but doesn't feel like he should have to give up money to do so. That is prima Donna and basically what is wrong with so many things in society today. This is why half the country keeps using words like snowflakes.  Unfortunate that the next Kevin love, Brandon Marshall, etc lose out. It's appalling, and it's horrible that nobody can call him out for it given the NBA fraternity."
Wait what happened to Kevin Love lol
Bro kevin love aint giving shit to the cavs lol
"Trading for what though? The the wizards won the trade just by virtue of the fact that 3 contracts are easier to move than 1 gargantuan one. Not to mention I’d rather have Kuzma and KCP than Westbrook. The only Players they have besides minimum and max guys are THT and Nunn, and I think Nunn fit in the MLE. And buyout guys don’t help as much as we like to play them up as. Like maybe Kevin love or wall get bought out, but those guys aren’t moving the needle for the Lakers. I think we’re finally seeing from Lebron, his effectiveness is down AND he’s missing games. Some rankings at the beginning of the season had him in the 2nd half of the top 10 and honestly I think that’s fair now.  I don’t think there’s a trade they can make. THT and Nunn are the only thing you could consider assets, Nunn is 26 and THT is simply a rotation player. They still owe picks to the pelicans, I don’t think there’s a trade to be made, and I don’t think this team is elite."
Kevin Love was way worst than Simmons y’all so whitewashed here.
"Superstars right now are KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Lebron, Jokic, AD, Haden, Luka and Embid, so maybe I was over the top with saying only 7. Aside from Wade and AD no one else on your list was on that level.   Kyrie and Kevin Love  were not superstars when the Cavs won a chip, they were all star caliber players. They didn't even make all-nba second team."
"Oh so not getting the proof of the illness is bad now?? The reason why I believe he should is A) to know exactly what he’s up against (depression, GAD, bipolar, panic disorder etc.) and B) so then he and the sixers can make a plan to combat it. Sure I might sound like an angry asshole in my comment but I’m coming from a genuine place of frustration of having dealt with mental disorders my entire life and also studying to be a social worker so I can help people put the measures in place before they get to the situation I was in.   Simmons doesn’t need to publicly disclose anything. That’s none of our business. However, it’s important for people like Ben Simmons to go through the proper channels for mental health diagnosis and treatment instead of saying they’re fighting it and leaving the organization in the dark. Kevin Love and Demar Derozan DID NOT PAVE THE PATH FOR THOS TO FOLLOW FOR SIMMONS TO RIP IT UP. What if because of this people like Rui aren’t able to take a step away from the game like he needed at the beginning of the season? That’s why Simmons needs to do this the right way. The way he’s done it is gonna hurt a lot of people."
"I don't get why they wouldn't be able to prove muscle tightness or something, or he could say he has a mentla block from his calf injury like Kevin Love did for so long"
"When a guy says he wants out, his agent says he will hold out, tries to hold out, and fakes an injury to hold out, you’re naive to think that a sudden pivot to “mental health” is legitimate.  Most players are universally praised when they are open about their mental health issues. (See Kevin Love) But we weren’t born yesterday. If you can’t blatantly see that Simmons is using “mental health” as a loophole for sitting out, getting paid, and making it taboo to call him out and impossible to prove he’s faking/milking, then you are extremely naive."
"right.  Kevin Love made it easier for people to go to their employer and be open about mental health issues (in theory, in some way that cant be measured).  But if Simmons is faking it, it makes it harder for people to go to their employers, they might be told they are just ""pulling a Ben Simmons.""  (again, in theory, but still this is just too low if he is faking it).  hopefully he is not faking it, and how he has gone about the past few months are just displays of his illness rather than trying to fake it."
"&gt;Could he have some issues? maybe.  I'd say probably.  &gt; Could he also be faking? Probably.   I'd say it's possible, at most.  &gt;he'll basically single handedly undo all the progress made due to players like Demar and Kevin Love  Will he?"
"Mental health is a real issue and should be considered as such, however because it's so difficult to clinically diagnose due to lack of hard numbers like a lab result would have that it becomes an easy way to abuse the system.  Even in regular jobs there are people faking sickness all the time because they don't want to work, and with mental health it's even harder to disprove.  Could he have some issues? maybe.  Could he also be faking? Probably.  The shitty part is that if he is faking (which given his history toward this entire situation seems likely) he'll basically single handedly undo all the progress made due to players like Demar and Kevin Love, and that's the absolute shittiest part of this whole debacle.  Being a selfish fucking douche and throwing all that progress out the window because he wants to be paid his millions without working makes him a garbage person.  I hope he gets traded to the middle of nowhere and fades into obscurity"
"Lmao he literally recruited Chris Bosh to go to Miami, Asked David Griffin to get Kevin Love  and he got AD to force a trade to the lakers wtf are u talking about???"
Kevin Love?
"lakers need more seasoned vets, they should sign kevin love"
Isnt kat already supposed to be a top 20 player. If they cant build a team around kat why will they build one around ant. How many years of kg did they waste again? Kevin love they just suck building teams and have done so this entire century so far. The whole front office has been shit and is shit.
"I linked an explanation of what RAPTOR is... But if you're too lazy to read it, it's not team based system. The point is that you *make your team better, offensively or defensively, when you're on the floor*.   &gt; I remember in the finals against the Cavs the Cavs kept switching on to Curry as their strategy and you know the rest.  If you want to have a Stephen A. type conversation about this, then I totally understand that take. But if you ask any serious analysts like Zach Lowe or Tim Legler, they'll tell you that Curry clearly still injured those playoffs. Kevin Love was destroying him in those match-ups in that series. That says a lot.  The Cavs and other teams hunted Curry in switches the following seasons, and it didn't work. And considering how many minutes he takes up, isn't it weird that he's such a bad defender and yet his team has sustained a top 5 defense every year that he was healthy?  Again, if you want to have a Stephen A conversation about this, I totally understand why you would make that argument. But if you zoom out beyond a specific series and look at other games and series', you'll have a more nuanced view."
"Warriors won those rings fair and square nobodies denying that. But you’re kidding yourself if you think, for legacy purposes, they matter more than like dirks ring. Yeah, and the raptors beat the injured warriors, the bucks beat the injured nets, and in 2015 the warriors beat the cavs who were missing Kyrie and Kevin love. We can do this for all championships. A rings a ring but some rings matter more for ones legacy that’s all."
"How do you know that a center that averages 25-10-4 while shooting over 40% from 3 is a bad fit?   You also thought you Kevin Love wasn’t considered a top 10 player in the league on the Timberwolves and I sourced 6 publications to prove you wrong there  Also not a trade I put together, and the reason it wouldn’t go through is because the 76ers and Timberwolves"
"Bleh, his defense is good every year according to the Timberwolves fans. Dude has never contributed to a win in his life. He’s the pinnacle of a the guy who gets big empty stats. Not to say he could’ve be the third option on a championship team, but Kevin Love was putting up monster numbers with the Wolves. He’s a great player, but he’s not Embiid or Jokic or even Gobert who immediately makes any team in the league top 10 defensively. Bleh, so tired of KAT stans."
Time to bring Kevin ‘Something’ Love home.
"15,13,19,11,7 is his shot spread the last 5 games. That is by definition sporadic. He’s also been getting less and less 1v1 attempts per game and neither Demar or Zach are consistent enough in looking for him in second halves/ 4th quarters. He’s a guy who’s used to getting shots and especially getting attempts at isos/ post ups to get in rhythm. Just posting percentages and usage rating kind of shows YOU aren’t watching lol. If you were you’d see they miss him a lot and never give him chances to create for himself. There’s like 5 or 6 possessions a game where he’s wide open and Demar or Zach miss him and take contested jumpers. They all need to find better ways to get him better looks he’s more comfortable with. Rn he’s getting used like Kevin Love in Cleveland and neither of our stars are Bron"
But he still started more the half the games for them that season. JR smith started 79. Both those players weren’t there next season. We are talking about their regular season record here.  Kevin love wasn’t injured in 2018. He played 3 times as many games that season as he did the season after James left. He was also an all star. Next season he played 21 games.
"Oh yeah 7 years of 1st round exits. Followed by 1 good year and then missing the playoffs from 2004 to 2018.   So one of the greatest talents of all time made them a perennial 1st round exit.  And KAT is better than Kevin Love, not to mention Kevin Love on the Timberwolves was seen as a top 10 player, the league just changed."
Crowder wasn't on the finals team he was traded at the deadline. Kevin Love is always injured. JR Smith fell out of the league completely.
"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!? They went from a 20 win team the year before KG, to a playoff team in his second year. They then made the playoffs for 8 years straight.  If your best comparison is Kevin Love, that’s even a harder “FUCK NO” to that trade."
remember when he put CJ Miles on Kevin Love? good times.
"They made the playoffs with KAT the year they had another All-Star beside him.   Plus the Timberwolves were also bottom dwellers with Kevin Love and Kevin Garnett. It’s an organizational problem, not a KAT problem."
"We'll give you Kevin Love back so that way we can start 4 sevenish footers.  3 wasn't enough and Taco isn't good enough, yet."
The Kevin Love special!
"People use to say this about Brad Stevens.   [Here is an article from 2018](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23527508/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-brad-stevens-superstar-player)   Some fun takeaways from the article  &gt; FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver put the bar very high indeed, finding nearly 50/50 results on a poll asking respondents to choose between Stevens and MVP contender Giannis Antetokounmpo after the first round of the playoffs.  &gt; Remember, not that long ago it was Thibodeau's example we were using to discuss the upper bounds of value of coaches (and by we, I mean me). That's a pretty good sign that coaches' skills aren't as consistent or transferable as those of star players.  While I love Nurse and think he is a good coach, I can assure you that the players are definitely more valuable. Nurse can help elevate a team, but ultimately it’s a players league"
your scenario isn’t backed up in any reality   kevin love makes commercials for headspace. nobody shots on you for having mental issues except for twitter bots
Kevin love has def been faking these past yrs
"Game 7 of the 2016 finals. That entire series was crazy, but the moments in game 7 - The Block, Kyrie splashing in Curry’s face, Kevin Love discovering how to play defense in the final moments. With Lebron’s redemption arc in Cleveland, the rise of the warriors as they are coming off a historic regular season, damn that was riveting."
"Kevin love also averaged like 16 rpg one season  Rebounding your own bricked layups isn’t impressive.  Especially when you win like 26 games at the same time....  Rodman had 0-18-0-0-0 stat lines on purpose.  There is no equivalent.  I like the honorable mention of Barkley...  Although people love to say he stat pads, people genuinely stop trying to out jump russy for rebounds lmao they’re not letting him, they’re just not wasting the energy to get out jumped lol"
"Cavs fan checking in, reminder the 73 win warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the finals and Kevin Love clamped Curry in game 7 btw :)"
Didn’t Kyrie win during the disastrous Cavs era? Didn’t Kevin Love win during the disastrous Timberwolves era? Why was Booker and the Suns singled out?
Yeah or maybe like a Kevin Love/Tyler Herro/Steve Adams/Luka/Caruso/Joe Harris/Joe Ingles/Duncan Robison with a splash of DiVencenzo
"Felt like every team in the 2000s had one dude that just chucked constant shots on low efficiency  I love AI but he’s in there. Mike Redd, Kobe, Antoine Walker, Starbury, TMac, Melo, Kevin Martin, list goes on"
Seattle Supersonics fan here. I hope Kevin Durant never wins another thing of meaning unless he returns to Seattle. And I should note for the record that I love him and always will.
The wolves gave Kevin Love depression
LeBum joined Wade and Bosh and ruined the parity too. LeBum then assembled and army in Cleveland with Kyrie and traded and no. 1 pick to get the best all rounder in the league in Kevin Love.  I can give many examples.
"\[Kevin Durant\] Spending all day on twitter is great and totally normal! I absolutely love interacting with my fans there. Truly, I can't imagine why anyone would suggest spending my free time reacting to anonymous strangers tweets about me would be a bad idea."
"Kevin Love. I don't think he's making it. The falloff was just too hard, but for a while, he was dominant AF.  I also don't think Big Shot Bob is making it. He was never even a top 50 player in the league IMHO, but being a critical piece for 7 rings is nothing to laugh at."
"No, but also in a way yes.  Would love Kevin Harlan on that call"
"I hope the Raptors miss the playoffs for a decade.  It’s pure pettiness, but… - They gave us our most painful playoff loss maybe ever and **gloated** over it for years. - They used that loss to relentless call Giannis a choker and paper MVP - They were somehow simultaneously just as relentless about our “choker” ditching us for Toronto, where he would of course be a legitimate superstar - The whole goddamn Kevin Durant thing - Borderline delusion about being a “championship franchise” when they were just carried to a ring by Kawhi and a historic collapse from GSW   You asked for petty.  Don’t tell anybody I fucking love Scottie Barnes."
"Talking about someone who  I do not want to win a ring - Harden. I hate this guy ever since he left OKC. He is the only player in the history of the game I hate. I do not like for one reason or another Karl Malone, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Sprewell, Garnett, Kevin Love etc. but nobody comes even close to Harden."
"Contest is so friggin important dude.  Kevin Love averaging 8.5 PPG in an NBA Finals, isn’t putting him over anybody."
"Suns just were two games away, we thankfully finally stopped chasing the 8 in the west and got the number one pick before the odds got all fucked up.  Also Cleveland tanked while LeBron left, and used those picks for Kevin love trade &amp; drafted Kyrie."
"Russ, Kevin Love, John Wall - basically any shit contracts"
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love also send their regards as well.
"Kevin Love, you hear that?"
"I mean the Cav’s didn’t have Kevin Love for a game in that 2016 series because he got elbowed in the back of the head.. and Kyrie was nursing an injury too.  One could argue the Warriors would’ve never had their first championship in 2015, and it would’ve gone to the Cavs if Kyrie didn’t fracture his kneecap and Kevin Love didn’t have his shoulder ripped out of it’s socket.  One could argue that 2016 Warriors team was the greatest regular season team of all time and it’d be indisputable based on their record. But the playoff’s are another animal and the Cavs beat them. It’s doesn’t have to be anymore complicated than that. Injuries and a little bit of luck help determine every single playoff berth, series, and eventual champion.  But hey, if dwelling on the “what if’s” makes you feel better than, sure."
"Probably Kevin Love.  I think people will forget about his Minnesota years, and his Cleveland years are getting tarnished by how it's finishing out.   If you had asked me 4 years ago I would have said yeah, sure he's getting in."
Is Kevin Love going?
"As JJ Reddick put it, Kevin Love is better than 90% of the power forwards on the 76 all time list."
"His 6 fouls that game were on Tristan Thompson, then LeBron, then Kyrie, then Kevin Love, then Kyrie again, then LeBron again."
"Curry's game 6 fouls:  Foul #1:  Throwing TT in the post; obvious, uncontroversial call  Foul #2:  LeBron lowers his shoulder into Steph, but Steph is obviously moving into LeBron's lane when the contact is initiated. That's a defensive foul every single time.  Foul #3:  Very light contact on a Kyrie shot coming off a screen is called a foul on the ground. Only was called a foul because Kyrie immediately went up for a shot that was clearly impacted by the contact and that was how the refs were calling that in 2016, though they called it on the ground to balance it a bit for the Warriors.  Foul #4:  Contact on Kevin Love on a outback attempt. Wouldn't have been egregious had it not been called, but certainly not a bad call either.  Foul #5: Really the only bad call on here. Makes some contact with Kyrie on a steal attempt, then on a second attempt picks his pocket cleanly, but it appears they call the foul on the second attempt and not the first. The ref had a bad angle, so anyone saying it's rigged is deluding themselves, but it's undeniable that this shouldn't have been called.  Foul #6: Steph hyper-aggressively pursues a steal in the backcourt and cuts LeBron off, creating contact in the process. The only other option the refs would've had there would be to give LeBron a double-dribble, which would have been silly since he was only forced to double-dribble because he was fouled by Curry.  Most of these calls are pretty straight forward. A couple are 50-50 calls. One is a bad call. What none of them are, though, are fouls called on Curry for hand-checking, which just goes to show that when people in this sub talk about anything, particularly something controversial, they just say shit without regard for whether it's true or not. You could've easily fact-checked yourself before you posted, but instead you decided to post something that was just demonstrably false."
"&gt;AD is one of those weird players like KAT, Kevin Love, etc where the stats are impressive but they dont really impact “winning” as the MAIN guy on the team. Some guys are just best as a Robin to someone else’s Batman.  AD is nothing like KAT or KLove. They have never been as good in the playoffs, heck even regular season as AD. Also a few times AD even got a quality team such as 2015 and 2018 He took Pelicans to the playoffs, 2018 he lead the swept of Blazers averaging 30/13/2 blocks and then losing to KD Warriors.   &amp;#x200B;  People who say stuff like this obviously do not understand that Pelicans supporting cast was always horrible until 2018 and then when it became good Cousins tore his achilles."
LeBron done with Kevin Love lmaooo

"AD is one of those weird players like KAT, Kevin Love, etc where the stats are impressive but they dont really impact “winning” as the MAIN guy on the team. Some guys are just best as a Robin to someone else’s Batman."
"""Watch Uncle Steph throw this garbage behind the back pass. Here he is getting locked up by Kevin Love. You heard me. Kevin. Love. I should shoot 30 times a game, but it wouldn't be fair to the rest of the league."""
"The CBA includes a medical retirement option. The player still gets paid all of their contracted money, but their salary stops counting against their team's cap beginning one year from their last game played. To my knowledge, Pekovic (Timberwolves) is the only player to ever make use of this clause; the Lakers tried to use it for Luol Deng but were denied because they'd already stretched him.  I know about this clause because I've been hoping against hope that it would be used for Kevin Love."
"Knicks and Nets are unfair competition, it's the same as if Kevin Harlan got a deal to be some team's main broadcaster.   From non-national announcers, my n.1 is still Followill. Perfect mix of homerism, admiration for opponents and energy. Derek and Skin are very hit-or-miss, though. From others, I love booths with high energy and that gets hyped with anything that happens, so the Hornets are 10/10 (They're the second team I watch the most, basically because of Eric/Dell). Like the Kings, Raps, Spurs and Pistons as well.  On the other hand, Clippers, Grizzlies, Celtics and Thunder craddles me to sleep. They react to a dunk with the excitement of Pat Summerall calling a slug race."
"LeBron is just a bitter old man. He only won 4 championships and he’s not going to match MJ any more because he made a foolish trade for Westbrook. To top it off, he has to go watch Stephen Curry out there having fun and winning with Andrew Wiggins, who he personally traded to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love, who was a massive bust in his time with the Cavs and who didn’t help him beat the aforementioned Stephen Curry who was out there having fun and winning with Klay Thompson, who the Warriors passed up trading for the aforementioned Kevin Love."
"I don’t disagree with your reasoning but he is the betting favorite at the moment. It isn’t completely unprecedented for it to happen, like Kevin Love back in the day was good already and then jumped up and won it but I def see what you mean."
No it’s kevin love
Maybe Kevin Love can fix their defense
I thought the post implied that Cavs would be giving the first round pick up. Giving up a first to get Kevin Love off the roster.
"Sometimes it's kindof a combination where a big man isn't a total ""empty stats"" guy but if he's the only good player on the team his stats end up way inflated because he's the only one on the team who can do anything. If you looked solely at stats you'd think TWolves Kevin Love was the best player in the league."
"Indeed so players like Kevin love Timberwolves, Russell westbrook every where he goes.   As of right now Zion is looking like a straight carbohydrate diet the way his calories looking of empty stats"
OKC has almost too many draft picks already and does not want Kevin Love sorry bro
"Not gonna lie when the warriors played the cavs the other night and I saw Kevin Love I thought to myself: oh shit, he’s still there. All these years and he’s been stuck there this whole time."
tobias for kevin love [eyeballs emoji]
That or OJ Mayo for Kevin Love.  We should only trade with Memphis.
"Yeah, I'd agree with this.  Remember how Kevin Love used to be great in Minnesota, and now we know that he's struggled with mental health issues.  It's easy to forget that basketball isn't just about pure physical talent.  Anytime you're on a team with LeBron, you know explicitly that the entire NBA world expects a finals appearance at the least.  It's a lot to handle, no doubt."
"&gt;Is this copypasta  No, but this is:  ....  https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/brain-health/a-game-changer-for-mental-health-sports-icons-open-up  **A game-changer for mental health: Sports icons open up**     by Kara Gavin    July 29, 2021 11:41 AM     *Simone Biles, Naomi Osaka and others could accelerate growing acceptance and decreasing stigma for mental health.*      They had the world’s spotlight shining on them.      They had trained for years for this moment.      Millions of fans waited to watch them compete and see them hoist a trophy or a gold medal once again.      Instead, they used that spotlight to say something few world-famous athletes have ever dared to say out loud: I need to step away from this competition and focus on my mental health.      And by doing so, gymnast Simone Biles, tennis player Naomi Osaka, basketball player Kevin Love and a handful of others at the pinnacle of their athletic careers have helped accelerate a trend that mental health experts at the University of Michigan say is long overdue.      By being open about what they were experiencing, and not “toughing it out” or stifling their feelings like generations of athletes have had to do, these icons did more than spare themselves injury or defeat.      ...Their public choice to seek help for depression, anxiety, overwhelming stress and other concerns could help athletes at all levels have the courage to seek professional help, and a break from competition if they need it...       “As more athletes speak out, it gives others permission to ask for help and normalizes mental health as part of the conversation,” said Stephanie Salazar, M.P.H., who manages outreach programs for the center including Athletes Connected.      **A generational effect helping to end stigma about mental health**   All three U-M experts say the shift has been most striking as athletes from Generation Z have reached elite levels – including Biles and Osaka.      “The generational difference is one of the things that gives me the most hope about the future – for all of society, not just athletes,” said Heininger.  “The idea of ‘not knowing about depression or anxiety’ seems so foreign to them; they are consistently surprised, even shocked, to learn that ‘not knowing’ was the norm, very recently, as well as for all of history before that.” ...      The importance of early recognition and effective treatment, and the availability of options including telehealth-based talk therapy and mobile apps for monitoring and managing moods, have all converged in recent years too.      **The brain is just a body part**   Coaches and parents who heed this research can actually help athletes harness current knowledge to boost their performance, said Heininger.      “The idea that an athlete – or anyone trying to perform at their peak – need not pay attention to their mental health is negligent,” he said. “It would be the equivalent of ignoring their physical health and saying ‘My body just is what it is. There’s no impact if I lift weights, train, and eat well.’ I think it says a lot about how far we’ve come that today’s athletes think about training their minds in the ways they do their bodies.” ...      **The importance of reaching out about mental health concerns**   When an athlete is having a mental health crisis – such as the anxiety attacks that led Love to suddenly leave a Cleveland Cavaliers game in 2018 – coaches and parents need to understand that this is not a time to tell them to “suck it up”, Hong said...      When he’s treating an athlete for a mental health emergency, from anxiety attacks to suicide attempts, he often finds himself doing that educating as a crash course. “We can reach them sometimes, but with some families, it can be really hard,” he said...      Now, he finds himself hearing from athletes who heard his presentations. Months later, they contact him to get advice – not just for anxiety or depression, but for other emotional and mood changes they’ve noticed in themselves...      Hong adds that there is a special significance to the two world-class athletes who have spoken up recently and very visibly. ""*It is known that in the United States that those from racial minority groups are less likely to seek mental health care than white Americans, with stigma being a significant factor,*"" he said. ""It is then even more notable that Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka, as faces of Black and Asian America, are speaking out, demonstrating that it is ok to admit to having a mental health issue.""      **More progress needed to end mental health stigma**   The negative comments on social media about Biles’ withdrawal and Osaka’s early defeat during the Olympics have shown there’s still a long way to go in raising awareness and increasing acceptance.      But a growing number of comments are from people defending the athletes for their bravery and cheering on their recovery. Biles even mentioned that Osaka’s decision to focus on her mental health helped inspire her own decision.      “The more people who are famous and come out publicly about their mental health, the better,” Hong said. “Backlash will happen, but somewhere out there we know there are young athletes who sought help because a role model spoke up, and we know that will continue.”"
"2x MVP and DPOY? Averaging 28/12/6 for the last 4-5 years while being one of the best defensive players?   I love Durant, he’s my favorite player,  but using the “ringz” argument in favor of him is stupid. He joined the 73-9 team that beat him. The Greek’s one title and FMVP  is worth both Durants combined…  Any combination of curry, Kevin and Giannis is fair and will get no argument. But saying Giannis isn’t even in the same conversation as them? Gtfo"
IT was such a dick on the cavs too    Calling out Kevin Love for not trying hard enough after Love had the flu and started playing again    Also this was shortly after Love had been open about his mental health problems he was facing      And IT was like well a lot of the issues are Kevin’s fault     And the kicker was Kevin Love was one of the first people to reach out to IT after the kyrie trade cause Love grew up playing with IT in Washington
Of course Kevin Love is in street clothes in this picture
Kevin Love. One last hurrah in Cleveland.   /s
Does Kevin Love still play basketball? He kinda just faded into nothing.
"Nah he wasn't, he couldn't even get passed Kevin  Love. The next year he cooked Love everytime he got switched on him. That was also the most biased officiating I've seen in the playoffs since the 2002 western conference finals."
"Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Kevin Love would fit in great.
"I love kd. Dude is a spider demon born in a lab to be the perfect basketball player. Appreciate everything he did for us. But no one escapes being made fun of. Not kd, not Curry, not Klay.  Harden has been one of the most effective basketball players of all time over the last couple of years. Hall of famer for sure. No denying that. But also, this year’s rule changes have effected his game more than almost any other player in the league. So much of his game is built around both foul baiting and the space that the fear of fouling him creates.  Players in the league absolutely appreciate the effectiveness of his game. But I’m sure they also share the fan’s frustration with it. It’s more than just how you feel about playing against other good players. If KD rains jumpers on your head you just shake your head and shrug. There’s nothing you can do. He’s Kevin fucking Durant. If Harden hooks your arm and gets to the line you - and your fans - feel cheated.  So let’s see how we look back on Harden and his game in a couple of years. Is he still a top of the line, too 5 player in the game type of superstar under these new rules? I think it’s fair to question that. And given the frustration that style of play causes in folks, I think you can expect a lot of cheerleading his demise if it turns out he isn’t that anymore."
Yeah but there is also a difference between passive aggressively saying Kevin Love needs to play better and passive aggressively accusing LeBron of supporting the oppression/mistreatment of an entire ethnic minority.
Specifically KD? So playing with Wade/Bosh doesn’t negate them? Playing with peak Kyrie and Kevin Love? Playing with AD?
"Man, Kevin Love used to be so good. Consistent 20-10 guy in MIN. And now he’s the butt of jokes."
They should trade Westbrook to the Cavs for Ricky Rubio and Kevin Love.
"The fact that Casey thought putting C.J Miles on Kevin Love for 4 straight possessions was a good idea says it all, [Love absolutely cooked Miles during those possessions](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/94okck/kevin_love_absolutely_abusing_cj_miles_the/).  Casey is the 2nd best head coach in Raptors history by a considerable margin, but he was a pretty bad playoff head coach honestly."
Kevin love was an empty stats guy and so is Westbrook. Doesn’t mean they’re bad but it does exist to an extent
"Always was. Told Carlos Boozer to sign with the Jazz for money instead of goading him into re-signing with the Cavs. Oversaw a franchise where players were sleeping with other players moms. Picked Miami with Wade/Bosh instead of Chicago with Wade/Bosh/Rose/Noah. Traded Air Wiggins for Kevin Love, who ended up being a major bust. Didn't recruit anyone except Kawhi in 2020 free agency, making the Lakers miss out on any other potential third stars for a big 3. Traded decent role players for Westbrook."
"I’m saying dog. You lost Sexton but you gained Rubio. You never had a veteran mind PG in long time. no dis to Garland but its true. Sure you lose Sexton points, but Rubio adds an element to make even Mobley an offensive threat. And look at Kevin Love. Bench per minutes monster."
Russ and reaves for Rubio and Kevin love
What? You have massive injuries and Sexton got injured last week. Lol. Do you watch the games? And Kevin Love just came back from Covid.
"&gt;I more look at it as a good tool to tier guys  It's a terrible tool to tier guys. Career OBPM puts Hakeem outside the top 100 (OBPM = 2.17), way under guys like Westbrook and Kevin Love (OBPM ≈ 4). It puts Duncan outside the top 40 (OBPM = 3.29), way below guys like Chris Paul and Kyrie (OBPM ≈ 5).  Career OBPM is a useless stat. Bringing up the fact that it ranks Kobe 20th is literally meaningless."
And Kevin Love.   Why try to dunk on someone named Love?
Watch Kevin Love on the bench through the first three 3s in this video.  Dude has seen this shit too many times.
"Steph has been doing this for 10+ years at the highest level. Yeah, Mobley would probably make it look different, but the rookie would be manipulated just as Kevin Love and the cavs were last night. A Kevin Love, mind you, who is more experienced than anyone in the league defending Curry and the Warriors."
"Nah, that dubious honour belongs to the “did LeBron give Kevin Love depression” thread"
Fox and Bagley for Kevin Love
"I was under the impression that in 2017 he played with a starting 5 including a picture of Kevin Love, a make a wish kid and 2 cones from training."
"Then Kevin Love doesn't pop his shoulder in 2015 and Lebron has the same number of rings. Players have both good luck and bad luck in their careers, you can't say ""if only such-and-such had happened"" because there's other such-and-such's that didn't happen in their favor also."
Steph only won with Draymond and Klay Thompson due to Kevin love and Kyrie Irving being injured in the finals when they won.  They would’ve lost that year to a fully healthy cavs team like they did the next year. This is why they needed Durant. They never win another ring without him.
"The 2010 Celtics, any of the early 2000s Nets teams, the Pistons in 2005. The 2017 Cavaliers, Kevin Love was the second-leading scorer at a whopping 14.5 ppg. Hell, the Heat just made the Finals out of the 5th seed 2 years ago."
"kevin love looked nice today, that's nice"
"I wouldn’t say fine, we are missing 4 starters and 2 bench guys and were surviving off of Kevin Love key 3 pointers"
It’s weird seeing Kevin Love with grey hair…..I can’t be that old…right?
"Yeah man that was awful, Kevin Love seemingly finding his shot from deep whatever, but that play is excusable. If I were Kerr or Green I’d play that on repeat at practice. Looking like the Wolves out there."
Slim Prime Kevin Love
I mean that sounds great and all but NBA players routinely practice at John wooden Center at UCLA during the off-season. Kobe and KG scrimmage with Kevin Love when he was on the UCLA team no joke.
Kevin Love just got fouled at the 3pt line the fuck
I feel like you could dress Kevin Love up as a Cavalier and just use him as the mascot; maybe I'm wrong
Damn Kevin Love hates the Warriors lol
It would come in the form of dead salary. For example you could acquire Kevin love and picks from the Cavs in a scenario like that.
Kevin Love used all his remaining defensive ability locking down Steph 5 years ago
"Fair enough. The Miami team that he joined hadn't gotten out of the first round for 3 years. He got help, but granted that's what happens when you bring a superstar to your team. With the Cavs, Kyrie was getting 1st round picks every year, its hardly a comparison for which team you're leaving or joining. KD could have gotten to the finals with that OKC team. Before the Warriors OKC series, OKC was favored to win, and it was looking like it too.  ""Warriors breaking out and becoming fierce competition wasn't exactly expected in the first place so who would have competed with that second Cavs super team?"" - Which is to say, he was looking for a dearth of competition and an easy ring? Lob City existed, the spurs hadn't disappeared all of a sudden.  As far as intention goes, theres a HUGE difference between Lebron joining Kyrie and Kevin Love, vs 3 All NBA players, one being an MVP, bringing in another MVP. Not comparable in the slightest. Intentions or otherwise."
"Many did criticize it.  Because the league never has and - in all likelihood, never will - see anything like it again.  All this talk about ""superteams"" is, largely, bullshit. When LeBron joined Kevin Love, it was a ""superteam."" When KD joined the Nets, it was a ""superteam."" No. Those examples are all-time greats being...all-time greats and leading their team to success.  KD joining the 73-9 Warriors? OK. That IS a superteam. You have the team with the *most wins in one season ever in the history of the league* and then they add a player who, at worst, is a top-3 player in the league and a surefire HOFer. That's just in a whole 'nother league than Kawhi joining the fucking Clippers."
Kevin love ain't a hofer and I love the guy
"Yeah, it's incredible the revisionist history around those LeBron Cavs team. Kevin Love will be a HoFer and Kyrie Irving outplayed Steph Curry in an NBA Finals, but people on this sub act like the roster that went into 2018 was the roster from 2015-2017.  The 2017 Cavs obliterated the Eastern Conference with Kyrie averaging 27/3/5 and Love averaging 17/10/1 to aid LeBron, in fact they were so dominant in the East that some analysists unironically believed that they could've pushed the Warriors in the Finals.  LeBron James is a great player, we dont need to lie about how good or bad his teams were to make him greater. The 2015-17 Cavs were absolutely stacked, they dismantled a 51-win Raptors and 53-win Celtics in 2017 like they were G-League squads.  They were stacked, the Warriors were just more stacked."
"From the article:  “It’s all well and good that we have some other things to entertain us, like Steph Curry doing Steph things with a real team around him in Golden State and the DeMar DeRozan-led Bulls trucking teams in the East.  Just don’t lose sight of the big picture, folks: Jokic is still the most effective regular-season player in basketball. Voters seemingly reluctantly gave him the MVP last year and again appear to be scanning the universe for alternatives, and it may be harder to convince them after seeing Curry go amazeballs on Tuesday in the league’s most prominent TV game of the season.  People: I get the Stephmania and all because the Warriors have been unbelievable (and we’ll get to that soon here), but for the love of all that is holy, would you please stop dismissing Jokic? He’s basically a 7-foot point guard at this point, dragging an injury-riddled Denver team to competence.  Yet we’ve heard comparatively little Jokic banter thus far, despite the fact that through 13 games, his PER of 35.4 ranks … (checks notes) … first all-time.  All. Time.  By a wide margin, actually — the all-time best heading into this year was 31.86 by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019-20. It’s only 13 games, and maybe Jokic’s numbers will dip as the year goes on, but nothing about his start has seemed particularly fluky or weird.  Even relative to the other four players who have been notably awesome in the early part of the season, Jokic has been on a completely different level.  We’re blessed with some awesome players right now, but in terms of production, it’s The Joker’s world. Yet, reading the tea leaves, it already seems very possible Jokic won’t repeat as MVP due to some combination of voter boredom and embarrassing oversight.  (Also, while we’re here: It is an unconscionable, embarrassing mistake that Jokic was left off the league’s top 75 players of all-time list, just to leave room for misty-eyed wistfulness about the fourth-best players on Lakers, Celtics and Knicks teams of yore. “Sure, this Jokic fella is good, but he’s no Dave DeBusschere.”)  The breadth of what The Joker is doing is overwhelming. Skill-wise, he’s the best passer in the league, but he’s also second in rebounding; oh, and he’s shooting 38.3 percent on 3s. And — get this — he’s sixth in scoring, while very nearly leading the league in 2-point shooting percentage at 66.3 percent.  Defensively, he’s less off-the-charts awesome, but his IQ and giant mitts still make him effective. (Fun fact: Jokic has more steals than Giannis, Trae Young or Kevin Durant. He’s in the league’s top 50 in both steal and block rate.) The Nuggets, quietly, are third in the NBA in defensive efficiency despite missing multiple key players, which sort of neutralizes the “WuT AbOUt hIs D?” angle.  In addition to having the best individual stats in the league, Jokic’s impact stats are borderline hilarious. The Nuggets are plus-14.2 points per 100 possessions when he plays, minus-11.6 when he sits, nearly a 26-point swing depending on whether he’s in the game.  The eye test backs up the numbers. He’s steadily improved his doughy physique and now moves better than ever, gliding past opponents in transition and making guard-like moves closer to the rim. As a roller, it’s been interesting to see him use long strides and (gasp!) athleticism to get chances close to the rim rather than ambling into jump hooks like he used to.  And mixed in, of course, are assorted displays of a rare basketball genius. He’s reinventing the game on the fly, doing stuff no big man has ever done and adding to the repertoire as he goes. Oh, here, let me just whip this one-handed, no-look, pick-and-roll dish to a driving Aaron Gordon.  Even as the Nuggets scuffle along in fits and starts through early injuries and bad bench units, Jokic has been unbelievable. Night to night, he’s not just the most effective player in the league, but he also makes at least one mind-blowing play every single game … and everyone just kind of ignores it and goes about the day. Playing in the Rocky Horror Time Zone doesn’t help, but it’s still weird. It doesn’t help that the league still markets him like he’s Mason Plumlee.  Fans of good basketball: Appreciate this guy. He is an awesome, generational talent at the absolute peak of his powers.”"
"I agree. KlankThompson (excellent name btw) knows faaar more about LeBron Leadership than those other guys who have praised it. What the heck do, wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Love, osman, Morris, Howard, rondo, Davis, Korver, Caruso, Reddick, Vogel, spolstra, griffin, etc know that Klank doesnt???  I mean come on, we never see quotes about LeBron like the one from Dave Griffin: "", “He got his work in before we flew.  Nobody does that … His single-mindedness and focus, I’ve never seen before.”  LeBron James didn’t let setbacks discourage him or stop him; he used them to make himself and his team better.   And certainly a hall of famer like Bosh would never say anything about a regular season game like:  ⁸ ""The Bulls had beaten us 10 days earlier, and this win on our home floor gave them the season series sweep and propelled them to a 24-4 finish. It also meant they took the No. 1 seed from us. Needless to say, it was a low point, and the media was loving it.  The next day at practice, I remember Bron coming in—and you could see it on his face. It wasn't that he wasn't happy. No one was. There was something about him that just embodied bouncing back. That he was back on track and we just needed to get on his energy.  The intensity that he brought to that practice was inspiring. To see the best player on the court sprinting full speed and leading the team with intensity and effort was what we all needed. We were all diving on the court for loose balls, taking charges, bringing that same intensity to the seemingly mundane drills. Getting back to the basics.  That's what a leader does. It's not just hyping the team up when you're winning and everything is comfortable. A leader shows composure when others would fall apart. LeBron didn't need to say anything to get us fired up—he just needed to set the example and trust that we would follow him. And we did.""  Or maybe Alex Caruso when asked about LeBron Leadership in preparing and reaching out to his team:   “It is ability to put everything in a perspective. He’s one of the smartest players I’ve ever played with if not the smartest. He always knows how to put people in a position for success,” Caruso said. “And I think for him to be able to understand that as a player it really helps me, it really helps our team.    But hey, let's not take anyone's word for it. I mean, didn't he throw Kevin Love under the bus or whatever. Listen to these mean things Kevin Love has said about LeBron leadership:  """"He's demanding in all the right ways and for right reasons,"" Love said. ""He has that strive for [greatness] saying that he always lives by, and he really won't accept anything else. I think Jordan was...they're different in their own right. I think Kobe was the same in trying to get the best out of their guys. I think Bron was absolutely very, very demanding but always was looking out for his guys. Always wanted to build you up. Always wanted to set you up for success. """
Yeah because Kyrie and Kevin Love never played for the Cavs. Just a reminder they went 12-1 in the East
Did you really just say Kevin love was at the peak of his powers in 2017
"I disagree and I think that's a point the Philly fans are missing.   In the last 15 years, social media and the media has brought players and fans closer than ever. The last 10 years, the players spent focused on player mobility. The last 5 years, NBA players have spent trying to assert their voice and create their own narratives by creating their own media channels, in response to the narratives driven by the news media and social media. KD, Kyrie, Ben, Kevin Love to an extent, are all examples."
"look, this sub hates him, but Ben Simmons would be a better return than the hauls from these trades:   1.	Boogie  2.	Paul George 3.	Kyrie 4.	Chris Paul to LAC 5.	Harden to Houston 6.	Kevin Love 7.	Blake Griffin   he’s a 3 time all star, an all-nba talent, and he’s a top 3 best defender in the league   NBA teams always think they can coach guys up and get them right and whatnot. i guarantee there’s a coach and FO who thinks they will fix him and his value will be higher than most other options   like the Cavs keep getting mentioned in these trades and i know they can’t be offering more than like Sexton and some firsts. that would be so much worse than Simmons for every other potential star, but that’s what the other teams have   simmons won’t get moved for a nobody"
Kevin Love
Kevin Love
"I have been closely following LeBron too, wherever he went. You are obviously biased because of your fandom. The Kevin Love saga was just as toxic for Minny as the AD saga for NOLA. AD wearing a t shirt doesn't make a difference lol."
"You do realise that the way the Lakers got AD is the exact same way your Cavs got Kevin Love, right?  Both franchises had LeBron's system working for them. The Lakers won a title, the Cavs won a title. Both titles are like 90% because of LeBron in one way or another. Comparing the remaining 10% is ridiculous."
My fantasy team a couple years ago was named Young Love because I had Trae Young and Kevin Love. My team picture was Malone.
"I wouldn’t do it I were the cavs. But Kevin love is probably the only contract with Cp3 and Wall that are even in the same territory.   But Wall might have separated himself from it as he looks good and still quite fast which was everyone’s biggest doubt.  And Cp3’s unique skills like his iq and leadership makes his somewhat fine as well. Even though I do feel next year, he will be worth no where near his contract"
"World champion, Kevin Love? Love conquers all, tf you on..lol"
"Can’t win with Wiggins, should have traded him for Kevin Love"
"Here for the armchair sports analysts that commend Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan for speaking out about mental health but shit on Kyrie Irving when we don’t even know anything about his situation and don’t want to give him any benefit of the doubt, it’s pretty clear he struggles mentally let’s just leave it at that."
"Of course. I have foggy brain. But the larger point remains unchanged -- those were the expectations when the Wolves traded their foundational piece (Kevin Love) for Wiggins &amp; extras. That is what I am saying -- when he was drafted, he was supposed to be a superstar. On the Warriors, he is paid like one, but those aren't the expectations.   So in that sense, he isn't becoming who he was drafted to be. He is becoming a terrific secondary scoring option though. If Klay were playing, he'd be ideal as a 3rd or 4th scoring option, depending how Wiseman develops, while D'ing up the best scoring wing on the other side, while Klay does that to the other team's best initiator (though Oubre has done a good job defending ballhandlers IMO, he just cannot throw a 3 point shot into a lake)."
Nothing would be amazing   Russ is untradeable. Other than maybe for Kevin Love if they give a pick
yeah but come on we literally can look up [2017 Lonzo rookie highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtnQjJCdYd8) and he was dishing everywhere.  I love Lamelo and personally think he will be great.  Just wait til players like Marcus Smart are on him and not Kevin Huerter and Nickeil Alexander Walker
"Could be a multitude of factors influencing Trae's play. He himself would be one of the best sources as to why he's struggling, and even he himself might not know.  These comments starting to look like similar to ""Lebron gave Kevin Love depression""."
Reminds me of Minny Kevin Love with his game
Thought her was drafted by the Cavs to be the compliment to Kyrie then traded for Kevin Love?
"KD: NO! Steph! Don't let me leave, Steph!  Kyrie: KD. KD, come in.  KD: Kyrie! We survived our recovery blackhole of a season.   Kyrie: They brought us here. Somewhere on this flat earth, they reconstructed a basketball arena in Brooklyn with their 5th dimensional mind to allow us to understand our purpose.   KD: Well it's not working.  Kyrie: Yes it is. You've worked out that there is a force that works across basketball space-time.   KD: Gravity.   Kyrie: Yes. They didn't bring us to Brooklyn to change the past.   KD: ... They didn't bring us here at all... we brought ourselves. The Warriors have access to infinite cap and space, but they can't find a specific player to fill that space. That's why I'm here. I'm going to find a way to communicate with Steph. With love.   Kyrie: Kevin Love?  KD: No. Love. For Steph's gravity. In order to save the NBA's ratings, I need to send a message to him. To team up with him again.   *[Charania] Magic Johnson fined $100K for tampering.*"
Nothing against Bron but if you are going to his team it’s championship run or bust. That pressure is insane Kevin Love and D. Rose both had mental breakdowns on that Cavs squad. Lebron expects you to perform at your peak in your role and that type of militant ball is tough. I mean that with great respect to the goat.
"Nah, gonna be like that Lebron gave kevin love depression take, no one ever forgetting either one"
Wade still gave a fuck but apparently he was no angel in the locker room either. Everybody blamed IT but apparently Wade was the guy leading the charge against Kevin Love for leaving a game due to illness which I believe it came out later was actually a panic attack. It was later that Love wrote his article about his mental health struggles.  We're all a work in progress but it seems weird that Wade would go there given the situation with his kid. Until I hear otherwise Wade is kinda an asshole. IT and Crowder get a slight pass because they were traded and obviously didn't want to be in Cleveland but Wade and Rose chose to sign and then bailed almost immediately.
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
Kevin love
I don't think I have seen Kevin Love play a game since LeBron left  does he even exist anymore or is he just an AI generated hologram that we only see during mental health interviews and Banana Republic print ads?
"Your cesspool fanbase takes anything said about Curry that isn't slobbering all over his nuts as an insult, it's pretty funny.  I'm saying that he played with KD, who was arguably the best player in the NBA, so the stat is less impressive. If LeBron did this while his best teammate was Kevin Love it would be different. Fans are always going to be able to say this about both Curry and KD, and that's not Curry's fault at all, but it is what it is."
"Lebron had to have Chris Bosh, and Dwayne wade then he went back to Cleveland for kyrie and Kevin love and shit JR smith lol. Now he’s with a top 5 player AD  You just mad the warriors naturally drafted Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond &amp; now Wiseman ;)"
From what I've heard there's a good chance we get Sexland back for the Bucks game. Kevin Love is going to take longer to return
"Overcompensated for fucking up the Kevin love contract .    Maybe we'll get it right one of these decades, if we still exist that is"
how about kevin love and chris bosh
I love Kevin Hart. Man is a fucking worker and even this segment gets the full treatment. Like there was joke after joke after joke in his bit ... while Kenny has to default to some lame height joke.
"Blake looks so old out there. It sucks to see because he isn't. A Stretch 4 at this point, looks like Kevin Love with muscles."
Kevin Love at UCLA 🙄 not even an all star
What is wrong with you people? The WNBA loses all of $10 million per year. That’s 1/3 of an old-ass Kevin Love. A single Plumlee brother. It’s literally *nothing* for the NBA. They fund it because it’s a league they think has the possibility to grow. Your ire for a league that doesn’t even remotely affect you is clearly just misogyny.
"Hell, only player who’d be traded for him would be Kevin Love... and they’re both injured to hell and back."
"Honestly, this supports my theory on big numbers on a bad team.  A lot of “stars” on bad teams who go to good teams and don’t produce the same might only be role players.  Like Jerami looks like a star but on good teams he’s a very decent role player.  No one expects him to lead a team but he’s putting up huge numbers.  So those guys putting up big numbers who never been on a winning team, they might not be the guy to lead the team, just a role player.  No offense but I mean guys like Wiggins, Boogie, Kevin Love, etc..."
Collin's ankle has been bothering him so I assume he's day to day. Garland is supposed to be reevaluated in a few days. Kevin Love is somewhere else living his best life.
"You’re not hearing what I’m saying.  The Rockets’ offensive system *is* James Harden, as the ‘18 Cavs offense was LeBron, the 80s Lakers were Magic, etc. When you’re a ball handler at that level when the game gets that slow, you get to making a lot more of the decisions down the stretch especially without the second ball handler in Paul. It’s neither here nor there that the 0-27 was dispersed among 5 different guys. The offense was designed and executed to generate those looks, but to get over the hump when it’s a really close series you have to have the ability to transcend the schematic design, and he didn’t. Whether he couldn’t or didn’t is a conversation to be had, but I genuinely don’t understand why that admission and that fact is so hard to get through.  Steph gets shit on for not being able to get by Kevin Love in game 7 of the ‘16 finals and for their offense not scoring a bucket the last 6 minutes of that game, it’s an identical concept."
"1.) “*I’m ready, I’m coming back. I’m back with my trainer that I had in my* ***MVP season****, I’m back with him. I get a summer to train to work on my game going into the season. I’m locked in like as locked in as you can be and I’m motivated.”*    **“I’m on Motherf\*\*ker’s A\*\*es”**  Actually has no MVP ever...  2.) When asked about Denver Nuggets, he said Clippers were in the driver seat  Proceeds to get eliminated  3.) Double taking about the championship or bust:  **Paul George says it's championship or bust season for Clippers: ""Immediately, we expected to come in and win it all.""**  4.) Posts on Instagram about how he doesn't give a fuck about what people think etc. But keeps comments moderated. Hilarious.   5.) Then of course throw in his whole iblamedocnotusingmeproperlyetc + dame comments + locker room chemistry etc.   Stuff like this makes me question if he actually has depression. It feels fake unlike other athletes like Kevin Love. But if he actually does have depression I hope he gets treatment."
a mcflurry could at least maybe make kevin love fat enough that he's an all star again
"Dude threw outlet passes to LeBron for like 4 years that did nothing but benefit the team. Kevin Love is a lot of things, but he's not a stat padder. He also willingly accepted the third banana role on Cleveland during that time and learned how to play on the wing. GTFOH."
Kristaps made of glass. Kevin Love vibes
"Kevin love and Demar Derozen spoke on anxiety and depression way before PG did... neither has an issue w/ guys talking shit... It's because of PG's ego, stop using mental health as a crutch"
Just a few weeks ago there were a large amount of people saying a washed up Kevin Love is better than Tobias. Just ridiculous
I don't know why you think Kevin Love doesn't get shit talked on the court
"This is what kills me here. Trash talking on the court is not an attack on your mental health. Especially when he starts that shit half the time (see PG's ""You getting sent home this year"" comments). I'm so glad people are opening up about this, huge shout-out to Kevin Love, KAT, and PG all, but trash talk between competitors does not mean the NBA is failing in focusing on player mental health."
Lulz Kyrie is weird and LeBron gave Kevin Love depression 🤓
Kevin Love takes it
"when the pacers had a first round exit to a cavaliers team that was significantly worse than from the previous year when they had kyrie irving and a healthy kevin love? that team was taken to seven games by a kyrie-less celtics, and then got swept in the nba finals. i don’t see the overachievement here tbh"
Kevin Love aint out there trash talking people lmao.   PG wants to trash talk others and then use mental health as a way to avoid getting trash talked himself. I'm glad players around the league are going at him.
"comments in this thread are exactly why people suffer in silence, y'all would be crying if this was Kevin Love."
People on here would cry themselves to sleep if this were Kevin Love instead of PG
Or Kevin Love when he was white
Or Kevin Love when he was chubby
I'd like to see a Kevin Love for Blake Griffin swap. Not sure if it helps either team but just to shake things up.
"Terrence Ross on Magic, Murray on Nuggets, Klay, Wiggins (I still believe in him - especially if vs OKC), DLo, PG13, Tatum or Brown (if one is injured and they get a bunch of shots), Jimmy Butler (man scored 40+ in the finals), Westbrook, Embiid, Seth Curry, Kevin Love (hot take but if healthy sure), fucking Austin Rivers, John Wall ( I’m still a believer), Donavan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams"
Trade Kevin love for Wiggins
"PF-Centers that come to mind, whether starting at one and transitioning to the other at different stages of career/roster/or even mid-game: Channing Frye, Al Horford, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Domantas Sabonis,  LaMarcus Aldridge, even Giannis plays a fair bit at 4/5...Porzingis as well has that flexibility.   Are PFs really getting smaller/faster/more skilled more so than any other position, or is that just happening more pronouncedly at the 4/5, where there was the most room for improvement? It'd probably be fairer to say there has just been an overall blurring of the lines between roles rather than focusing on just the meta changes at the PF"
"Off hand : Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Gary Harris, D’Angelo Russell,"
"Rose is tough because of his injury. If he gets in it’s a sympathy vote. I think he’s going to make it, but that’s a special case.   Butler needs a couple more nods, but he’s 4 years younger and it seems very likely he’ll get them, imo he’s better than Aldridge.  I also just think Lowry is better than Aldridge. Both of them have shown to be playoff team leaders, and perimeter players/defenders are just more valuable than people like Aldridge who can’t really guard the paint but also can get turned around.   I’ll be honest, I forget Kevin love exists. I think he’s about the same tier as Aldridge in terms of skill"
"Wall, Wiggins and Gobert are in the top 3.  Last 2 spots are between Tobias Harris, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Horford, Hayward and Klay. Tough call, guess I'd probably go Harris and Westbrook, even though Harris is playing way over his head at the moment."
Kevin Love. Dude never plays.
"Russ, Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Porzingis (if he can't stay healthy) and (gulp) Kemba Walker (also if he can't stay healthy)"
"I was just saying this in another thread how Portland needs to shake up their frontline.  I more realistic option, if he has anything left in the tank, would be a Kevin Love type player, particularly if they can keep Nurkic at center as well."
Kevin Love is pretty good in the post but I guess he isn't playing much lately
Similar to Kevin Love back in 2014
I *like* the Blazers team quite a bit but I think they are either one move away from Finals contenders or Nurkic needs to take a big step up this year (and he's looked better as the season's gone on) as I think their front line is their weak spot.  A Kevin Love type PF would be perfect for them.
"You're talking about lebron. A guy who attacked morey for his hong kong comments, threw Kevin love publicly under the bus, got all his teammates traded in a long public saga. Someone who has one of the fakest personas in the league lmao"
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
LeBron vs Pacers in 2018: 34.4/10/7.7 55% from the field 35% from 3 and 82% from the line   2nd best teammate was Kevin Love with 11.4 points
"Because it's just as ridiculous and insulting to suggest that it's black and white that one was the beneficiary of help while the other was the architect of their own success. Both are legendary players with incredible propaganda behind them and the beneficiaries of great FO (like literally all great players) yet people are trying to pretend they are any different in how they approached the game.  The way 2016 is talked about you'd think Lebron carried G Leaguers who shot 2% from 3 to the title and not had an incredible team loaded with shooters with an amazing scorer in Kyrie Irving who were favourites over literally the exact same team the year before. You'd really think Lebron was ""coming home"" rather than going to a team with 3 no.1 picks, 2 top players in Kevin Love and Kyrie guaranteed to join at the time, and a FO willing to do whatever it took to get the exact roster construction Lebron wanted.  The Heatles (along with the recent warriors teams) are literally the definition of stacking the deck as much as you can and yet the mental gymnastics people do to say Lebron didn't do anything remotely similar to what KD did are are frankly hilarious. The only major difference worth criticizing more for KD is one joined the team that beat him but in both cases the anticompetitive undertones of their moves are exactly the same. Yet they'll actually portray it in retrospect as if Lebron was ""wronged"" this whole time.  You'd really think the Lakers management didn't get him Anthony Davis, and pulled out ALL the stops to try and get fucking Kawhi to join them as well while loading the team with quality players championship calibre players like Gasol and Green. But sure, Lebron had ""no help"".  It's frankly insane, people here are complaining about how biased the last dance is, which it is of course, it's a) a documentary, and b) storytelling. They're all biased. But then turn around and preach about how Lebron always got the short end of the stick in his NBA career from roster construction and created his own success so much more than Jordan did. When the Lebron documentary inevitably drops, it will be just as biased.  Go on, downvote me. I have karma to spare. But deep down y'all know."
But that trade is why LeBron had George Hill and whatever was left of Kevin Love as his #2 and #3.   Still made the finals.   Same east y'all lil soon to be 3x mvp can't get to one finals in 🤷🏾‍♂️
"Less successful?? He's won championships with 3 organizations, brought 5 different head coaches to the finals while Jordan couldn't even get the wizards to the playoffs in the most watered down east we've ever seen.  He's less successful because he lost to a spurs and warriors dynasty with Kevin Love + George Hill and Zadrynas Illgaskus + Boobie Gibson?? Jordan never played in a single finals game without Jackson AND Pippen.  Jordan is probably more successful, if you only look at success as being able to win when you have a HOF head coach and a HOF wing along side you for 6 years 🤷🏾‍♂️"
Kevin Love is also extremely ✨ unproblematic ✨
"Not sure, but Kevin Love has the same thing, and he’s missing a month+."
"I'm 100% sure there was tension between him and David Blatt and then whatever lead to the JR Smith Soup Throwing Incident. His Cleveland tenure was nothing but drama too, particularly with Love and Kyrie (remember the Arthur fist emoji? or the Kevin Love isn't in the IG picture scandal?)"
It means I’m biased but also informed; Kevin love himself said if there was friction between him and wade that he didn’t notice.
Wade and Crowder were the guys who allegedly called out Kevin Love for leaving a game due to a panic attack and said he was faking it. Totally understandable why we would want to ship them out after that.
"Al Horford, Blake Griffin and Kevin Love"
"Timberwolves and big men .  Literally the only thing that we can hang our hat on.  Laettner,  KG, Kevin Love, KAT"
"😂 The comments though:  &gt;I can't tell you how many times I've thought to myself ""If only I could smell more like Kevin Love""  EDIT: Also, Love looks eerily similar to Tom Brady in profile."
"I would think you, of all people, would be a little more sensitive, chubby Kevin Love."
"Didn’t he say he wanted to retire in Brooklyn, that it was his last stop? Or did I make that up?  It’s probably Brooklyn, though I’d love to see his career make things right with OKC  Yep: https://www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2020/10/9/21509142/kevin-durant-on-whether-he-wants-to-retire-a-net-as-of-today-this-second-yes  He says “as of this second, yes”. Obviously that could change"
"“I miss the old days when guys like Bird, Stockton, Halvelchek, Price had more class. Stars like Lebron and Harden show no respect while guys like Kevin love and Luka do.”"
But then he dunked on some dude in Summer League and we were able to flip him and Wiggins for Kevin Love. I’d say it worked out nicely
lebron made kevin love depressed too right?
Kevin Love for Doncic? Cavs hang up
"&gt; He's out Chris Bosh/Kevin Love.  I think he's more of a Paul Pierce guy for us (not as good but similar role). Honestly at least so far, our starters kind of line up a bit with the Doc Rivers Celtics  Simmons - Rondo (good passers and defenders with poor shooting)  Ray Allen - Seth Curry (elite shooting)  Tobias - Paul Pierce (well-rounded forward who can create his own shot when the offense isn't clicking as a team)  Embiid - KG (Paint monster on both ends)  Danny Green - James Posey (total 3&amp;D with probably better defense than shooting)  ______________  Now I'm not saying these players are on the same levels or are identical, but it is funny how there are some striking similarities just in terms of player archetype lol"
"Kevin Love and not playing, name a better duo"
besides Kevin “Gary Payton” Love
Only kevin love :/
Kevin Love.
"I've been saying this, if Tobi keeps it up, we're elite.  Joel will get his. Ben is more hit or miss, but his size and speed will always put pressure on the defense and his D is always all-NBA. If Tobi is also cooking, teams will crack. It's just too many angles of attack. He's out Chris Bosh/Kevin Love. The third guy who makes the whole thing go when he's on."
"Yeah, I definitely wish that we have more players available for the next game, our depth chart is looking rough:   &amp;nbsp;  [](/CLE)Cavs|**Starter**|**2nd**|**3rd**|**4th**|**5th**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |PG|~~Darius Garland~~ |~~Dante Exum~~|~~Matthew Dellavedova~~|Collin Sexton|-| |SG|Collin Sexton|~~Dylan Windler~~ |Damyean Dotson|~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |SF|~~Isaac Okoro~~ |~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~|Cedi Osman|~~Dylan Windler~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |PF|~~Kevin Love~~ |Larry Nance Jr.|Cedi Osman|~~Isaac Okoro~~|Dean Wade| |C|Andre Drummond|Larry Nance Jr.|JaVale McGee|~~Kevin Love~~|Thon Maker|   Also, unrelated, but Cole Anthony looked pretty good in there tonight for Orlando."
"I think they're good but keep in mind we didn't have Garland, Love, Okoro, Kevin Porter Jr, Exum, Windler, Delly in this game.  It was Collin and Cedi against the magic with Drummond trying his best to lose it for us and JB calling plays for him instead of the guy that went for 24 on 52% shooting."

"&gt;	But let’s not pretend he didn’t have help during his championship years. Anthony Davis is by far the best teammate either LBJ or MJ has played with ever. Vogel is a very good defensive coach.  Nobody is saying you can’t have help, I’m saying that MJ didn’t do much of anything without help or a HOF head coach meanwhile lebron took two different Cavs teams that didn’t belong in the finals to the finals, in addition to being the best player on a finals team for three different franchises. MJ has only won championships with one team, one coach and one #2, lebron has made it work with Kyrie, Wade + Bosh and with AD. MJ has only won with Pippen and Jackson, and when he didn’t have either, he didnt do much and he couldn’t even get the Wizards to the 8th seed in the most watered down version of the East we’ve seen over the last 25 years.  He’s proven to be a very successful Chicago bulls player when they have Pippen and Jackson. Lebron has won with many different combinations of players and coaches and has won 3 finals MVPs with 3 different franchises. They’re incomparable imo, once Lebron did it for a third time they became incomparable.   LeBron is the system, he’s the element that has found a way no matter who you put next to him or who coached him. Jordan won when you gave him a Pippen and a Jackson and when he didn’t have that, he was getting bounced in the first round. Lebron made the finals with Kevin Love and George Hill and Larry Hughes and 90 year old llgalskus.  Jordan is one of the greatest players of all time, but you cannot be the GOAT when you’ve only been successful with one set of circumstances. Lebron doesn’t need a triangle or a HOF coach, give him a great #2 and he’ll find a way to win. Give him a mediocre roster and a mediocre coach and he’ll still make it there, unfortunately for him he ran into the spurs and warriors dynasties when he lots with those rosters.   You can’t compare Jordan to LeBron, that argument ended last season. LeBron is the greatest player of all time because he will find a way to make it work, he is the system. The greatest player of all time cannot only be successful under one set of circumstances in one conference. Lebron has won in both, with 3 teams now, with 3 different #2s, with 3 different coaches. Compare MJ to Duncan and KAJ, players that always had perfect circumstances."
Didn’t kevin love do that shit all the time?
"&gt; racism no doubt plays a role. Most of the players are black.  I don't see any hesitation to call white players overpaid as well - eg, Chandler Parsons, Kevin Love, Steven Adams, Mason Plumlee. Ask Celtics fans if they think Gordon Hayward's salary was worth it, or Lakers fans if they think Mozgov was overpaid.   It's just natural that in a league where most of the players are black, most of the overpaid players will also be black.   In the NFL, most of the overpaid QBs are white, and most of the overpaid WRs or CBs are black. That's because most of the total QBs are white, and most of the total WRs and CBs are black."
Tell that to Kevin Love and Chris Bosh. They were forced to become catch and shoot players because Bron needs the lane clear to drive. These were two of the best PFs in the league before teaming up with bron
"I should hope so. Calling Kevin Love, Kyrie, etc a bad team would be a hilariously bad take"
"Kevin Love was either injured or shit the entire 2017-18 season. On top of that, he had to play center due to TT injury &amp; regression + poor roster construction. He had one good series and that was the stomping of Toronto."
Kevin Love was literally an All Star in 2018.
Kevin Love was far removed from all star form
The same kevin love whose stats were identical last season and the Cavs ended up being one of the worst teams in the NBA?
"Where's the lie tho?  It's cute what Jordan did, he had the perfect situation when they gave him scottie and Phil, but when you removed either of those elements and look at his career.....lot of cute stats, no team success.   Lebron brought George Hill, Crowder and Kevin Love to the finals. He brought Ben Wallace and Larry Hughes to a finals. Too bad he ran into the Spurs and Warriors dynasties both times. Has Jordan player a single conference final game without scottie or Jackson?"
"Friendly reminder that Michael Jordan only really only had success in the league with one head coach while lebron literally brought 5 different head coaches to the finals. Jordan couldn't do it when you have him Doug Collins. You probably can't even remember all the head coaches Lebron brought there.   MJ was a great player, but he's no GOAT. He's the goat if you have Phil Jackson and Scottie Pippen with him, a perfect situation. But if you have Crowder, George Hill and Kevin Love, he probably wouldn't get very far.   Jordan did a great job within a certain system, with certain guys around him. LeBron james is the system. He doesn't need X coach or X superstar to make a finals, his legacy is him dragging teams that had no business reaching the finals to the finals."
Kevin Love really with some top tier bench reactions.
Kevin love came in his pants on the bench
when did Nance become Kevin Love?
He's a positive impact player but for a max contract I agree tbh. He goes into the category of good players who you don't want on a contender alongside kevin love and derozan
Darius Garland with his dad Kevin Love celebrating on the sideline
Kevin love look like he ages 10 years in 2
Awww Kevin love is like their dad lol
"To be fair, Kevin Love is a bitch."
Has Kevin Love played basketball in the last 3 years? He's forever in street clothes on the bench.
Imagine this Cavs team with a star like Kevin Love.
They said lebron turned Kevin love and chris bosh into spot up shooters.  The Nets went further and tried to turn DeAndre Jordan into a spot up shooter.
"Kevin Love is just spending the rest of his career always injured and talking about mental health, huh?"
Of course Kevin Love is injured for this game. Fucking nba
"People have called Kevin Love and KAT empty stats players, but Al was what an empty stats guy really is ."
"Garland is out so just Sexton coming back, sad.  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (6-7) | [](/BKN)Nets (9-6) ---|--- C.

"(From Oregon) Maybe I’m too young, but Kevin Love seems better than AC Green"
"Kevin Love was great next to LBJ, blasphemy to put him next to Clarkson haha! I agree they're much more evenly matched, still think people are so goddamn in denial about how good KD is and what he can do. Not saying its an easy Nets win or anything but also definitely not Lakers in 5."
"LBJ was playing with Jordan Clarkson and Kevin Love. Definitely not calling anything, but their teams are a bit more evenly matched these days to say the least."
The Kevin Love Special
"Kevin Love wasn’t even on the Cavs when lebron came back, they traded Wiggins for him (likely because lebron came back)  The Heat were getting worse and worse, the team around him was awful in the 2014 finals."
Kevin love not being all time is disrespectful
Pretty sure Klay Thompson and Kevin Love were born in Oregon.
"TIL Kevin Love wasn't born in Oregon. Graduated from Lake Oswego high school near Portland, OR, but I guess he's just another one of the many cali transplants in our state."
I’ll take Kevin Love over AC Green
Not Kevin Love for Oregon?
"I'd probably go Kevin Love for Oregon active, but this is a good list. Super interesting, thanks for posting"
Oregon should probably (unfortunately) have Kevin Love as its best player. He's from Lake Oswego.
"These lists are dumb. Kevin Love is the answer to both questions, doesn't matter what hospital he was born in."
"Every star Harden has ever played with is the washed up version of themselves. He’s never had Kyrie entering his prime, Kevin Love in his prime, Chris Bosh in his prime, or AD in his prime. Lol.   He’s consistently had mediocre rosters. Jason Terry at the starting guard. Joey Dorsey starting at center. Chandler Parson’s decrepit knees. Playing with stars that are injured half the season (Dwight/CP3/Westbrook). His best squad was by far the 2017/18 run and even then CP3 missed significant time"
"Kevin Love is def the GOAT for Oregon. AC Green's streak is amazing and he was on some incredible teams, but Love is unquestionably the better player."
Was going to say Kevin Love as an Oregon option but I guess he wasn't born here.
"How are you gonna say Damontas Sabonis is better than Kevin Love from Oregon?  Love has averaged 18/11 in his career, 5 time all star and NBA Champ."
"Was surprised that Kevin love didn't make the list for oregon, considering he's a champion and multi time all star"
Because Kevin Love didnt say he had depression then proceed to talk shit about other teams and players
"Yep.  The ""lean"" as it is called, I think it was Kevin Love that popularized it &amp; had harsh words for old-school shooting coaches who over-prioritized squaring your feet up."
Kevin Love. I have always thought since Cleveland that he is a top end role player and not a star.
"You guys got lucky in 2015 that Kyrie and Kevin Love were out, lost in 2016, and only won in '17 and '18 cause KD joined y'all."
"&gt; If I was Kevin Durant I wouldn't listen to Steve Kerr either. &gt; Kerr is going to have a bizarre coaching legacy once all is said and done. &gt; 3 NBA Championships in his first 5 seasons and never makes it out of the first round of the playoffs after that.  I copy-pasted it here as well in case the fucker tries to delete it. Love ya /u/bonerang, let the record show that you wrote this comment :)"
"The first step unfortunately, because I think it is admitting failure on a valiant cause of trying to save the kid, is to trade Kevin Porter Jr. I thought the situation was being handled remarkably well by Coach Bickerstaff et al until he set the whole thing back with his tantrum  SexLand™️, Okoro, Allen, Delly, and Nance are non-negotiable for me. Larry in part because he is one of us, born and raised on the shores of Lake Erie. Id also like to see Windler remain a part of the rebuild and Love to come back for the title run in 2024"
Sources tell me that the Cavs are signing Len to play PG.      Cavs starting lineup:  PG: Alex Len  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Javale Mcgee  C: Andre Drummond
Kevin Love would've stopped that real quick.
Hes on that Kevin Love cycle now unfortunately.  Pretty much impossible to get out now being on the wrong side of 30
Kevin love Lite
"he owes his teammates/coach an explanation, he doesn't owe the fuccbois on /nba shit, man was going through some personal shit, and felt he needed to step away for a bit, for all the BS the bullshit this sub talks about mental health(kevin love situation) and self care, they sure do like bashing people for actually following through, and doing whats best for their mental health and family needs."
"Something I was thinking about was how everyone says the league is downsizing, but it's not centers who are dying out, regardless of what Shaq might say. It's the traditional power forward. If you're big enough, you just slide over to center (Derrick Favors), or play both positions (Anthony Davis). If you're not big enough to play center, then you need to expand your game, most notably with a three-point shot, which Blake, Paul Millsap, and Kevin Love have done in recent years.  Griffin had the ball-handling and passing skills, but he's needed to add the 3 to make up for the changing league, and his body deteriorating.   There aren't a lot of Horace Grant, Brian Grant, Charles Oakley type PFs in today's league. Most PFs are big wings, and/or have a more perimeter-oriented skill set."
"&gt; There’s no amount of skill that can keep you from becoming washed if your back hurts so bad you can’t sprint.  This is why Kevin Love is done. You don't need to see the stats, you just need to watch him try to run up and down the court."
"Harden &amp; KD are matching each other’s energy well, but they played together already so that was expected. Adding in Kyrie is a question mark for chemistry, because how do you keep 3 ball dominant players happy?  When you look at most Big 3s the 3rd star is usually complimentary, and not a ball handler. Think Rodman, Ray Allen on the Celtics, Klay, Bosh, even Kevin Love and the list goes on.  For this team who is going to be the guy that’s ok to limit their touches? Consensus would make Kyrie the odd man out, and strictly basketball wise, he’s the least likely to accept or be happy in that role. After all, he wanted out of Cleveland citing he wanted to lead a team."
I think they'll make it work. But the argument is that someone is likely going to be the Chris Bosh/Kevin Love
"&gt;You make an implication about mental health by bring Kevin Love into the discussion,  I didn't bring Love into the discussion.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;then you act snarky all over this thread claiming ""strawman""  Because it is infact a strawman? Do you think you're making some kind of point right now? Being snarky does not equal being wrong.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You look like an idiot.  Seems like I've struck a cord. Feel free to tell me what exactly you think I'm wrong about and we can talk about it. If not I'm not too interested in your personal feelings about me."
"Nope, still on the same point. Nice try bud.  Kyrie does something shitty, makes some vague and stupid statement that doesn't properly explain anything, and people let him off the hook because of ""mental health"". The actual fallacy is the whataboutism in comparing it to Kevin Love, who has an entirely different history. Yes, newsflash, typically people's actions are judged partially within the context of their past actions."
"LMAO you don’t even know people’s race on this sub. I thought you were saying OP is salty about Kyrie or the Nets or just singling him out because of his superstardom. Kevin Love helped bring a title to the city of Cleveland, Paul George plays for a team nobody wants"
"&gt; Kevin Love didn’t refuse to play while dealing with his mental health issues  Uhh... Sorta? We just dealt with it pretty stealthily but he did even leave a game in the middle of it and we just didn't make a big deal about it and just wished for the best, no abundance of speculation posts or articles at the time. And I say ""sorta"" because it was not like he refused to do something, his mind was just not right there, which can happen with depression/panic attacks."
you’re sure that’s the only reason? what about pg then? he didn’t receive the same support as kevin love either. there’s a lot of casual racism on this sub
"Kevin Love didn’t refuse to play while dealing with his mental health issues, that’s why the reaction is different"
No I wouldn't since Kevin Love never went maskless to a party dancing and singing all night w 40+ people
Kevin Love doesn't have a precedent of acting like he's better than other people.
"that would almost be a ""lebron gave kevin love depression"" level take"
Same people dunking on him will applaud Kevin love for talking about depression (rightfully so)
"I remember the game Oladipo was in foul trouble, one of those fouls was an absolute BS call on a Kevin Love pump fake ""jump into the defender"" thing"
"&gt; Lebron was not the first player to request a trade lmao  He didn't even request a trade, did he?  The move he should get credit for is signing the short deals with the Cavs to leverage them into mortgaging their future - trading for Kevin Love, big extensions for TT, JR, etc. - and then leaving to not deal with the aftermath."
I GOT THAT SHIT GET OUTTA HERE KEVIN LOVE
The biggest dumbest comment was yours above comparing him to Kevin Love. Delete your account.
"Kevin Love didnt hide his issues? Wtf he was one of the first to talk about his mental health issues. Kevin Love gets credit for staying professional despite his mental health and Kyrie if he has mental health issues is catching flak for being unprofessional, mercurial and a history of cringy comments"
"He obviously has issues going on.  This sub is so quick to put players like Kevin Love, who hide their issues well, on a pedestal, but when kyrie shows the first sign of it in public he's ""lazy"" or ""entitled"""
also the corpse of Kevin Love ?
I imagine that things may have been extra tough for Kevin Love from a mental-health standpoint
&gt;Jaren plays on the perimeter / outside the paint throughout the game.  Porzingis shoots more three's than Jaren and has a trb% that is over 50% more than Jaren's. This is even while playing with Luka who gobbles up a ton of the uncontested rebounds. Kevin Love has had years he shoot as many 3's as Jaren and he still rebounded a ton. I can't even find another bigman that had the trb% that Jaren had last year that ever made it big in the NBA. All the bigman outrebound him whether they are a static traditional bigman or a perimeter. You can say whatever you want to say but you really said that the reason Jaren has 8.5 trb% is because he plays at the perimeter. He is tall and can shoot the 3 but since he is terrible defensively and can't rebound he is not a unicorn. If being tall and shooting the 3 was enough then Steve Novak and Andrea Bargnani would also be unicorns.
Deep down I'm sure Wiggins would have had a very different career if he was never traded for Kevin love. I swear he just gave up on his potential.
"KAT i can see for sure.  D lo is one of those guys who you try to trade and find out theres not much of a market and so you just keep him around, like Kevin love in Cleveland"
take kevin love as an example
"Lmao Kyrie won't just revert into some Kevin Love spot up corner shooter, you know. He's got to have the ball in his hands."
"Kevin Love isn’t that good, but his depression seems well controlled or at least he seems in control even when he is depressed."
I really hope people think about this more. I 1000% agree with you. He is screaming for help at this point. I really wonder why Kevin Love hasn't reached out to him...
"Kevin Porter Jr. and Kevin Love for Kyrie Irving really makes sense. With this trade, they only need another Kevin to surround James. Nets goal has always been to surround James Harden with Kevins."
"You're not getting bailed out that easily.   Besides, Kevin Love could be gone in a second if the Cavs realised that no one is actually going to give up assets for him, and they'd be better off just giving him away for nothing."
"I bought a LeBron Cavs jersey and he was traded within a week. I have a LeBron/Irving/Love Cavs shirt and now 2/3 are gone, I bought a Kareem Hunt Chiefs jersey, and I bought a rookie Kevin Porter Jr Cavs jersey. I'm done buying team apparel unless I want to curse somebody"
"Nah sick reference dude, his dad was murdered when he was a kid and you were SO READY with your hilarious joke about it!  Fuck that loser for humanizing this guy and having empathy for someone who's had a difficult and traumatic life, perhaps explaining some of his behavioral problems - we have dead horses to beat for 20 upvotes!  I'll catch you in the next thread where you applaud Kevin Love because you have self diagnosed depression."
"Full Text for people who can't access the article:  &gt;**Houston, Seattle Feels Your Loss**  &gt;*With whipsawing trades and other player movement routine in the N.B.A. these days, it’s hard to be loyal to teams and players.*  &gt;SEATTLE — If you’re a fan of the Seattle SuperSonics, jilted long ago despite decades of loyal love, you’re seriously happy for the last great talent from your team.  &gt;That would be Kevin Durant.  &gt;After a year spent rehabilitating a torn Achilles’ tendon, Durant now seems to be living his best life in Brooklyn as the leader of the Nets. His odds of winning a third N.B.A. title received a significant boost when a blockbuster trade reunited him this week with James Harden, his close friend and former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate.  &gt;Durant, Harden and Kyrie Irving on the same team? Scintillating, so long as they end up on the same page.  &gt;But if you’re a die-hard Sonics fan — and yes, count me in that group — the happiness felt for one of basketball’s transcendent superstars comes with a flip side.  &gt;We see Durant and are forced to reckon with all the unfulfilled possibilities.  &gt;Recall that the slim, do-everything forward spent his rookie season in Seattle. He was only 19, but he led the team through a dreary and uncertain 2007-08 season. He wasn’t just good, he was prodigiously good; so full of talent and joy that watching him made the doomsday talk of the Sonics’ possible relocation drift away.  &gt;Then reality hit. April 13, 2008. The last game played at the old KeyArena: a win sealed by a Durant jump shot.  &gt;Soon the team moved to Oklahoma City, where it began anew as the Thunder. (Pardon the crankiness, but they’ll always be the Tumbleweeds to me.)  &gt;It’s been 12 years, but the stinging questions remain.  &gt;What would have happened to Durant and our team if the Sonics had never left?  &gt;And how much should fans expect their devotion to be mirrored by professional sports leagues, team ownership and the players we most admire?  &gt;I’m typical of many in Seattle. The Sonics will always be in my blood. I’m comfortably middle-aged, but I can close my eyes and remember my first N.B.A. game: the bright colors and sharp sounds and even the smells of buttered popcorn and roasted peanuts in the old coliseum nestled near the Space Needle.  &gt;I was 6, and the Sonics were playing Jerry Sloan and the Chicago Bulls. I can still feel my father’s humongous hands as he led me to our seats.  &gt;A few years later, when my parents divorced, my father kept our connection close through the Sonics. We went to dozens of games, seated almost always near the rafters. We saw Julius Erving’s first appearance in Seattle — all that grace and power and coolness.  &gt;We were there in 1978 when the Sonics lost to the Washington Bullets in the N.B.A. finals.  &gt;In 1979, we watched Gus Williams, Jack Sikma, Dennis Johnson and my dad’s friend Downtown Freddie Brown as the team won its only league championship.  &gt;Years later, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton formed a powerful, legendary duo, but our hearts were always with those 1970s teams.  &gt;One more memory, this one bittersweet. When my father was dying, far too early at age 75, we rode together in an ambulance to a nearby hospice. I held his hand again as he spoke of our most cherished times. “The Sonics,” he said. Then he recalled, one last time, the glorious, arcing accuracy of Fred Brown’s jump shot.  &gt;That’s love.  &gt;I know I’m hardly alone. We bond over teams, over remarkable wins and searing losses and athletes who remain ever young in our mind’s eye.  &gt;Fans all over the country, who root for all kinds of teams and players, know that love. It is steadfast, faithful and rooted deep into our souls.  &gt;We also know the risk. There are no guarantees that devotion will be rewarded with loyalty in return. (Just ask the Houston fans who have stood behind Harden since 2012.)  &gt;Two years after my father’s death, the Midwestern ownership group that had bought the Sonics moved Seattle’s first big-time professional sports team of the modern era to Oklahoma.  &gt;The fact that the team had been a vital part of one of America’s greatest cities for 41 years did not matter. Nor did the fact that Seattle was known to have one of the most passionate fan bases in sports.  &gt;Nothing mattered but the bottom line. The N.B.A. wanted a fancy new stadium, and taxpayer money to fund a big chunk of it. Seattle’s political leaders balked. There was no compromise.  &gt;The city lost the Sonics and the one player everyone imagined as a franchise cornerstone. The one player who could have brought another title and forged more remarkable seasons, maybe for a decade or longer.  &gt;We have never relinquished our passion for Durant. He matured during an era of constant player movement that seemed to be foretold by the uprooting of the Sonics. He came to personify the modern superstar. He bounced from team to team to team, winning an M.V.P. and world titles and never quite content in one place. But to us he’s still the wide-eyed teen who conjured our last flash of basketball brilliance. We can’t let go.  &gt;It helped that he never forgot the city that birthed his N.B.A. career. When his Golden State Warriors came to Seattle for an exhibition in 2018, he wore a vintage Shawn Kemp jersey and gave the sold-out crowd all they could ever want to hear. “I know it’s been a rough 10 years,” he said. “The N.B.A. is back in Seattle for tonight, but hopefully it is back forever soon!”  &gt;Will that ever happen? To pine for it is to be whipsawed between hope and despair.  &gt;Whenever N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver utters a single sentence that could be divined as giving a nod toward the Sonics’ return — as he did recently when he spoke of league expansion as “Manifest Destiny” and gave a tip of the hat toward Seattle — the local news goes into overdrive with stories about a possible return.  &gt;Contractors are rebuilding the old KeyArena, soon the home of the N.H.L.’s Seattle Kraken, an expansion team. They have gutted the old structure. Close to $1 billion will go toward increasing its size and prepping it for multiple sports — pro basketball included. The whole endeavor is led by Tim and Tod Leiweke, brothers connected to the N.B.A. and Silver for decades who make no secret of their desire to have an expansion team playing in their gleaming new edifice.  &gt;Does all this mean the Sonics are coming soon? Maybe. But then again, maybe not.  &gt;So Sonics fans keep holding tight to the one last superstar to have played for our team.  &gt;He’s doing his thing in Brooklyn now.  &gt;And we’re still dreaming of the future.  &gt;I can see it now, in two years or maybe five, the SuperSonics back at long last. The first big free-agent signed to herald their return? Kevin Durant.  &gt;Sorry Brooklyn, there’s no such thing as loyalty in the N.B.A., but at least you would still have your team."
It's only mental health awareness when it's about players that look like me! (Kevin Love 😄😀😃)
"Westbrook chasing triple doubles is such a bullshit narrative. Unless you have Jokic, Kevin Love, etc throwing the outlet pass to him, having Adams boxing out and Westbrook grabbing the rebound and starting a fast break is good scheme."
Can we get a save Kevin Love movement going? Please?

And how much should fans expect their devotion to be mirrored by professional sports leagues, team ownership and the players we most admire?  I’m typical of many in Seattle. The Sonics will always be in my blood. I’m comfortably middle-aged, but I can close my eyes and remember my first N.B.A. game: the bright colors and sharp sounds and even the smells of buttered popcorn and roasted peanuts in the old coliseum nestled near the Space Needle. Rory Smith On Soccer: Our correspondent covers the tactics, history and personalities of the world’s most popular sport.  I was 6, and the Sonics were playing Jerry Sloan and the Chicago Bulls. I can still feel my father’s humongous hands as he led me to our seats.  A few years later, when my parents divorced, my father kept our connection close through the Sonics. We went to dozens of games, seated almost always near the rafters. We saw Julius Erving’s first appearance in Seattle — all that grace and power and coolness.  We were there in 1978 when the Sonics lost to the Washington Bullets in the N.B.A. finals.  In 1979, we watched Gus Williams, Jack Sikma, Dennis Johnson and my dad’s friend Downtown Freddie Brown as the team won its only league championship.  Years later, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton formed a powerful, legendary duo, but our hearts were always with those 1970s teams.  One more memory, this one bittersweet. When my father was dying, far too early at age 75, we rode together in an ambulance to a nearby hospice. I held his hand again as he spoke of our most cherished times. “The Sonics,” he said. Then he recalled, one last time, the glorious, arcing accuracy of Fred Brown’s jump shot.  That’s love.  I know I’m hardly alone. We bond over teams, over remarkable wins and searing losses and athletes who remain ever young in our mind’s eye.  Fans all over the country, who root for all kinds of teams and players, know that love. It is steadfast, faithful and rooted deep into our souls.  We also know the risk. There are no guarantees that devotion will be rewarded with loyalty in return. (Just ask the Houston fans who have stood behind Harden since 2012.)  Two years after my father’s death, the Midwestern ownership group that had bought the Sonics moved Seattle’s first big-time professional sports team of the modern era to Oklahoma.  The fact that the team had been a vital part of one of America’s greatest cities for 41 years did not matter. Nor did the fact that Seattle was known to have one of the most passionate fan bases in sports.  Nothing mattered but the bottom line. The N.B.A. wanted a fancy new stadium, and taxpayer money to fund a big chunk of it. Seattle’s political leaders balked. There was no compromise.  The city lost the Sonics and the one player everyone imagined as a franchise cornerstone. The one player who could have brought another title and forged more remarkable seasons, maybe for a decade or longer.  We have never relinquished our passion for Durant. He matured during an era of constant player movement that seemed to be foretold by the uprooting of the Sonics. He came to personify the modern superstar. He bounced from team to team to team, winning an M.V.P. and world titles and never quite content in one place. But to us he’s still the wide-eyed teen who conjured our last flash of basketball brilliance. We can’t let go.  It helped that he never forgot the city that birthed his N.B.A. career. When his Golden State Warriors came to Seattle for an exhibition in 2018, he wore a vintage Shawn Kemp jersey and gave the sold-out crowd all they could ever want to hear. “I know it’s been a rough 10 years,” he said. “The N.B.A. is back in Seattle for tonight, but hopefully it is back forever soon!”  Will that ever happen? To pine for it is to be whipsawed between hope and despair.  Whenever N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver utters a single sentence that could be divined as giving a nod toward the Sonics’ return — as he did recently when he spoke of league expansion as “Manifest Destiny” and gave a tip of the hat toward Seattle — the local news goes into overdrive with stories about a possible return.  Contractors are rebuilding the old KeyArena, soon the home of the N.H.L.’s Seattle Kraken, an expansion team. They have gutted the old structure. Close to $1 billion will go toward increasing its size and prepping it for multiple sports — pro basketball included. The whole endeavor is led by Tim and Tod Leiweke, brothers connected to the N.B.A. and Silver for decades who make no secret of their desire to have an expansion team playing in their gleaming new edifice.  Does all this mean the Sonics are coming soon? Maybe. But then again, maybe not.  So Sonics fans keep holding tight to the one last superstar to have played for our team.  He’s doing his thing in Brooklyn now.  And we’re still dreaming of the future.  I can see it now, in two years or maybe five, the SuperSonics back at long last. The first big free-agent signed to herald their return? Kevin Durant.  Sorry Brooklyn, there’s no such thing as loyalty in the N.B.A., but at least you would still have your team.  _Kurt Streeter is the new Sports of The Times columnist. He has been a sports feature writer at The Times since 2017 and previously worked at ESPN and The Los Angeles Times._"
"&gt;But he's always perceived as the studio gangsta who makes empty numbers in bad teams, without trade value...   I've never had this perception of him.  On a good team I don't think he gets as many chances to handle the ball like he does now.  I always thought of him like less athletic LeBron without, shooting, defense, and passing. He's not an empty stats guy a-la Kevin Love...but he he probably tops out as your 3rd or 4th best player on a championship team."
"royce wasn't suspended nor was he fighting anyone. he had anxiety and fear of flying. he should've been more open about it during the draft process but at least he talked about mental disorders so when demar and love admitted they had similar problems people were more open to it. i get why houston fans still dislike the guy, back in the day he came off like some whiny demanding everything guy, but he was nowhere near kevin porter jr in terms of flying off the handle."
Guys LeBron gave Kevin Love depression
"A quick search for the keywords ""Cavs"", ""Love"", ""Sexton"", ""Lue"" from the summer of 2018 yields the following  u/MarcusNotSmart (-107):   &gt; The Cavs legitimately have one of the worst rosters in the league. They won't make the playoffs. There will be no Celtics/Cavs matchup.   [deleted] (+37):   &gt;&gt; Ah yes, Kevin Love is a scrub, Colin Sexton will show no upside and Ty Lue is obviously unable to coach so this roster will have luck being out of the lottery. Not to mention the entire roster is a bunch of scrubs.  &gt;&gt; OR  &gt;&gt; **You can take the reasonable approach and say that this is the first time Lue can actually coach the Cavs without having to deal with LeBron, they still have very good role players, Kevin Love is a bonafide all-star who can now perform as a star player and they have great young talent like Sexton, Nance, Cedi and possible Zizic.**  &gt;&gt; But based on people defending Marcus Smart for sucker punching JR last night I don't expect reasonableness from Celtics fans like yourself at the moment.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9m50o0/cavs_bench_mocking_jayson_tatum_for_getting/e7c4mvv/   I'm sure if I search more I would find more of the same. People absolutely thought the Cavs would be a fringe playoff team before their disastrous 0-6 start."
"Slightly unrelated, but I can't help but wonder what Kevin Love is thinking about all this as the main veteran in that locker room."
"I'd agree. It's refreshing compared to a lot of the talking heads out there. I do sort of think he's gotten a lot more lazy from a quality analysis point regarding the current NBA, than he was at the height of his powers at ESPN. But he's probably too busy hanging out with his deplorable LA power broker friends and trying to cut deals with Spotify, to really watch the game as closely as he used to. He's lost some mph on his fastball is what I'm saying I guess. I also like when people are willing to question the shit he's saying, which Russillo does a pretty good job of. Nothing compares to that Kevin Garnett podcast though ofc, where it looked like he was about to rip his head off on about 5 different occasions.   He's still generally pretty damn good don't get me wrong. And he's the only NBA pundit/talking head who's going to examine Russell Westbrook's game through the lens of Nicholas Cage movies... which is why we all love Bill in the first place."
"I hope he changes too but don't go and try to be all righteous about a guy who has clearly demonstrated some type of ass-hat like behavior on a consistent basis.  If he took his ""mental health"" seriously, he wouldn't be throwing food at people in the locker room. I mean you have Kevin Love as your teammate... he clearly doesn't care about anyone other than himself."
"People ""put up"" with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving because they're really fucking good at basketball. I think Kevin Love is a great example for people on dealing with success and mental health problems. I'm not trying to belittle there experiences in any way. When you become a headcase first and basketball player second the league will wash you out pretty quick (Royce White)."
"Absolutely, I wish the Cavs had done more to try to support him. They should have foreseen that moving his locker could be alienating/upsetting for him. They talked a big talk about mental health with Kevin Love, and it doesn't seem like they're following through with KPJ"
"Anyone who knows this series, can y’all guess when he’s doing Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant? I’d love to see that"
Marc Gasol and Kevin Love used to be pretty good as far as I remember. I don't know if they're still good though as I don't watch many games nowadays.
Kevin Love is the OG of that club
One day I want a team of Fat Luka Fat Zion Fat Kevin Love Fat Harden and Fat Lowry just destroy the league. A victory for the XXXLs around the world. One day.
"Come on now, the guy is literally in a lawsuit right now over his involvement with bringing in Kawhi. Nobody else other than him. You don't end up in a lawsuit like that if you're ""just a consultant"". He had the same exact ""consultant"" role at the Warriors as well and still made vital decisions like picking Steph over Monta, pushing to draft Klay, pushing to draft Draymond, threatening to quit if Klay was traded for K-Love and convincing Kevin Durant to join them. You're honestly disrespecting the man trying to downplay him and put him below Masai's level. I guess that's the Raptors bias though."
In general Kevin Love is in a different stratosphere than Russell. But 2018 Kevin Love is a way worse player than 2019 Russell (the year he made the allstar team).
Simmons will imo be a Lonzo Ball/Jrue Holiday/Kevin Love type player on a contender.  He just doesn’t have the all around game to be a 1st/2nd option.
Game 1 is not the same as the whole chip. Kevin love is better than Russell. He had multiple all stars under his belt before teaming up with Lebron. Russell will only be an all star in the East.
"I'd say the stretch 4 was the ideal. But that's still the time when 4's were actually bigs, and not ""big"" SFs. I had high hopes of Kevin Love being a perennial 1st/2nd teamer watching his Wolves games.  It took Bron being the genetic freak that he is (because we always overlook the fact that he weighs as much as a stereotypical 4 from that era), as well as the '15 Warriors, to eventually have this 1-big setup that is so common today. I also remembered people (including me) laughing at Vivek Ranadive when he once had a vision of putting out a lineup full of 6'8"" guys.  God, I really missed late 00's - early 10's NBA. People may downvote me for this, but I still believe that was the most stylistically diverse the league has ever been.  edited for grammar and stuff. english isn't my first language lol"
Ask Kevin Love or teams that were part of that lbj ride they all look at  the ring/s and probably say it was worth it.
"Kyrie Irving Ron Harper LeBron James Brad Daugherty  Hot Rod Williams  Mark Price Jordan Clarkson Kevin Love Larry Nance Shawn Kemp Kyle Korver  The Lakers have insane bigs so it is a massive task keeping Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, and AD at bay so this team is F/C heavy and Price, Love, Kyrie, and Korver might be able to avoid them inside by stretching the court with their shooting  Prime Kobe vs near-prime Harper would be fun to watch. I tip it to Kobe but Harper’s defense gives us our best shot"
"As always with Barkley, he has half a point and also totally doesn't understand the modern game.   When Kevin Love started drifting further and further out on offense, there was a real cost to it: his offensive rebounding. His offensive rebounding rate plummeted (and he was elite at that) as his 3FGA went up. But Love was also a 36-37% 3pt shooter during that time: fine, for a big, but not great. To me it's not at all clear if the benefits of the improved spacing with Love at the 3-pt line made up for the loss in OREBs.   KAT is not ""fine, for a big"" when it comes to 3pt shooting. He's awesome at it. It also doesn't seem to be negatively correlated with his offensive rebounding rate so the idea that you're paying a tax to have him out at the perimeter is harder to justify.   Barkley has caught up with the idea that jump shots are good shots (strange that he's such a hater on that given how many threes *he* took) but he's still ten years behind the times. If you look at KAT and see the same tradeoffs there were with someone like Kevin Love, you're misunderstanding his impact.   (It may not be possible to be a winning team with a C who is as uninterested in defense as KAT is. That can't be ruled out. But that flaw has absolutely nothing to do with his outside shooting)."
"&gt;Byrie  Now I'm just imagining a Kyrie that just hilariously misquotes Byron all the time  ""Those who will not reason, are pawns, those who cannot, are pawns, and those who dare not, are also pawns. You're all pawns.""  ""There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? And what does government mean to you?""  ""Kevin Love will find a way through paths where Timberwolves fear to prey.""  ""To have joy, one must share it. That's No. 23's job.""  ""Like smallpox, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life. Fuck Thanksgiving."""
I'd like to offer you one Kevin Love
"Fair point on 2008, but 2018 Kyrie was ballin. Kevin love was forced to take a smaller role like Bosh, not a superstar, but point was Lebron couldn't drag a team without stars to the playoffs like in 2019.  If AD is out there's no chance he does it here, we've literally seen it before."
"Same. Love the dude cause he always give 100% on the court. But when you consistently take almost as many shots as Kevin Durant as a PG, your BBIQ must not be all that high."
"Sure but when his notable failures include putting CJ Miles on Kevin Love, benching James Johnson when we needed defense, under using PJ, overusing Lou, I'm comfortable saying Casey is a bad coach.  Vogel isn't as good as Spolestra probably, but  If you can manage the egos, coaching a Lebron team is butter so not super fair to compare.   The Bucks do have a lot of issues outside of Bud but his decision making is questionable to down right baffling at times, to the point I wouldn't really trust him outside the first round."
"Just curious, when was the last time kevin love even play and why is he not playing?"
"He is right , No one is dragging the Cavs leadership through the mud for trading for Drummond and wanting to deal him less than a season later , but if Drummond wanted to be dealt and made it public he'd get all sorts of bad press directed at him personally ,  &amp;#x200B;  No one is dragging Kevin Love through the mud for his semi-injury that everyone knows would be healed the moment he is dealt to a good team.  &amp;#x200B;  But Harden was the devil...even though he was playing.  &amp;#x200B;  its a clear hypocrisy."
Surprised no one has mentioned Kevin Love yet.
"Larry Nance is not the starting PF for the Cavs Kevin Love is. He's a bench player filling an injured slot.  Zubac isn't a starter for the Clippers, Ibaka is.  Brandon Ingram was MIP as well as an all star which is important."
"I can't believe how I need to point out how Harden's usage has collapsed compared to prior seasons because he is now on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. It's literally the lowest it has been since he was coming off the bench in OKC. You apparently seem to know that yourself, but completely disregard it?  Not to mention that despite Harden's usage being way down, he's still playing 5 minutes more per game than Stephen Curry is. Is it that unbelievable to you that Curry is averaging 1.5 less FTA than Harden?  Curry is not unfairly officiated. He does essentially the same shit (but to a lesser extent) and receives the same calls as a notorious foul-baiter. It just looks like you're trying to believe something that clearly isn't true out of some blind love for a player.  and no, I'm not trying to be an asshole. It's not that serious."
I think Kevin Love has played 20 minutes all year after straining his calf in that time
Bro is Kevin Love in the league still?? Wtf where is he
Laughs in Kevin love
Gotta Love Kevin Loves Kevin Love
"Yeah same thing with Kevin Love.   I wish the NBA would allow teams to “loan” players. You would have to require that a pick is traded at a min, but I think it would enhance the product by allowing these past their prime all-stars squeeze what juice is left on a contender."
Kevin on Kevin love
Kevin loves Kevin Love's Kevin love.
Some Kevin Love from Kevin Love.
Love give Kevin motivation
Kevin love is an awesome dude.
Kevin Porter gave Kevin Love mental health issues confirmed
Kevin Love give love to Kevin
"When has LeBron ever blamed his teammates? He always praises his teammates. The only time I can think of is when he said ""don't stand out fit in"" to Kevin Love, but that was in the season and they squashed their beef."
ja morant trying to dunk over kevin love
"Pretty much all advanced stats put Blake slightly above Kevin love, and way above him if you take out loves last season in Minnesota where he put up silly numbers on a terrible team. Blake’s best years were during seasons his team won 50+ games.   Also Kevin love isn’t exactly a slouch.. and is another guy with constant injury issues, had he stayed healthy after lebron things could be a lot different. Dudes getting lingering injury problems in their 30’s is just a way of life, it shouldn’t detract from what these guys accomplished in their careers."
"Man honestly (healthy) Blake, Westbrook, and Drummond all feel like they could end up being like Paul, Wall, Hayward, and Wiggins cases of being still overpaid but way better in the right environment  I doubt if any of them find those environments, honestly, but I'm holding out hope. Would be really nice to see them all bounce back. Doesn't feel like a Kevin Love or Harrison Barnes level of ""probably never gonna be an all-star again"" yet"
"If the Wizards decide to declare Westbrook a lost cause, they could save about $50 million over the next 2 2/3 years by taking Blake for Westbrook.   I tend to doubt they are ready to do that yet, though.   The only other trade destination might be to Cleveland for Kevin love.  Love is owed $90 million of the next 3 years (including this one).   The Cavs might be willing to take on Blake's rotting corpse for Love's in order to free up a max slot a year earlier.    Detroit might be willing to gamble that Love has a little more left in him than Blake"
In terms of impact towards winning? He was an impact player in the same way that Kevin Love was.
BG is closer to Kevin Love than Russ in terms of the appeal of trading for his contract.
"You hit it on the head w/ KG.  KAT isn't Kevin Garnett.  KAT isn't Kevin Garnett mentally.  There's offense, defense, and then there's all the intangibles that exist between the 2.  Leadership, emotion, energy, love of the game, teamwork and all the other things that go with encouraging the other 4 guys on the court to play hard and well.  If KG had an 85 on offense, 95 on defense and 99 on intangibles, KAT has 95 on offense, 75 on defense and a 45 on intangibles (at best...generously).  This is why they're not even close and why he can't carry them to the playoffs."
Good luck with that fam. Ask Kevin Love how that's working out for him. Huge contract that's expiring will only be wanted by rebuilding teams who won't give up picks or young assets.
does this mean kevin love is coming back? i guess drummond to wizards for bertans? i donno if i would do that but i can't think of anything rn.
I still have no idea why Cleveland thought spending $60 MILLION a year on Kevin love and Andre Drummond was a good idea.  What is you doing?!
"Well the wolves drafted OJ Mayo and I was hyped about that, but then later in the evening find out they traded him for Kevin Love, this pudgy white guy .  But for all of Kevin Mchale's faults, he does have a good eye for big men so I have to hand it to him.   I really thought OJ would be an All Star, and he was on track with a strong rookie season but just never improved from there"
Kevin love and oj mayo
Kevin love is easily the worst contract in professional sports.  Dude gets like $30 million a year to be a spokesperson for depressed athletes.  Fleecing the cavs
have you heard of a guy called Kevin Love?
I don’t know why Kevin Love is your go to example of this.
Lebron had Kevin Love and Tristian Thompson as rim protectors when he was on the Cavs and basically had to be the rim protector himself in 2016 lol
"The Cavs got Kevin Love, JR, Shump, and Mozgov because LeBron told them to. Also, I was being facetious."
"And Kevin Love put up monster numbers for the Wolves. Similar with Chris Bosh. Don’t get me wrong, I believe he’s thriving in his role, but I’d still bump him down 2-4 spots."
"I think a lot of people are taking Kevin Love and Demar Derozan's experiences to heart (good), but attempting to apply that idea in the wrong way (bad).  Good: Lonzo's stats are x and Lamelo's stats are y, Lamelo is playing better  Bad: Lonzo's a piece of trash  There is protecting feelings and then there's ignoring the realities of being a pro basketball player. I think it's fine to not want anyone to feel ashamed of themselves, but expecting an entire community of fans and analysts to ignore comparisons because ""maybe Lonzo will feel bad"" is just silly. Not all of being in the spotlight is enjoyable, but some parts of fame are static. If he's going to be in the league, he's going to face comparisons to his brother (and everyone else)."
"People love to shit on Kevin James, but he's genuinely funny in the right setting."
"AD played the majority (60%) of his minutes at the PF last season, and was still given the All-NBA C position.  That being said, he’s not playing C nearly as much as last season so he *should* be listed as a forward this year.  The season isn’t close to being over yet, and I wouldn’t put money on Anthony Davis being this bad all year.   If it came down to those two, Davis will still get the nod despite Gobert potentially being more impactful. LeBron’s teammates usually get special treatment (Kevin Love and old Wade) despite putting up meh production.  I think they’ll both make it this year though."
"Good point, but once we trade Blake for Rudy Gay and Kevin Love, Gay Love will out duel SexLand in a super sweaty 7 game series"
"I’m waiting for the day Harden, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Sexland, Dickley, and the both Balls play on the same team."
"People know hardens scoring is way down but he’s also just not impacting game at close to a mvp level, maybe not even top 10 lvl.  I thought he be the 1b to durant even if he was scoring less than Kyrie but he’s closer to bkns Kevin love(people forget love had argument for top 5 in 2014)"
Cavs played without Kyrie &amp; Kevin Love in 2015. And GSW blew 3-1 lead despite 2 HCA.
Look nobody is saying LiAngelo has a bad life but ya don’t get mental health and it shows. I thought Kevin Love and DeMar Derozan made that clear but is that too mature for this sub?
Duncan Robinson is better than Kevin love right now. 30/30 teams would rather have Duncan Robinson than love even if they were paid the same.
Jerami Grant - 53  Kevin Love - 75  Duncan Robinson - Just outside top 100  Tristan Thompson - Probably not top 200
"Still can't believe the Cavs big 3 of LeBron, George Hill and Kevin Love nearly managed to win a whole game against that roster."
"""I'm rich and do what I love.  Don't cry for me."" - Kevin Durant"
"This isn't the NFL, a the difference one star makes on a team can be so massive that it's really hard not to blame them for his team's performance, especially when you have 7 chances to beat a team. Pat Mahomes can lose in the superbowl to the Bucs in large part because of his offensive coordinator's gameplan and the performance of his offensive line. Giannis can't lose before the finals two years in a row and expect anyone to hold those trophies in high regard when LeBron dragged George Hill and Kevin Love there and AI had Aaron Mckie as his #2 and got there.   Sorry."
"Kyrie was an All-Star point guard and Kevin Love was averaging 26/12/4 before he moved to the Cavs, when they teamed they were seen as a ""Big Three"". Love just had to change his playstyle when playing with Lebron and Kyrie"
"Kevin Love seems like he has a bad attitude and isn’t a good leader. Lebron probably wishes he held onto Wiggins longer and waited to cash in his Wiggins trade chip for when Butler and Paul George became available.  Love got paid big money and will likely make the hall of fame thanks to Lebron carrying him to a championship, so can’t really feel bad for him."
Fuck Kevin love honestly. It’d be one thing if love just shut up and took his money but he doesn’t. He threw a bitch fit on the cavs after they gave him a thank you contract even tho he sucked and underperformed his whole tenure in Cleveland. That contract is an absolute albatross and Cleveland will not be able to move it. And then he goes and throws a young gun under the bus by throwing a bitch fit on the court cause a rook made a mistake. Sexton is already way better than love and good on him giving it back to love.
"It's a pretty asshole move by whoever is controlling the account (whether it's Sexton or a family member). Love knows he's not living up to the contract and he feels bad about it, but he's been injured. You can't hold that against him.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/02/25/cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-admits-guilty-injury-looks-forward-return/  &gt; “Me too! It’s so funny you say that. I have regret. Like…It’s not my fault! I was just telling an assistant coach today, a guy that I love, Dan Geriot, ‘you see me!’ You see how hard that I attack injuries and how hard I work. I don’t have to tell you, but I’m telling you just because I feel guilty. Like I feel like I’m letting you guys (the organization) down.'”  &gt; ...  &gt; “On top of all that, you get paid all this money to put a ball through a hoop. And fans and people are asking when you’re going to be back…..On the other side of that too, it makes me feel guilty because people don’t understand the difference between (the severity of) a grade one, a grade two, a grade three (strain). And I have a grade two.”  &gt; ...  &gt; “I’m taking care of it. I’m busting my (butt) to get back…Boy, I feel so guilty (about being injured). More than anything, it’s (feeling like you’re) letting your teammates down.”  &gt; ...  &gt; “I just want to play competitive, meaningful basketball. And that is all I want. That’s all I want. Moving forward, all I want to do is win. All I want to do is play meaningful basketball. But you can’t do that if you have these injuries and you’re not healthy. That guilt (of being injured) is a real thing.”"
"Love has been injured a lot (especially recently). That's probably the bulk of why he's miserable and no, I don't think you can hold those injuries against him.  He was just on JJ's podcast talking about it, actually.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/02/25/cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-admits-guilty-injury-looks-forward-return/"
So we're gonna act like Kevin Love helped the Cavs? His gargantuan contract could have been used to sign actual good players to help Lebron and Kyrie.
"This isn’t even the biggest NBA “heist of the century”. Kevin Love had good stats and helped the team win a title. Contracts to guys like Timofey Mozgov, Omer Asik, Chandler Parsons and Bismack Biyombo had far less return on them."
Kevin love signed the contract in 2018 and has been trash ever since.  Everyone is talking about shit he did before he signed that contract
Muarbary (butchered name) Ray Allen Kevin Love KG Towns
Because Kevin Love right now is absolutely not worth the money compared to AI
you can assemble a good team around a max player. you’re just arguing for better roster management. what does AI (who was obviously worth the money) even have to do with Kevin Love?
Kevin FREAKIN love
Kevin Love is trash
Well Collin Sexton would love if Kevin LOVE CAN ACTUALLY PLAY instead of being out during the games.
Yea the HOF becomes meaningless when we talk about this tier of player. I usually put a lot of weight in all nba selections and when Kevin Love is 2x second team and only 5x all star it's meh.
"Yeah, this wasn't like other bloated contracts if you can even called it that. Kevin Love can ignore other idiots like Sexton all day knowing he was one of the most important pieces to the championship. He should have been paid even more."
"You don't pay a player for what they've already contributed, you pay them for what they're going to contribute. Frankly I think a lot of people saw this coming, injuries aside. Kevin Love on the wrong side of 30 can't reasonably guard his position in this era."
he's 22 and is in one of the worst situations for young players and Kevin comes off as being a bad mentor and veteran based on his body language so i can understand his frustrations when Love can't even play 10 minutes.
lets be real Kevin Love got to play with Lebron in Cleveland and he didn't really get anywhere in Minny (i know he was a 3 time allstar there but they never made the playoffs).
"Kevin love is far from the worst contract ever, he’s been terrible absolutely, but just off the top of my head chandler parsons is way worse."
sexton isnt even wrong. when was the last time kevin love played more than 5 minutes in a game?
They got beef? Doubt it  All I remember Kevin Love saying KPJ was the most talented player on the Cavs (over Sexton/Garland)
"I hope Kevin love can somehow start playing good again to shut everyone up, I know he’s been trash and is always hurt but goddamn the hate he gets is so unnecessary."
"Kevin Love was a vital part of Cleveland getting its first ring in 50+ years. Colin Sexton is a decently promising young player on a middling Cavaliers team who, to this date, has done nothing of note in his career. Dude should show more respect to a player who will likely always mean more to Cavs fans than he ever will."
https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2020/01/kevin-love-explains-viral-on-court-moment-with-collin-sexton-i-was-frustrated.html  Coach didn't see Love had CP3 in the post and called a play for Sexton to run
Colin Sexton gave Kevin Love depression
"I don't think people would be as mad at that love contract if the dude ever showed up. He's been made of bandaids since he lost his minnesota weight, and is one of the worst defenders I've ever seen. As much of an overpay Tristan Thompson was, at least when he hustles he passed the eye test.  Kevin Love fucking sucks"
Kevin Love the curry stopper.
Bro are you actually stupid? Everyone knows Kevin Love has one of the worst contracts in the league. He always gets shit for being trash in the playoffs. All anyone would talk about when LeBron was there was that he forgot how to post up and was invisible in the playoffs
Well.... Kevin Love wasn't the one who offered himself that contract. I don't think anyone thought it was a good deal when it was originally signed. It really didn't make sense at the time and still doesn't because I don't see them being able to move him without eating a lot of that deal or offering up assets.
KEVIN LOVE IS THE WORST CONTRACT IN NBA HISTORY.   and was complete dumpster juice in the playoffs. and showed up overweight  but nobody will say it.  Luol Deng cant even order pizza without being reminded he's a failure.  and we all know the reason why
Death   Tax  Kevin Love and John Wall appearing in injury report
"Yeah between those guys, KAT and Kevin Love (traded for Wiggins ofc) the wolves have drafted significant high end talent."
Lmao Kevin Love was not a star at 14/2/8
Kyrie was a star but not a superstar. Kevin Love was kinda a star
"The Nets just got Blake Griffin and they're not the Pistons or that Knicks team, when they picked up 100 PFs in one offseason.  Kevin Love would likely go to Milwaukee or Miami, something like that."
I’m not pessimistic about a team who traded Kevin love for a number 1 overall bust. (Only a bust because of draft position). A team that couldn’t win with a top 20-30 player of all time. A team that is constantly mismanaged and poorly coached. Everyone was excited about a lot of players. Should they have been in hindsight? I bet the blazers were over the moon with Oden. The Knicks didn’t even respect Porzingus... The clippers literally had one of the worst owners of all time. Don’t get me started on Dan Gilbert and the loser that inherited the Knicks. I just think the Wolves need new management. And no one should be excited for them until things are changed top down. I don’t even know who coached the wolves he’s so insignificant...
Anthony Edwards throws down a ferocious dunk. The Internet: “Yeah but he is -7”  Ja Morant misses a ferocious dunk over Kevin Love   The Internet: “OHMYGODMVPMVPMVPMVP”  It wild how Twitter and Reddit chooses to love and hate.
"If Kevin Love gets bought out, I think he would consider the Nets/Knicks.  He owns a very nice apartment in NYC.  It was on Architecture Digest."
"Highly unlikely, but I'd like to see Kevin Love secure a buyout and try and end up on the Nets. Just have them say fuck it and go for even more offense, imagine him as a stretch 5 on the Nets and how many open 3s he'd get."
Such a weak tech. All he did was tap his head lmao. Id love to see someone like Kevin Garnett play on today's league
I dont think that counts because they had to lose Kevin Love for him. Like if you had to trade a key piece for a young stud its not really luck you got the younger player
"Bosh, KD, Kevin Love.  Even for the folks who didn’t win a title like PG13, Harden, I’d say they’re pretty pleased so far."
I feel bad because he’s wasting his years with them it was the same with KG and Kevin Love. Minnesota has always had problems surrounding their star players with talent. Maybe in a few years with a good coach and supporting cast they can compete. D'Lo and Beasley are good and Edwards has potential to be a great player as well so they do have some good pieces to work with.
Read on here Kevin Love punched a hole in a wall at a party where he showed up and his gf was cheating on him and a bunch of people commenting were confirming it lol. I need to find that thread again
The 15' Cavs could've won the championship if they had Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love.
"As many have said, Kevin Love is probably the worst. Blake would’ve been a contender on this but he’s been bought out. Love doesn’t play enough and when he does is a shell of himself.  Wall and Westbrook both at least are positives on the court, so while they’re overpaid for what they do they aren’t necessarily “crippling” contracts.  Wiggins, despite the narrative, is still a pretty terrible contract because he’s close to league-average production at a superstar price. I’d put him in a similar boat as Drummond except Wiggins is making 50% more on that contract making it just a bit worse."
"Kevin Love is making a case for being a top 5 ""Keep Gettin' Dem Checks"" player. Chandler Parsons might be the GOAT(he was on this list long before his insanely unfortunate car accident last year).. but Kevin Love is throwing some haymakers right now."
Kevin Love is back and now gone
Kevin Love
"Kevin Love played 2 mins and was like ""ight thats nuff"""
Typical Kevin Love  RIP Future/Sex LoveLand
Kevin Durant cause I love how he plays
"Matthew Dellavedova.  Why? Idk, he’s just kinda cool, I guess.  Realistically: Kevin Love or DeMar DeRozan (under appreciated and also outspoken on mental health issues)."
Kevin Love and Kemba
It’s Kevin Love
Kevin Love has to be up there
Kevin love wasted an entire season cause he fucked up his hand/arm doing doing knuckle push ups   He came back that season for a bit but he was terrible and I think wolves shut him down. It was a horrible year for him
He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers and traded with Anthony Bennett and Thad young for Kevin Love
with a dash of Kevin Love lol =)
Our scouts watched Kentucky all year and somehow fell in love with Kevin Knox over Shai I’m nauseous
God I wasn't working out at the time and even then I thought he was faking it. Give that man some milk  Article https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/10/18/kevin-love-breaks-hand-knuckle-pushups/1642261/
"&gt; Cause when Drummond gets steals and blocks - it seems those are ""stat-padded"" but when Jokic does it, it's a sign of elite defense.   Tbf here, I’m not arguing Jokic is an elite defender. I’m just arguing that his defense is passable when you combine it with his offense, which is currently on the short list for all-time offensive big men  I don’t know if Drummond takes too much shit or not, some of it is probably because he and Jokic both fail the defensive eye test  But Jokic isn’t just an elite offensive big—peak Cousins, LMA, Kevin Love etc. If he can string together 3-4 seasons at even close to this level he’s basically center Larry Bird right now. A center hasn’t had this much offensive impact since Shaq"
"They don't though. Steph has way more 3PM. If you look at only a portion of the relevant numbers, your perception will be thrown off, but that's the same as the eye test. Kevin Love would look like the GOAT if you only watched that one quarter he had 34"
I think that he isn’t what he was defensively. That’s a huge concern. He’s a third option offensively. The shooting is great and should add well. He’s probably always going to be in an out with injuries. He’s basically tall Kevin Love at this point.
"One Acronym. Sure, he doesn't have the highest knowledge of the game as this moment. You can teach X and O. Does he learn and improve...yes. That is proven in the 83 games he has played. Learning to switch, play defense. He's gotten better. You can't teach 6'10"" and shoot 50/42/80.   And if BBIQ was all it took to be a superstar...you would have a whole different league.   I also love Mavs fan downvoting me because I said MPJ could be at the same level as Luka. Why does this statement trigger people. I'm not taking away Luka's talent. Why people so hurt by that?   Its not far fetched, I'm not talking about some random nobdy. A talent that was predicted to be #1 draft pick that was also  * [*USA Today* Player of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today_All-USA_high_school_basketball_team) (2017) * [Gatorade National Player of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade_National_Basketball_Player_of_the_Year) (2017) * [Naismith Prep Player of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Prep_Player_of_the_Year) (2017) * [Mr. Basketball USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Basketball_USA) (2017) * [McDonald's All-American MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_All-American_Game) ([2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_McDonald%27s_All-American_Boys_Game))  Yes, those accolades do not for sure predict NBA superstar like (Gatorade National Player of the year) Greg Oden (injury), Brandon Knight, and Andrew Wiggins. Then you have names like LeBron, Kevin Love, Dwight, Jrue, Beal, Simmons, Tatum, KAT. They predict more superstars then they don't. And in this case, I don't think it missed on MPJ. Yes, the circumstance is different in what he had to go through but the only thing holding him back was...his back. He has proven that his back doesn't hinder him shooting at an elite level against NBA competition."
"Anthony Davis is allowing 63.4% at the rim this year. Gobert is allowing 60.8. Embiid is 60.3.   **When people get to the rim, they score.** Even against Davis and Gobert.  I think a lot of people are looking at this number and thinking Embiid and Gobert are holding people in the 40s--the biggest part of defense is keeping people out of the restricted area in the first place.  Jokic is bad at rim protection, but it's just one component of defenses, and he's good at every other part of big man defense.   From 2015-2020 the Nuggets have had a better team Defensive rating with Jokic ON the floor than off. If he was such a generationally bad defender i dont see how this could be the case for a literal half-decade  People hate defensive analytics, but Jokic is the only ""bad"" defender they constantly rate above his reputation. Kevin Love doesnt overperform. Amare didnt. KAT doesnt.   Add on top of this a half-decade of his team being better at defense when he's on the court than off, and I'm sorry, he's not a terrible defender"
"Gordon Hayward, Joe Harris and Kevin Love"
Wizards getting a cavs center like Kevin love would be interesting.
And then a week later kevin Love pulled out of the game and they put in Kemba and the Hornets were 4 games behind us lol.
"I mean its pretty strong evidence that the horrible drafting is the main problem.  Draft Flynn and Rubio, Curry goes right after  Draft Wes Johnson, Demarcus Cousins goes right after  Draft Kris Dunn, Jamal Murray goes right after   Trade up and draft Jarrett Culver, the next 7 guys who go after him are easily better   When the Wolves hit on a pick, they nail it.  Kevin Love, Lavine, KAT.  All 3 players developed just fine on the Wolves.  But theres just waaayyy too many shitty picks mixed in between.  Like not even players who underachieve,  just straight up bad players with these high lottery picks.  And thats why they can't ever build around their all star talent  Would a guy like Greg popovich have gotten more out of , say, Derrick Williams than the wolves did? Sure, but youre still just putting lipstick on a pig"
Im still convinced that if for whatever reason the Kevin Love trade falls through Wiggins is a different player in the league.
Zion vs. fresh-off-the-injury-list Kevin Love was never going to go well for us. Kevin's a little too pale to be referred to as BBQ chicken - poached salmon is probably more accurate.
Love how the knicks passed on him cus of his back issues so we drafted Kevin weight room Knox instead
"The Pels are strong af, and they're longbois too. As much as I love Jarrett Allen, Steven Adams is not a good matchup for him. And Kevin Love is a shell of himself."
Cleveland bad. LeBron good. Kevin love. Dan Gilbert bad. Jarrett Allen doesn’t deserve this. Drummond buyout.
You are fucking with me right? Jordan Clarkson would have been the third best player on the 76’s. Any team that has Kevin Love and top 3 player of all time can’t be considered a “bad” team.
Kevin Love laughing and asking what his coach like what can I do about Zion ??? 😂
Kevin Love floppppin???
Didn't kevin love yell at altman last year and basically say fine me I have plenty on money. Hasn't drummond been dnp for a month.  Cavs are dysfunctional thats a fact. If they weren't lebron would not have left twice .My guy had three coaches in a 18 month period. Was he the most professional no.
I've missed Kevin Love
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team! Anyway, so here are the likely lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (14-22) | [](/NOP)Pelicans (15-22) ---|---   C.

2016 Cavs. Basically just LeBron hard carrying a bunch of bums. Don't believe me? Look at Kyrie and Kevin Love without LeBron.
"I've been thinking about this recently. Centers are as good as they've been in a while---it's the traditional 4 that is dying out. You either have to be 1.big enough to play center, so you either slide over to C full time (Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka), switch between the two positions (AD), or if you're not big enough you have to expand out to the three-point line Blake, Millsap, Kevin Love (although he expanded his range earlier than the others). A lot of guys playing PF now would previously be combo forwards/tweeners, or are just big wings. Siakam was a combo forward, now he's just a normal PF. Additionally, there is a de-emphasis on back to the basket play, so it's easier to get away with this.  It looked so bizarre seeing Portland throw out a Nurk/Whiteside/Melo frontcourt last season---felt like a 90's throwback."
reminds me of how Kevin love got injured.  He's yanking on his arm with his full body weight.  really bad.
&gt;KD is in the Kevin Love role.  My god. The things I have to read on here sometimes.
"KD in the Kevin Love role??????? YOU AIN'T GOT THE ANSWERS, SWAYYY!!!"
Op compared Kevin Love to KD
KD is a snake but this is disrespectful. Comparing an empty stats player like Kevin Love to KD is wrong
Kevin Love.... KD...... am I on drugs what did I just read
&gt;KD is in the Kevin Love role.   Nephew
Michael Beasley only just retired 3 years ago at age 30. He was drafted the same years as Kevin Love and Serge Ibaka - stretch forwards were very much becoming a thing already. It's not like he's some dinosaur from a forgotten era.  Beasley's career sucked because of his work ethic and attitude problems.
"Kevin Love was born in Santa Monica, Lopez brothers born in North Hollywood"
"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."
I'm just gonna laugh if Kevin Love gets bought out and goes to you guys.
"""Players you hate to play against, but love if they're on your team"" team  &amp;#x200B;  G: Chris Paul  G: Kyle Lowry  F: Tony Allen  F: Kevin Garnett  C: Joakim Noah  Bench: Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Matt Barnes, Anderson Varajao, Andrew Bogut"
Dwight Deron Williams and Kevin Love.  Can anyone guess where?
"Thats the thing about young players, they develop. But shoot, if in all your wisdom you don’t deem any of our high draft picks outside of LeBron to be any good I don’t know what to tell you. Carlos Boozer, Kyrie, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, Sexton, Garland, and Okoro aren’t exactly a black eye on the organization. We missed on Anthony Bennett but he was good enough to package with Wiggins and land Kevin Love. Not a whole lot of lottery picks outside of them considering we were consistently in the playoffs from 2005-2010 and in the Finals (that’s the series you play to win the championship) from 2015-2018. Oh, I forgot those dont count because LeBron was raised in Northeast Ohio...where are Kawhi and PG from again?"
Now we know. Love kevin but he should not be taking clutch shots. (Expect he made one tonight so ignore that for a sec)
I don't know if this is a league problem or reporters thing but they seem to cover negative aspects and tragedies that happen DeMar DeRozan life very well. Almost never a bit of positive news about him or Kevin Love for that matter. I only read about Love's engagement through his own tweet.
Can Kevin Love sing tenor?
Kevin Love lmao
"Do you think AD, kyrie, kevin love, Dwyane wade, and Chris Bosh regret playing with lebron?"
"&gt; I just don't think you should be able to buyout a guy making the kind of money Blake and Drummond were making.  There should be some punishment to players for signing those kinds of  contracts with bad teams. LIke Kevin Love, he can't just opt out of a  team he committed too. There should be some drawback to signing those  kinds of contracts.   The reason why they were bought out was literally because of their big contracts. Blake gave up his player option and a large portion of this season's salary to get his buyout. Think he gave up at least 40million+ in salary total.   Love is still on the Cavs because either he has no trade value, he doesn't want to give up salary or he just likes the Cavs.   &gt; I don't like this change in the league that the players can just do whatever the hell they want and the teams placate to them.   So basically it is ok if your team benefits from it but not if other other teams do?"
"I just don't think you should be able to buyout a guy making the kind of money Blake and Drummond were making. There should be some punishment to players for signing those kinds of contracts with bad teams. LIke Kevin Love, he can't just opt out of a team he committed too. There should be some drawback to signing those kinds of contracts.   Dieng and Lin weren't making the kind of money these guys were.   &gt; Did the Nets not get their players legitimately?   I think I'd be a slight hypocrite complaining too much about Harden considering we won a ring off the back of a trade for a disgruntled player, but even as someone who benefited from it, I don't like this change in the league that the players can just do whatever the hell they want and the teams placate to them."
Kyrie needed to bring in Lebron and Kevin Love to win. Another one of these super teams.
Fat Kevin Love sends his regards.
big fan of that one guy who picked Kevin Love to be the best PF
"I still think he should’ve won in 2018 for his work on the Kyrie-less Cavs. Kevin Love also basically became a non-factor that season, too."
"Those other guys did a lot more on defense than MPJ or other aspects of the game. They also were all stars before they joined forces in most cases. MPJ is a great shooter but that’s pretty much all he provides at this point and he can’t really create his own shot either, you’re overrating him and underrating guys like Bosh, Kevin Love, and Draymond Green."
"I think what they’re saying is someone who is on either side of the border, sometimes they’re in, sometimes they’re out. The last guys in and the people just behind them who didn’t make it. Devin Booker would be considered one (right now) since he is always on the cusp of it and has only gotten in as a replacement. Kevin Love is a good example too since he wasn’t consistently selected year after year."
I'm confused how does Kevin Love only have a 0.7% percent chance to be in the hall of fame. And for that matter why is Blake only 0.5%.  They are both multi-time all-nba players.
"Yes, but did they actively recruit them like they seemingly do today? Jordan didn’t recruit Scottie, Kareem didn’t recruit Magic, Bird didn’t recruit any of the Celtics and Robinson didn’t recruit Duncan. LeBron used the media to recruit Bosh to Miami, he recruited Kevin Love to Cleveland, Anthony Davis to the Lakers... same with Kyrie and KD picking Brooklyn then recruiting Harden... I can respect that they all had it back in the day but they didn’t recruit like the players do now."
"Oh, the old Kevin Love method, I see. (Old as in: Minnesota)."
"I wouldnt say wiggins counts.  He was the best deal on the table for Kevin Love .  Flip wanted klay Thompson (which wouldve been the better move) but thankfully for warriors fans they didn't agree to that move.  Wiggins was not the wolves first choice really , just the best of that situation where Kevin love wanted out."
"Part of it is because people think we drafted wiggins.  The cavs drafted him, and we later in that offseason the wolves traded Kevin love for him because Lebron wanted to form his Big 3 over there , and Love wasn't gonna re-sign in MN .  The wolves actually drafted Lavine with their pick that year"
&gt; Is this love financially viable?  Kevin love sure is
Didn’t Kevin love go vegan?
"Kevin Durant is so good, he can win the championship without playing. I’d love to see Lebron or Steph try to win their team the championship without playing, but they can’t. KD is the real GOAT."
"You realize Heat had three all stars too right? And Ray Allen who had all star performances during the playoff. Lebron left the Heat in 13, so your argument is that he had one year where Wade wasn't good, and then he immediately bailed to make another superteam. That's kind of a shitty argument.   &gt;    The point about Lebron is a hypothetical again, and Lebron’s won without “super teams” unless you consider Kyrie Irving and the shell of Kevin Love a superteam   You are fucking with me right? Kevin Love made all nba teams in both the years before joining Cleveland, and averaged 20/12 for his entire Minnesota run. If you somehow think he fell of a cliff in 2 years at 27 then you are seriously deluded. It's not his fault Lebron didn't know how to use him, and he had to stand in the corner shooting 3's. Kyrie had one of the best finals performances ever when they won? and hit a ton of the most important shots. He was also all nba and made like 4 all star teams in those years.  &gt; Durant may have been the best player, but Steph Curry led those teams. He was the franchise always.   Again a hopeless take. Durant was by far the best player on those teams. That's like saying Wade was the leader of the Heat teams, and therefore Lebron was the second most important player on two of his championships. Wade was also the heat franchise."
"&gt; LeBron James in 2016 had co-stars who missed time pre All-Star break( Kyrie, Kevin Love)"
It's great to see kevin love actually get to use his long distance passing skills
This is reminiscent of the Kevin Love to LeBron James full court pass fade away against the Wizards.
"Golden State was way better than those Miami teams. 3 all stars and a Sixth man who played at All star level during the playoffs. Wade was fantastic until he got hurt in 2012, wasn’t the same player afterwards.  The point about Lebron is a hypothetical again, and Lebron’s won without “superteams” unless you consider Kyrie Irving and the shell of Kevin Love a superteam. Dude if you think Kevin Love was a top 15 player during any of those Cavs runs to the Finals you clearly were not watching the games lmao   Durant may have been the best player, but Steph Curry led those teams. He was the franchise always."
Vucevic is the new Kevin Love
Exactly. He tried to recruit kawhi just couldn’t. He joined the heat to stack rings but wades knees fell apart. His second Cleveland stint he traded for Kevin love who at the time was an all nba second team player the year prior. Love sucked as a third option but lebron was clearly trying to stack the deck here again. Then he trades off for more help with jr and mozgov.   Lebron just hasn’t been as good at it as Durant.
"This play went down right in front of Kevin Love as well, obviously a key component of that LeBron shot in Washington."
I love kevin Durant and im an nba fan
"&gt; First of all there’s no comparison between Lebron’s and Durant’s superteams   Wade had won the championship as the best player four years before, and averaged basically the same stat line as Lebron James on the same efficiency their first year in Miami. He made first team-all nba in  the two preceding seasons before Lebron joined Miami. He was a top 2 guard in the NBA, and one of the 5-7 best players. Chris Bosh was a 5 time all star at 26.       &gt; Kyrie and Kevin Love is nothing compared to James Harden and Kyrie   Kevin Love was 26 and 13 guy the year before he joined Cleveland. He was basically asked to play out of position for his entire run with them. Of course he isn't as good as Harden, but he was a top 15 player.   This has no bearing on whether or not he created superteams. If Lebron hadn't created super teams he probably wouldn't have any championships and he wouldn't be considered one of the best players of all time.  &gt; Secondly Lebron played with absolute garbage around him for years and years always leading his team to overachieve   This has no bearing on whether or not he created superteams. If Lebron hadn't created super teams he probably wouldn't have any championships and he wouldn't be considered one of the best players of all time.  &gt;  Durant wasn’t even the leader of the team during his championships.   After Durant joined he was the only player on Golden State to win FMVP. If you don't think he was the best player and the leader than you are blind."
"First of all there’s no comparison between Lebron’s and Durant’s superteams  Old Wade and Bosh is nothing compared to Steph,Klay,Dray and Iggy  Kyrie and Kevin Love is nothing compared to James Harden and Kyrie  Secondly Lebron played with absolute garbage around him for years and years always leading his team to overachieve. Durant has never played without a multiple time all star by his side and generally had competent teams. Lebron gets more respect because we know he can do a lot with less help, Durant wasn’t even the leader of the team during his championships."
2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers:  PG: Isaiah Thomas  SG: Derrick Rose  SF: Dwyane Wade  PF: LeBron James  C: Kevin Love
"I see it differently. MJ faced more talented competition while Lebron played teams that played at a level that far exceeded their talent level.   During Jordan's time the style of play was largely static. Teams played through their big men and the best teams had great bigs.  The game has rapidly evolved from 2011-2020. Late 2000s teams beat stronger teams by utilizing the 3. Which is why the Spurs even with an old big 3 was able to challenge and beat a young heat big 3 in their prime.   If you transported a both the 2013 heat and Spurs to the 90's and let them play an. old style of basketball. The heat would have crushed the Spurs. Curry's gravity. Multiple switchable defenders, zone defense. While all of these aren't new, they gained prominence as a response to the 3 pt era. A lot of LeBron's losses are a result of teams pushing the envelope with 3pt shooting. the Dwight magic, 2011 dallas, the Duncan/kawhi Spurs, the warriors,   I would use an analogy of racing.  MJ drove a slightly faster car than his competition. Lebron was racing when brand new race cars were entering the race with cutting edge tech. This forced Lebron to constantly take pit stops and change cars.   If MJ played in this era, he certainly wouldn't have a perfect finals record. Not because he couldn't adapt to new challengers, but because he would have to constantly leave certain teammates who's games became obsolete.  The biggest example is Kevin Love. In 2014 before signing with the Cavs, he was an All-star 25ppg 13 rpg who could shoot. At the time his game was revolutionary and he was playing plodding big men off the floor. In the span of a year, his inability to defend in space made him a liability against the Warriors."
Why do you believe Kevin Love/Bosh aren’t on the level of Klay/Kyrie? Is it just recency bias? Go compare their career numbers and accolades
"Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving &amp; Lebron James was a super team in 2015.  The reason the Warriors got to the Finals that year was because the talent level was low in the league. Like I said, transitional period, the old guard in Duncan, Kobe etc were moving on and the young guys weren’t established in the league yet.  Besides Warriors and Cavs. You had Lob City Clips, Al Horford Hawks, Lowry Derozan Raptors, Harden Dwight Rockets, Dame LMA Blazers, KD &amp; Russ who were hurt a lot.  That’s how bad the talent was. Most teams had 1-2 All Stars at most. Lebron-Kyrie-Love is 100% a super team in comparison to the rest"
Bit if both. I’m rooting for the bulls against anyone.   I also love Kyrie and Kevin Durant enough that I had convinced myself a few years ago that Boston and GSW were gonna battle in the final.   There are tons of other guys I’m huge fans of but that doesn’t necessarily make me a fan of the team they’re on.
Harden and Kyrie are not that much better than prime Wade and Bosh. Lebron also played with one of the same players Durant now has (Kyrie) and added Kevin love who averaged 26/13 before joining Lebron.   Lebron did the exact same shit Durant is doing now on the Nets. Durant is just doing it better.
Thats a Kevin Love - Bron play right there
"He’s good, but his contract is too big. He however is not like Kevin Love who is okay at best and has a horrendously huge contract. Blake is somewhere in between.   Have no idea why Cleveland traded for Drummond."
"Serious answer is that it was formed inorganically thanks to lebron’s ‘promise’ to deliver a championship. They were in full rebuild mode until LeBron arrived, then they traded their no 1 pick for Kevin love who was easily a top 15 player at the time"
I think people forgot how good Minnesota Kevin Love was
Kevin Love wasn't playing upto true Allstar standards in the Playoffs. That's like calling the current Jazz a superteam-- they aren't.
Washed Kevin love is an all-star?
"&gt; LeBron also doesn't actually design every aspect of his teams rosters, that's a myth that only idiots buy into.  He got to LA and literally shipped out a 6-year rebuild to bring in AD. He didn't sign in Miami until Bosh committed. He didn't return to Clev until they agreed to swap their #1 pick for Kevin Love. Wtf are you talking about?   &gt; Also LeBron never said some dumb shit about how superteams are bad before going and creating his.  Lol fan boys are amazing."
Kevin Love was obviously a bum 2nd all NBA averaging 26/13 the year before signing with Lebron.
There's only been two 30-30 games in the last 30 or so years - Kevin Love and Dwight Howard.   Moses Brown isn't doing it.
"Lol no  Colluded with Bosh &amp; Wade to create a Superteam in Miami. ""Not 1, Not 2, Not 3, Not 4...."". Unfortunately Wade's knees gave out &amp; he left because he knew their time had ran out.  Tried to build another Superteam with Love &amp; Kyrie in Cleveland. Except it turned out Kevin Love wasn't anywhere near as good as he thought he was. Moved to LA after Kyrie's departure.  Attempted to build his 3rd Superteam with AD &amp; Kawhi in LA except Leonard controversially decided to join the Clippers instead.  LeBron laid the foundations for team hopping and creating superteams, KD just did it better."
"Lebron joined up with Wade and Bosh, and had the best bench in the NBA with one of the best coaches. Then jumps back on a team with superstar Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, again with one of the best supporting cast in the NBA. Then goes to the Lakers with a top five player and one of the best supporting cast. Dawg."
I don't get why everyone is hating on Kevin Durant. They're just jealous of his supreme skill. KD is so good he can win a championship with this Nets team without even playing. I'd love to see Lebron or Curry lead their team to a championship without playing.
Kyrie was often injured and Kevin Love was a shell of his former self. We all see what happened with Love once LeBron left.
"Colluded with Bosh &amp; Wade to create a Superteam in Miami. ""Not 1, Not 2, Not 3, Not 4...."". Unfortunately Wade's knees gave out &amp; he left because he knew their time had ran out.  Tried to build another Superteam with Love &amp; Kyrie in Cleveland. Except it turned out Kevin Love wasn't anywhere near as good as he thought he was. Moved to LA after Kyrie's departure.  Attempted to build his 3rd Superteam with AD &amp; Kawhi in LA except Leonard controversially decided to join the Clippers instead.  LeBron laid the foundations for the Superteam era, KD just did it better."
Eeehhhh lebron created one superteam. Miami.  Kyrie and Kevin love literally never even made the playoffs before finding lebron.  And lebron joined a bumass lakers team with no other relevant stars.
"That settles it. r/nba upvoting the ""LeBron gave Kevin Love depression"" thread means that it actually happened!"
"Little bit ignorant. Dwade dropped off hard each year following 2011. By 2014 Ray Allen was the 2nd best player in the 2014 finals. Lebron went to Cleveland to win a chip against a warriors team with best bench 3 hall of famers(and eventually 4 when KD chickened out). And now him and AD, with a not that great of a supporting cast dominated the playoffs. U wanna tell me that Kevin love was as quality a “star” as Westbrook Steph harden kyrie klay and even prime draymond (maybe)"
"&gt; But people made it seem like Adams was just ""letting"" Russ pad his rebounding stats  This is true for pretty much all guard rebound though. Doncic, Westbrook, Jason Kidd etc. Guard rebounding has no correlation with winning. It is usually like 80% uncontested too.  &gt;Hes not athletic enough to be cleaning the glass like say a prime DeAndre Jordan would do  He has been the best rebounder on a couple of teams that have been number 1 best rebounding team in the league. He is one of the best rebounders in the league but doesn't get the raw stats like guys like Kevin Love or Hasan Whiteside got."
"Kevin Love  Not as good as Kyrie, but the team is way better overall with him as the 2nd option and a defender like Dray"
lmao kevin love and bosh do not compare to the third wheels of klay and harden/kyrie. its not the same
Lebrons teams have all been “super teams” as well. Lebron wouldn’t have won in Miami without all stars Wade and Bosh even Ray Allen. He wouldn’t have won in Cleveland without All Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and he wouldn’t have won with the Lakers without All Star Anthony Davis.
And he only went to Cleveland and got Kevin Love alongside Irving. And then he only left for LA and got AD.
I can’t believe there are still nephews out there that think Lebron rejoined the Cavs to “finish business”. That’s hilariously pathetic. Yeah let’s just ignore the fact that the heat were getting old and battered by the end of their 2014 run and let’s also ignore that the Cavs had Kyrie Irving (one of the best young players in the game who’s playstyle really compliments Lebron well) and enough trade assets to get Kevin Love who was absolutely dominant back then. But sure he did it for Cleveland and not because it put him in the best position to win and once again own the East so it was a clear path to the finals. You are one of the biggest nephews on here.
"I would love it if the Nets somehow could also sign Nash as a player so he can check in during garbage time in the last game when they are winning the finals and shoot a three, or ali oop to Blake or Kevin."
"Like I said even if you don't use the metric of everything going the same way, the other team has Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with nearly two minutes left in the game I'm sure they could find a bucket in that amount of time after the tension of nobody scoring had been broken, now had the block happened with 50 seconds left instead of a minute 50, I'd probably give it a little more credit, the way things stand now it was just a really pretty moment that's been drastically overrated"
"If the game plays out exactly the same Golden State doesn't score another point after the layup, Kyrie hits the 3-pointer and LeBron hits the free-throw after the Draymond foul so yes Cleveland would still win using the exact same way it plays out oh, now if you want to make the case that the layup would have broken the monotony of neither team being able to score the other team has Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with nearly two minutes left in the game I'm sure they can find a few buckets lol"
Was that the same season or the season after? I miss good Kevin Love.
Melo had the record before with 33 and then Kevin Love had 34 too.
Kevin Love had a crazy first quarter as well.  34 points.  Nobody can get hotter than Klay yet.
None. Literally none has been that good. Kevin Love had a pretty good quarter until Kyrie iced his own teammate.
"LeBron has played with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving,  Kevin Love and Anthony Davis"
"The thing about this argument of help is that players who play on more teams will have more help, because they played with more players. So, shouldn't we analyze it on a team to team basis, rather than a sum of players?   For example; Scottie and Dennis vs Wade and Bosh/Kyrie and Love. Not Pippen and Dennis vs Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, and Kevin Love."
Here’s the lists I made:  KD had:  Russ  Prime Ibaka  Young Harden and Prime Harden  Curry  Klay  DPOY Draymond  Kyrie  Iguodala    Lebron had:  Kyrie  Kevin Love (who was still good in his first couple years with Cleveland)  D-Wade (mostly injury prone Wade but he had prime Wade for an entire season)  Chris Bosh  Prime Anthony Davis  6MOY Montrezl Harrell  6MOY Candidate Dennis Schroder  Ilgauskas (who was a 2x all star)  I honestly don’t know who had more help
"Kawhi beat a prime 76ers team, Giannis, and the Warriors to win a championship. His second best player was Kyle Lowry. Lebron needed Kevin love and Kyrie Irving to do the same thing. Kawhi’s also beaten Lebron to win a championship.   He’s not even 30 yet. Lets allow him to finish his career first before you call him 25-40 all time. If he wins a ring with the Clippers he will be top 10."
"Only one other Cavs player even averaged double digits, Kevin Love, who did it on 42% eFG. That was such a hard carry if I've ever seen one"
Kevin Love is way worse
The disrespect to prime Kevin Love.
"I think gotta give that title to Ja morant. some of missed dunks would’ve been some all-timers, like the kevin love one."
KAT is Kevin Love reincarnated.
Love the twice a month when boucher decides to just become prime Kevin durant.
I couldn’t believe the shots Shamet was hitting. I’ve never seen him that hot before. Classic Kyrie. Pulled the same shit with Kevin Love back in the day.
Kevin love sucks. I should market tshirts.
Is this the alt of the guy who said Kevin Love gave LeBron depression?
"Yeah, at least Kevin Love won't take away shots from your young prospects that need development"
"https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2872952-kevin-love-trade-rumors-cavs-pf-prefers-to-be-moved-but-hasnt-demanded-deal.amp.html  Kevin Love has requested trades before.  But I also don't really see it as disloyalty, it's not like he was even drafted there. The best years of his career was with the Wolves."
"Coming from a Rockets fan, you need to trust me when I say you don’t want John Wall. Kevin Love isn’t going to take 18+ shots a game and he’s actually a good shooter."
I’d rather have John Wall then Kevin Love despite the pay difference
John Wall and Kevin Love are the 2 worst contracts.
Kevin Love  Has missed 112 out of the last 203 games
Kevin Love has no shot
What about Kevin love is loyal?
"I mean, Kevin Love being made of glass is irrelevant here."
"Kevin love only played 12 games this season, 10 if u ignore the 2 games he played 5 min in."
Kevin Love is loyal so idk. Westbrook 100%. Probably Beal or Gordon Haywood or Vucevic

The cavs had lebron and Kyrie even thought I wouldn’t classify Kyrie as a superstar every time I said he wasn’t one I got downvoted to oblivion so to everyone else he is a superstar so they had 2 superstars and a all star in Kevin love
"I’m more of just a NBA fan now  I love the warriors but I’ve also loved the heat, pacers, Celtics, clippers, spurs, Mavericks, lakers, bucks, sixers, nuggets,etc, I’m from the Seattle area so I Stan the Sonics but I’m in Oregon as of last year so the Blazers are the closest to me now.  I jump between team fandom but mostly just follow players I like   I’ve liked the warriors a lot since the monte Ellis days And I appreciate great basketball so the stretch from 2014-2016 was basically basketball porn and KD joining them was great for me because he deserved to win championships (although a giant hit to his reputation).  I love great team basketball but can just appreciate the greatness of players it would be damn near impossible to list my favorite teams   I hated OKC and wanted Kevin Durant (my favorite player since 2007) and Russell to leave from day one since WE drafted them and the okc franchise and fans were benefiting from Seattle drafting MVPs...  Since Russ left they still were a playoff team and now in the worst year of the franchise history  they have 40 picks over the next 7 years... so I’m bitter because it’s the luckiest franchise of all time but I don’t hate them anymore just wish them luck “rebuilding” with the greatest draft capital of all time  I’m just a basketball fan at this point but when Seattle gets a team back I’m gonna be such a fan it’s gonna be annoying as hell ha"
The only man that can stop Steph Curry is Kevin Love.
"I believe he means insert almost any player in the league on a max and its bad and on a min its good. Most players aren't on a max so it can still apply with all maxes being good.    Even then a ton of max players being number 1 would be really bad. Most teams with 2nd and 3rd max players are competing for the title and pay them to have the talent. Guys like Tobias Harris, Kemba Walker, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton, Blake Griffin(idk how his contract actually works out right now), Russ, Wall, Lowry, Wiggins, KP, McCollum, and even guys a tier above that such as PG, Conley, and AD. If they are maxed and the number one option your team is wasting money unless they use these signing to attract other stars who are better."
"Truth. I would pick the rookie who 4 years later was the unquestionably top pick if I had a time machine.  Until then these are all hot takes. Also opinions, even though Kevin love has won a title and had some great years in Minnesota I think he sucks. Opinions vary...to quote my favorite trashy movie."
"Even Michael Jordan, who is probably the closest player to be ""a perfect player"" only would be considered perfect if you gave him the benefit of his era and ignore 3-PT%.  LeBron James is a bad FT shooter, Kevin Durant isn't a great defender, Giannis can't shoot to save his life and Steph is a horrible defender, they are all Top 5 players in the league despite those weaknesses. People just to love to hate on Russ for whatever reason while ignoring faults of other players like Damian Lillard, who has shit the bed in three of his last four postseasons."
Why are we getting fined for resting players when we’re playing 7 games in 10 days and half of the team had COVID and is likely still recovering.  Where’s the fines for the Thunder? How many games have the Cavs let Kevin Love just sit out of?
Too bad I haven't forgot what he did to Kevin Love.
Because current Lavine is the first option and prime Klay isnt. Take Lavines averages when he was the second option behind KAT. You can compare it with second option Klay in 2013-2014. That isnt Klays prime.  Didnt you read how many problems were in the locker room when Kyrie was in Boston? A fair comparison will be Harden in rockets vs now and KD in okc vs KD in warriors/nets. Kevin love behind Lebron and Kyrie Chris Bosh? Dwade?  There are so many players whose stats go down as a 2nd option yet you can only name one anamoly.
Kevin love is listed at 6’8 and there’s about the difference you would expect between him and Durant who is 6’9-6’10. Either lebron is bending his knees or he’s a bit shorter than his listing
"2 on the Heat, 1 on the cavs, 1 on the bubble lakers.  Kevin love was average 26/12.5/4.4 before LeBron recruited him. Just because LeBron and his superteams underperform, doesn’t mean they aren’t superteams.  Even then the cavs super team only lost in 2015 due to injury, won 2016, and then were outclassed by KD’s warriors.  And I like how you said all of KD’s rings are from super teamS plural, as if he didn’t win both on the warriors."
Kevin Knox? Kevin Porter Jr or Kevin Love are def better
"I love The Mismatch, but I don't know if I agree Kevin is always the more nuanced one. Kevin has some super hot takes, and he might \*kind of\* have numbers to back them up, but I still often side with Verno because Verno often brings more context to the discussion.      But regardless, I love their dynamic. They argue and I switch off who I agree with. But the arguments never seem manufactured. They're arguing because they disagree (see ""blowing it up""), and they always stay friends afterwards. It's a fun show with a super different dynamic than the ESPN show. The Mismatch doesn't feel like they're only talking because of a contractual obligation."
“Lol why would Cleveland pay Love so much?”  “Free Kevin Love”  Funny how things change
What American white boy was a franchise WINNING cornerstone player in the last 15 years? Steve Nash.... that’s about it. Gordon Hayward ain’t do shit. And Kevin Love never made it to the finals until he joined Lebron. Who else we got? Korver was a role player. Same with Joe in Brooklyn. Really the league is only 20% white. Feels to me there’s almost a stigma. White man can’t jump?
Very true Kevin love is the only guy that rivals him in that
Jokic is young Jason Williams x fat Kevin Love
"Jokic is a significantly better offensive player, Embiid a significantly better defensive player. From a positional standpoint there’s basically nobody in Jokic’s universe as a center offensively who can man the Center position on defense.  Like you could play peak Kevin love at Center and offensively it’s not the worst comp but that’s going to get you murdered on defense.   Embiid is also a really good offensive player at C, while also being a great defender, and I do think that matters more at C, but then we get into like best non-healthy playoff LeBron Offensive player at C vs defensive value given position and...  I go cross eyed.  They’re both awesome, Jokic has been way more durable, and therefore he’s the MVP."
Yea but common buddy....No Kyrie....No Kevin Love....Delly the 2nd best layer....No finals MVP...
Yea but common buddy....No Kyrie....No Kevin Love....Delly the 2nd best layer....No finals MVP...
Kevin Love dropped 31-31-5. He also had a 45-19-6 game I believe as well a 51-14-5 game.
"I don't think anyone denies that Kerr helped, but they were really good with Mark Jackson though. They improved with Kerr but that was also because that core got a ton of playoff experience the year before and then a lot of their competition was hurt on that first run to the finals. They played the Pelicans, Griz, Houston and Cleveland who were all missing very key players for all or part of those series (Holiday, Conley/Tony Allen, Pat Bev/Howard, and Kevin Love and Kyrie). They could have very easily won that year with Jackson coaching still."
PLEASE free Kevin Love.
He forgot Kevin Love and Delly
Yeah Kevin Love and John Wall both exist.
"Bro, Kevin Love is getting grey hair wtf"
Kevin Love and Al Horford. Makes sense yes. :)
We traded Kevin Love for Wiggins.
"""actually good to see Kevin Love"""
"I got McDyess 05-06.  Followed by Jalen Smith, 2 Kevin Love years, and Boogie.  I like it."
"Kevin love elderly? Lol. Uh,ok."
"Embiids shtick was arguably a lot more entertaining, and he's obviously playing up the heel role and not simply being a disrespectful brat to his own team.  He's a 4 time all star in 5 years of playing.  Dragged the 76ers to the playoffs 3 times.  All NBA twice  All defense twice  And despite chronic injury, has been consistently in the MVP conversation.  And you wanna defend MF Collin Sextons clownery by lumping him with Joel? Tatum? Brown? Kevin Love?"
"Be mad that awfully run team drafted you. Kevin love signed the contract to help get them that team that got them one ring. You can't be mad at the guy for agreeing to a bad contact that the team offered  If I'm sexton i would put myself in his shoes and ask myself would i have taken that Kevin love money. Most likely, yes"
I mean we cant just put anybody in the HOF like you asked about Kevin Love makes me think your criteria for the HOF is pretty loose
I legitimately forgot about kevin love and didnt know he was playing again
"At this point it seems like it's Kevin Love and everyone else. He was away from the team a lot. Definitely shouldn't try to make it worse, but Love is just getting checks on a lottery team. You're also going off one or two stories from a non-competing team. Sexton not liking love doesn't change much."

"Nah. Kevin Love has been injured, weak or MIA since he signed. He acted out a few times over the past two seasons and his name has been in trade talks. This respect your elders thing would make sense if Love tried. This is coming from someone that is actually anti-Sexton as well. I don't see a big reason why Sexton should bend knee because he's his elder."
That's tank commander Kevin Love to you.
So we are just going to pretend like Kevin Love was elite for the Cavs?Ok
Kevin Love when he hears Brooklyn needs another over the hill big man in the buyout market.
"Oh Kevin, you were a guy, a top 25 guy every season, what happened too you Love"
"It's luck though. Dell Curry asked the Wolves not to draft Steph, and he also got a phone call from Don Nelson asking what he thought were the Warriors to draft him, and Dell said no but also said, it's up to you Coach.   Klay was drafted at #11 and almost got traded for Kevin Love. The ""who-to-trade"" decision between Steph and Monta was a crapshoot. Getting Draymond at #35 and then David Lee getting injured giving Dray playing time was also luck. Barnes at #9 was a decent pick, but he almost got sacrificed for Love as well. And Festus Ezeli didn't pan out.  That is a lot of luck to get to get a chip winning core that could've been derailed multiple times, with some not-so-great picks thrown in too."
"It was the 2014 offseason, right before the rings. The front office wanted to make a big move and considered trading Klay, Harrison Barnes, and David Lee for Kevin Love. Jerry West blocked the deal.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11108483/golden-state-warriors-add-klay-thompson-possible-kevin-love-trade"
I was insanely confused when I saw him with the ball. Thought ‘oh no I hope he doesn’t have bad blood since the finals!’   Then I remembered it’s Kevin Love and he don’t give a fuck.  ...then I remembered how scared I was that we’d trade Klay for him. Yikes.
"No he wasn’t, the organization and veteran players specifically are. Beilein is an outstanding coach. Kevin Love et al just don’t want to practice"
It is nice to see Kevin Love.
“Actually good to see Kevin Love...” what you haven’t seen him in 4 years either?
In 2014 Dubs offered Klay and Dray for Kevin Love. Wolves wanted Klay and Harrison Barnes... deal fell through
I feel like I haven't even seen Kevin Love since 2016
is he seriously still injured? or just perpetually injured? i feel like the whole league just accepts that Kevin Love doesn't try at all anymore at basketball and not even his coaches or teammates expect anything of him.
I was just thinking about Kevin Love today. He should go to Boston.
I remember Shaq asked what team Kevin Love was on during Inside the NBA.
"ok i know this has been asked 100 times before, but seriously - what the hell is going on with Kevin Love? has he really tried to play basketball as well as he can at all in the last like...3 years? why have i literally never seen a single Love highlight in years? i mean not a single one. or impressive stat line. does he ever score more than 15-20pts anymore? get as many rebounds? is he really just committed to half-assing his play for the last 3ish years and onward?"
Fun fact. Kevin love has played 11 games this season and has made roughly $20 mill. This dude is making $2mill a game so far this season
Free Kevin Love
Cavalier's forward Kevin love savagely slaps the hand of warriors guard Stephen Curry and warriors forward Draymond Green
This easily the most relevant Kevin Love has been in the past few years
kevin love should just embrace the grey
"christ, there was just a thread about how Kevin Love isn't in the HOF, and he has a championship. Blake doesn't stand a chance  edit: I replied to the wrong comment woops"
Shout to Kevin Love making 30+ million
"The Timberwolves also couldn't even crack .500 in the years Kevin Love was there, your point being?"
Kevin Love looks like a completely different player from just a few years ago.
Reggie Miller led mediocre Pacers teams on playoff runs repeatedly including a finals appearance. Kevin Love led Minnesota to the lottery and was a relative non-entity on the Cavs.
"His best statistical years were spent in Minnesota where they couldn't even crack .500  He got a ring in Cleveland alongside LeBron/Kyrie but played a much more supporting role, his statistical output also decreased greatly.   Since then injuries have basically ruined his career, and when he has played in recent years you'd think Kevin Love is closer to retirement than LaMarcus Aldridge  If people are saying no to LMA (5x All-NBA &amp; 7x All-Star) then Kevin Love is definitely not HOF material"
"The longest streak of double-doubles since the merger was 53 games, achieved by [Kevin Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love), then of the [Minnesota Timberwolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves).      &amp;#x200B;  This kind of stands out."
If Kevin Love can get his own HoF thread so can my boy Rodney
"nothing stands out about kevin love. good player who was the 3rd option on one championship team, &amp; hasn't done anything since."
How did Kevin love age 17 years in 3 years ?
"LMA achieved way more than Kevin Love, to get as many All-NBA selections as a forward considering the talent he was up against is no mean feat  LMA (who I don't think is 1st ballot tbh) is still a much more deserving HOF candidate than Kevin Love"
No to Kevin Love hell no to LaMarcus
"Alex Caruso, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kevin Love, Gordon Hayward, Sam Dekker etc"
Facts. And then Kevin Love out here throwing tantrums on the court but that's cool lol. Shoulda just busted him down to the G-League for a stretch and let it be.
Kevin Love wasn't kidding when he said this guy looked like a top talent and ready to step his game up. This dude at sf eith sexland as a backcourt and Allen as the C would have been an amazing core 3 4 yrs down the line
"Dumping KPJ is much easier than dumping Kevin Love with 2 yrs and $60m still to go after this, especially considering they bought out Drummond so already have $30m of dead cap this year lol"
Hard to beat Baynes for us lol  Kevin Love gotta be up there too
Let me know who’s willingly gonna trade for Kevin love on that contract
At least we have Kevin Love....who is actively quitting on the team
Explain to me why Kevin Love got 120 million? Because he was the only person who wanted to play in Cleveland?
Kevin Love
"I would put Kevin McHale in your Kevin list ahead of Love.   Kevin is definitely the best. Only two that’s even close would be Michael and Chris and MJ would be carrying the Michael team. But you have like Conley, Finley, Redd, Cooper, and some solid role players. No C though. Chris you can have Paul, Bosh, Webber, Mullin, and find some other Chris from the playground."
"I think it definitely has to do with how he held himself with OKC. That team was meant to be a bottom feeder. Instead of whining and complaining for a trade to a contender, he kept his head down and lead them to the playoffs. I mean we have seen how much of a diva someone can be (Kevin Love for instance) when they don't like the hand they're dealt."
"It would be easier if someone other than LeBron or the Warriors won over the last decade. The Raptors sneaking one against a super-injured Dubs team is the only thing that would keep the champs in it. Imagine if the champs have to go to the well for old-ass Rondo, JaVale McGee, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, etc. instead of Kawhi, Siakam, Lowry, FVV, and the option of Norm Powell/OG Anunoby"
"&gt; My entire point is that if Kevin Love could be plausibly be the best PF in the league without even being able to lead his team to the playoffs once (compare that to, say, a certain earlier best PF in the league who played for the Timberwolves) then it reflects pretty poorly of the entire era  No, that would speak to the overall quality of the league. A borderline top ten player wasn't enough to get to the playoffs. Way to insult my intelligence when your point makes no sense.  Griffin was really good during his prime. The Clippers had absolutely no chemistry, but to say Griffin wasn't even close to the best bigs in the game is just false. You could argue that a bunch of guys were better than him, but none outclassed him."
"lebron, kevin garnett, iverson, carmelo  love the fact that bron and melo are still playing at a high level, i feel old af"
"&gt; You weren't watching basketball ten years ago.   This is the absolute most boring response. I’ve been watching basketball since the mid nineties.  Ten years ago was probably the period of time I watched basketball the least but yes, that’s because I didn’t think the product was great at the time.   And   &gt; Before joining LeBron, Love was putting up like 25-12-4 with the T-Wolves and was seen as the best PF in the league.  this doesn’t exactly speak well to your logical reasoning abilities. My entire point is that if Kevin Love could be plausibly be the best PF in the league without even being able to lead his team to the playoffs once (compare that to, say, a certain earlier best PF in the league who played for the Timberwolves) then it reflects pretty poorly of the entire era.  Can easily say the same thing for Carmelo, though not quite as extreme.  Griffin was never close to the best big men of this era (unexceptional creation ability, not a good defender) even playing with one of the few best pure point guards in history."
Not gonna sit here and let nephews act like Kevin Love isn't one of the best outlet passers of all time
So Kevin Love gets no credit at all for working his ass off for a 1% chance to get into the NBA? He still has to get to the NBA to make the big bucks you know
"I dont hate Lebron. I just hate fans like you who constantly put down other greats, calling them choker and stuff. So Im just here to remind you that your daddy Lebron isnt a god and he do choke as well.  Why the heck are you talking about kevin love lol Its currys stats since you called him a choker lmaooooo"
He had one bad game against Delly. You’re not going to convince me Steph performs worse in 2015 on offense if Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving are getting 30 mins a game a each and getting dragged into actions over and over again
"man just listed ""former teammate of LeBron"" on his resume in this interview. man..Lebron got Kevin Love PAID. What a bag, congrats to Love."
"It feels like you’re arguing more against some imagined position where I’m saying all of these guys are trash (obviously, they aren’t) than the original assertion that it was a temporary lull in top-level talent in the league.  I even call out that that there were plenty of all time greats who played at this time, just that they were pretty clearly on the wrong side of their aging curve (either too early or too late).   Like, Kobe was simply not as good in his 30s as he was in his 20s. In his final two postseasons his efficiency fell off a cliff compared to the two championship runs before that.  2012-2013 was better but also, self-evidently, unsustainable.    You actually seem to agree with me that the big men I mentioned are better than Dwight so I’m not sure what needs to be said there.  My very hot take is that a smart team in 2021 would use Dwight almost exactly like Gobert is used today.  The idea that Dwight was actually a pretty good offensive player is mostly revisionist history; he was an all time great lob finisher and offensive rebounder, but never better than mediocre in the post (and his demand to get post touches hurt every team he played on).  He is, inarguably, much, much worse on offense than any of the players I mentioned.   And come on, we both know that all the players I listed are much better than any of Love, Griffin, Bosh, Rondo, Aldridge, Parker, etc. It’s become fashionable to acknowledge how ahead of his time Bosh was but the guy made one all-NBA team in his whole career.  He was a fringe top 15 player in his own era, which makes it look even worse when we see some of the other players who snuck onto all-NBA teams during this time. The most useful thing he adds to this discussion is to show exactly how overrated Kevin Love was in comparison.   You certainly can try to apply a similar argument to eg Kemba Walker but there are just a lot less of those examples now than there were before.  Even if you go past the 10 players I mentioned you still have guys like Lillard, Irving, Butler, Tatum, Zion, Paul George, Gobert, Beal, etc. Most of these guys aren’t even going to sniff an all-NBA team this year but they would have been shoo-ins for a 3rd team spot or better in basically any of the aforementioned years."
If Kevin Love makes the hall of fame then I could never ever take the HOF seriously again. I already feel iffy about T-Mac making it while never getting out of the first round but Love would be an all-time low.
"you forget that lebron stacked 3 stars in miami? or that he joined cleveland a team that had just gotten two number one picks and all their picks going forward. they could've traded for anyone, but lebron chose kevin love which was a huge mistake. Then he chose to join the lakers in free agency and was unable to recruit kawhi to join him with AD.   Lebrons just not a good gm."
That's Tank commander Kevin Love for you. Now the second best Kevin in Cleveland
Kevin Love is seriously 0 for 8 with 0 points lmao holy shit
Nets pick gave Kevin love depression
"2014 is actually his weakest case, just FYI. The lockout year he actually had an argument (not even close to consensus still)  Aldridge, Griffin, Davis, and your friend Dirk Nowitzki all had legit cases ahead of Kevin Love.  Aldridge was the best PF that year"
Kevin Love made himself rich and famous lmao
"Wins. Kevin Love has never been able to lead a winning team, even in the regular season."
"&gt; The players you listed that would have been top 5 in 2012 would not have been top 5 in 2011. Wade, Lebron, Kobe, CP3, and Dwight  I think there's a typo in what you wrote, but many of those players now are playing at a higher level than Dwight has ever played (Giannis and AD are both easily better than Dwight ever was, for starters), and higher than Kobe in 2011 who averaged a ho-hum 25/5/5 on 55% TS.  &gt; This would be the top 10 in 2010-2011 time; Kobe/Lebron/CP3/Wade/Dwight/Dirk/Duncan/Rose/Durant/Carmelo.  I used the year 2012 so let's go with that (it's slightly better towards the late 2000s as you get more into the prime of Kobe, KG, Duncan, Nash, Dirk, and others).  Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Kobe were clearly past their prime by 2012 (and had a much greater dropoff in production than, say, LeBron at a similar age).  &gt; Some notable guys left off the list include Rondo(lead Celtics to a 7 game series against 2011-2012 Heat), Chris Bosh, Griffin, Love, etc.  I don't see any argument that any of these players are anywhere near any of the players I listed.  Bosh, Griffin, and especially Love (who joined Cleveland at 26 in what should have been his absolute prime and then was instantly revealed to actually be a pure good stats/bad team player), are not as good as Giannis, AD, Jokic, and Embiid (to name the big men alone).    The early 2010s also included other all-NBA selections like David Lee, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Zach Randolph, Joe Johnson, Tyson Chandler, etc.  Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge made all-NBA teams virtually every year during this timeframe.  Again, all perfectly fine players, but none of them are anywhere near the players I mentioned, and none of them had any significant success as the best player on their teams (not even talking about success in terms of 'titles' but even 'winning playoff series').   &gt; Also the pace and scoring was also just much lower back then  I do think it's easy for pace and scoring to inflate our opinions of some modern players (e.g. if you took Zach LaVine's stats and put them in 2012 he'd look like the third best player in the league or something), but everything indicates that many of the guys I mentioned are having much more impact on their teams winning than, say, LaMarcus Aldridge or Kevin Love or Chris Bosh were doing in the early 2010s."
"fixed:        # [Haynes] Kevin Love: ""I could be that guy that pushes a team really over the edge, puts them into championship contention in China."""
Julius Randle this year is better than 2013-2014 “peak” Kevin Love
"Kevin Love was a great post player but Lebron doesn’t play well with post up bigs since he needs space. So of course K Love lost weight and became a stretch 4. Lebron wanted another Bosh, not a K Love. LeGM in action."
"Minnesota Kevin Love is the most overrated player in recent history. He didn't actually make his team that much better, and proved it when he became a spot up shooter in Cleveland. AD didn't face the same fate! Because AD is an actual elite player"
"In retrospect the amount of talent in the league is a lot higher than it was in the early 2010s.  Sure, there was prime LeBron/Wade/Paul and the early part of Durant’s prime, but also a bunch of players who never got over the hump and players from earlier generations who were clearly past their peak.   In comparison, in the past few years LeBron and Durant have still been playing at a high level, and there’s also players like Harden/Curry/Davis/Antetokounmpo/Leonard/Doncic/Jokic/Embiid, pretty much any of whom would have been playing at a top 5 level in the league circa 2012 or so.   It’s possible some of this is availability bias — maybe we’ll eventually think of Damian Lillard like Kevin Love if he never wins anything, but Lillard is miles better as a player than Love was."
"Zac Collins is essentially a younger Kevin Love (not Minnesota K Love, just Cavs K Love if he was younger)"
"Kevin Love - if locked in and playing at his best - could absolutely  fill that role. He'd be a solid rebounder and floor spacer. And if he's coming off the bench, you have a guy that can help spread your offense."
Kevin love maybe bosh hell no
"The difference is we all work at expendable jobs, Kevin love is in the top 400 at what he does in the entire world. I know everyone’s trying to make a point but it’s silly to compare any normal job to a professional athlete"
... I genuinely don’t believe that you watched basketball back then if you think Kevin Love was a positive in the series.
"Tristan Thompson averaged more points per game than Kevin Love in the 2016 finals.  If it wasn't for ""The Stop"", Klove wouldn't have even been a positive player for the championship he did win."
Wade went from a 30 point scorer to 22. Bosh went from 25/10 to 17/7. Kevin Love went from 26/12 to 17/10. Huge production drop offs once they joined Lebron.
he was saying that the teams that would offer kevin love more money and minutes would be teams that are trash and in that case there'd be no reason for him to leave. The sixers would therefore be a more likely landing spot. That's how I interpreted it. Idk maybe I'm wrong and he's being an ass.
Believe what you want. Bottom line is Wade himself said he had to sacrifice a massive amount of his game to fit in with Lebron. The same thing happened to Kevin Love and Chris Bosh.
"yes, someone should trade for Kevin Love for his lockdown defense."
He was barely the player he described in 2016 let alone 2021. In 2016 his minutes were reduced in the playoffs for the likes of Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye.  Kevin Love would be unplayable in the playoffs for any legit contender.
[Kevin Love built his dream home in NYC.](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/inside-basketball-star-kevin-loves-waterfront-tribeca-apartment). He owns a unit over Michelin Star Perry Street in the same building as Hugh Jackman (saw him while eating 2 years ago).
Damn these kinds of threads coming out right on time what with the Kevin Love shit recently
For 2 minutes Kevin Love turned into the greatest perimeter defender of all time
Don’t forget when Steph Curry would shoot every time Kevin Love was guarding him..... The guy hasn’t been good since Minnesota
I think that quote is correct. Kevin Love was robbed.
"It's complicated, b/c our organization has been pretty bad and was notoriously terrible during most of Love's tenure (the David Kahn years). Kurt Rambis, the hand-picked coach of Kahn who coached us for two years, also did not get along with Love, and Rambis was a terrible coach.  Having said that, Love had issues with teammates at several points, like once with J.J. Barea and Dante Cunningham: [link](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1916845-kevin-love-slams-jj-barea-and-dante-cunningham-for-sulking-on-the-bench). Here's also what Rubio said about him back in ~2014 or so: [link](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2073914-is-kevin-loves-trade-demand-the-minnesota-timberwolves-worst-nightmare):  ""Kevin (Love) is a special player. I mean, his numbers are amazing but maybe our leader must be another player. He is our leader in scoring and other things but vocally he is not the type of player that wants to be or that can be the leader. There are many kind of leaders. I think that he was not the leader we needed vocally. Perhaps Kevin Martin could have been our leader because he had more experience. Perhaps I could take a step forward to be the leader.""  So not exactly a ringing endorsement.  There is the ""knuckle pushups"" incident of 2012. Right before the 2012-2013, Love broke his hand supposedly doing knuckle pushups, though many were skeptical if that's what really happened. He missed most of the year during a season where we were supposed to take the next step forward.  Lastly there is the infamous late 2012 Yahoo! news article: [link](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--kevin-love-remains-unsure-about-timberwolves--future-200009299.html), where Love kind of publicly slammed the organization and his teammates. Granted, we did suck at the time, and a lot of what the article says is true (e.g. the somewhat insulting way Kahn offered Love a contract extension) but I and many other T-Wolves fans were pretty pissed off that he took all that public.   So TL;DR: we were (and in many ways still are) a trash organization, and some of that was not Love's fault, so I do feel bad for him in some ways. However he also attracted criticism and controversy a few times during his tenure with us, and did not appear to be a good team leader."
Kevin Love is absolute trash. He was only carries by James. No defense and mediocre shooting.
"His sense of duty and stuff is probably a bit warped. I’d hustle hard as shit to earn 5 years worth of salary in one game because thats a huge bump for me.   For Kevin Love and others, it’s just “normal” pay."
"I'm saying the reasoning is faulty.  Imagine a player gets caught cheating on his wife and someone comments  ""I mean Magic cheated too so let's not act like Kobe is a bad person"".  Cheating is bad.  Just because Magic, who has done a lot of good things in his life, got caught cheating doesn't make cheating ok.  Same here.  Lebron has done a lot of good in his life, but saying disingenuous things for PR isn't a good thing.  People who do that shouldn't get a pass whether its PG, Lebron, or Kevin Love."
RIP Kevin Love
Another fun fact: Kevin Love has never sniffed the playoffs without JR Smith
"If anyone deserves a Kevin Love sized ‘thanks for the ring’ contract, it’s him."
Kevin Love to the Indians confirmed
Fun fact: Kevin Love has never sniffed the playoffs without LeBron
Damn I had no idea Kevin Love had ties to the Beach Boys
Kevin Love to The Rock 'n Roll Hall Of Fame confirmed?
"Lol. They were bad defensively because they were starting Kyrie Irving, Lebron, JR Smith and Kevin Love. They were still 11th in defensive rating out of playoff teams. You should go back and watch those playoffs because they were horrible defensively. Their defensive rating in the playoffs was worse than their defensive rating in the regular season.   Those Finals games could’ve been a whole lot closer if they had just focused more on their defence. Their were possessions where they weren’t even trying, they just left guys open. Even when Klay, Curry and KD weren’t all on the floor together."
I mean LeBron said and says this too and he left twice so let's not act like Kevin Love is a bad person
"Chase Budinger, Alexey Shved, AK47, Nikola Pekovic, Kevin Love, Ricky Rubio  With Timberwolves legend Coach Rick Adelman. What a squad"
"To add to this, everyone knew they would go to shit anyway and will go full rebuild mode. Cavs tried to salvage the remnants of Lebron by paying Kevin Love"
Kevin Love has to act like this every play to get criticism from ya'll. Most other players would get torched for doing something like this just once.
2017 is the only year Kevin Love was even a consistent factor in the finals so I'd say 2017 Cavs in a tight 7 game series
Are you forgetting that Kevin Love missed game 6 (essentially) and game 7?
"Yes, but he was seen as a great coach due to his innovative new offensive system. And you can say that about most superteams. LeBron, Kyrie and great role players. Kevin Love was not better than even young Horace Grant"
"I think there is video of KD from few years back watching HS prospects and when it got to LaMelo he basically was like ""ya this dude gonna be tough in the NBA once he learns the game the right way"". And now LaMelo was ballin out before his injury.   [Source](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/kevin-durant-breaks-down-lamelo-balls-game-love-his-game-because-hes-skilled/)"
"People didn't even watch the full thing.   KLove got pushed out of bounds and he was pissed off about the non-call. Although i think Kevin Love would love to get out of Cleveland,i don't think its a big of a deal as many people are making it out to be."
"I dont know if its unpopular, but Kevin Love shouldnt be totally crucified for what he did. The fact that everyone is acting like he killed someone is pathetic considering players have done far worse than that and this sub has given them a pass."
Kyrie Irving who didn’t make the playoffs before LeBron and Kevin Love who disappeared in the finals = teaming up with a 73-9 team that has multiple hall of famers and the reigning league MVP  Why would LeBron try to stack the deck against a team he just humiliated in the finals?
Gtfoh. You act like Lebron didn’t joined a team with Kyrie Irving and draft assets to trade for Kevin Love. Lebron tried to stack the deck too but the Warriors played the game better
"Lol ok, he’s locking him down harder than Kevin Love did"
At no point did I defense Kevin love. Please go back and read the actual words written. It wasn’t only love who Was to blame. And stop responding. You’re obviously just a troll who doesn’t want to actually have a conversation.
"I think Kevin love should’ve, you know, made a pass instead of just slapping the ball when the ref tossed it to him.  Idk why you’re so eager to defend KLove over such a clear tantrum he threw. Doesn’t mean he’s some evil guy but he was clearing being a little bitch."
&gt;Cops don't give a shit  If that was Gordon Hayward and Kevin Love standing there they would have brought the whole police department and FBI to find out who smashed them with bottles
Steph finna throw the ball like Kevin love
They need to pull a Kevin Love lol
Maybe in the late KG or the Rick Adelman Kevin Love years but no way were they gonna get any better during the David Khan years lmao
"Kevin Love my have questionable health and physical fitness. Still, his past behavior gives him the benefit of the doubt in my eyes. I really think this whole incident is being blown out of proportion."
&gt; move on from the Kevin Love  yes...  &gt; incident  ...and no.
"Your argument originally had to do with the Lakers draft record, not how they managed those assets. You're changing your argument and I honestly have no idea why you're being so abrasive about it...we are just talking hoops after all. I would argue that a top 5-10 player like AD is almost invaluable, and he proved that in the playoffs last year. If that was the minimum that the Pelicans would take then that's what they had to pay. The Pelicans certainly didn't need to trade AD and they made it abundantly clear that they needed an offer they couldn't refuse to let him go. Kevin Love as good as he was is certainly not Anthony Davis, and Wiggins was considered by some to be the next superstar...they traded him before he played a day in the NBA. And the AD trade worked out pretty well for both sides, so ultimately what is more draft picks and pick swaps worth for a championship? I would say not much.  You're not even making the right arguments if you're trying to poke holes in Lakers front office moves, there's plenty you can bring up like not resigning Brook Lopez for peanuts, the aforementioned Zubac trade, the Luol Deng signing (who they are STILL paying, LOL), basically every free agent move in LeBron's first year (Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley, etc.)."
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  So I said... eh, was it drafting assets? Or were they just bad for a long time and had some shit they were able to package with a shit load of future picks? You come back at me explaining how they really were drafting well this whole time, but what.. they suck at asset management? I'm confused.  &gt;Julius Randle was the Lakers best player in his last season there, averaging 16/8. They let him walk in free agency as he was in a redundant position with LeBron  Huh, so they drafted a great player, he turned into the best player on their team, and they let him for nothing? That sounds like bad asset management. Maybe you're on to something.  &gt;D'Angelo Russell was a good player for the Lakers (15/4/5 at age 20). He allowed them to get out from under Mozgov's contract which was killing them. For better or for worse his weird Snapchat snitching thing with Nick Young made the rest of the locker room turn on him  So DLo was another good player for the Lakers. They did a great job drafting him 2nd overall in your opinion, and he was playing great for them. They new he was a great player, but he offended Swaggy fucking P. So they traded him after two years in a salary dump move. Clearly another example of excellent asset management.   &gt;Nance and Clarkson were definitely salary dumps but they also created the cap space that allowed for LeBron to get signed. Both were decent with loads of potential. They also got a FRP  So another two young players, loads of poential. Traded in salary dump to clear future cap space. They got the 29th draft pick out of it. Another excellent example of drafting and asset management.  &gt;Zubac I have no idea why they traded him, that was a terrible move he was really good for them  Fair  &gt;Ingram was definitely not disappointing. He had a potential career-ending injury his last season with the Lakers but was their second best player his last year there. He got better every year and his potential was obvious  &gt;Lonzo like Ingram couldn't stay healthy. Can't say he was worth the #2 pick but I think most teams would have taken him there  Here's the thing. I personally cannot square the notion that BI and Lonzo were good 2nd overall picks if they had to be packaged with a #4 overall, 2 more FRPs, a FRP swap, and Josh Hart. Look at the value of other top picks *when they actually hit.* Look at how much value young tatum had. Or how much value Ben Simmons had. Or so many other young stars. When guys actually hit, you don't need to have such a massive haul in a trade for a disgruntled star. Cavs were able to trade Wiggins and fucking Anthony Bennett for Kevin Love. And that still doesn't erase all their other fuck ups."
"I argued that I've never paid attention to the refs inbounds pass. For all we know, that could happen all the time, but we never notice because they didn't throw a tantrum like Kevin Love.  Tonight, I'll definitely be looking at this during the warriors Mavs game."
"Kevin Love and serviceable defense don’t belong in the same sentence. Outside of that one play where he guarded Curry pretty well, Love has never been an above average defender or even an average one."
"I’d disagree and I’m biased but context makes Rose’s mvp really impressive. Comparing MVP cases year to year is idiotic in the first place but I’m really sick and tired of people who never watched the NBA that year talk down what a player he was.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.

Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do.

Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA.

"""Cav ownership.  Suck my balls."" - Kevin Love"
"Kevin Love wrote an article saying he was sad because he suffered from 'Imposter Syndrome' maybe he's just an imposter? K Love is sus. I'm voting K Love, sorry dog I love you but I didn't see you doing any jobs and you sabotaged the team by smacking the ball to the other team. (secretly I am the imposter muahaha)"
"Swatted the ball away he was supposed to be inbounding which the Raps immediately converted to a 3 while he walked away complaining  I know he's frustrated and being petty but Kevin ""No"" Love cracks me up with his 'over this shit' antics. See also when he lasered a pass full force overhead at a teammate outta pure rage"
tbf it's easy to not realize fat twolves kevin love is the same person as lean supermodel kevin love.
"Kawhi, CP3, Kyrie, and Kevin Love were all injured during some of your title runs."
The Kevin Love contract that keeps on giving
"Sadly most people only consider these things real if it's somebody they like or respect. Look at how people in this very sub are talking about Kevin Love recently, some minimize his depression/anxiety issues or make jokes about them. Paul George is hated on relentlessly so people mock the panic attack/depression issues because they're shitty and don't know where the line is"
"It's shocking he wasn't taken out of the game and cut on the spot.  For a pro to do that is just wild.  That is a cancer to a team full of young guys.  I thought Kevin Love was awesome in Minnesota, but those days feel like a career ago."
&gt; Brandon Ingram &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick &gt; &gt; Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  BWAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH  FOR ANTHONY DAVIS  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  17TH RING  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH  Pure clown shoes partner.  All you can argue here is that Lakers made some trades at the time that didn't turn out.   You abandonded your argument about Lakers drafting poor because you know you got spanked with the examples I gave you.  Lmfao enjoy Kevin Love and your ace managment in Cleveland.  I smell a first round exit in the playoffs... in like another 15 years.  Kings of the east.  literally
"Tobi is actually good in the right system, Kevin Love hasn't been an all star in years."
"The intent of the rule was to elucidate that the player must control the ball from receiving the pass - for example, not fumbling it. Kevin Love made intentionally made contact with the ball. It didn’t slip out of his hands. Because the ball did not go where he intended does not mean that he did not have control of the ball. No where in the rule does it discuss the players intention. You are comparing the actual result with the intended result, and equating it with control. Take a tip back shot, if it goes in another direction should it not count as a shot attempt?"
"I believe in that too. I've been a fan ever since the Kevin Love days. KLove is a wolves legend, we just couldn't win. If we made the playoffs or had that suprise season like we did in 2004 with Love, i think he couldve won MVP. But he didn't. The thing is this franchise has failed to build around KAT. Adding DLo and Ant help. Same thing happens with many other stars like Zach Lavine."
To be fair Chris Bosh is and was better then Kevin Love at pretty much everything except inbound passing and rebounding.
"Not trying to argue, do you think Kevin Love is a hall of famer? He has those qualifications. I’m not sure if I would vote either for Hall of Fame, but i feel like if you can’t really make the case for one without the other."
I totally agree. Both Wade and especially Bosh deserve credit for that too. They both accepted roles that were worse fits for them personally to make that team successful. Kevin Love also got the Bosh treatment and handled it well although the perception that Love was worse than we thought was more deserved than it was for Bosh.
"About to drop some knowledge on you from a different thread, please hold:  I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined.

Kevin Love
"it's funny how everyone clowns on that ""Lebron gave Kevin Love depression"" post nowadays when it was one of those things that got 10k upvotes, not some random shitpost that was downvoted to 0"
An adult for Kevin Love to talk to?
"That’s really not a fair assessment to make though. You could make the same argument for the 9-10 seeds not getting a chance at all. I could understand a team “underperforming” and clearly not playing hard but you can’t say teams like the Warriors, Mavs, Lakers, trailblazer, Hornets, Pacers etc. are just simply “not trying”. That’s the most asinine things fans say and it pisses me off. Not trying would look like Kevin Love lately. Just because a team isn’t one of the best in the league doesn’t mean they’re not trying. Hell even the players on teams where management gave up and they’re tanking are still trying."
Wall has been arguably a negative for the Rockets this year (and I love John Wall) and yes he has? Every single player on every team he's ever played on (except MAYBE Kevin Durant) speak super highly of Russ as a leader and how he gets the best from his guys. Top 20-25 range is debatable but I would put him there still
"Hey Vivek, you know what would make your team great? Veteran leadership.  Someone with a championship ring, and a few all star appearances to boot. May I interest you in a gently used Kevin Love? Your 2021 first round draft pick doesn't know what it's like to play with LeBron, Vivek. You can't draft a player who's beaten Steph in the finals, Vivek. You know you want to."
"Its not my style to look into other peoples profiles, i dont care that much lmfao.  Pretty sure star player injuries were a huge factor in the 2015(irving, kevin love) 2016(curry, bogut), 2017(kevin love, lebron james) finals so imo those arent really all that impressive the Miami Heat and Spurs finals were way more competitive and exciting because all the star players were nearly 100% in every one of them."
First option Kevin Love was the carrying LeBron
Kevin Love is not good he makes Kuzma look like an all star
"Kuzma is not good as a first or second option,my lord. Still better than Kevin Love though."
&gt; and getting locked up by Kevin love in the finals  LeBron got locked up by JJ Bera in the finals
Who’s acting like LeBron is the most hated? Curry is def over hyped and loved by everybody. ESPN can’t let a minute go by without talking about how amazing he is. As if leading a team to the playin game is some fantastic achievement. He’s just not on the same level as LeBron is but the Stephews like to argue that he is despite not having any finals mvps and getting locked up by Kevin love in the finals
Terrible effort by Bledsoe.  Kevin Love of the Western Conference.
Kawhi leonard as cyborg  Paul George as Booster Gold   Russell Westbrook as the the dazzler   Dame lillard as cat woman   Kevin love as night crawler  Chris Paul as Wonder Woman   Karl Anthony towns as  hawk girl    Trae young as moon knight   Luka as squirrel girl  Boogie cousins as also cat woman for some reason
i will never forgive him for what he did to kevin love!
Kevin Love worse
"Ahh yes, 5 games before the playoffs every year when Lebron’s team sucks and the 12 year old Stephews on r/nba say he’s done.  My favorite tradition   I once let this website convince me that the 60 win hawks were gonna beat the Cavs because lebron didn’t high 5 Kevin love or that the he couldn’t handle the west before he straight back door swept everyone on the way to the finals"

Can’t be worse than Kevin Love
Hardship = rostering Kevin Love
"Lol I don’t think this thread is gonna go well for me. My comment was definitely kinda uppity, and I see how a lot of people took it wrong. All I wanted to suggest, was that it doesn’t really make sense that Kevin Love would leak this sorta stuff, a 12 year vet with a max contract and a pretty quiet agency.  These types of leaks almost always come from younger guys looking for bigger opportunities, with Agencies kinda encouraging turmoil. Best example would be Terry Rozier, confirmed to have leaked a ton of stuff from that Celtics team a few years back."
kevin love is a starter. He was really good here
~~Kevin Love~~ gave LeBron depression  Raptors
Kevin “Glen ‘Big Baby‘ Davis“ Love
"Ricky Rubio, Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, KAT"
We will trade you Kevin Love for two slightly used basketballs and one of those circle mop things they wipe the sweat off the floor with.

Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"So in 15’ they would play like who the rockets or Memphis? Are Kevin love and Kyrie still hurt? If they are... does he win this? Maybe, probably I guess. Definitely if they’re healthy. We’ll call that a win ‘16 he would go against OKC. Definitely not a guarantee he wins this I would probably say this is a loss but I guess it’s a toss up. ‘17 is gonna depend on where KD goes, maybe he stays with OKC in this universe if they win in ‘16. In which case Lebron would go against either OKC or the 61 win Spurs since I’m guessing Kawhi doesn’t get injured without going against Zaza. Is that a win? Idk I guess 50/50 here. ‘18 they would go against the 65 win rockets who took the warriors to 7. This is a for sure L it’s honestly wild lebron even brought that 18 cavs team to the finals they were not very good. So in conclusion: ‘15 is a W. 16’ and 17’ are toss-ups so let’s say he wins one of these and loses the other which seems fair. And ‘18 is an L. So without Steph Lebron likely has 1 more championship I would say."
Do you really like Jarrett Allen would be treated differently by cops compared to Kevin Love???? /s

"Must be Kevin Love. Because we know what the punishment for Sexton would be if they were cops. Or Jared Allen because they would feel ""intimidated""."
There's a reason the Cavs are still playing Kevin Love but wouldn't play him
https://uproxx.com/dimemag/timofey-mozgov-cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-rocky/
The Shanghai Sharks are going to love Kevin Knox next season.
"I just mean that personally there was no point where I actually believed the Blake Griffin we saw in Detroit was the Blake Griffin that we’d see playing for a title favorite. Just like if Kevin Love were bought out and signed by the Lakers a month ago nobody would expect to see the same Kevin Love who misses 90% of games, slaps the ball to the other team for a free 3 pointer, and plays 25 minutes without attempting a single shot like we’ve seen with the Cavs.    Look at Rondo playing for the Mavs compared to Rondo for the Lakers in the playoffs. We’ve seen so many examples of players who truly don’t give a shit on one team and then play like stars when they’re on a playoff team."
You haven’t seen Kevin Love recently then lmao
I feel you man. I got this feeling in 2011   All under 25 players in 2011   Dwight howard   Cp3   Derrick rose   Kevin durant   Russell westbrook   Kevin love   Andrew Bynum   Rajon Rondo   Brandon Roy   Tyreke evans   Blake Griffin   These guys had me excited for the next decade    The future of the NBA is currently really bright.
"*statistically*  Dirk is my favorite player ever man, I know how good he was. It's okay to acknowledge people being statistically equivalent; hell Kevin Love was statistically equivalent to prime Dirk in his 2014 season, that doesn't mean he was as good on offense lol."
KEVIN LOVE STRIKES AGAIN
Somebody save Kevin Love
"A number of things, but the [slugs thing in particular](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/01/10/after-ncaa-success-john-beileins-rocky-season-with-cavaliers-has-gone-bad-worse/).  It's a bummer too because for anyone who knew John Beilein during his time in Ann Arbor, ""playing like a bunch of slugs"" is 100 percent the type of thing he'd say. He surely had an edge to him when needed but generally he gave off strong Mr. Rogers vibes.   &gt;In early December, the Athletic reported the Cavaliers, who are 11-27 entering Saturday, had “drowned out” Beilein’s voice. Their complaints included his exacting communication style, his unusual terminology for play calls and his lack of familiarity with NBA personnel. Within weeks, Kevin Love, Cleveland’s highest-profile player, was the subject of relentless trade speculation as his frustration with his younger teammates’ abilities bubbled over repeatedly during on-court incidents.  &gt;But that was child’s play compared with an ESPN.com report Wednesday that noted Beilein had said the Cavaliers were no longer playing like “a bunch of thugs” during a film session one day earlier. In subsequent interviews, Beilein was adamant he had meant to say that his players were no longer “a bunch of slugs” in reference to their improved energy level and competitiveness.  &gt;“I called all the players afterwards and explained the situation,” Beilein said. “We met about it, and I apologized. I apologized about it today as well. It was never intended. The players understand that now. It’s something I have to learn from: enunciate better and be clearer with my intent.”"
How quickly we forget Minnesota Kevin Love
"no he didnt, was always massively overrated because he was on the team with Lebron and he is white. or is that Kevin Love? oh, both"
Probably Kevin love leaking trying to get all the bad press off him. Funny how this comes out the day after he dishes out 8 assist too lol
"They won because kevin love and kyrie irving didn’t play   When they did play, they blew a 3-1 lead in the most dramatic fashion in sports history, right next to playoff p and kawhi collapsing last year"
Probably Kevin love

"&gt;And the current lakers are way better than the 2017 cavs so it’s actually not different at all  Current Lakers are 36-27, 6 seed, 1 game out of a play-in, and AD has been garbage all year. The 2017 Cavs were 51-31, 2 seed, and had Kyrie, LeBron, and Kevin Love. Are you trolling at this point?"
Didn’t draymond sit in his car crying for KD after curry choked and got locked up by Kevin love In the finals? Lmao sad af
"Kevin Garnett   I love everything about him. As an undersized Center playing HS ball, I “modeled” my game after him by watching non stop clips of him. Love everything he was about as well.   Currently it’s Russ.  I guess I just like guys who play hard.   Honorable mention to Dwight. Never stopped rooting for him."
"Big men aren't as good at getting the ball out (unless you have Jokic, Duncan, prime Kevin Love, etc.), a prevalent defensive transition strategy is to deny the easy outlet pass so it would be slower most of the time."
"I think if the Cavs can reach an agreement with Kevin Love, we should try to get him.  Lonzo is a good fit, doubt he wants to be here though.  Also don't might DeMar for 3 years if he comes at a reasonable price, still got legs in him."
2021  -	Kevin love 24 minutes played on average and has only played 20 games this season (!) -	Jarrett Allen almost 30 minutes played and 54 games this season.  Kevin has glass bones and paper skin. He wouldn’t survive in the playoffs past the first round
"I guess if they're really lacking in rim protection. I just think smart, veteran  basketball + a really stretchy pf is being underrated really badly.   Kevin Love enables a team to play 4 out, makes transition offense so much better, and is just a smart player. I value this more than Jarrett Allen 2021 but ill concede theres probably a place Jarrett Allen is more valuable"
This is untrue. Jarrett Allen can contribute more than Kevin love to a playoff team
This is an insane take imo. Kevin love can contribute to winning basketball more than anyone else on the cavs by a wide margin.   He's just not a part of their plans &amp; they're choosing to develop talent
Kevin Love? More like Kevin Apathy.
Kevin Love wounds       And maAaArks
The funny thing is he'll probably get more playing time than Kevin Love the rest of the season.
"Cavs fan. All members of the title squad are pantheon for me, so I'm a Love defender. My way of looking at it is this: Kev took that extension with the caveat that he wanted to stay competitive (https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2018/10/kevin_love_needed_assurance_th.html).  *Six games* into that first season, they fire Ty Lue and go full tank. With management not prioritizing winning, Kev requested a trade two years ago that obviously never came to fruition (https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/12/09/report-kevin-love-wants-cavaliers-to-trade-him-to-contender/amp/). Since then, the Cavs have traded nearly all their vets or let them walk. I'm sure seeing the Pistons straight-up waive Blake Griffin for the remainder of his massive deal earlier this year is all the more frustrating for a guy who is clearly not in the long-term plans for this organization and has wanted out for years.  To an extent, I get that you honor your contract, and that players have to make the best of their situations and stay positive. I also get that from the Cavs' point of view, there is no net-positive way out of this situation. But I also think that to Love, that Cavs extension was made on false promises, and that he likely expected to be taken care of in the event that they could not remain competitive due to that promise, and due to his status as a pivotal piece on that championship squad.  I think everyone is in agreement that both sides have needed to move on for a while now. Kev has been working a job for a dysfunctional employer for three years and can't do anything to change it. He most likely doesn't have a ton of time left to contribute to a good team at all, and he has to spend at least the next two years playing for a team that doesn't want him. I'd bet I'd get a little pissy too, if I'm being honest with myself."
Nah Kevin Love has that role on lock.
Kevin Love playing with Lebron actually masked a ton of his decline cause people just blamed Lebron for his lack of production. He lost a lot of weight that 2015 season and subsequent years and his ability to post up bigger players suffered a bit and he's always injured so it's impossible for him to get into a real rhythm and improve his game. He's better than he is this season with the injuries and not giving a fuck though but he's far removed from his Minny days
"Tbh this situation is kinda sad. Kevin love is known to have mental health struggles and if a player can be sat out for a bs ""rest day"" they should do a psych eval of love and see if he needs time off/treatment. Mental health is as important as physical health and anyone who has gone through serious depression before knows being forced to do something means you're about to put in as little effort as possible just so you can get home and crawl into bed again."
CJ McCollum + ?? for Kevin Love trade inbound this off-season
Kevin Love trick y'all man
You guys are acting like this is the only time kevin love has had attitude issues with the cavs
"I miss theis, I’ll never forget the time he cooked Kevin love"
Kevin Love has a resemblance to Justin Timberlake. Def from the same tribe.
"I also wonder. What's stopping Teams from paying the players when they obviously don't give a shit? Like if Kevin Love was an employee, he'd be fired months ago. I understand there's a contract but this mans attitude is really depressing to look at."
Kevin Love Bites
Kevin Love hurts  Kevin Love scars
Ricky Davis or Kevin Love?
"I really don't think Kevin Love tried to put that ball into play. I think he was trying to get a T, and if he did no one would have cared. On the other hand Love has look disengaged (in past years) and I can agree about his whiney-assness about those instances but I think this was blown out of proportion."
The Kevin Love stopper
He's just there to do what's Kevin Love supposed to do.
Harden without Chris Paul playing never won a game against the Warriors either. Give Lebron Chris Paul instead of Kevin Love and see what happens.
"Want and able are two very different things. Which all star is going to get traded? The only possible two are both on Chicago and that seems unlikely considering Chicago made big trades to build their current team.   You can maybe get Mike Conley. Seriously go through the last few years of all stars and tell me who you’re getting. Or better yet tell who is someone teams want to give up on? Baring some sort of trade demand, I don’t see it happening organically. You will end up with Kevin Love in a buyout."
This is purely a veteran presence move. After the Kevin Love incident
Think Kevin Love ended up with 40 that night. How do you stop feeding a guy who dropped 34 in the first quarter?
Kevin Love pushing the Cavs for that underdog #1 overall pick too
"The Kelly Olynyk special. That guy's got a knack for tangling his body with other people on the basketball court. You've got guys like Ersan who made a career out of taking charges, but nobody's got the bodycount that Kelly Olynyk has.  Even throwing away the obvious Kevin Love shoulder stuff that Kelly has in his past, he's always getting his feet under guys leading to twisted ankles."
"how do you define ""miss"" when the goal was to freeze kevin love - I'd say he ""hit"" on that goal"
"I remember Kevin Love had 34 points with about 1.5 minutes left in the first quarter, just three points away from Klay's record. Kyrie proceeds to go down the court and take shots on three consecutive possessions, ignoring Kevin completely. Kyrie missed all of them"
We only acknowledge one Kevin in this house and it's not Mr. Love
"The East is so royally fucked if KD and Harden are healthy, it's not even funny.  I love me some Giannis and Embiid, but neither have shown that they can will a squad into the NBA Finals and that was before there was team in the East that was stacked.  Last time i saw Embiid in a high stakes series he averaged 17 ppg on 37% FG to lose in 7 and we all know how Giannis flamed out in the last two years, now they are playing against freaking Kevin Durant with Kyrie and Harden as his sidekicks."
And keep notorious locker room guy Kevin Love 😔
"Because everyone acts like the Cavs did absolutely nothing wrong here. KPJ fucked up, no one denies that. But everyone acting like the Cavs are saints in the whole ordeal are just extremely ignorant and it's annoying to keep seeing people agree with.    Cavs won one fucking ring off the back of the GOAT and apparently they have a ""culture"" now where they're able to ship off talented players for nothing.    But even without KPJ there, the locker room still seems toxic with the whole Love ordeal so at what point is it not the Cavs fault? Where's the winning culture they're building cause apparently it hasn't been working since LBJ left.   Look at the fucking Jazz for example. Remember the shit with Gobert and Mitchell that everyone on this fucking sub was acting like it was irreparable? Oh fucking wait, our organization knew how to be patient and allow for players to fucking grow and deal with their emotions. Now we're the 1 seed in the NBA while everyone thought our window was closed because Gobert and Mitchell couldn't play with each other anymore.    KPJ can't even legally drink yet. He's a young adult with clear mental health issues and had a traumatizing childhood. Look up the shit that happened with his dad and tell me you'd be able to come out of that without any issues. He got thrust into the premier league of his sport at a young age and was given millions of dollars and was just expected to know how to act properly. Fuck that, organizations have to do better than that especially an org that has Kevin Love on their team. He's the fucking advocate for mental health, yet the Cavs failed so hard at helping KPJ deal with his mental health.    Now as I point that out, everyone's going to come back at me and say, ""Oh, he's given special treatment for doing illegal things blah blah blah."" Well special treatment is given to plenty of people in this country for doing things even worse than what he's done. It's called white privilege, but no one's ready to even have a convo about that in here lmao."
" &gt;32 isn’t that old if you ask me  What if you ask DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, or Derek Rose? They all seem pretty far from their peak. They are all 32."
Lol I wish this was true for Kevin Love
They should totally take Kevin Love from us and play him at center.
"this is pretty ridiculous. you give lebron the excuse of not having kevin love and kyrie the year before.  but you don't give steph curry the excuse of having a significant nagging injury that immediately dropped his play off a cliff and draymond green being suspended for barely anything.  steph was injured. the warriors best player was injured. those are the same metrics you used for giviing lebron an excuse but you don't give curry that excuse.  &amp;#x200B;  lebron should have won 2015, barring injuries; steph should have won 2016, barring injuries. they're even on these fronts."
"Seeing as Indiana really need a proper 4, we will consider making a huge sacrifice and trade 5 x All Star, NBA champion Kevin Love. All we ask for in return is Oshae Brissett and TJ Warren."
Imagine how many rebounds Kevin Love could have amassed if LeBron didn’t give him depression
Yeah Kevin love Steph curry dad
"Fun fact... Joe Harris is good friends and still hangs out with a lot of his college friends, who are mostly semi nerdy / semi douchy NYC finance people.     I love imagining Joe going from practicing and hanging out with Kevin Durant, Kyire, Harden straight to a bar with a bunch of people no different than any of my own friends and doing the same shit we did in the city"
"im anti trade kemba (makes no sense to move him for a worse contract or give up picks) , but in the case of an expansion draft this summer (i doubt it would happen this year anyway), i think it would be smart to see if some team grabs him since it would open up our cap flexibility with the Jays earlier (summer of 23 probably). expansion team more likely to take kemba than john wall or kevin love too"
The Knicks killed it this year AND they’re entirely homegrown. It’s crazy how much of a difference coaching can make  - The Suns added point god - The 2015 Cavaliers added LeBron and Kevin Love - The 2008 Celtics added Big Ticket and Ray Allen
"Because you rarely have bigs with the court vision and bbiq and passing abilities to a) spot the opportunity and b) make the pass. Sure, if you've got ATC Jokic or an all-time great outlet pass guy like Kevin Love, you can definitely do it. Most teams don't, though - just like most teams don't have an elite guard rebounder like Westbrook.  The other advantage is that if you go back and watch those ""Adams is boxing out for Westbrook"" Thunder games, you'd see Adams move down the court immediately. That drags the opposing big with him, instead of letting him jog down the court at his own pace. It may not be a lot, but it does help wear him down a bit if he's not as well conditioned. Kind of like what you see in HUNH football with offensive lines who move fast and leave DTs sucking wind."
That Kevin Love contract might finally leave
Yeah because kyrie and Kevin love were hurt
I'm certainly willing to grant you that getting Bill Cartwright is on part with teaming up with Chris Bosh or Kevin Love.  Or are you referring to the draft picks that Chicago developed in to All Stars in Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant and Toni Kukoc?  There's a difference between playing with and developing the guys around you and winning it all vs running to a different team already set with all stars to win.
Larry Bird would be low budget Kevin Love in today’s NBA.
You mean the Kevin Love who just kinda said fuck it during an inbounds pass and let the other team score an easy bucket?
Better show it to Kevin Love!!!
Like why am I even surprise at this point. This sub thinks LeBron give Kevin Love depression lmao.
"Bro he wasn't saying it made him the goat, it put him in the convo. Jordan clearly had a better resume at the time. Draymond only missed one game, then lebron dropped 41 on him again then a triple double on him in game 7. Pretty sure kevin love missed a game as well"
"I opened this thread expecting to see people clowing her for this stupid take, but instead it's just a bunch of people agreeing. Reminds me of the time I opened the ""Lebron gave Kevin Love Depression"" thread"
Kevin Love is the ultimate curry stopper.
Mo Bamba led Orlando in scoring 4 times?! Did I miss something? Is he good now?  Also Kevin Love is still active and led Cleveland in scoring twice? I coulda sworn he didn't even play this year.
"As recently as the '11-'12 season Randle would've been 5th in scoring behind Kevin Love and top 9th in '17-'18 behind Irving, scoring has skyrocketed the past 2-3 years. Going through year by year, what stood out to me the most is the curve; that is to say, before scoring jumped in the last couple seasons you'd have a couple guys in the extreme echelons of scoring (27.5-30+) with most others 24 or lower, and often with the majority of top 10-15 scorers hovering around 22. Now it's a smooth curve, there's practically a player for every digit of scoring."
Klay Thompson for Kevin Love
Kevin love and jj barea
"No, you have to be a bronsexual if you even think that. They all contributed and played major roles in winning a chip. It was not just Lebron, like yeah he was the best player on the team, but to think that he carried players like AD, Dwade, Bosh, Kevin Love, and Kyrie is just fucking laughable."
"so u are telling me he carried AD, Dwade, Bosh, Kevin Love, and Kyrie lol."
Well I mean if Kevin Love donated to white owned businesses you think the reaction would be the same?
KEVIN LOVE PUT SUM RESPECT ON HIS NAME!!!
"The issue with analyzing any player is that there's 2 very distinct ways to analyze players:  1. Through the lens of how good they are innately. 2. Through the lens of how good they are in relationship to their contract / cap space they take up.  I really like Wiggins. Through (1) he is a very good player. Through (2) he's overpaid but still a good enough fit for the Warriors that it works. People hating on Wiggins were/are primarily hating on him because of (2). He's not a max contract dude. No one (I think) is going to argue that Wiggins isn't worth a vet minimum contract. His worth is somewhere in the middle.  Blake Griffin/Andre Drummond/Kevin Love are horrible in regards to (2) with max contracts but for the most part, still a steal for a vet minimum.  IMO so much confusion of a players ""value"" or ""skill"" revolves around people talking about a player through these 2 different lenses and getting into ridiculous arguments when in reality, 1 person is arguing through lens 1 (their innate value), and the other is arguing through lens 2 (their value in relationship to their contract)."
Ahh yes All Star Kevin Love. How has he looked since LeBron left?
"I’m not saying there’s only one way to play the game, just that there’s an interesting way and an uninteresting way (imo). The interesting way also made it easier to be a fan of a team over an individual player. Reggie Miller was a Pacer. Kobe was a Laker. What the hell is James Harden or Kevin Durant? I don’t care about these players or whatever team they’re on this year. I guess I just love the game I grew up with. It isn’t that anymore."
Kevin Love. He was putting up monster numbers on a okay Twolves team who couldn’t crack it in the West to being third fiddle to Lebron.  Same with Chris Bosh. Sacrificed so much to play with the Heat.
"Lakers 2019 had Ingram, Lonzo, Hart, KCP, Kuzma, etc. Current Warriors would take those guys in a heart beat.   Cavs 2018 had another all star in Love (who had to play suboptimally all those years subjugated as a 3 pt shooter) and the best shooting roster in the East. Boo hoo LeBron only had 1 other all star rather than the usual 2. What great competition did he face in the playoffs? Oladipo? Rookie Tatum? Craptors?   &gt; In an interview with Bleacher Report, Bosh claimed that it will be ""extremely frustrating"" for Kevin Love to play with his former Miami Heat teammate, LeBron James. ""It's going to be very difficult for (Love),"" Bosh said in the interview.  Cavaliers from 2004-2010 were stacked with defensive specialists (all-nba defense caliber), multiple former all stars, multiple all rookie, etc. It reached its peak in 2009 with the Cavaliers shooting 41% from 3 excluding LeBron's percentages, basically unheard of for that era. It was a roster catered around the LeBron system. Their shooting elevated LeBron's drives even better than the early Miami Heat years. Those rosters are only 'mediocre' compared to the historically stacked rosters LeBron has had the pleasure of playing with."
"K Love magically declined on the Cavaliers. Why? Because he had to become a spot up shooter like Bosh, subjugated to the LeBron system.   &gt; In an interview with Bleacher Report, Bosh claimed that it will be ""extremely frustrating"" for Kevin Love to play with his former Miami Heat teammate, LeBron James. ""It's going to be very difficult for (Love),"" Bosh said in the interview."
Kevin Love gave KD depression
same for alot of us dude.  i love all 3 of these dudes.  tim obviously cuz i was raised in SA but kevin and kobe were on a whole other level of intensity.  Tim brought some cold assassin level of intensity but the swag and demeanor of kevin and kobe was different.  i loved this era of basketball so much because of these 3 guys.
That’s cool and all but nothing will top winning 73 games then choking and having a flat earther hit a clutch dagger three in your face then get locked up by a depressed Kevin love.
"This is Chris Bosh we're talking about, one of the fastest small ball 5. He might not have rim protection but he is a great defender. He is also definitely better than Kevin Love."
Curry couldn’t even get separation in ISO against Kevin Love 7’ behind the 3pt line when it mattered
In a contract season…I wouldn’t mind being traded  to the team that maxed an aging  Kevin Love
I mean it depends   Are we talking like   Basic Ass white boy attractiveness: Tyler Herro  Most attractive overall: Blake Griffin  Controversial Pick: Deandre Jordan  Or you are actually confused if he’s just an model on an extensive photoshoot and not an actual NBA player: Kevin Love  Or if you have a ostrich fetish: Chris Bosh
"Oubre, Kevin Love, PJ Tucker are all good looking dudes"
Steph Curry couldn't shake Kevin Love.
Kevin Love
Hence why i said use playoff ppg instead  Mans said depressed Kevin Love tho LMAO that's a good one ngl
Prime Kd averaged 35 in the finals curry got locked up by depressed Kevin love
Freedom of Movement GOAT! Take that Kevin Love!
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron’s effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie’s exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron’s people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA’s other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn’t pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
too bad we didn't get to see that bc Bron has ring chased his whole career and traded Wiggins for Kevin freacking Love
Too good a resume and he’s much better than the Mitch Richmond types.   I remember when everyone woke up in 2012 “holy crap I guess Bosh is a g’tee HOFer”. Lol  Kevin Love is also a HOFer.  Some people in the HOF are worse than others. Who knew?
"Not long ago this sub said Lowry was a hall of famer. Lowry and Love have had similar careers. So, I guess Kevin Love gets in regardless."
"Then I guess players like Kevin Love deserve to get in too. Chris Bosh's inclusion diminishes the achievement of getting inducted. From Kobe, KG, and Duncan to Pierce and Bosh..."
"Bosh is not a hall of famer in any other sport, let alone first ballot  you get that much worse in the playoffs? guy was straight up abysmal, averaging 12/7 in his prime   i get the dude put up numbers in toronto, but this says to me that Kevin Love has to be a Hall of Famer and i don’t think he is either  there isn’t a single person who watched both who would rather have Bosh over Amare, it’s impossible to think otherwise  not even trying to hate on Bosh that much, but damn  basketball hall of fame is a joke"
"Can’t get something nobody was offering.   Trust me, I know Harden is worth more than what we got. Even Kevin Love got Andrew Wiggins back fresh off being picked number one and still had all that hype.   But nobody was offering a number one overall pick and every day we didn’t trade Harden at that point, better offers weren’t coming in. A better market never materialized.   Even the potential Simmons trade creates a team with a weird fit that is likely never better than a mid tier team."
"To an extent sure, like Kevin Love. But that is definitely not the case for most players since the majority don’t have a roster spot secured. Additionally, the best players need to try to secure their payday, so maybe there are a few who mail it in but not a significant amount by any means"
Love me some Kevin Harlan. It blows my mind that he leaves the NBA playoffs every year to focus on football commentating.  He’s become more unhinged during Covid and made nba broadcasts more enjoyable with his random facts. He could convince you of anything really too.

I blame Kevin Love
What bout this?  Kyrie  Michael Jordan  Lebron James  Kevin Love  Ben Wallace
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
Shades of Kevin Love
Kevin love is getting paid 30 million dollars and  he's not even cleaning the toilets at the Q
Trade him for Kevin Love
Kevin Love just off the top of my head.
"CP3 &amp; Westbrook were all-nba so I don’t think that’s a good comparison. Not that many contenders have big enough salaries to match Horford’s, because their money is already tied up to their stars/core pieces.  Horford’s better than these guys, but I’d say his situation is closer to Kevin Love, Drummond &amp; Aldridge (before the buyouts), who were all on the trade block but no team bit, instead of CP3 and Russ."
"He’s in the Kevin Love tier of practically unplayable players.  The Thunder are legitimately paying him to not play games because he messes with their tanking blueprint.  I remember he was actually playing well for a stretch, which I don’t think the Thunder expected and then they pulled the cord out."
They could win if Kevin Love actually showed up and played like an all star. I say it goes 6 games at least and Warriors most likely win barring a historic Finals by the Cavs.
Better Kevin Love than JJ Barrea
No it was his teammate donkey crying in the parking lot after his mvp teammate got locked up by Kevin love
Wtf happened to kevin love tonight does he just skip every other game nowdays?
Kevin love - cavs
"No, one has AD the other Kevin love"
Anthony Davis is just Kevin Love with a unibrow
you mean when Kyrie and Kevin love were injured...
"Is this a joke lol. What did we do beside draft, sign, and trade for good players, make 5 finals, and win a ring? Lebron came back because we could surround him with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and good to great role players. Sorry we can’t all pass up the chance to avoid drafting a generational talent like Luka after tasting cavs ass for 2 decades like the hawks."
"Bennett got cut by Minnesota, who had just lost Kevin Love to the Cavs. How bad do you have to be to get cut after just 2 years of your rookie contract, and by a team that desperate for any young pieces at all"
Kevin Love was aggressive as hell on the TWolves. This comparison makes no sense.
Unibrow Kevin love
"You're right. Their demeanor reminded me a bit of Steph in game 7 vs the Cavs.. just not feeling it. Shots not going in, fire doesn't seem to be there, throwing careless passes out of bounds, clamped by Kevin Love/Ayton, sonned by Kyrie/Booker. Just a bad look both ways"
"You see this is the shit people on this sub ignore. Why does it always seem like whenever lbj gets super star players or the role players you just mentioned they magically start their decline and LBJ is just running with trash? Everything on his teams runs through him entirely, and I find it hard to believe that Bosh, Wade, Kevin Love, and Davis all just happened to take a shit a year or two after player with Lebron and turned into inconsistent swamp ass teammates. It’s the same story every goddamn year"
There is a bit of truth to this. The issue is that Lebron commands the offense to such a large degree that when he goes out the offense becomes stagnant - this has been true since Miami post 2011. I mean are we gonna sit here and always act like Lebron is taking a heap of trash to the finals each year or is it that the offense is so centered around him by design that once he goes off the floor there’s no real game plan.  Wade had a good bit left in the tank in 12 and 13 and same goes for bosh. Kevin Love same story and now look at AD. Lebron certainly makes role players better but has always seemed to have other stars struggle with him. I think at this point with AD it’s no longer a coincidence.
They sucked though? Kevin Love had a 50% TS% in the playoffs? He just carried them despite their suckage
Kevin Love tried his best. Oops I mean AD
5-16. 5-16. Jesus maybe the Bubble really just benefited us. Can’t believe I saw Kevin Love play with Bron again.
AD for Kevin Love right now who says no??
Lebron missing Kevin love
Not at that angle. He pulled and backed up. Not quite to the Kevin Love tear extreme but it's a dangerous play.
Kevin Love got his shoulder separated on that exact same play.
Right I'm dead.  Same type of play that Kevin love got his shoulder disclocated on.
It’s not the fall… Chris did a version of what Kevin Olynk did to to Kevin Love.  Locking someone’s arm up is dangerous. These guys are strong as fuck and that’s how you tear muscles.

"Lebron has had Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Kevin Love, and AD. just stfu bro you don't know what you're talking about."
"Pippen was a top player in the league for like 5 years before injuries caught up to him, before that he still had a lot to prove getting manhandled in those Detroit series and before THAT he was a developing young player who had small minutes  Jordan was winning MVPs and DPOY long before Pippen got there, you can’t seriously convince us one Scottie Pippen = D Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Anthony Davis without sounding like a fanboy"
I mean Kevin love was an all star player and he did have Kyrie Irving. Lmao like why pretend that he was carrying bums.
"I watched Lebron go to the finals with Kevin love and JR smith lol. I dont want to hear it, that Nuggets squad is more stacked then ever and won most of their games at the end of the season without Murray.  The least Jokic can do is make it out the first round."
"He's an incredible, generational offensive player but he's also a worse rim protector than Kevin Love. Can't be everything lol"
Klay for a whole season is worth 6 more wins. At least. That would put them at 4th or 5th seed. Depending on which teams lose some wins. So yeah just getting him back makes them a legit threat to the top 4 of the west. They need one more good add really. Could they get Sobonis? Could they get Kevin love and feed him only fast food for months. Creating fat Kevin love; aka Proto-Jokic. Idk. Probably not. But who knows.
"I traded Dragic to the Mavs in 2k MyLeague and Kevin Harlan always says ""The Slovenian backcourt pair"" when they start together. I love it when sports games program things like that"
It's like Cavs' big 3 era. Kyrie as Kyrie. KD as Lebron. then you replace Kevin Love with fucking James Harden. That Cavs team dominated the East every year.
I love that camera shot of Kevin Durant just chillin next to the basket lol
"So you guys didnt deserve your first win cuz kevin love and kyrie got injured? That wouldve made a huge difference. You guys had so much luck not dealing with injuries and ruining the balance of the league with having kd. If your team is made to be extremely top heavey and your top guys go down, you will crumble. One of the best talent in the league is availability. You guys got lucky to have such deep runs without dealing with any major injuries until 2019."
"Haha fat  Y'all realize this isn't any better than ""LeBron gave Kevin Love depression, right?"" You should be just as embarrassed by this post"
"I never said he wasn’t the best player on that team, but you’re acting like he carried that team which is extremely untrue. That was a team win if there’s ever been a team win. FVV bailed his ass out a few times with clutch ass 3s and good rough defense on Steph. That year the Warriors sacrificed depth for an unbeatable starting 5, losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson is NOT comparable to losing Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. Especially when there’s no depth because you have 4 stars eating up cap space."
"Yeah, just trade him to Kevin Love straight up and I'll be fine with it."
"Kevin love was washed that playoffs. Given LeBrons health, I’d take them getting a chance at the 8 seed, even in the west. No different than what curry did."
Kyrie and Kevin love...   The spurs smoked them proves my point. That team coasted through 2 .500 squads and a broken down pistons team. Point is put LeBron on this warriors squad and there's a 0% chance he gets to the finals in the west this year or that year. Period.
Wiggins had 22 and 10 while playing good defense. Dray had a triple double while being maybe the best defensive player in the league. Poole gave him 19 off the bench. Juan was a +11 in 31 minutes despite only scoring 4 points.  Steph is MVP and can’t even beat the fucking Memphis grizzlies with his teammates giving him that? Give me a break. Superstars figure out how to win games. LeBron has made the finals with fucking Drew Gooden and washed ass Kevin Love as his second best players. Kobe took the Suns to 7 games starting Smush and Kwame next to him. Steph can’t even make the playoffs with Dray and Wiggins playing well. Don’t act like he’s MVP and then give him a pass for this. That’s pathetic.
"Unless Kevin Love is going to have a massive resurgence, we are paper thin in the post. When you have in the conversation for BPA, fit and need become most important"
I have the final vs the Warriors if you want it. The block. The shot. Kevin Love like a man possessed covering Curry
Curry would have won the title if the opponent didn't show up with Kevin Love.
"i didnt the mods did  here:  I've seen so many people putting him over LeBron for current best player this year, when he's not even above Kevin Durant (both currently and all-time). If Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were hurt in the 2012 Finals (like Kyrie and Love in 2015) and KD had Kerr instead of Brooks, he would not only have won the Finals, he would have won Finals MVP, something that Wardell Stephen Curry has never been able to do. Additionally, if you replace Kerr with Brooks in 2015, then the Warriors not only would have not won the finals, they wouldn't have even made it past Memphis (which is funny considering tonight)."
and people hated lebron for wanting to trade wiggins for kevin love
It's Kevin love... literally every season.
Kevin Love. Sup
Just remember that people believed LeBron gave Kevin Love depression.
Kevin Love is as valuable as a role player for winning.
1. Dirk Nowitzki   2. Steve Nash  3. Rik Smits  4. John Stockton  5. Larry Bird  6. JJ Redick  7. Steven Adams  8. Kevin Love  9. Brad Miller  10. Bill Walton
"lol have you listened to his podcast? He talks about his struggles with depression, how he always has a constant fear of not performing for games, when he had DeRozan and Kevin Love they had discussions about this. I'm 26."
Massively underrating Kevin Love and completely ignores all context ab that finals series
1. Jimmer Fredette (hometown boy)  2. Kemba Walker  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Dirk Nowitzki   5. Kevin Love  6. Luka Doncic  7. Miles Bridges   8. Hakeem Olajuwon   9. Nikola Jokic    10. Devonte Graham
"One of the Cavs young guards, Kevin Love, and a lotto protected first round pick for next year. Would throw in Jarrett Allen on a sign &amp; trade. Conditional on Kevin Love approval because he is a franchise legend."
Kevin love for sure . Big contract and that crap he did with the inbounds pass few weeks ago
You just said that salary is an irrelevant point yet your first critique of Kevin Love is how he was paid 32 million dollars for 25 games 🤔
"Demarcus, Kevin Love, Horford,and Porzingis."
"There are a lot of bad contracts that could use an amnesty: Kevin Love, John Wall, Al Horford, Steven Adams just to name a few"
they need to bring back the amnesty so cavs can get rid of kevin love
"https://kingjamesgospel.com/2018/08/07/cleveland-cavaliers-remember-kevin-love-injury-prone/  This article is from 2018, just before he signed the contract. He had 22 different injuries and 2 surgeries up to that point."
"Good post OP, love the breakdown. Kevin Love is still my LVP, man gets paid too much to look so disinterested on the court and have a bad attitude. Use to root hard for the guy but wouldn’t want him anywhere near my team"
"I think we should be able to hold Kevin Love’s contract against him and hey gets my vote. It’s not a guy’s fault if a team pays him a lot of money and he’s hurt, but if he acts like a baby about the situation then it’s on him.  Kevin Love for Least Valuable Investment. Or LVP = *LeaVe, Please*."
"This is amazing, kudos OP. But I would love to see salary thrown in as a metric (like a ratio of production/salary or something).  Basically a measurement that shows who’s the biggest waste of money in the league. Maybe different from this, but Baynes isn’t paid that much relative to others (like Kevin Love) and would that should count for something imo"
I’m going Kevin love
Haha what are you smoking!? LeBron played with prime Dwayne Wade and Kyrie Irving. Chris Bosh and Kevin Love. Fuck.
Bosh came off of 0 point games. And everyone thought bron needs a forward to rebound and shoot. Kevin Love went on to scoring 0 in the finals also
"I still don't understand the thought process behind giving Kevin Love that contract to begin with, it never made a ton of sense. This certainly seemed like a feasible outcome."
"Enjoyed reading your write up, had a few laughs. I’d vote Kevin Love, and getting paid $31Mil to boot, ooof."
"This.  Seriously, it would set a bad precedent for teammates if Porter, Jr got away with throwing a [hissy fit](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30735990/sources-cleveland-cavaliers-look-trade-waive-kevin-porter-jr-outburst) over that.  And before everyone chimes in with what about Kevin Love, well, there were literally like a [hundred million reasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/loveke01.html#all_all_salaries) to keep him on the roster after his insubordination."
"I used to like him and I understood why they gave him that contract. I loved what he did for mental health awareness but now I almost hope we don't buy him out next year because I want him to be as miserable as possible and punish him for quitting on us by not allowing him to sign with LA or the Nets. I don't care about the Block anymore, I hate knowing that Kevin Love is still on the team and I want him gone ASAP no matter how bad it fucks us over financially. I'll be mad if the Cavs give him a tribute video when he returns to CLE for the first time because he doesn't deserve it after everything he did after LBJ left."
He was coming off a 26/12 season lol. The dude was a rebound machine for a few years there.  Minnesota Kevin Love and Cleveland Kevin Love are two very different players.
Wtf made Bron think “Yeah I want Kevin Love”
What is up with the Kevin Love clip circulating like it's on him. He's checking the ball.
Kevin love should be the front runner for this on a continuous basis till Cleveland fires him for cause
"Took the words right out of my mouth. Part of me hopes we don't buy him out next year so he doesn't get to run to a winning team for the vet min after quitting on us for all these years. I don't care what he did in 2016, I hate the fact that Kevin Love is still here for at least another year. He doesn't even deserve a tribute video at this point."
When you wanted to lose Kevin Love had the ability to make you win. Baynes has zero of said ability.
i mean idk about the cap hit but kevin love costs a shit ton too
"The first GSW title they faced the Cavs without Kyrie and Kevin Love? That's one of the biggest injury asterisks in Finals history, aside from maybe the Raptors title..."
"they didn't buy out john wall though, or CP3.  cause if the wizards did that they would have to pay him 90 million dollars over the next 2 seasons  it's different from drummond who was on the last year of his deal.   kevins deal is multiple years for a lot of money, the cavs would be on the hook for all of it if they buy him out.   drummond is already off the cavaliers books, they are totally done with their obligations to him  maybe houston can take kevin love too if the cavaliers will pay them a bunch of draft picks.   because they plan to be bad for the duration of john walls contract.  they might buy out his deal in the last year too because they will have absorbed all the damage from that bad contract already by that point"
"CP3 is clearly a very valuable asset and it's not hard to argue that he's worth his contract, he's been mentioned in MVP conversations this season  That john wall trade was awful for houston IMO, westbrook is so much more valuable than him.   It's not john's fault though he is legitimately a good player when he is healthy  Unlike kevin love who gives you no value, he's never gonna get another 100 million dollar contract, would you give up 30 or 60 million dollars to go ring chase when you know you aren't going to get a payday like that ever again  So maybe kevin love has value to a tanking team?  You have to plan to suck for a long time and cleveland would have to pay you to take him.  And I don't think kevin would be very happy there either  He might get bought out in the last year of his deal then he can go ring chase and he still gets his money"
"drummond only had one year on his deal, love had 3 for even more money  drummond is probably more valuable by every metric than kevin love also, even if drummond is a negative kevin is an even bigger negative"
I see your Kevin Love and raise you Andre Drummond.
"like it didn't work for kevin love, nobody wants his contract  cavaliers probably dont want to pay him millions to play for someone else so he doesn't get a buyout  so he will just be pretty bad and make a lot of money until his contract expires"
"No, fuck this guy for injuring my Kevin love back in 2015"
Is this a good way for a team to get rid of a bad contract like John Wall or Kevin Love?
He was not a very solid performer for us  Also he gets shat on cause Kevin Love
Kevin Love got a concussion in game 2. Not convenient for you to mention that though  https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15983799/2016-nba-playoffs-kevin-love-cleveland-cavaliers-elbow-head

"It’s because he has a history of doing so.   Who else has scheduled a special with espn to announce their move following free agency? Anyone other than him? I haven’t seen one but admit I could be wrong if I missed someone else doing so.  The decision is one clear example of an all time media blunder but also shows how intentional he is in controlling stories and how typically it’s done in a narcissistic manner.  His comments related to China are another example and have aged particularly poorly.   It’s like Kevin Durant with his burner social media accounts-love them both as players but they are not going to get the benefit of doubt while they show patterns of behaviors.  They also don’t need our approval in how they act with the media.  It simply explains why people assume he is crafting a narrative with his Steph comments, because he shows patterns along those lines."
"It started when Curry couldn't shake Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson. Two bigs he routinely abused anytime they had single coverage on him. It's clear that injury affected his lateral quickness and agility. People always say things like Curry is going to age so well because he doesn't rely on athleticism, they don't realize how much he relies on his quickness and agility. Things like that and stamina will def be affected when a player ages, Steph is one big injury away from looking like JJ Reddick."
or Kyrie and Kevin Love missing the entire series the year before. Not to mention love got a concussion from one of your dirty-ass players in game 2 and wasn’t the same the rest of the series but he was still good enough to stop the choker curry and leave draymond crying to call big brother kd

"I don't think those are the rules. I know you're just asking hypothetical question, but what Kevin Love did was no different. [https://streamable.com/9w1o1a](https://streamable.com/9w1o1a)"
"Miami wasn't a trio superteam, more like an legendary duo in Wade+Bron, with Bosh as a 2nd-tier star player that wasn't playing like he did in Toronto.  Cleveland had Kyrie+Bron, and who was the third superstar really? Kevin Love, who didn't really get integrated when sharing minutes with Tristan Thompson? KLove has regressed since his Grizzlies days.  LA had Bron+prime AD, and that was really it as far as star players."
"Eh, Shaq only had Kobe, really, and he didn't move to LA to have a superteam. Magic was drafted and didn't decide to move to a superteam. Bird was also drafted. MJ too.  KD is so different because he's deliberately moved to a known superstar team after getting beaten by that same team in the playoffs. Then he went to the Nets knowing he'd have Kyrie, and unexpectedly wound up with another superstar in Harden.  Bron did have Wade in Miami, but I don't think Bosh played like the superstar he was in Toronto. He has Kyrie and Kevin Love in Cleveland, but Kevin Love didn't play to a superstar level IMO. But KD plus Steph, plus a sharpshooter and star defender Klay, plus the perennial 2nd-place DPOY in Draymond, that is just completely different."
"Imagine if you traded Kevin Love for Kevin Durant and a much better supporting cast. Also, not even addressing the fact KD literally joined a 73-9 team. LeBron teams without him would not make it out of the second round"
"That was horrible stuff, but tbf people didn't know Kevin Love had been struggling with pretty severe depression until he later revealed it and started bringing attention to mental health in general and especially for athletes.  Shoutout to DeMar for taking part in all that. Even though it started accidentally for him, he embraced it and ran with it to do good in the world."
"""LeBron trapped Love in Cleveland and abandoned him""  Kevin Love signs max extension months later"
It’s been 4 years since anyone would choose klove over ten years.    I wouldn’t choose Kat if he had a kevin love career vs Zion/BI.
"All these Channing Frye references.     He averaged 22 mins in his career. Dirk literally could not walk his last two seasons.    KLove MAKES my point for me. He is 32.   When was his last real season?    If the question is about ten years.  Kevin love is the exact concern I have.   I know you and KAT are tight, I get that.  If the question was 5 years, I might agree with you.  Ten years.  Much bigger concern."
Well these same nephews thought LeBron gave Kevin Love mental health issues. Never undestimate unabashed blind sports hate.
The ref gave the ball to Kevin Love.  The ref did not give the ball to LeBron James.    Apple is not orange.
"i never thought anything of this play, would expect nothing less than a player having clear control before counting an inbound, but it does seem valid to ask why the Kevin Love play was considered a valid inbound then?"
Porzingis for Kevin Love? Swapping two toxic assets. At least Love can rebound.
Lebron gave Kevin love depression and Dennis schroeder psychopathy
Kevin Love
Kevin love was so good for Cleveland that during the finals they won he averaged 8 points a game. Fucking game changer. Couldn’t have done it without him
"&gt; But kyrie was a borderline All NBA caliber talent   Lmaooooo this conversation is a joke. You’re inflating the fuck out of the Cavs players. In reality I doubt you watched these players enough to make these claims. Literally go look at kyries stats in the years before bron and in the first playoff run, he was no where near all nba lol.   Love had a 55% TS in four playoff runs my friend, he was a minus defender, he was no where near all nba in Cleveland. It’s really that simple. You can try to exclude and cherry pick series or whatever but at the end of the day, Kevin love was terrible in Cleveland and the stats support that conclusion. Not only the stats, but the EYE TEST supports it as well. Kevin love lost strength and underwent multiple surgeries, he lost the ability to bang down low and was a terrible defender."
Bro if the only way you can get rid of Kennard is to attach 3 picks for fucking Kevin Love then I can tell you hes a garbage trade chip buddy. And Kennard isn't a positive asset so there isn't really any one you can get for him without having to give up more assets which means he's the opposite of a good trade chip.
"I think you're proving my point.  Kevin Love isn't the only ""bad contract"" vet in the league that is useless on a rebuilding team but could provide value on a playoff team.    Obviously, Kevin Love sucks and I'm not talking about him, but there are other player like him that are available.  The only way for the Clips to make a play for players like that was to sign Kennard to the extension."
"how about Kennard and PatBev's expiring contract, the 25th pick, and 2 Detroit's second round picks for Kevin Love"
"John Wall and Kevin Love are in a tier of their own. Both barely play and when they do just aren't that good anymore.   Westbrook is certainly overpaid right now but in the regular season he can still get you some wins, Wizards don't make the playoffs if they have Wall instead of Westbrook. He also gets people in the seats which counts for something.   Porzingas barely plays and is now just a 7'3 SG lmao.   Kemba has been pretty bad after his injury.   Hayward played well this year but it's not a coincidence he's injured again, he's injury prone and that contract may age like milk.  Klay has missed half of his contracts life and while we expect him to be good again, he suffered 2 major injuries and may not be the same."
"Came here to give Kevin ""what she don't know won't"" Huerter some love as a member of the 2018 draft class"
KP for Kevin love straight up
"Right!  I tried to defend you as well,but you couldn't ring upon bag of rice properly.    So I picked Kevin love,I know he's only accomplished being in the nba,and you won cashier of the month.  Someday you will figure out the code between basmati and short grain rice."
"Pretty interesting fact I found out from Russell Westbrook’s cousin at a gym in Delaware. Apparently, Russell and Kevin Love went to the same college."
This dude really defending Kevin love with his life damn. didn’t know Love had burner accounts too
Sounds like you’d be interested in one slightly used Kevin Love
Depends on his contract because I’m convinced all the cavs hate Kevin love
KP for Kevin Love?
"I see what you mean but I don’t think you can really compare their game, kevin could have used the weight down low using that fat ass to box out and grab 20 rebounds but he had to accept being a 3rd option 3 and D guy, had injuries and some mental battles it’s a completely different thing Kevin Love had a lot of other factors when he “got fit”  Spelling errors*"
He's never really been that guy even on the Knicks. I mean when defenses don't plan ahead and try to lock him up he'll have great night's. But when a good defensive team is keeping him in check it's really just him shooting 3's. Doesn't really have an inside iso game that he can revert too if his shots aren't falling. He's getting boxed out and the clippers shoot more than pound the paint so he's not blocking a ton of shots. You just hope he makes his 3's really. I mean Kevin Love would at least get to the line and do a lil damage there every night but KP just shoots.
Wtf is wrong with Kristaps? Is Luka turning him into Cleveland Kevin love or has he already reached his peak?
"1st of all, Kevin love wasn’t a good offensive player in non GS series’. That’s false, he had one good series against the Celtics in 2017. I also find it funny how you feel it’s okay to exclude the good defenses love went up against to somehow make a point? There’s no excuse for being consistently useless on the offense end if you’re some superstar player, regardless of who you’re up against.   Secondly, bosh is better than love. Simply because he can actually play defense and score inside at a better rate. But, I wouldn’t say either of them are superstar or even potential #1/#2 options on a contender. So if you ask me, the heat weren’t a superteam. Superteam to me is a team with 2/3 players who could lead a contending team (it’s much more complicated than that but that’s a minimum in my book). Then after those 2/3 players theres solid role players/coaches etc. The Nets and 2017 warriors are what I consider to be superteams. Regardless, if you’re calling the heat a superteam it has less to do with bosh and more to do with wade. Wade was a proven superstar and one of the best players in the league. Two of the best players in the league teaming up is why the heat were considered a superteam. Kyrie was a rising star when lebron returned."
Can I interest you in one Kevin Love?
Y’all want Kevin Love? He’ll at least rebound
We'll give them 1x Kevin Love for him
&gt;He shot 13 times a game in the 2018 playoffs and shot under 40%.  You quite literally picked his worst shooting playoffs and think that that's indicative of Kevin Love as a player. Man averaged 18-9 in that 2018 regular season on 61% TS. One bad playoff run doesn't make a player.    &gt;Lol you’re saying this as if Kevin love was ever a successful star worthy of getting touches on a contending team.  Bruh he averaged 26-12-4 on 60% TS on the TWolves as the only real offensive threat on that team. That's worthy of offensive touches on a contending team.  &gt;You’re looking at Kevin loves stats on a losing team and acting as if he was some superstar player when in reality the timber wolves were never competitive despite his “dominance”. How does that make any sense?  If your logic is that Love just put up stats on a losing team then the Heatles weren't a superteam then since Bosh put up his numbers on a losing team too. Does it make sense that those Heat teams weren't a superteam?
i wonder if kevin love can fit in dallas
"Watching Porzingis is infuriating, on one level I'm like this dude doesn't look anymore special than the role players and may even be less impactful, it reminds me of Kevin Love on the Cavs. But also he looks like he's lacking confidence, I wonder if making plays for him and getting him baskets would get those glimpses of what he was back, but at this point I don't even remember what made him special"
I love kevin harlan so much
Probably Kevin Love.
Wade had already suffer a bunch of injuries same with Bosh and Kevin love Kyrie and love both also where I jury the first time around
Kevin Love was a 3 time all star and Kyrie was a 2 time all star when LeBron came to Cleveland on poor teams. They had talent...
"The front office literally did everything he said. Part of the reason we were so awful in 2018 was that our front office let LeGM talk us into giving role players horrible contracts. He was wanting us to trade our entire future when he wouldn’t even commit to staying long term. Man is great at basketball, but he really acts like an unbearable diva. The Cavs were arguably the best team he could have joined in 2014. Cleveland being his former team and hometown just made it excusable for him to ditch an aging Miami team that most likely would not have had another title run for a young team with an upcoming young star and loads of cap space and trade assets (turned into Kevin Love who had been an all star starter the previous season). LeBron wins championships at the cost of running teams timelines into the ground, and skipping town when problems start to catch up. This is already starting to show with the Lakers, but I doubt he will leave LA at this point. So yeah most Cavs fans I know that actually stick around after he leaves appreciate his basketball, but see him as a diva and hard root against the Lakers. Cavs may be absolutely horrible right now, but a lot of us have enjoyed the change in culture after all of the toxicity and drama of a lot of the LeBron era players. Part of the reason I’m not really that upset that they got rid of KPJ for nothing."
"Look at Kevin Love, still stuck at Cavs."
"Every-time I bring up this point I usually get downvoted lol. When Curry was struggling to breakdown Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love, two bigs he usually abuses for fun, it was clear he wasn't close to his best. Even Iguodala was not fully healthy. That doesn't take anything away from the Cavs comeback, but people never bring this up, but always want to talk about how the Warriors were lucky that all the guards for the teams they faced in the 2015 playoffs were injured. And they will say Kevin Love and Kyrie, like Kevin Love has ever had a great series against the Warriors. They are a terrible match-up for him."
Kevin Love is usually shit against the Warriors. I bet anything they would have rather faced Love than Tristan Thompson and Mozgov.
Bruh you’re saying that like mentioning Kevin Love isn’t a joke in of itself. He’s obviously joking
ummm not sure if ur joking or not but they’re talking about Kevin Love
"Idk going into 2015 that team was probably heavily favored to win the title. Kyrie was a young star on the rise, kevin love was considered one of the best pfs in the game, he was putting up video game numbers in Minnesota, and top it off with lebron the best player in the league. Sounds a lot like a super team"
"On the other hand Kevin Love was giga useless next year, barely a top 5 player for them getting benched because he was so ass. But yeah, Kyrie was definitely missed."
I think the top 10 and top 5 argument is awful. There are players that can win games and there are players that can look good and lose. Kemba is the Kevin Love of pgs.
Lol you’re saying this as if Kevin love was ever a successful star worthy of getting touches on a contending team.   He shot 13 times a game in the 2018 playoffs and shot under 40%. He was the 2nd option in that playoff run and was garbage. You’re looking at Kevin loves stats on a losing team and acting as if he was some superstar player when in reality the timber wolves were never competitive despite his “dominance”. How does that make any sense?
" none of that has anything to do with the fact that Kevin love lost a lot of mass, was a terrible defender, and couldn’t post anyone up in Cleveland. He simply sucked, that’s the reality. Doesn’t matter how you spin it, he was ass. He barely shot above 40% on 2pt attempts in the playoffs on pretty good volume. He never averaged a block or steal in the regular season or playoffs. What was Kevin love good at? Defensive rebounding and outlet passes is about it.   He couldn’t finish inside, wasn’t strong enough to post up anymore, couldn’t offensive rebound, couldn’t defend and was injury prone. Both the stats and tape make this completely obvious, yet we sit here and debate it. As if him being a number one option on a playoff team would ever be successful on any team. His best statistical season was a losing season"
"he was a good scorer and shooter. was somehow more valuable than Kevin Love in an winning an NBA championship and has maybe the biggest mistake in the history of the league.  “where does he land for you”  feel like he can only be ranked against other 6MOY type players even though that wasn’t the only role he played.  i’d take him over a Jamal Crawford, Lou Will type player, but he’s in that sorta crowd of players."
Were the 2017-2018 Warriors a better team than the 1985-1986 Celtics? I think that's got to be a debate on its own.   And then you have the fact to debate the matter of whether LeBron had a better team around him than did MJ - because it plays to the relative attention given to the player in question due to the efficacy of their teammates. And I don't know that I accept that 1986 Orlando Woolridge &amp; Co is better than 2018 Kevin Love &amp; Co.
"Even if you were just looking at their credentials (which is a stupid way to look at it). How can you compare them to the current Sixers with a straight face?  \- LeBron 4x MVP, 2x FMVP, GOAT conversation &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Embiid (who I personally love)  \- Kevin Love, 3x All-star, 2x NBA 2nd Team &gt;&gt;&gt; Tobias Harris, 0-time all star  The closest might be comparing 24-year old, multi-allstar Kyrie to 24 year old multi-allstar, Simmons, and I think 99% of people agree Kyrie was and is better than Simmons...  Not to mention none of the Sixers players forced or connived their way to Philly to  *form* a SuperTeam, which I think is one of the co-requisites for calling a team a ""SuperTeam""."
"I mean, it's fair to give him his due but when guys want to play together, you clear out the space and make it happen.  David Griffin offloading assets to get Kevin Love and making space to sign Lebron outright? no brainer.  Pelinka/Magic clearing space to sign Lebron and then Pelinka trading a bag for Davis? no brainer.  Even moves that looked semi-bad for awhile like say the 76ers trading for Tobias Harris kind of feel like no brainers now.  He's a good GM however."
"John Wall got paid 41 mil this year  Blake Griffin got paid 34 mil for this year prior to his buyout  Kevin Love 31 mil  Drummond 30 mil prior to buy out  Porzingis 29.5 mil  hell, Otto Porter got paid 28.5 mil this year"
I believe the idea of Klay is more valuable to the warriors than Kevin love is to the cavs and Jhon wall is to the rockets
1. Kevin Love   2. John Wall   3. Kemba   4. Porzingis   5. Westbrook
"I think there's a discussion that your not a contending team if CJ is your 2nd highest paid player but he's no way near the level of kevin love, KP, Wall or Westbrook in terms of most overpaid"
Not even close.  Kevin Love a very distant second
It's Kevin Love
Kevin Love Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson Gordon Hayward Grayson Allen
"so another form of ‘who are the true superstars in the league?’   That’s easy. In order:  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  I’d love to put Luka Doncic on there because I watch and really respect the Euroleague and how hard it is to win that ish. But no.  Any other name you’ll see or have seen mentioned here all have caveats, explanations, projections, ifs/ands ,wishes and whatever jargon they use to rationalize it.   Fact is, they are not certified."
"&gt;Love wasn't on that team when LeBron went back to Cleveland.  He knew he was coming, his ""I'm coming home"" letter literally omitted Wiggins and people knew the trade was already in the works.  &gt;1 3x all star does not a superteam make.  What the fuck is wrong with you ignoring the result of it all?  Kevin Love was a consensus top 15 player in the league and he was on that team.  At the end of the day the Cavs had literally the top player (Lebron), a top 15 player (KLove), and a top 25 player (Kyrie) all on the same team.  It was a superteam, fuck off with this revisionist history bullshit."
"The 2015 Cavs were objectively a SuperTeam, especially compared to the 2014 Miami Heat.  Maybe you don't remember but the Heat just got their asses whooped by the Old 3 + Kawhi. Bosh was done, Wade was not the same player.  LeBron looked around and said, where can I go in the East and immediately win: Back to Cleveland! Kyrie was proving he was/would be a top 3 pg, they had the assets to go for Kevin Love, and everyone knew they would complete a deal, even before LeBron got there.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/7/9/5884871/kevin-love-cleveland-lebron-james-cavaliers-rumors-nba-free-agency-2014"
"Reps matter and it does change your game. Just look at Chris Bosh and Kevin Love who were relagated to much smaller roles. They did well in those roles (Bosh more so), but they also never were the players they used to be again, scoring wise even after Bron left their teams."
"Nope, the best you're getting is Kevin Love"
Might be a shitty take but I’ll always like Jordan over Lebron because I didn’t have to watch Jordan piss and moan anytime he faced the slightest bit of adversity. Seems like anytime someone gets injured or doesn’t play to his expectations he just quits and mopes around. Like the early exits or the weird media shots about Kevin love fitting in. I’m just over it.
"&gt; If that’s a superteam than the Rockets with Harden, Paul, and Capela are a superteam.  they nearly beat the KD Warriors dude...and Capela is not even close to being as good a third wheel as prime Kevin Love lol"
"You're saying a team with three players making the All Star team *in the same season* aren't a superteam? Kyrie was already an All Star and a highly regarded player (ESPN ranked him #23 the year LeBron returned) and Kevin Love was literally in the conversation as best power forward in the league, in fact he was ranked #7 in the entire NBA in ESPN's player rank the year LeBron returned. It's not his fault he was relegated to a spot up three point shooter with the Cavs. So that's two top ten players and a borderline top 20 player. Definitely a superteam.                   As for the Lakers, any damn team with two top five players is certainly a superteam (and yes, Davis is a top five player at his very best, not many can do what he did in the last playoffs). Every past example of two top five players playing in the same team has resulted in championships. That in itself is enough to make them a superteam but they also traded for the two best sixth men in the league and have a multi rebound champion, multi all star and All NBA player who still hasn't hit 30yo. It's funny how injuries can mask how good a team is....a bunch of losses without their two stars and everyone thinks the Lakers stink."
"The point is, he was terrible. For whatever reason, he sucked. He sucked in the “lebron system” he sucked after it. He sucked in the regular season and he sucked even more in the playoffs. He was terrible. He’s still terrible and brings little to nothing of value to any team. He was never a good shooter, valuable rebounder, defender, nor post player in Cleveland.   The fact that we are even discussing this is ridiculous. He barely shot over 40% on 2pt attempts as a big man in the playoffs. He had a playoff run in which he shot 36% on 2pt attempts on 6 attempts a game (2016). I seriously doubt that you have watched much of Kevin love in Cleveland to make a statement on the matter."
"Klay is coming off an ACL tear + Achilles after a 2 year break, and even in his prime was a very streaky player. I also don't believe he can elevate Klay to such levels, we've seen LeBron with elite shooters before. In many cases others can't play optimally with LeBron as the ball handler - a.k.a Kevin Love and Bosh had to become spot up shooter instead of the offense running through them."
"What does that have to do with him being terrible in Cleveland?   We also drafted Anthony Bennet with the first pick, he ended up sucking too. Kevin love sucked, period. Therefore, the Cavs weren’t a superteam, it’s not rocket science"
"Kevin love sucks, Jesus stop with this terrible take. Kevin love has rarely been good in Cleveland, with or without lebron."
And needed to get a ring the BS way then come back after getting multiple number 1 picks and Kevin Love. He never earned the first Ring the real way. The 1st is always the hardest to get anxiety pressure off your back. He knows deep down he couldn’t win it the real way.
"I just find it weird that we just call a team with 3 all stars a “super team.” To me “super team” is brought up loosely when it comes to Lebron. The Heatles I get, the second Cavs stint? Eh, outside of Lebron and some of his veteran teammates, Irving and Love were basically the only ones that never sniffed the playoffs. Great players, but hard for me to think of them as a super team when even Kevin Love couldn’t sniff the playoffs with the stats he was putting up."
"Kevin Love has never scored more than 20 ppg after that season, nor has he had that efficiency, rebound, OR assist numbers. Kyrie’s best season before Lebron arrived was 22 ppg on 45% shooting on a historically awful team. Of course he put up stats, he was their only guy. If you’re telling me you think that Cavs team deserves to be mentioned alongside real super teams, regardless of how they were constructed, I honestly don’t know what to tell you. You’re obviously not going to change your mind but I just don’t agree."
People underrate Kevin Love because of how he performed on the Cavs. Man averaged 26 and 12 the year before on the Wolves
Kyrie was a 20 year old allstar before he got there. Not a basketball fan in the world was surprised that Kyrie continued to “develop well” lol. And Kevin Love was All-NBA 2nd team averaging an outrageous 26-13 on 60% TS the year before he went to the Cavs. By all accounts that team was put together to be a super team. Just because a team constructed as a super team fails to live up to expectations doesn’t mean it wasn’t still constructed to be a super team.
"You're right. We should also say Kevin Love never loses before the Finals. If he gets to the playoffs, it's an automatic Finals trip."
"D-Wade slowed down, retired.   Bosh blood clots.   Kyrie missed large chunks of the last two seasons before this one. Mental seems boomed at times.   Kevin Love can't stay on the court.   AD hurt.   The constant. LeBron James. My conclusion is that he sacrifices their life forces to stay as dominant as he has for as long as he has.   Also sidenote: LMFAO at Chuck telling that fan to stfu"
"I think it's more about how he hand picks his situation every year, hopping around as necessary. Kevin Love and Kyrie with him was a formidable championship trio. And he wouldn't have gone back if they weren't loaded with high picks to use to make a team with."
Kevin love has left the chat
Kevin Love
Ahem. Kevin Love
how bout kevin love + assets?
"I was gonna say you could trade for Kevin Love, but then I saw you wanted defense. Lol"
would you take kevin love for CJ?
"I said this in another thread, but literally the only super team Lebron has ever been on was the Heat. The cavs 1st stint were terrible. The Cavs second stint was a 3rd year Kyrie who had never made the playoffs and Kevin Love who wasn’t even as good as he was on the TWolves, and on the Lakers literally all he has is AD, outside of the big two this team is literal hot garbage. The Nets, the Heatles, and the KD Warriors are super teams. Any other team he has been on has been pretty darn balanced compared to other teams."
"Are we gonna pretend GSW's only Championship without KD happened when Cavs missed Kyrie &amp; Kevin Love? Once they were back, the Cavs won 2016 Championship despite a 1-3 deficit.  GSW most likely would never have beaten LeBron/Kyrie/Love without KD."
If you think Lebron with AD or a 3rd year Kyrie and a Kevin Love that wasn’t even as good as he was on the TWolves is a super team in the same regard as the Nets or the KD Warriors you’re delusional.
"Bad take, honestly. This man has been to like 13 finals, beat a 73 win team with Kyrie and Kevin love + scrubs, never lost in the first round, etc etc. Now he’s ridiculed when he is 37, missing the other player the team was built around, with role players that can’t hit the broad side of a barn. This is just a stupefyingly stupid comment."
Reminds me of 2018 when the pacers won game 6 by 30 before LeCHINA went to the back with “cramps” in game 7 and the refs and Kevin Love went nuclear
"Do John Wall, Kevin Love, and Kemba count?"
"He literally did it 4 years into his career. And don't act like 2018 Kevin Love was actually an all-star lol  Also, all those other years pre-Heat....did you just start watching basketball or something?"
Kevin Love got roasted for a week and some because he flippantly threw the ball away. But LeBron consistently does this shit and people barely bring it up.
"My point 100%. He always makes his own super team. Yes the warriors had a good team before KD but they drafted Steph and Klay and won before Kd joined. Lebron goes to Miami and gets Bosh and Wade, he goes back to cavs with Kyrie and Kevin love and now lakers with Anthony Davis. And he’s literally quitting right now."
dwade and chris bosh then kyrie and kevin love? AD?
Sign and trade for Kevin Love. Love returns to LA and reunites with LeBron
"Will only applies to the likes of Paul George because he's ""deflecting the issue"" so that people will stop bullying him.  However, this sub will have open arms on Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan because they're so wholesome."
So true. I think ownership literally said something like “we love you Kevin but steph gets more money” in the championship speech.   https://youtu.be/uaEBYICk7Lw
Lol. Kevin Love.  It was a well-constructed team. Not a superteam.
"WOW! You’ve already judged them, eh? The Pistons have a bunch of players who want to improve and develop - Grant, Bey, Stewart, Hayes, Doumbouya. Cavs didn’t have that, as revealed by team insiders (who I believe is Kevin Love)."
if they swapped joe harris and kevin love at half time would you notice?
they should really make a move for kevin love.
Kevin Love was all NBA second team when Lebron traded for him  JR Smith was 6th man of year two years ago
You can easily move him + picks for Al Horford. You can trade for John Wall and gamble it will be better. You can probably do trades for several other players as well just depends on how many picks you want to give away. Want Kevin Love?   Personally I think Kemba and Picks for Kyle Lowry is your best move. Have the Raptors do a sign and trade for 2y/ 65 million contract with Lowry and send Kemba and 2 lottery protected firsts
Kevin Love couldn’t do shit in 2018 lol it was uncle Jeff riding sidekick
So when Lebron puts up 50 tonight like in 2018.. who's gonna fill the Kevin Love role of putting up 20+
"&gt;guess who hands was the ball in for the gamewinning shot in 2016? sure wasn't Lebron  Whose hands was the ball in for Dirk in the 4th quarters? It was Jet, not Dirk.  &gt;lmao they weren;t All-Stars cause they didn't play enough games pre-voting.  Still weren't all-stars. Only Kyrie even played like an all-star Kevin Love is not a real star."
"You think the 2016 Cavs weren't a superteam? Lebron literally went to Cleveland and formed a superteam with Kevin Love, who was a 26pts and 12 reb level player and Kyrie who was an all-star. The Cavs were favorites coming into the 14/15 season to win the championship.   They were also favorites in 15/16, as people said if Lebron could take 2 games off the Warriors in the 2015 finals, then the Cavs will def win with a fully healthy Love and Kyrie.   It's funny how the narrative changed to the Cavs being the underdogs and the Warriors being a superteam, cause the Warriors had more synergy as a team and Curry went supernova. Lets not also forget that the Cavs played in a worse conference, making it easier for them to get to the finals."
Collin Sexton and Kevin Love for CJ and a pick.
"This is unsurprising to me.  CJ is a good player on a contract that is a bit too big.  He's not like Kevin Love, where he's just a giant anchor on a team.  He's a plus player that unfortunately limits our ability to bring in other guys.  Due to how much he's paid, he'd be hard to move for positive value, which is all we're interested in getting back for him since we're trying to win rather than rebuild.    Unfortunately he's a SG, which there is abundant talent at, and Portland needs as SF, where there isn't abundant talent.  We've got a better chance at a S&amp;T with Powell."
How has he proven that? You can't just say shit like that without some level of backing it up.  OkBarber6 has proven he doesn't know anything about basketball. OkBarber6 has proven he's just trying to stoke love for Kevin Durant because he has a crush on him.   It's meaningless
"&gt; I went back to the 60s to show that it has always been like this  Going bvack that far isn't ""always"", it's more like it's been a long ass time but now were doing that super team shit again lol it's just perspective.   &gt; Karl Malone was still averaging 20ppg  Right, but Basketball is still a game of points, and if your top three stars are pulling in 80 PPG, that doesn't exactly leave much points for your fourth options.   Again, Malone at the end of his career is nowhere close to any of the Top 3 on the Nets, who could each be leading their own teams right now on their own merits. Malone at that point could not do that.   &gt; Barkley was also averaging 20ppg in that year he played with Moses Malone, also Malone literally just won MVP the year before going to the sixers.  Right. So the closer comparison there is a team with stars that drafted well this year, aka a Golden State if they were healthy with Wisemen. A team with Malone and Dr J getting a top 7 pick and drafting well is not the same thing as what this Nets team is. That is not a super team, that's just drafting well.   &gt; Do you really think that KD, Harden and Kyrie have more star power than Kobe, Shaq, Payton and Malone all on the same team?  Yes. And I think your doing an incredibly disservice to any of the Nets Big 3 by pretending that any of those three are on Payton or Malone's level. They are better then Payton or Malone. Your comparison makes sense for like the Cavs, where they had Lebron + Kyrie, and then you could argue Kevin Love is on that level. Kyrie is above them, and your just trying to normalize insanity by pretending KD, Harden, and Kyrie on the same team all in their primes is in any way normal."
I totally agree I love Shamet but at the time the trade was made there were columnists like Kevin Pelton that argued Shamet was the worst player in the three team trade. There was plenty of argument over Luke Kennard being the player the Nets should’ve taken for that pick but in hindsight the bet on the fit of Shamet within the construct of the Nets roster at the time was one I’m happy with.
"It is a lot of revisionist history. Kevin Love was basically viewed as the best PF putting up 25/13 at the time. If I remember correctly, before the start of the season of 2016, the Cavs were viewed as the betting favorites before the Warriors did 73-9."
"People talk about Lebron’s second Cavs stint like he had been there all along. He didn’t build the Cavs organically and just to trade for Kevin Love. He left them to be a lottery team, they drafted a star and then had great assets to build another super team just in time for the Heat to crumble.  Until he got old and the Cavs relegated him to being a spot up shooter, Kevin Love was more valued than Klay Thompson. Love was a bonafide star in Minnesota."
"If people watch the video, I think you’ll come away from it with more respect for Kevin than just the headline alludes to. And at the end he says something about it being all love or something."
I mean trading for Kevin Love vs choosing to play with Curry &amp; Thompson is pretty different
"Ah yes the superstar Kevin Love  Btw does anyone want to trade for him? Please? He’s a superstar, not sure why nobody wants him on their team"
Breen is predictable but I feel like it’s just because he’s got the formula down and he knows it. It works for me. Love Kevin Harlan as well though.
"lol he was being a dick and he knew he was being a dick.  Anyone not named Kevin Durant would say something like ""Well I put in a lot of time and effort and I hoped I would be back to playing at this level.""  Or something like that.    That being said, I love the answer he gave and I don't want him to change.  It was a dumb question."
Wouldn’t that be ironical… 😂 Wiggins and Kevin Love in a three team deal that lands Lebron back in Cleveland.
Yeah man I’ve always loved Larry Bird. I was a big fan of Kevin Love too. Steve blake is so underrated
"2016 cavs was not a super team and if you think so you are smoking crack. Two high level all stars, one injury prone and declining Kevin love, and no one else. Or 2018, even though he didn’t win it, he dragged the cavs to the finals with no love or kyrie almost all of the playoffs. Kevin Durant only cracked the finals once, and came up short every other year with a solidddd thunder team most years."
why would the thunder do that lol. I'm not sure who you could get for him.. but its probably for one of the worst 5 contracts out there. Kevin Love maybe? Kemba with other stuff
"9 game sample lmao. doing it for a whole season is a different story. that's why AD led the Lakers in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, and FT% last season  Lebron without another All-Star has accomplished less than Kevin Love in the West"
"Not exactly the same at all - Steph Curry showed up this year, and was amazing to watch despite the fact that it was clear from the start that they wouldn't be contending. No Westbrook triple-double record or Wizards fighting into the playoffs because, fuck it, what's the point. Kyle Lowry gets 10ppg and gives up on defense because Raptors were bad this year.  If other players took not-bothering to seek a trade to the extent Blake Griffin did the league would be utter shit. I'd rather Pelicans Eric Bledsoe and Cleveland Kevin Love were the exceptions, thanks."
yeah cause the Wolves had a shit ton on injuries. still won more games than Lebron  fun fact: Lebron without another All-Star has won the same amount of playoff games in the West as Kevin Love
"Lmao, I love when people overrate Kevin Love based on putting up numbers on a trash Wolves team. If Kevin Love was really that good, he wouldn't have looked so shit by the 2018 season when he was only 29-30"
"they're kind of like LeBron's second Cavs, Joe Harris is short Kevin Love, they aren't great on defense but they do enough, and they can score a bunch. And there is no KD Warriors this year"
I fucking love Kevin Harlan so much. I'd watch a 30-point blowout as long as he's the one calling the game.
I love Kevin Harlan lol
Kevin Love about to do the same.
"Ad hominem 🤣  Sorry buddy, you needed Kyrie and Kevin love to get injured to win your first title and KD carried your boy for your other two and that’s the hard truth  But thank you for believing that we win the championship this year I wholeheartedly agree with you"
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."
"I want to say Love has the decency to be too injured to ever play, but he was able to summon up just enough Young Kevin Love this season to drop us a few spots in the draft order."
I love Kevin Wayne Durant
Sorry I got here late. We're you guys talking about Kevin love
"I don’t understand how a player as talented and dominant as Kevin Durant comes across as so insecure, both in his personality and with the teams he’s chosen to join and help assemble. To be clear, I love watching him. But it seems like he doesn’t wanna be on a team unless it’s All-Time Talented, and I don’t think it’s necessary cause he’s good enough to win with less talented teams."
"I don’t understand how a player as talented and dominant as Kevin Durant comes across as so insecure, both in his personality and what teams he’s chosen to join and help assemble.

LeBron gave Kevin Love depression and Kuzma made LeBron give up?
"Andrew Wiggins got a max, Kevin Love got a max way after his prime, Klay got a max. I don’t think dollar amount determines how dumb some FOs are."
"Didn’t you hear? Kevin Durant is a celebrity, so that makes it okay to be an asshole to women and surprise them on the spot by making them fight for your attention!  What woman DOESNT love showing up to a first date and finding out that her man has another date on standby in case he doesn’t like her? But KD is a celebrity so I guess that makes it okay!"
"he gave up 9 million dollars next year they still owe him 30 which is dead money on their books  they did him a favor, they coulda just left him on their roster like kevin love and waited until his contract becomes easier to buy out."
Kevin love
Idk man... by that logic Kevin Love is one of the greatest defenders of all time because of 'The Stop'. Having good defensive moments does not make you a great defender. That's like saying a spot-up shooting is a great offensive player because they sometimes hit step back threes. It doesn't really matter unless you can do it consistently.
I think Kevin Love played 10 games this season
"The Mavs were a great team 2nd half of the regular season after going through COVID and injuries.  Just because they lost the first round doesnt mean the other costars are bad.  Clippers could potentially be the best team this year if they win the chip and losing to them in 7 is not something that should be looked down on.  Clippers tanked to play them so they prolly know they match up better with them.  It was just a bad match up for them.  If the Mavs played any other team in the West, KP, prolly plays a lot better.  He was averaging 20/9 in the regular season.  Luka is like Lebron, where unless they are a generational talent who can create themselves, they will suffer being on his team since the ball is in their hands so much.  Just look at Chris Bosh and Kevin Love"
"The only realistic option is to try and swap ""bad"" contracts with someone else and try to get something shorter, maybe send your 2025 alongside it in some situations  Only realistic situations I could see are swaps for dudes like Kevin Love or Kemba, or maybe sending future picks for Horford... but who knows what the appeal for either side might be on those.  I guess Dallas would chop off at least a year of money, and the other teams could at least see if a change of scenery could make KP better?"
"depends, do you watch the cavs enough to no longer think kevin love is our 2nd best player?"
"Nobody likes to play with a ball stopper, for sure.  The biggest problem is that KP is also a ball stopper.  He needs to find his inner Kevin Love or DeAndre Ayton.  Even though he's good enough to be a #1 he's nowhere near good enough to be a #1 on a championship contender, so figure out how to set great screens so you can pick and pop and crash the f-ing boards."
Kevin Love started 5 and played in 6 games in the 2016 Finals. But it does look like he was a little banged up.
This guy really put Kevin Love instead of LeBron 😂
"He probably likes basketball still, but his lower back and knees don't. He pulled Minnesota Kevin Love out of his ass enough times this season to bump us down in the draft order."
Somebody on our sub posted Kevin Love + Cedi Osman for KP + Josh Richardson. Seems like one of those trades that would be equally horrible for both teams.
It’s ok he has his finals buddy Kevin Love there to back him up
"Pelicans are the [second best rebounding](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=REB_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) team in the NBA. The more good rebounders you have on a team, the less total rebounds everyone gets. See Kevin Love when he went from Minnesota to Cleveland."
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
No contracts are untradeable while the Cavs are around to take a salary dump for some assets!  so I guess that leaves Kevin Love then?
Kevin Love
Kevin Love
"Back in the day (2012?), I thought Klay for Kevin Love was a great idea and I hated that the FO didn't go through with it"
"I agree. Honestly, I say move him for another shitty contract that's 1-2 years shorter. It's worth it. Maybe Kevin Love or Kemba Walker. Walker would actually give them a secondary ball handler, too."
We'll trade Kevin Love for him
"Therein lies the issue, though. They probably have to give up on the idea of ""featuring"" him, because it is a role he is insufficiently skilled for. Other than giving him the minimum touches to prevent him from going into an selfish and sabotaging pout a la Kevin Love in Cleveland, featuring him on offense more than they are will only make them as a team worse.  Now, obviously that leads to the issue of ""uh oh, now we're stuck with a guy making over $30mil a year who we can't feature on offense."" And that's the real crux of the problem: they have paid a non-star like a star, and now are stuck with the consequences."
Might I interest you in a slightly used Kevin Love?
"This trade seems unrealistic, but KP is still a young player that was productive during the season and could turn into a valuable contributor. Kevin Love will never contribute to winning basketball for the Cavs, while KP could"
How about Porzingis for Kevin Love
"He isn't necessarily wrong porzingis and Luka clearly lack chemistry and the offense is entirely Luka centered, combined with not many plays beeing run for KP, he often ends up as a Kevin Love Cleveland situation where he is nothing more but an overpaid spot up shooter.   But KP in addition since his injury isn't 100% and might never be again, he lacks his speed and athleticism that allowed him to blow by defending Bigs, he isn't a rim protector and resounding presence like he used to be for the Knicks.   All in all I think the mavs and KP need to part ways for both of them to benefit"
Haha whoever wants Kevin Love can have him for a pack of smokes. I think he makes 200k per minute played.
"KP is the 2016 Cavs Kevin Love of this team. Solid player, maybe not quite as good as his hype, doesn't really fit the scheme and doesn't really get along with the star of the team."
good call. just don't know if kevin love still likes playing basketball lol
KP and cash considerations for kevin love
Rodney hood has been inconsistent since leaving the cavs. Jr isn’t even in the league. Kevin love is not relevant. Iman shumpert is out of the league. Yea these players have gotten so much better since lebron dipped.
It works from a play style perspective as well. Kevin learned how to play with Lebron. A Luka-Love PNR would essentially emulate that. Kevin can also post pretty well too so it gives Luka options.  Ideally tho they turn Zingis into a wing
Kevin Love for Zingis. Both get their wish.
No.   Kevin Love exists.
"This is 100% true. He’s an injury-prone Kevin Love in the sense that he’ll put up great stats in bad teams. But he and his brother are toxic as hell.  KP was infuriating with the Knicks because he’d show flashes that got us excited as hell but then he’d disappear. He’s inconsistent as hell and I think many of us worried that playing with Luka would bring out some consistency that would make us saltier.  But if he isn’t a primary focus or isn’t playing well, he just digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole.  We were all pissed with the trade because we should’ve been able to get more because we thought KP had more in him. But it turns out the player we saw is the same player today. So the trade looks a lot better to us. Nobody wins the trade until DAL wins a title or the Knicks make/use those picks and they turn out to be quality pieces"
He used to be a beast but now has kevin love syndrome
nah he was a beast bro he has kevin love syndrome
Wasn't Kevin Love traded away by Minny? After the front office kept trying to trade him?   I hope they still appreciate him in Minny
are you forgetting that Kevin Love is/was one of the better rebounders of all time?
Okay let’s stop. Porzingis is not good but he is much better than Kevin Love and John Wall is terrible now.
John Wall and Kevin Love can actually somewhat contribute and not be a liability.   Wall can be a decent point guard and Kevin Love a floor spacer with elite rebounding.   Wtf can Porzingis do?
"That's true, but it's partially because the Mavs didn't attempt to use him any differently than Dorian Finney Smith. What do people expect him to do if the gameplan just parks him on the perimeter? He's never going to be as good as his contract, but if the Mavs keep him, they've gotta try to get him more involved - to take the burden off Luka and to make the offense less predictable. Get him involved in more screening actions, get him running some DHOs, get him more face-ups at the elbow where he can use his height even more. Take a page out of the T-Wolves playbook for Kevin Love. I get he hasn't been good, but if you play him like he's a second Maxi Kleber, why would you expect different results?"
John Wall... KEvin Love?  Come on dude
Pretty dogshit considering they have Kevin Love
"To an extent, sure. But the Mavs have decided to play him like he's a second Maxi Kleber. What do you expect? Luka is basically out there playing Harden-ball, which is fine, it works when you have a star who's an elite facilitator and shot maker. But it turns everyone else into statues who just spot up on the perimeter. I'm seeing so many people complain that Porzingis is just playing like a 7-foot shooting guard (including Kevin O'Connor) but how else do you expect him to play in this offense? Not saying post him up, but you gotta run some actions to get him involved - high-low game with Boban, DHOs, screens to get him a little space to shoot at the elbow, where his height is even more of an advantage. It takes more creativity to get big guys involved than it does to just turn the ball over to a dominant guard and say, do your thing. T-Wolves were great at this with Kevin Love. If the Mavs don't want to run any actions for him, there's no reason for Porzingis to be on the team."
"Two overachieved compared to their talent. Doc has almost always underachieved for his talent and Ty Lue has only ever had Lebron James, Kyrie, Kevin Love before this year."
I agree but I don’t think KP is a negative asset as compared to say a Kevin Love or John Wall. I agree he’s not holding them back from a salary cap perspective but I think from a team building perspective they need to go in a different direction . Mavs don’t have their 1st the next two years and Lukas due for an extension soon I think Cuban needs to continue to show they are committed to winning
Kevin love did it.
Make a package deal involving KP to Cleveland for Kevin Love and Collin Sexton.   Trade with Boston for Marcus Smart.
Mavs can match any offer made by another team and Luka has the sign the Mavs offer. We have seen LeBron and Kevin Love signing the 4+1 to be able to leave a year early or have more leverage in trade requests.
Kevin Love.  By a mile.
Deron Williams   Joe Johnson  Peja Stojakovic  Kevin Love  Shawn Kemp
"Honestly, I feel like the mavericks treated him like cleveland treated kevin love when lebron was there. Everyone wondered what happened to love but he was playing in a system that had a ball dominant player who always initiated the offense and he just sat on the perimeter."
Kevin Love
This goes on carlise as well. The just have him as a spot up shooter like what lebron did with kevin love. It's better to involve him into the offense. He was good against the clippers last year.
"Did I say it was bad from the beginning? I loved that move when I heard about it. I thought it was great, porzingis was such a good player in 17-18. I thought he had true superstar potential. And while the situation of him and love looks comparable, I think Kevin love was much better than KP. Could shoot the3 at an elite level consistently unlike KP and went to 4 straight NBA finals. Though he didn’t play well he was the 2nd best player in 2018 and had some good games. And he was an all star in 17 and 18. don’t think porzingis is on that level. And KP is 25 right now, Kevin love was nearly 30 in 2018. Not sure if KP will get better, I think he might Regress even more"
That is true but that can be fixed over the off-season if he practices with Dirk. My problem is what good is his post moves if he’s never going to use them if the Mavericks go 5 out all game long with Luka and force KP to stand in the corner like LeBron did with Kevin Love in Cleveland.
Kevin Love.
You do realize when they signed him it was based on how he was before he got injured in New York right? KP could attack close outs and put up points because he wasn’t in a 5 out system. What they’re doing now is turning him into a spot up shooter. You can say this is a bad contract in hindsight but back then everyone loved the pairing of Luka and KP. This is literally the exact same situation as Kevin Love and LeBron. Love was a dominant big man who was paid generously and when he came to a system similar to what the Mavericks run now he was forced into a spot up shooter role and everyone said he was trash and overpaid because he wasn’t putting up Minnesota Love numbers anymore in the new system.
Worse option than Kevin Love
Realistically? Nobody.   Because only la handful of teams are gonna take KPs 100 million $ contract.  Maybe they can trade him for one of the other bad contracts out there but is Kevin Love or Al Horford better?  Because without emptying all of their young players the Mavs will not be able to trade KP.
"at this point, a trade for Kevin Love might be a huge upgrade."
Have you met Kevin Love?
John wall and kevin love are worse. He might take 3rd tho
"He works real hard at slandering young black men for the people that pay him. That’s for sure. Praised Kevin Love for talking about depression then insults Paul George because he said he was depressed in the bubble. Caruso caught with Weed compared to Josh Gordon. Deshaun Watson Allegations vs Trevor Bauer Allegations. Theres a bigger picture a lot of people aren’t seeing. S.A.S is just the puppet for Disney, but nobody wants to talk about that or the narrative they are setting."
As a kid I loved Kevin Johnson and I’m DYING for them to bring back the western font jerseys. I know they’re not as flashy as the sun bursts but I love them. The current icon and association jerseys are so bland but I’m glad they still have one that’s purple at least. The Valley unis are hopefully a sign of good to come.
"Sports media in general has done a spectacularly poor job of marketing Giannis these playoffs. And I'm not saying it's some anti-Giannis thing; they've sold him so well before.  I'm a fucking nerd, so going into the Brooklyn series I knew about one of Giannis' earliest interviews, pre-draft, saying how much he admires and wants to be like Kevin Durant. I knew about the clips of him in his rookie year saying how excited he was to get to guard Kevin Durant, how proud he was that he managed to block Kevin Durant. I knew about the KD comments about how he thought Giannis could be the greatest player ever. KD in 2017 said Giannis was his favourite player to watch.  Could no-one honestly build a story out of that? Was the most compelling narrative you could find, as these players fought to Game 7 with their teams on their backs, stuff about Giannis' FT routine? After the series Jay Williams did the thing about KD angrily saying not to compare them - KD shuts it down immediately, great job ESPN. If they wanted beef Harden was right there on the team. He walked out at the end without congratulating or shaking hands - if you want to get messy with it, get messy with that, re-run a timeline of the beef.  Giannis' story basically writes itself, and the match-up against KD has so much history leading to it. I can't believe the main thing about Giannis this year has been his FT routine; hey, casual fans, you'll love this! This guy takes a lot of free throws, loads of them miss, and it wastes loads of time! Make sure you tune in!"
"No, most likely Cleveland would trade Dray to Minnesota as part of the Kevin Love trade. Dray broke out after that trade happened, so when LeBron comes in 2014, he would've been 100% expendable"
Kevin Love
"Yeah but you said good enough to be a max player. Tyson wasnt, and Kevin Love certainly isnt now. Guys like Iggy werent max caliber guys either. Go back further and you have Tayshaun Prince and Redd and cusp guys like Boozer."
"Tyson chandler was only their because of his size, Kevin love already has a max contract"
This is mostly accurate but pretty blanket. A guy like Tyson Chandler was and would never be worth the max. Dont think Kevin Love currently is either.
"Kevin Love wants a trade so bad it's ridiculous    Sorry Kevin, no one is taking you on. Take on a cavalier attitude about it"
Is this a Kevin Love joke
Kevin Love made 2 all nba teams in his first four years. Can’t tell if you are dumb or a troll.
I’m 12 times better than Kevin love at playing help defense
Kevin love was not an all nba player on the cavs and even if he was it’s not close to the warriors
Are you really going to act like Kevin Love and Kyrie being All star caliber players warrants using them as an equal comparison to playing with Steph Curry.
Kevin Love was never a good basketball player
"&gt;LeBron was gonna wear down no matter who was guarding him- he was forced to carry the team entirely on his shoulders all series.  lebron carried his broken and bum ass team thru the bulls when they were down we had no idea if he was breaking down or not, kevin love broke his arm in the 1st round, kyrie irving was inconsistent as shit and it was unclear if he was really that much of a playoff performer (though he was battling injuries too eventually)"
"David blatt was a good coach, just had a bad shake. Lebron changed that whole thing it was supposed to be Wiggins,blatt, Kyrie, they could have been the brad stevens Celtics core or the 76ers build (excuse grammar) pls.. David blatt finals first time never got blown out until the Kevin love situation in Boston"
Kevin Love is on thin ice man 👀👀👀👀
Thats the most passionate i've heard Kevin Love in years.
Lmfao no way you actually said Kevin Love was better than Chris Paul and Capela. I refuse to believe I actually saw this
And Lebron had Kevin Love for 59 games who was an all star
"Jesus Christ Kevin Love even sits on the sidelines for Team USA. Guy is an ALL TIME bench warmer. Poor Kerr, that shit probably didn't feel good lol."
He gave Kevin Love depression too /s
players not drafted here that should be in over some of these players  SGA  Sabonis   Christian wood  Vucevic  Miles Bridges  Kevin Love  Collin Sexton  lemelo
"KD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kyrie   Klay &gt;&gt; Kevin Love        Warriors EASILY win 2019 if healthy. No sane person will argue that. Whereas 2015 would've been close w/o injuries (see:2016, which went down to the last minute of game 7)"
"""Big yikes"" was in reference to you saying ""It reeks of that SJW gen z mentality."" People who talk like that are usually telling you a lot more about themselves.  &gt;This whole ""KD is the best player in the league"" started after those 2 games. No one was really saying that before. You initially replied to me saying that during the time.  Cool, thanks for acknowledging that at no point have I said KD is the best player in the league despite you claiming multiple times that I did. Glad we cleared up that fabrication.  &gt;I didn't belittle that person, I corrected a bunch of things they misrepresented.  The entire comment is you saying ""no, their opinion is wrong because I disagree with it. In fact, it is actually AMAZING!"" in different ways. Call it whatever you want to justify it, but you wrote nine paragraphs belittling someone's *subjective opinion* about something.  &gt;When did I say this?

I love how badly you misinterpreted my extremely simple point here. 2. Interesting logic. ""You're the one who corrected my lie - how ridiculous of you to do that. I should be allowed to lie without anyone fact checking what I say."""
That’s Olympic gold medalist Kevin Love to you
"Suns only weakness is at PF, so either Zion or Kevin Love.  CP3, Book, Bridges, Zion &amp; Ayton. Crazy thing is that almost happened, Suns had pretty good odds in Zion's draft."
"i feel it very uncomfortable that Kevin Love, a white cis male of privilege, is ordering a bunch of minorities to run laps and yelling atta boy"
"Curry played every game in the 2016 Finals, saying he was hobbled is just laughable. Draymond should've been suspended earlier (in the OKC series) which would mean that Durant-Westbrook would've made the Finals that year instead. Just imagine even if the Cavs had a healthy Kevin Love for that series, it might've been finished in less than 7 games.   That 2018 Rockets Team definitely takes the cake over the 2016 Warriors, who really got pretty lucky in the later rounds of the playoffs."
"Miami was ""ring chasing"" but Cleveland was not. Kyrie and Kevin Love had done nothing in the nba neither of them even made the playoffs before playing with LJ. If that's ring chasing then Paul joining up with Harden is definitely ring chasing."
Kevin Love is still a poor defender though.
Lebron first built a team with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Then he teamed up with Kyrie and Kevin Love. The current iteration with AD is probably the least ring chasey team he’s been on since the original cavs.
should be no problem if everyone stays healthy. think of it as a kevin love and Kyrie situation in 2015
GET GIANNIS SOME HELP LIKE KEVIN LOVE. Bud needs to play Klove Lopez and Giannis on the floor at the same time!
Will Kris Middleton became Kevin Love On this Series?
They gonna have to play w half the select team and KD w Kevin love if they drug test the Olympic squad.
You guys are gonna go out and get Kevin Love and play him Lopez and Giannis all at the same time
"All three Plumlees, Cody Zeller and Kevin Love."
He's been playing with Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond who were basically only good for getting boards. Kevin Love didn't need to get rebounds with them in
Kevin Love is there just for free summer vacation to Japan.
"when did kevin love develop a relationship with kevin durant? Literally have never heard those names together until now. I would've thought love would've wanted to play for the lakers.  Derozan is getting way more than brooklyn can offer.   millsap is actually washed, so who knows.   wall has like 90m left on his deal...   gasol, maybe since he's not getting any younger."
Kevin Love music
Kevin Love to the warriors confirmed.
"He'd be probably the best stretch/playmaking 4 in the league....   At the very worst he's Kevin Love with better shooting, passing defense, far better inside touch...."
"This is a fascinating version of history.      The Cavs lost the last 8 games in which Drummond started. He sat for one game in between and they won that one. They were 9-16 when he played, so .360.       A bigger part of the Cavs early success was Larry Nance Jr… the Cavs were 8-11 when he played before his first extended absence. When he came back he wasn’t the same, and then Kevin Love came back into the mix and the Cavs were 5-18 in games he played."
"I love me some Payton Pritchard, but Celtic fans need to *temper* expectations with this guy.  Some of our sub genuinely believes this guy should be a starting PG, although I highly disagree with that. I do agree that he's deceptively athletic and sports some impressive ball handling skills, but that's a testament to his work ethic. At 6'2, he's going to be limited on what he can do on defense on switches. Some people compare him to Fred VanVleet, and I think his numbers are very eerily similar as well.  At 23 -  &gt;**Pritchard's** 7.7 points per game, 2.4 rebounds per game, 1.8 assists per game on **44/41/88**   &gt;   &gt;**Fred VanVleet's** 8.6 points per game, 2.4 rebounds per game, 3.2 assists per game on **42/41/83**  I don't think Payton Pritchard has the defensive chops as FVV's, who's actually an underrated shot blocking guard for his size. But PP has a very high range, I've seen dude light it up from 32+ feet. He's also known for taking long deep bombs during his time with Oregon.  I liked FastPP, but I definitely clowned Ainge for pick, this is what I get for listening to Kevin O'Connor hype up prospects lol."
Only Kevin Love is allowed to be sad and rich
Still amazed Kevin love is on this team lmao
&gt;I personally really like their jerseys. What better than the Kevin Love era. Simple and clean. They've had great alternative uniforms as well.   I like the blues and whites (although I like the blues a lot more than the whites) but I hate the neon green ones.
"That's not true. The best role players are the ones that have literal roles, like 3-and-D players--PJ has just two jobs, stand in the corner and guard the wing. Kuzma is a hybrid PF who either has to be a Kevin Love camper on the line or asked to be the offensive spark off the bench. Those are two roles that have almost never thrived on a LeBron-led team, and he has to decide which of those he is."

"Kyrie and Kevin Love injured in 15', got punked in 16, then went crying to KD for their last two. Even made his damn achilles explode trying to bring him back for the third attempt. Too bad so sad."
"LeBron just isn't a shooter period. Over the finals LeBron rarely ever shot over Curry despite being in pure 1 vs 1 situation:  https://streamable.com/p2s3o  https://streamable.com/sascq  Plenty of other examples off the top of my head too - e.g game 2 in 2018 finals after Curry made a ridiculous 3 over Kevin Love, LeBron is in pure 1 vs 1 situation to shoot over Curry and misses badly. LeBron's jumper is at its best when he's left wide open from teams gapping him on his drives."
Steph and Kevin love
bruh kevin love was the third guy not the chalmers 🤦‍♂️
Kevin Love being on this team is an embarrassment. An Olympic medal should be a charity event.
"It's Miami. We literally need a shooting, rebounding big. Pat traded both of ours away. I'm on my hands and knees, give me Kevin Love."
Meanwhile Jalen Rose calling Kevin Love a token white player gets zero coverage.
"i think that's just inevitable on a Lebron James team  You have the number 1 sidekick   you have the third guy   then you have the guy everyone blames when things go wrong - mario chalmers, kevin love, and now kuzma"
The funny part would be if GSW ends up with Love without giving up Klay Thompson like they considered back in [2014](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2069317-report-warriors-dont-want-to-trade-klay-thompson-in-kevin-love-deal).
"Bucks and Cavs never met in the playoffs. In real meaningful games Lopez is better than Love. Just compare their shooting splits in the playoffs.  Lopez for his career in the playoffs is a 50/35/83 guy.  Love for his career in the playoffs is a 40/40/85 guy.  Add to that the fact that Love cannot guard any position, while Lopez can at least guard his own, and it's obvious Lopez is more useful in the playoffs. Lopez isn't ever going to get locked up offensively. He will always be big enough and skilled enough to finish at the rim efficiently. Kevin Love needs the perfect matchup to excel."
"Trae Young    DeMarcus Cousins    Rudy Gay    Kevin Love    Ramon Sessions"
Nobody was giving Kevin Love that contract. A lot of people questioned it even then.
"Let's say this. You're not winning anything unless Kevin Love is, at most, your 4th best player."
Kevin Love will regress to Kevin Like
"You are talking about stats, Im talking about as a player / skill. KD is the better shooter, scorer, shot creator, ball handler, defender and Bron was the better rebounder and passer with a better IQ.  Comparing stats is silly because LeBron's 2nd option was Kevin Love meanwhile KD had Steph/Klay so of course his numbers would be down. Look what happened when Bron got AD, all his numbers went down too meanwhile we saw this playoffs that KD can put up big numbers too when he needs to."
"Like a week ago someone said Kevin Love made the Olympic roster for tokenism and everyone said ""what if a white person said that they'd lose their job"". Now the races were reversed and still no one gives a fuck."
"Let Allen walk.  But knowing this is the NBA they’ll draft Mobley, pay Allen a ridiculous contract for his average production, and the Cavs will claim they can play both big men together with Mobley playing PF due to his ability to shoot the 3. Kevin Love may or may not be on the Cavs by the end of the summer but we’ll assume he is. Mobley will come off the bench because they want to bring him along slow because he’s “a kid”. They’ll experiment with a 2 C lineup in the preseason and see minimal results. The regular season comes &amp; Mobley will be the backup C. All of his minutes will come at C &amp; it will take several games before Bickerstaff feels comfortable to test out playing both big men together due to pressure from fans that makes the front office want to appease them. They’ll try it for different 5 minute stretches over the course of maybe 2 weeks with the 2 C lineup ranking at the bottom as far as efficiency of their 5 man lineups. Eventually they’ll abandon it and just begin a rotation at C with Allen &amp; Mobley. Allen will face criticism because he’s now viewed as overpaid because he’s a limited rim running big man &amp; his production is still 11 PPG 10 RPG or around that level but he has little room to grow or develop beyond that because he’s splitting minutes &amp; his backup offers more upside on both ends. As the Cavs slip out of contention once again, we’ll see Woj mention that Cleveland would be interested in moving Allen for the right deal. The trade deadline comes &amp; Allen is still underperforming based on what he’s paid &amp; teams are hesitant to trade a valuable player or pick for him. While Cleveland still wants to recoup the 1st they gave up to acquire him. No trade takes place. Long story short in Summer 2022 the Cavs trade Jarrett Allen and the 4 years remaining on his deal along with a  future protected 1st round pick to OKC for 2 future 2nds to create a Trade Exception."
"Like wen Rubio and Derek Favors played with Ramon Sessions, Rudy Gay, and Kevin Love.  [Rubio Favor, Gay, Love, Sessions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omshb/rubio_favors_gay_love_sessions/)."
"Is there anything more nephew that can possibly said than ""he gave Kevin Love depression"". I personally think not"
"He formed a superteam and declared he's going to win ""not 5, not 6, not 7""  He revolutionized the league trend of shameless flopping  He completely fumbled the China situation  He also gave Kevin Love depression  Fuck him."
They can't keep getting away with this.  Raptors could use a cheap Kevin Love.
"&gt; Kevin Love gives up $90 million for example, so team only has to pay $10 million  It's more like Love gives up 10 million, so the team only has to pay $90 million."
Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan didn't purposely derail their teams and destroy peoples dreams for their narcissist ego complexes.
"Wow, I can’t believe Kevin Love took Ayton’s spot on Team Bahamas, ya know, where Ayton is from"
"Then Raps/Warriors is equal conjecture. As for 2016 the team had a much better Steph and Klay vs a shittier Kevin Love for the Cavs, completely different teams"
kevin love*
"I think where Jalen and Rachel were wrong was to include an individual in their complaints. If Jalen makes those comments when the Olympic team isn’t settled, then it’s not as big a deal as when he specifically calls out the selection of Kevin Love as a token gesture. Same with Rachel, if she makes the same statement about minorities and women competing for a single spot without mentioning Maria Taylor then it’s a lot less big of a deal."
"I personally believe that this is bc casuals love easy to follow narratives and superteams. It's easier for them to understand what's going on.  I do not understand this logic whatsoever bc 2017 and 2018 were boring as fuck thanks to Kevin Durant, but I'm obviously not the majority"
"https://awfulannouncing.com/nba/espns-rumored-retooling-of-nba-countdown-is-reportedly-closer-to-happening-with-rachel-nichols-and-maria-taylor-reportedly-replacing-michelle-beadle.html  They both were reported to be hosting it part time. That's the only report we have.  I don't really care who does the host job either but the entire reddit narrative seems to be ""Nichols had the job completely but then ESPN took it away last minute!"" Similar to your comments.  ESPN also never released a press release saying Nichols got the job like you said. Just wanted to know where you got that from but I see its just an assumption lol.  Damn near LeBron gave Kevin Love depression type assumptions lol."
"All I'm asking about is where this narrative ""that Rachel had the job down pat but then ESPN took it away from her"" came from?  Because it really is the main narrative surrounding this in Reddit at least lol.  I don't really care who's in the position honestly. No game tonight and was curious about the hoopla so I did this research a bit.  Like ""Lebron gave Kevin Love depression"" type assumptions lol."
Give me Kevin Love
Kevin Love massively underperformed in the playoffs
So then I take you think Jalen Rose should be fired for his comments on Kevin Love
"That's effectively saying ""no contract buyouts allowed."" If another team wanted Kevin Love's contract, they could have it.  Cleveland would probably even pay the receiving team some assets to get rid of it.  The problem is that no team wants the contract.  Kevin Love doesn't want the contract because no team wants the contract.  This is the same situation for every player that gets bought out.  The real problem from a fan perspective is that these bought out players become UFA's mid-season and tend to go to contending teams over the cap with a vet min deal i.e. the rich get richer.  There's a stupidly easy solution: don't allow taxpaying teams to sign players who have been bought out in the same season.  This will never happen because the NBA actually wants recognizable names on the bench for contending teams because it's good for TV ratings."
In my 2k franchise Kevin Love lead the Cavs to the ECF while sweeping the Bucks and Nets. Let's see if he can make it happen.
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
Not equivalent at all. Remind whose contractually obligated job Kevin Love took?
"Let’s say contract is $100 million, letting it run its course means the team pays the full $100 million.   If a player requests a buyout, he knows he’d have to forfeit a chunk of that $100 million, in return the team lets him go. So it’s cheaper.   Kevin Love gives up $90 million for example, so team only has to pay $10 million"
Cj Miles and Lance Stephenson were the only guys Kevin Love could back down in his entire tenure with the Cavs. And it was always Lebron creating those mismatches and feeding Love. If Lopez played with Lebron you know Lebron would be feeding Lopez with a little guy on him.
"What a stupid comment. Lebron is constantly changing his style of play depending on the team he's on and even within the team depending on the lineup he's in. Kevin Love needed to change too. On a winning team, the role Love played in Cleveland is the role he has to play. There is no other way for him to be effective on a winning team.  Lebron always puts winning and having fun over stats this guy has never prioritized stats. He could have easily averaged a 30 point triple double for his whole career. This guy just watches the ball go out of bounds instead of racking up rebounds.  &gt;Didn't even tell his best friend he was abandoning him, yeah great teammate  You're crying about this more than Wade. Hence why someone like you would never befriend someone like Lebron. Wade respected Lebron's right to control his own career."
"The most interesting option I thought about was letting teams trade partial salaries.   So the Cavs could shop Love and say they’ll keep 25 Million of his Salary for the next 2 years on their books. I’m sure a number of teams would offer *some* kind of assets for a Kevin Love that costs 5 Million/year.   This would mean that teams are always able to trade disgruntled stars, and teams have to have assets to get these types of players. Teams like the Nets couldn’t get Love in this scenario, because they already traded all their picks and assets for Harden.   Some limits would probably have to be put on the system though, so that teams don’t end up with 1 Million/year All-Stars. Maybe teams can only do this on the final year of a players deal? Or teams can only do it once every 5 years? Or you can only split a certain portion of the salary? Idk, there’s a ton of options."
"Thats not how the stats work unless you really truly believe kevin love is a negative player in a jv high school game, bc youre calling him a negative impact. He just isnt as good as lebron, and frank isnt as good as ayton. But players dont normally play 48 mins so that irrelevant to their impact on the game"
"If the team wins by 200 points, and Kevin love plays 45 minutes and posts a +100, then yes he was a negative. That’s literally how the stats work.  Any player on the suns when they win by 12 is expected to post +1 per 4 minutes. Frank played 4 minutes and posted a +0, aka he was worse than expected and worse than an average suns player. (Yes I’m aware that this is incredibly semantic)"
deadass. the responses to the post I replied to were crazy. they're taking brook Lopez over kevin when just their stats are  brook in his 3 postseasons in milwaukee: 13/6/1 on 34.8% from deep  love in his 3 deep postseasons (was hurt in one of them): 15/10/2 on 40.2% from deep
"Yeah, he was somebody you had to account for defensively. Kevin Love absolutely abused CJ Miles in the post on repeated possessions that one year. The Cavs were not afraid to exploit his mismatches.  Meanwhile, you've got teams hiding guys like Bruce Brown on Lopez for extended stretches and getting away with it. Some of it can be blamed on coaching, or lack of aggression from Brook, or the continued evolution of the game away from postups (i.e., refs let you hack Brook in the post but will reward Khris for jumping into his defender at the 3pt line)... but you've also got to give Kevin Love some respect.   He can dribble the ball while backing down (and pass out of the post if it's not there) much better than Brook."
Kevin love was trade for a number one pick
Would rather have the Buck's Lopez than Love then.   Or put one of the young bucks from the Select team to get them trained up for international basketball.   Those must be some juicy photos that Kevin Love has.
people really writing off Kevin Love for some reason. all these responses are pitiful. he scored way better from 3 and put up good production as the 3rd option.  his defense was good too
Season ending surgery he needed and eventually got.   What games did Harden miss?  Kawhi was HURT. And he’s still battling that injury 3 years later.  All of these players fulfilled their contracts for someone else. Kevin Love doesn’t even show up to work and when he does he’s a locker room cancer and throws the ball at teammates.
All of those players played on the court. AD wanted to play but they say them down.   Harden dropped 40 for the Rockets while asking for a trade.   Kawhi was fucking hurt.   Kyrie was dangled in trades &amp; Bron wouldn’t commit before he asked for a trade.    Kevin Love is who y’all need to be mad at.
"Bro, Kyrie played 1.5 games in that series, Love didn't play at all.  You wanna explain to me how the Cavs with 1.5 games worth of Kyrie, and no LeBron and no Kevin Love are beating a 60-win team in a playoff series ?"
Why was Kevin Love on team USA in the first place?
Kevin Love and a top 55 protected second rounder for the first pick. You guys get an ALL STAR CHAMPION VET PRESENCE and SIGNIFICANT draft capital  (please)
"Bruh, the Bahamanians are like a teeny tiny island, there is no way they will ever have a basketball team at the olympics. That's like saying hey olympics, we are having a 200 country pool in the basketball competitions. Opening round is Brunei vs New Guinea. And alas, at least trust the experts... “Kevin Love needs to be replaced by Deandre Ayton”: Jalen Rose  Monkey, you mean Mobley? You ever heard of the DREAM TEAM? You ever heard of Christian Laettner going to Barcelona with Magic, Michael and Bird.....when he had 0 NBA experience? Any of a hundred younger guys will be better than McGee because at 33 and 7 feet tall, with 270 pounds on your knees.... old age is undefeated.  &gt; Have you even watched the exhibition games?  YEAH AND MCGEE DIDNT PLAY IN THEM, HE HASNT SCORED 10 POINTS IN OVER 2 MONTHS. SO UM HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED BASKETBALL LONGER THAN 5 YEARS OR DID YOU START WATCHING WHEN THE SPLASH BROTHERS GOT GOOD? I BET YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHO BARON, MONTE, OR TMC IS...REAL DUBS FAN FO SHO LMFAO (THAT IS UNLESS YOU ARE 12, ACTUALLY THAT WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT)"
At this point peak Kevin Love is sitting on the bench quietly and not disrupting the other players in the locker room.
Trading Kevin Love to a contender is the only way he can heal to full form IMO.      Blake Griffin style
"     https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/richard-jefferson-well-that-was-one-hell-of-a-ride  &gt; Kevin Love, one-on-one in space with Steph Curry, with the NBA Finals on the line. With the weight of history on his shoulders.  &gt; What he did will never get enough credit. Kevin stops Steph not just once, but twice, and forces an impossible shot.  &gt; For me, that play is the essence of basketball. Forget everything that came before that moment. The whole game. The whole series. The whole season. The whole 50-plus years that Cleveland was waiting for their title.  &gt; All that matters is that 10 seconds.  &gt; Steph was trying to get open like his life was on the line.  &gt; And Kevin was playing defense like his life was on the line.  &gt; (I asked Kevin about that moment afterward, and he says he blacked out.)  &gt; When the buzzer went off, and we were champions, I just sat there and started sobbing. I couldn’t even move. It was just too much.  I'm not even a Cavs fan, and the power of the above is undeniable."
Kevin love
"I don't even know Kevin Loves Position nor does it matter when we are talking about replacing melo, Love brings is scoring and rebounding, he is a negative everywhere else, he is unathletic, and I don't want someone who gives up on their team in the middle of the game, dame wants help, wasting money that we can spend on nerlans noel is bad idea, of course nerlans noel would cost alot more then the vet min but we need money either way."
"The Kings still could have drafted Luka.  Eli and Elway should both be heavily criticized for what they did.  And I'm a broncos fan btw.    Also, this is very unique to sports.  Obviously employers want as much control over their employees as possible, but most employees aren't on a guaranteed contract based employment.  Contracts can be viewed as a risk by the employer as well, look at Kevin Love.  Do you know what happens to people like him outside of sports?    The point is, sports is a competition driven industry.  And things like lottery system, contracts, are designed to give as much of an equal opportunity for each franchise.  How can you NOT think market size doesn't matter.  You're a Lakers fan.  I'd guess 25 of the top 50 players played for your franchise at one point.  Do you actually think that happened by coincidence?"
"Timing of contests, this happens to Jokic too   Jokic has always one of the most contests at the rim but people shoot consistently above 65% at the rim against him which is historically bad, Kevin Love is one of them too he actually goes straight up but he's always kinda late or too early"
How is that your takeaway from this list? - Chris Bosh - Kemba Walker - Shawn Kemp - Shawn Marion - Kevin Love - Kristaps Porzingus  How many more examples do you want of players not going to NYC/LA and now Toronto when they had the chance? Good Players go all over.
The Cleveland Cavaliers have made Kevin Love available.
Every kid gonna be rocking the jerami grant and kevin love USA jerseys next school year
"“We judge black players every single day harshly” because most players are black ??  It’s not blasphemous to criticise Kevin love, just nobody cares about him anymore, he is what he is"
"Bur you literally have no idea what they can take. You have no idea what mental issues they are dealing with. Assuming they are mentally healthy because they haven't told you otherwise is not how you are supposed to operate, especially if you want to applaud someone like Kevin Love for speaking up about his mental health issues. Do you think his issues didn't exist before he first spoke out about them?   If I said I care about LGBTQ rights, I wouldn't also continue using homophobic jokes and slurs around my friends. Likewise, for all I know, one of my friends could be in the closet. It doesn't make me an ally if I only watch watch I say around people who came out already.   Additionally, I'm not even sure why you'd think Simmons is someone who is takes criticism well. The guy doesn't shoot because he's afraid to miss, and just shot 30% from the FT line because he crumbled mentally."
The fact that you made Kevin love sucking at basketball about race is just so funny lmao
This isn’t really true. Their are Kevin love truthers who really think he’s been dogging it or been in a bad scheme for 5 years straight
Random Reddit user calling Kevin love trash when he would destroy you in basketball. 😂
Kevin Love owns a 25000sq ft condominium complex in OP’s head
What are you on about? Where did this even come from? People have been clowning on Kevin Love equally.
"I love Steph, but why are these people literally arguing with Kevin motherfucking Durant about who gets double teamed more, James Harden or Steph? Insane shit."
"&gt; Yet with Kevin Love…It’s somehow seen as blasphemous to make negative commentary on his basketball game.   The fuck you talking about?  Everyone knows and says he fucking sucks, lol."
Kevin Love murdered OPs family
Did Kevin Love fuck your girl or something? Why you care about him so much?
Kevin Love.
"Flair checks out. Stay classy my guy .   Kevin Love is washed. It’s okay to call every other marquee level player out—-BLACK PLAYERS—-so get the fuck outta here with this coddling of Kevin Love. He’s garbage and he’s been getting a pass, either bc he’s white or bc he evokes mental health——actually, Paul George evoked mental health too and no one cares—- so yea, it’s bc he’s white"
"Lebron literally quit on his team in a playoff elimination game.  At least, Kevin Love quiting does not have the same weight as Lebron’s. He is already on a losing team that seems to have no direction."
Kevin Durant is your star player. Kevin Love should have been the Haslem/David West veteran of that team. A guy that barely gets playing time but can impart knowledge to the young ones.   You act as if he has not played for team USA before.
This is our B/C team and our worst player by far is Kevin Love. He would be at worst a top 3  in the majority of the other Olympic teams. He would start for pretty much everyone.
Oh don't worry. Olshey will make some league altering moves like usual. Expect an Otto Porter or Kevin Love to be in scarlet and black next season. Dame will wonder why he ever doubted him!
"&gt; Kevin Love being on the team made no sense from the jump.  Maybe, maybe not, but Jalen implying he made the team because he was white (without any evidence to support that conclusion) was ignorant and borderline racist."
Maybe Kevin Love gets bought out and comes back?
Kevin Love is available and is also bff’s with Jalen
&gt; Only Kevin Love quit  like he did on his cleveland team.
Lol somebody from my school scored 75 doing the same shit   Our QB was 6’4 so he was the center and just threw Kevin Love bombs every time anybody got a rebound
Kevin Love would have been if they sent him this year.
"Your friend is on reddit too much, Kevin Love can barely stay on the court right now let alone do good stuff. Simmons is unwilling to shoot but otherwise solid, if perhaps not a guy worth 30 million."
Kevin love really should've just stayed a big fish in that small Minnesota pond
Bro they just sent a washed Kevin love .
The most Kevin Love ending. Will this dude ever be healthy again?
"Kevin Love is 6'8"" barefoot, and therefore probably slightly taller than Bam with shoes on. He's roughly Bron's height."
"Kerr probably keeps tabs on Javale, I'd think. This is an ""emergency"" situation for Team USA, it's like a week until the Olympics and they have 6 players lol.  Also think about it, you think Kevin Love was their first choice? He wasn't, but let's say he was. You think Javale was their second choice right behind Love? He wasn't lol.   This is a very unique situation and everyone trying to act like USA can just add players like it's 2K."
Please keep posting your ridiculous trade proposals on how your team is gonna move up and take cade. It's been great for us at /r/detroitpistons  Best one included kevin love.
Isnt Kevin love also undersized at like 6’7. He’s shorter than Bam and maybe barely taller than Draymond and Zion
Kevin love is much better than javale..  funny shit
"While I understand that there are better players out there aside from KJ and McGee, both make sense to me as to why they’d choose them. Keldon is known as Big Body for a reason and is very physical despite being 6’5. Kevin Love wasn’t doing shit and everyone complained about that and being on the team - and for good reason. McGee can at least rebound, stand in the paint for as long as he wants and knowing that one his top skills in the NBA is goaltending, he’s a natural fit for international play.  Everybody seems to also be forgetting that in a weeks time Booker, Middleton and Jrue are going to be joining the team. Sure they’ll be tired, but they’ll also be in basketball shape after competing at the highest levels in the finals, bringing their skill sets. I realize there isn’t much time before the Olympics to gel, but I expect they put it together and bring back the gold."
Lowkey…Kevin love seems like a jerk. I have no evidence of this.
"This sub hates Kevin Love, lol"
Bro imagine if we had Ja and Zion but team USA playing by inviting Draymond and Kevin Love
Same. Am white. Kevin Love shouldn’t have been on the team. Jalen Rose is an asshat. The two aren’t mutually exclusive.
Kevin fucking Love wasn't providing them with defense
No surprise. Kevin Love is a full-time model part-time basketball player.
"The Warriors finally get Kevin Love, but keep Klay. Light years.  Also, you joke but this has a legitimate shot of happening."
"The Warriors take guy was complaining that the KD Warriors were basically in his mind cheated out of 4-peating by Lebron having a ""superteam"" with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving.  The Zion post was someone saying that after seeing Zion's first few games back from injury, there was a chance he could actually be the best player in his draft class which was the weirdest duh post ever."
The very beginning of this movie was compelling and made me wish that instead of remaking space jam LeBron just made a biopic or something because after the opening credits it was horrendous. This might have done the impossible and surpassed uncle drew as the worst movie I've ever seen. Maybe that's just recency bias though cuz that movie was awful as well. Now we just need Kevin love to make a horrible movie too and the Cavs big three can compete for who desecrated the movie business the hardest.
"I'm really looking forward to the ""Is Kevin Love better than Mitch Richmond?"" conversations when he becomes eligible for the Hall of Fame."
and may Kevin Love forever rest in cleveland for that
1x Kevin Love stepped on Face
"The Cavs are schizophrenic on their big men, they want Mobley but traded for Jarrett Allen, and this season had Kevin Love, Jarrett Allen and Andre Drummond on the team. Team's big positions are volatile."
"Yeah, it’s why the choice of Kevin Love was so baffling.  Dwight in 2008 and DeAndre Jordan in 2016 played that role perfectly, but with Anthony Davis not available they suddenly acted like there was no one left for that role."
"There was definitely some ""let's put Kevin Love on the team to showcase his value for a contender"" going on. Don't know which dick had to get sucked for him to get the call, but a dick was most assuredly sucked, and well, for it to happen. Unfortunately, Kevin then proceeded to do exactly what he does best these days. Get hurt."
"I will say it again for the Stephews and youngins in the back, we aren’t winning the gold this year. If JaVale McGee is the best team USA can do as a replacement player for Kevin Love (who shouldn’t have been on the team in the first place), they’re toast."
Kevin Love will probably be retiring in like 2 years.
"peak Kevin Love was actually a so called ""good stats bad team guy"""
Anyone who bullied Kevin Love explain yourself
KD gave Kevin Love depression
"r/nba : *reams Kevin Love for getting a spot on Team USA*  r/nba, the next day : *reams Kevin Love for withdrawing from Team USA*"
"Only Kevin Love quit, other dudes under health protocol, don't blame love tho he's still recovering"
Kevin Love is Kevin Spacey
"Well, according to the internet, this is at least an upgrade from Kevin Love."
J.R. And Tristan were both better than Love on that 2016 Cavs team. The dude even missed a game the Cavs won. Kevin Love is actually shit and this sub coddles him
Typical Kevin love
Kevin Love hasn’t even been a league average player for 3 seasons now
"That’s irrelevant to my main point though. There will always be bad teams in the NBA, and as fans it’s genuinely bad for the sport to support this sort of behavior. I personally think that if Kevin Love actually tried, his play style would complement two ball handling guards well.   But ultimately even if it didn’t and the Cavs were destined to suck, someone making more money in a single game than 99 percent of NBA fans make in a year complaining about their situation is a massive turnoff to a lot of people. If I wanted to worship rich people’s egos I would be an Elon musk twitter reply guy"
"&gt;It's sad to see him become an average player.  Especially against international competition (not that he have really gotten a chance). I mean, 40+ year old Gasol and Scola can still light it up. Kevin Love should really still be able to dominate at this level."
"Popular in the sub cause the huge white population but tell me why tf he deserved to be on the team in the first place? He was washed in Cleveland, we knew it, and there are plenty other people we could've chosen. Jalen wasn't wrong, Kevin Love being on the team made no sense from the jump."
Randle played decent defense this year and was a decent rebounder. I'm not saying it's disrespectful he didn't earn a spot. Just that Kevin love did.
is it just me or does it seem like Kevin love hasn't played a basketball game in 3 years.  I know he has since I can see his game log but he has been irrelevant for quite some time
"Joining an already formed superteam to make an insane superteam, yeah I get that's a bad look for KD   When Lebron left to join Dwade and Chris Bosh was that a superteam? Coming back to Kyrie and Kevin Love? I dunno maybe all starting 5 have to be all stars to make it a superteam.   The warriors grabbed a former MVP to complete what was already a team they drafted very well for, so yeah it's probably just that one move because it was a big one."
Kevin Love is not even replacement level.
damn kevin love really made of glass smh
Kevin love isn’t playing. So 2 spots.
Kevin love was a hero I couldn’t see it
Definitely a better 12th man than Kevin Love. One of the more underrated young guys in the league because not many people actually watch the Spurs.
Actively quitting on the young teammates you're trying to set an example for is a stressor as well. How convenient that he opened up about depression immediately before quitting on the team because they didn't have LeBron anymore and he didn't want to do the work himself. Fuck Kevin Love.
"And LeBron James is NOT Kevin Love so how about that huh, huh!?"
Julius Randle got passed over for Kevin love lol
"Kevin fucking Love absolutely should not influence our draft decision. A front court rotation of Mobley/Allen/Nance could work, especially since Larry also plays a lot of minutes at the 3."
"Well yeah LeBron will be 40 the next time the Olympics come around, he needed the time to rest his body. But KD is the Vet on that team lol. He's been in the league longer and has waaaay more accolades and experience than Kevin Love does"
"Listen, I am the first one to bash Kevin Love during the regular season, but I honestly respect him pulling out. He could’ve continued to try and play, traveled to Tokyo, and gotten hurt or not being able to go 100% ultimately hurting the team. So it’s big of him to pull out now and give us the chance to fill the spot rather than try and do it and not be able to play once in Japan. I don’t like him and the way he’s acted on the Cavs, but I do not fault him for this at all."
"To be honest I think Kevin love is done with basketball mentally. I think he'll continue to play but I don't think the passion is there anymore.  It can be argued he had a hall of fame career. He won a NBA Championship, he won an Olympic gold, and he won the World Cup. He literally has nothing else to win. He knows MVP is out of reach. So I think he's checked out and just collecting checks"
"Kevin Love has been checked out of basketball since Lebron left.  His head and heart aren't on the court anymore, his body language and effort depict this."
"It's sad to see him become an average player. Loved him at UCLA, and fat Minnesota Kevin Love was legit an all NBA caliber guy. Sexy skinny Kevin Love was a high level stretch 4 who was the third best player on a championship team, but when they moved him to the perimeter his post scoring and rebounding went away, he didn't have the lateral quickness to defend on the perimeter, and his passing ability wasn't fully utilized either. Hard to complain since it led to a ring, but it feels weird and wrong to see a borderline hall of fame talent reduced to a glorified floor stretcher."
Honestly is that not just the most Kevin Love thing to do? Flake out at the last minute and disappear for unknown reasons but no one asks any further questions or cant.
30 out of 30 NBA franchises would take Jerami Grant over Kevin Love  Not really sure what point you’re trying to make
Jerami Grant is a much better basketball player than 2021 Kevin Love.
"what is ""peak Kevin Love""? Is he planning on going back in time?"
Kevin Love and Isaiah Thomas also
"Colangelo did Melo wrong, he showed up in 2004(when everyone skipped), 2008, 2012, 2016(when a lot of players skipped). wanted to just be allowed to practice with guys in 2018, and colangelo didn't even return his calls. But he gave his golden boy Kevin Love a spot on the team leaving off zion, trey ja and so many others."
Kevin Love breaking his hand doing knuckle push-ups
Kevin love?
Kevin Love?
Kevin Love played 77 games that season and didn’t make the all star team nor did he make an all nba team.
Kevin Love and Klay Thompson - Little League
My issue with Kevin Love picked was that he didn’t show up for 2016 or 2018. So I feel like those players who did show up would get some sort of priority over Kevin Love who has not participated since 2012.
"really? I think the Kevin Love selection was problematic for very different reasons. bam not getting selected in 2018, Trae &amp; Ja openly annoyed to not have been invited, the general lack of young stars outside of Tatum &amp; Booker, Colangelo being an absolute idiot in the press, Pop at his age — it's nice that it all worked out in the end, but team USA absolutely has some problems to sort out. first, re: their appeal to younger players in the league. especially when we had trouble against all these teams with mad continuity."
Colalengo did say that guys who have played for the team before and have interest again are given priority for Team selection in that Kevin Love burial piece
The people who are in this thread complaining about Johnson are the same people who complained about Kevin Love. Stop caring about who is on the end of the bench.
Kevin Love and Paul George up next!
Getting rid of the Debbie Downer Kevin Love probably helped too.
"Everybody is talking about how much closer the rest of the world is getting to the US, but I have to whole heartily disagree. The only reason these games were close is because team USA was horrendous offensively with their guard play. Don't get me wrong Luka and Giannis are top 5 in the world (evidence that the gap is narrowing) and more and more countries have NBA players on their olympic roster, but the games haven't been close since 2004 and they wouldn't have been this year.   Again the guard play.  I love Dame time, and Booker was amazing in the NBA playoffs and Hollidays defense was next level tonight but my god this team had no pick and roll action what so ever.  Like who the f\*ck was the POINT GUARD on this team? Team USA almost got rolled because France was annihilating them on the pick and roll. Seriously, they made Rudy Gobert look like the best player on the planet. Which is fine. I'll take Gobert missing half his free throws at the line. That wasn't the problem. The problem was team USA on offense.   Don't get me wrong KD was amazing and Tatum was too during stretches. But their offense was so disjointed and one dimensional. I get Steph probably didn't want to play bc he has has some bad luck with injuries the past few years, CP3 is aged out at this point for the same reason, and Kyrie as well, but this team really lacked someone like De'aron Fox, Ja Morant, or Trae Young. Like bruh, I could probably name 3 - 4 other logical choices. And not to mention TEAM USA had the opportunity to replace Kevin Love. So like maybe dudes didn't want to commit months ago / a year but they could have got an elite PG to commit last minute.  Even though Team USA won and it sounds like I'm being negative, I'm just point out that anyone who watched the last minute saw Team USA dodged a 2004 level bullet bc of poor roster construction.      One point guard please."
"what do you mean? They got wiggins with a 1.7% probability of getting the first pick and then trades it for kevin love which is the only reason lebron came. cavs got so unbelievbly lucky THATS why lebron came back, o/w he prob  stay in miami or goes to LA to play with kobe, then kobe would prob be alive today actually"
Kevin Love playing defence.
"Not even sharing a continent with the US but I love this video, two people widely hated on here telling the talking head dum-dums (and by extension our fine community here) to shove it. And if someone has a right to say their skill at their job is unmatched it's Kevin Fucking Durant and the country that churns out these generational players"
Kevin Love died for this.
"I felt curious enough to try to find out who else has come close to this, for no particular reason. These 3 all came close to an NCAA championship but not quite, Kevin Love (final 4) Andre Iguodala (elite 8) and Steve Smith (sweet sixteen), but had the rest."
"He really popped this tournament. Probably the 4th or 5th best guy out there.   Dame was 25th, right behind Kevin Love."
Kevin Love and we all know why \s
Reading it gave Kevin Love depression.
"if we had Kevin Love, we would have covered the spread"
I remember when they did that for Kevin Love when he first joined the Cavs
Draymond Green is what Kevin Love thinks he is
Fuck I love Kevin Durant
Bring in Kevin love 💗
Kevin Love
I love being able to cheer for Kevin Durant for a change
How is team USA going to stop Gobert without Kevin love?
I’m not holding out a lot of hope for Kevin Love. I feel like the Lakers would be his primary target with Lebron and going back to LA with Russ. Plus he’d get more minutes there.
Hopefully Kevin Love becomes available because he'd honestly be a bargain at 6m because he can still drop 10 and 6 off the bench with decent defense and shooting
I just hope Kevin Love gets bought out and is willing to sign with us
Was that the problem? I thought Charlotte just wanted to focus on developing their younger players?  Kinda like the Cavs and Kevin Love situation now
"Someone made a post on here, but it's difficult to believe that a team would have that many draft misses.   A lot depends on the situation and whether or not the player has a spot on the team.  E.g Someone , such as Derrick Williams', were logged behind Kevin Love. How good was he really supposed to become?"
"I’m fine with the Allen signing. It’s a reasonable contract that we should be able to move if needed. The big mistake was that huge Kevin Love contract. It really hamstrung us in speeding up the rebuild, and we really need the Mobley pick to work out, otherwise it’s like 3 more years at least of sucking/tanking and probably have to get rid of one of Sexton/Garland so we don’t get tied up with bunch a long term contracts when the team is mediocre or worse."
Kobe and Curry are my all time 2 favorite players. I'm going with Kobe due to his ability to destroy people in the 4th by being absolutely unguardable and having better court vision as a play maker down the stretch when it's necessary. Curry is a damn good scorer but still has issues when the defense steps up on him. I'll never forget an average defensive push from Kevin Love in the last minute of game 7. Kobe scores there without a doubt.
"Curry is a better shooter, but Kobe is a better scorer. Kobe wouldn’t have let Kevin Love stop him in his prime like that."
&gt; How in god's green earth you are 7 ft tall and you average 6 rebounds per game? That's laughably bad.  Kevin Durant is 7 ft tall and averaged 5.6 boards a game last season. Your team would love to have him.
Kevin Love
For Kevin Love
Kevin Love was pretty good
"Fuck it, Kevin Love to the Pyongyang Lions"
Best I can do is the soulless corpse of Kevin Love
"To be fair, he was surrounded by JR Smith, Delly, Shumpert, Mozgov, TT and James Jones. It's bound to happen when you're forced to shoot 30+ times a night just to even keep your team in the game. Notice how it didn't happen the next year when Kyrie and Kevin Love were playing?"
How does no one mention AI? That dude made me love basketball.  1) MJ 2) Kobe 3) AI 4) Shaq 5) LeBron 6) Carmelo 7) Steph 8) KD 9) Kevin Garnett 10) Tim Duncan
He's more talented than Kevin Love. Just doesn't seem to have the killer instinct to turn that talent into being a dominate player.
~~Norman~~ Kevin Fucking ~~Rockwell~~ Love
"I didn’t make any excuse. I just said that that’s a completely unfair comparison. If Bradley Beal somehow gets traded to the Nets, he didn’t somehow become a much better player because he’s going to make the finals now.  So saying “Russ is gonna make the finals and those players are not” is a completely ridiculous argument for why he is better value. Whichever you think has better value you should make an actual argument instead of saying stupid shit like that.  Also, I have said the same thing about Kevin Love being overrated (before everyone jumped on that train) and about Tony Parker being a little overrated at the time."
"Colluded during the 2008 olympics with bosh , Wade... kyrie said lebron said to him he’s coming back during a game against the cavs and said openly he wants to play with kevin love... midseason of 2019 had dinner with AD and after AD asked for a trade.. AD and Lebron met with Westbrook before trading for him. Lebron been doing this shit since his heat days."
"At that point, it is what it is. Tough love and then bye Felicia.      You act like this just happened, this has been brewing for years for prima Donna Ben Simmons Mr I'm too good to work on my game cuz I got 3rd team all NBA.  Jordan and LeBron best ever work on their games always.  BEN thinks he is on that level? James Harden level? KEVIN DURANT LEVEL? STEPH Curry max level?? those guys produce results, those guys put in the work."
I love how there have been certain posts on this sub that were so wack that they are still referenced years later. The Lebron gave Kevin Love depression and Brandon Ingram/Travis Outlaw posts are some that come to mind 😂
"KD was on the Warriors with everybody coming of screens, while Lebron was on the Cavs with Kevin Love and some scubs who couldn’t keep score."
Kevin Love isn’t playing
"I love these Ben Simmons articles! LOL!  What Simmons' camp should realize that these stories they leak are not actually doing anything to help their client.   They are just lowering and lowering his trade value. Yes, everyone got good, hearty laughs about the Sixers wanting multiple first-rounds and an all-star player in return. But, Philly's at a point should be happy if they get Kevin Love and a 2029 first-rounder. That's how much Simmons' group as devalued him.   Philly's only play now is hoping someone like Dame says, ""Wait, I actually don't want to spend the rest of my prime being on a borderline playoff team. I will only play for a contender."" But, even then, why would Portland want back Simmons' albatross of a contract if they are going to tank? And the city fell in love with Dame for everything he is - great shooter, clutch player, works his ass off, etc. Ben is the exact opposite."
"How many white players are even talked about? 75% of the NBA is black. How many stars are there currently that are white? 2? 3? Jokic, doncic, porzingas? Kevin love, maybe?  People destroy porzingas on reddit. Only really jokic and Luka get passes for honestly sad behavior--i hate ref whining for the record."
He's basically the non-out of shape version of the Kevin Love invite who's just there cuz of prior history.
"""Curry Stopper"" Kevin Love"
Cavs Kevin Love: Born To Die  Lakers Kevin Love: Lust For Life
You can add a few more after kevin love joins them.
"They want Kevin Love, not Ben."
"Even if you think those guys stunk (which is what you are implying), it still fits with exactly what I said: ""They tried, they just made **bad moves**.""    The moves did not pan out, but there was a thought process behind them.     Hughes got a big contract for a reason.  He was a 20 ppg scorer, young, and an athletic if inconsistent defender.  He was supposed to be the up and coming young guy to develop with Lebron, the Pippen to his Jordan.  Marshall was a stretch 4 before that role even really existed.  He was a good rebounder and could shoot the 3, which even in hindsight is something valuable for a player like Lebron (poor man's Kevin Love).    What is that if not trying?"
Kevin Love making $31M
"A lot of the per game stats were similar, but LeBron played every game and had a worse supporting cast. Kevin Love still had a fine season, but Harden had *Chris Paul*. As we've seen CP3 do for many teams, he makes everyone around him better. Like someone else said, LeBron on that Rockets team would make them unstoppable, but Harden could not have carried that Cavs team the same way."

"A GOAT would never have lost to that mavs team period. Give Jordan in his prime dwade and Chris bosh and it's a sweep gentleman's sweep at worst.  Lbj's need to team up has tarnished his greatness. 1st wade and bosh... 2nd I'll go back home bit only if you get Kevin love cus they already have Kyrie next I'll make a kid who's signed to essentially his agency hold out on his team and force a trade from the pelicans to the Lakers  now he needs another superstar in Westbrook.

"Kevin Love trick yall, i’ve never seen a year long muscle strain in my life."
"Kevin Love trick yall, i’ve never seen a year long muscle strain in my life."
"Kevin Love, Pau Gasol, Chris Bosh were all-stars.  Not Superstars."
It's a joke on Coangelo choosing Kevin Love based on his word
"Guys who are still making more than Randle after this extension:  DeAngelo Russel, Kevin Love, Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Jrue Holiday, Rudy Gobert"
Can't be worse than current Kevin Love
"Sure you could argue Kyrie wasn’t.  Kevin love? 26.1/12.5/4.4 year before cavs. Come on don’t joke around.  Chris Bosh? 24/10.8/2.4 year before heat. Was raptors franchise player.   Pau Gasol? 20.4/8.9/4.6 on his best year on the grizzlies.  Hell every big man Lebron on lebrons super teams have been better than Pau.   Wade, Bosh, Irving, Love, AD, WB, Gasol, Bynum.  Go ahead and list these players in order on who’s best, I’m interested to see your list."
"Kevin love isn’t good. He’s very average and was definitely overrated as hell. I would know more than anyone on this sub. I’ve been a t wolves fan my whole life. If he’s so great, how come we never made it to the playoffs?  Side note, is there actually a universe that we live in where you actually think you’re making any sense with your comments?"
"You're literally all over this thread bashing Kevin Love just to further suck off your idol. Get off your kneepads man, it's embarassing"
"Keldon Johnson, young player for the Spurs and was originally on the select team. He was brought up with the absences of Kevin Love and Bradley Beal  EDIT: If you are referring to the US team that is"
I love how the announcer even refers to us as “Kevin Durant and friends”
Chris Bosh was not a superstar.  Also neither was Kyrie or Kevin Love.
Where was Lebron with out Dwade and Bosh? Kyrie and Kevin Love? Anthony Davis? And now Russ and Melo?
"Getting rid of max contracts would he the best route for the NBA from a parity standpoint but the NBPA would never agree and also it turns out superteams get ratings.  Think about this. Bron AD and Westbrook will run you about $110 million a year. Mike Conley, Tobias Harris and Kevin Love is about $100 million. Yes I intentionally chose some terrible contracts but maybe the latter 3 were actually worth that at the time of signing. But by capping salaries for the former 3 you really stifle teams that don't have one of the handful of superstars out there."
"Lol yall think LeBron isnt friends with D-Wade and Bosh anymore? I swear to god this is some ""LeBron gave Kevin Love depression"" level of psychoanalysis"
Kevin Love?
"I could, but you wouldn’t like it and it would be a waste of time. You could start by looking at players that were good enough to win 2 MVPs lol   A guy that is barely above Kevin Love in career WS/48 has no place in a discussion of greatest players of all time. Kobe was a master of flash and marketing"
So far it looks like Kevin Love fat ass and his contract are actually the worst. Westbrook is just an expensive player but is still fucking legit. Kevin love is just an expensive bench warmer.
if you don't think that being relegated to a 3rd option made kevin love into what he was on the cavs idk what to tell you bro you're just being purposely dense
"Lol. So, to summarize Kevin love was screwed over by Lebron, that’s why his career fell short.  Thanks guys, I learned so much!"
"I mean again K love was an all-star because of volume and team dynamics in MN. I will give you Bosh, he was legitimately really good. K love clearly was not and got exposed for that during his time in Cleveland.  And yeah, I mean Bosh and love tried filling a role next to Bron. I’d argue it worked pretty well for the heat winning 2 titles and appearing in 4. The cavs run stopped short because Kyrie left and KD went to the warriors. But no, Kevin Love never really was an star on a good team and he has been overrated for most of his career. I don’t know how you could think otherwise?  Finally, yes when multiple elite players join a team their roles will change. What, you really think the cavs didn’t win more because Lebron took the ball away from k love?"
"klove wasn't some top 10 player but he was definitely an all star/3rd team all nba talent now cmon. just because you have a raging hardon for bron doesn't mean kevin love was ass  the cavs literally traded andrew wiggins for him to give lebron a 3rd piece  and yes, lebron relegates his teammates to very basic roles time after time  chris bosh and kevin love filled the same role for bron as gap filler big men. they were two of the best bigs in the league when they teamed up with bron and became considerably less than when on their superteams for a reason  there's really nothing to dispute that"
"I have lived in MN my whole life. Kevin love was the most overrated player. I don’t care what awards or accolades he received, Kevin love was simply an all star because of his team dynamics and situation.  I’m sorry, but if you think Kevin love is some elite player, can’t help you  Lebron neuters his teammates production…what? You think it’s brons fault K love played bad? Why didn’t K love return to his elite form after Lebron left then?"
"No idea, I think it probably really depends on how this year plays out. I think this roster on paper is good enough for the play-in in the East, but we have a serious problem with the injury gods and we're absolutely going to either lose in the play-in or get swept in the first round, since the only players off the top of my head) who have playoff experience on our roster are Kevin Love (lol) and Larry Nance Jr.   There will be a point where we will have to deal one of our young guys though, not enough minutes to go around and you cannot succeed in the NBA with a big pile of 19-22 year olds. No idea who we could bundle picks with to get a franchise star, but I would be astonished if we kept all of our prospects two years from now."
"To be honest, we have gotten quite unlucky in the lottery in the past 3 years (excluding this year, and obviously this is karma for all the bullshit first overall picks we got in the past), so we've dropped out of the top tier of the Luka/Trae, Zion/Morant, Edwards/Wiseman/Ball draft. The Brooklyn Pick (which became Sexton) in 2018 was poised to be a top 3 pick until somehow Brooklyn decided to go on a run at the end of the year and absolutely tank the pick's value, and we dropped out of the top 3 in 2019/2020 due to luck.  We didn't sign Drummond, we gambled on his expiring deal to try and get assets but it didn't work. Kevin Love was just a shit contract we gave out after 2018 because somehow Gilbert was on enough meth to think we could still compete. Also Garland has grown to about 6'3'' reportedly which is encouraging because we aren't running two tiny guards on D.   The gameplan now I think is to be shit for one more year and then go in with assets to get a star and try to compete. Next year I think one of our young guys is gone, plus our FRP, to secure a franchise player and make a playoff push. Or it's possible we keep all of them if we manage to outperform expectations. Everything is uncertain at this point."
"Dude what are cavs gameplan seriously? Post LeBron they are just stuck in rebuilding limbo. They drafted a couple of names like Sexton, Garland, Okoro, (and now Mobley) that are okay. but not much of a household name on a small market like Ja Morant or DeAaron Fox.   Then they signed an Andre Drummond for a bit (which is now gone). And they still have Kevin Love. Now they have a decent Jarett Allen and probably Ricky. I guess I'm just wondering what are they gonna do? Are they just waiting for these young guys to breakout? Are they being a trade assett? Or who to build around with?"
"I really hope as a Cavs fan that he goes for less than the max, we have to have room to pay Kevin Love eight years past his prime"
"yeah that would be my eye test and watching the games.   i do put a lot of ability on having an incredible go-to move, performing in the playoffs, and then height is big for me because it’s just so hard to match up with those guys   I can’t put Curry up there because his 1 on 1 game is not the same as Durant and Mike. Mike and Durant aren’t going to be slowed down by Delly and they aren’t having trouble going by/over Kevin Love. if Steph has another playoff run where he is the lead dog, he could bump up, but Durant was the Finals MVP for good reason and isn’t going anywhere  Harden hasn’t performed at an all time level yet in the playoffs. not at the tier 2 level where you have Shaq winning 3 straight, Kareem winning Finals MVP like 15 years apart, and LeBron’s final performances.   to try to be succinct, i think that elevating your play in the playoffs while being able to provide a consistent floor of scoring is most important to me"
"What are you trying to say? Also, you’re responding to someone making a meme of that post that said LeBron gave Kevin Love depression"
It’s pretty hard to quit against Kevin love in isolation  Curry averaged 23/5 on 52% TS harden averaged 35/7 on 60% TS with a worse team lmao
I mean... The other a guy told me that kobe was not top 30 all time and that we had no business discussing Kobe as a top player of all time because he was barely above Kevin Love in ws48
So 1 game 4 years ago?   Didn’t Kevin love lock down curry in the biggest game of the decade?
"This is true. His extension started at 16 while fellow draftees Russell Westbrook, Eric Gordon, and Kevin Love started at ~13 mil. Chances are Rose wasn't going to get to 16, because like you said he wasn't winning MVP (his max might have jumped up because of that, not sure) or making the all-star team. However, I still think they would have resigned him and figured it out later."
"&gt; I really think he would've won a championship one day  He could've even won one on the way out and been a big part of it. The Warriors looked REALLY good for the 2015 after the way they turned a leaf in 2014 (Steph's rise, the unexpected semis appearance and employing Kerr afterwards). There was a good chance they were going to seriously contend even before the 2015 season unveiled (even J.O knew it as shown below) and so the Dubs invited Jermaine for another run. Even at 35 and as a vet, he looked like one of the best backup bigs in the league but he declined implying he wanted to finally stay at home with his family  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;O’Neal found Warriors GM Bob Myers, his old agent. “I said, ‘Don’t do anything else. You don’t need anybody. These guys are going to be good.’” Later that summer, when O’Neal heard the rumors about Kevin Love, he called Myers. “I said, ‘Don’t you dare do that,’” remembers O’Neal. “Klay is one of the best two-way players in the game. He’s supremely underrated on defense. He moves his feet as well as anyone I’ve seen in a long time, and typically guys only go hard one way or the other, not both offense and defense. I said, ‘Bob, give these guys another year.’” In the end, Myers did. O’Neal, however, did not. That summer, he chose not to return for a 19th season. His playing career, he said, was over."
Wade admitted he was the one responsible for calling out Love. IT just followed Wade's lead.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10009825-dwyane-wade-opens-up-about-incident-with-kevin-love-while-playing-with-cavaliers
No way he could have gotten traded on that money though. Kevin Love has been trying to get traded since LeBron left.
everyone likes to joke about him sonning Dame but Jrue became Kevin Love’s biological father that game. Love couldn’t do *anything* against Jrue
Bron’s the only one who’s allowed to give Kevin Love depression
Big heart? Only in Boston maybe.   Didn't he have locker room troubles on the Cavs with Lebron and Kevin Love and then basically never demonstrated any kind of vet leadership on the Nuggets and Wizards?  There's a reason why every team that had him after Boston dumped him after a year at most despite him being on a minimum.
"completely agree. loved his game at his prime but after that kevin love incident i’ve lost most of my respect for him as a person. this looks like a cry for attention. the nba did not do him dirty, his skillset is unfortunately not enough for the biggest place at this age and his size."
"Now I'm trying to think of other lineups that would be close. 2017-18 Celtics had Kyrie (1), Smart (6), Brown (3), Tatum (3), Horford (3), which is pretty up there, but I'm struggling to think of other teams that  ran anything like three 1st overall picks.  I think technically in 2014, between the Cavs signing LeBron and trading for Kevin Love, the Cavs had 4 #1 picks on their roster. They never actually played together since the trade happened before the season, but theoretically they could've put out lineups of Kyrie (1), Wiggins (1), LeBron (1), Bennett (1), Tristan Thompson (4)."
"I would disagree that there is no reason   When talking about IT people automatically name his shortcomings as a defense, but he was acting like an asshole all the way up to the exit.    - Brinks truck  - Kevin Love  - ""Im not here to contribute, im here to dominate"" (coming to Nuggets)   Not once did he show any smidge of humbleness once his Celtics tenure was over, and acted like a diva. Never spoke of a team needs, but rather his own success, where ever he ended up.   And judging by this video, it's still on. It's his own video production, and the message is ""Look at **me**, im Crying!"", not embracing what NBA gave to him, but instead forcing the issue that ""NBA did him wrong"" and everyone should feel bad about it."
"Not exactly brain-dead, he has the resources to advise him, the money to support him. Not anyone elses fault he turned down $21mil/year contract extension, and he still has more than enough for himself and his family while people are homeless. I just cant bring myself to feel bad for someone (who will still be making more than enough for himself and his family) who's jacking himself off on how bad his luck is while still getting 2 digits higher pay than the highest state median income.  Kevin Love is an overpayed shithead too and I dont respect him any more for getting made fun of by dumbasses because he happens to have depression. He should retire."
He was a horrible off the court too. He called out Kevin love for having anxiety and missing a game. Bron traded his ass right afterwards
[Locker room cancer](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavs-team-meeting-drama-kevin-love-was-reportedly-called-out-by-isaiah-thomas/amp/)
Now show the video of him berating Kevin Love telling HIM he’s not doing enough to help the team while IT’s bum ass sat the entire first half of the season. Screw this midget clown for real
You must have missed the time where he outrebounded Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love combined in the finals

You're making large claims with no backup.
He's no Kevin Love
Ask the Lopez twins. Kevin Love was one bad bad man taking them both on when UCLA visited Stanford’s Maples Pavilion. I know - I was there.
Kevin Love seems like a decent guy but he’s had a ton of issues with Sexton over the years lol
Lol I love the Cavs commentators hyping up Larry Nance and Kevin Love post up.. they don’t learn 😭
Jrue clamped Kevin Love so bad that game. Had one sick play where I think he blocked Love’s 3 and then nutmegged him right after
"Watching Russ play at UCLA was an absolute privilege. Getting to see him, Kevin love, Aflalo, Framar, and Darren Collison."
Yeah. Was this before or after Kevin Love?  Edit not comment about Arrest. Just curious about the timeline.
"This is kind of a flawed argument because there are also guys with comparable (if not better) resumes who aren’t in the Hall or who took decades to get there.  With guys like Bob Dandridge, Paul Westphal, Jack Sikma, Sidney Moncrief, and Bobby Jones getting in recently, his outlook has improved, but there are still guys like Marques Johnson, Mark Price, Shawn Kemp, Tim Hardaway, Maurice Lucas, and others who I’d argue are at least peers with Kevin Love in terms of HOF worthiness.  The one thing Love has over those guys (except Lucas) is a ring. If he had been a more important contributor to that 2016 Cavs team, I’d say he’s pretty close to a lock, but he played 26 mpg in those Finals, averaging 8 points and 7 boards on .362/.263/.706 splits. He was basically a role player in that series that was lifted to a championship by Kyrie and LeBron, so I think it will kinda come down to how the voters view that 2016 ring. Will they see him as an essential part of Cleveland’s “Big Three” or will they see him as just a role player riding coattails to a championship?  Ultimately, I agree that he’s probably in, but it might take a few decades for that to happen, so I wouldn’t really call him a lock just yet."
How is Kevin Love a joke answer he’s literally only ever on the bench
Actually though Kevin Love will be coming off of the bench next year
"No, they just play the role they're supposed to on a championship team. Kevin Love as your leading scorer isn't a contender."
"how would he stack against paul westphal, he seems to have less accolades than kevin love."
Did he not offer Kevin Love that horrendous contract? Ive blocked it from my memory so it could have been Griffin
Best one is when he gets a [rebound over Kevin Love in the Olympics](https://youtu.be/nxEf9xHIZ5M)
"Not really lol. Lebron fans always find somebody to blame on. I don't remember Kevin Love or Chris Bosh having any 0 points game playing alongside Lebron but they get blamed on all the fucking time.  Remember Mario Chalmers? Chalmers, KCP and Schroder are not even all stars. I mean, you are Lebron, you are supposed to carry, not giving up plays while every game counts."
JJ Redick  Joe Ingles  Kevin Love  Gordon Hayward  Steph Curry
"Is Kevin Love a center or still a power forward? After Slo-Mo (Kyle Anderson), Love isn't exactly putting anyone on skates."
"Hard for a white guy to make it.  Culture is what it is in basketball   Kevin Love is a good example, he just couldn’t handle the bs being pushed on him daily.  Teams look for guys from overseas because they aren’t spoiled, entitled, divas.  They are usually hard workers and don’t bitch and moan about not getting their way."
Love? Like Kevin Love? Dear god.
This take is the same ridiculous level of the “lebron gave Kevin love depression” take.
I’m pretty sure most of America thought they should have traded Klay for Kevin Love too.
The designation of a super team doesn't depend on if there successful or not. That was a super team. Remember what Kevin love was doing before he came. Kyrie was already an allstar highlight reel. And they did well enough considering who they were against.
 REAL WOLVES LEADER   KEVIN LOVE WHO ????
You say silver spoon though which is absurd. His dad was a personal trainer. Thats not fuck you money lol. Kevin Love is silver spoon.
"I think the Cavs will be a pleasant surprise.   - Jarrett Allen bout to have monster year n make Brooklyn regret doggin him out  - they got tons of young talent wth sexton, okoro, garland, mobley,   - solid depth with dude like osman, rubio and Dean Wade could b good plus Nance who may be one of the best bench players in the league   - pretty chill coach in bickerstaff  - and who knows, Kevin Love may have a resurrection   Go Cavs!!!!"
Kevin Love
i love it. Kevin O'boomed
"LA: Westbrook, Harden, Paul Pierce, Kawhi, Kevin Love. Jrue Holiday, PG, Brook Lopez, Tyson Chandler, Baron Davis, Reggie Miller, Klay, Gilbert Arenas off the bench"
"Kevin Love was born in Santa Monica, but he grew up in Portland area"
"PG: Damon Stoudamire  SG: Terrence Ross  SF: Kevin Love(Lake Oswego but close enough)  PF: AC Green  C: Domantas Sabonis  Bench: Jerami Grant, Ime Udoka, Dave Gambee, Richard Washington, Terrence Jones, Michael Doleac, Terrell Brandon, Ronnie Brewer, Mike Dunleavy"
"Kevin Love, Domatas Sabonis, Damon Stoudamire, Terrell Brandon, Terrance Ross- Terrence Jones, AC Green, Mike James, Ronnie Brewer, Dan Dickau, Ime Udoka"
NBA Kevin rankings.  1. Durant 2. Garnett 3. Love 4. Johnson
"Wow I was going to say the exact same thing, the Ball brothers get this the most...  I think lonzo is a bit under 6'5"", Lamelo a weak 6'6, maybe even shorter. But the amount of people that discussed his (incredible) passing with ""that vision at 6'8"". He's listed 6'6"" everywhere since he got into nba. But people are still talking about his inflated shoe height lol that he had in NBL.  I'm guessing if they get 6'7.5 *in shoes*, these other leagues will list it at 6'8"". But bball shoes are thick af, so it turns into sometimes 3 inches different (Kevin Love for example)."
I think something similar happened with Wiggins/Kevin Love. Wiggins couldn’t be traded for about thirty days. But they still did it. It’s was like a under the table deal that everyone knew
"https://youtu.be/E_qUoOBBlA0 - even without this argument, I'd take a one legged, coked out Rodman over a healthy post-Wolves Kevin Love any day of the week."
Will be eclipsed when the Cavs sign Kevin Love to a 5 year $262m extension next off-season.
Kevin Love
3 other first overall picks who were Kyrie and Bennett+Wiggins who we traded for Kevin Love. Where is the problem here. Your team literally just got bounced in the first round because your roster construction is horrific and you're out here pretending like your team is a paragon of excellence lol
Jerryd Bayless better than Westbrook &amp; Kevin Love confirmed
Chad Ford had Westbrook as his 4th ranked players and went 4th.  The reach in the draft was Mayo.  The only player ranked above Westbrook still available was Kevin Love.
"Rose is not 6'8, he is a legit 6'6, he is the same height as Doug Collins. These NBA height listings are usually an inch and a half off or even a full two inches off. Someone like Kevin Love is almost three inches off his real height lol."
Sounds like you could use Kevin Love 😏
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
"Steph deserved finals mvp in 15 and 18 and even if kyrie and kevin love were healthy during the 15 series, it wouldn’t be an automatic win for the cavs like everyone says it would be"
"Senguin can be Minnesota Kevin Love or Kevin Love now, but I think Minnesota Kevin Love is more likely."
"I think the Kevin Love complaint was valid. He's washed, and hasn't been exactly a locker room beacon looking at the Cavs, and didn't bring much that was needed, except for some spacing."
"Kevin Love had a plus minus of -16 in that series, He averaged 8.5-6.8-1.3-0.7-0.3."
"They were a superteam on paper, but not in reality. Kevin Love was not a star in the playoffs, and especially not in the finals. It was LeBron and Kyrie carrying."
Idk why you’re getting downvoted. Btwn the end of the college season and the draft Embiid’s stock rose to being the clear first overall pick- but then an injury was revealed that would sideline him for the whole rookie season and therefore he slipped to 3.  Imagine if the Cavs took him tho and replacing Kevin Love w/ Embiid on those LeBron teams.
"How many play off games did Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving play without Lebron?      If the East was ""pretty crappy"" and Kyrie couldn't even make the playoffs, how much of a number 1 guy was he?       Lebron beat the team with the best record in history, and lead every player in every statistical category for the series. &lt;- There is no greater achievement in basketball history. It can literally only be matched, not topped.      Lebron has won a championship with 3 completely different franchises. Each time he leaves a franchise, they absolutely crater. Where as Jordan's team were still good the year after his retirement.      Lebron has longevity, availability, and the higher individual peak. He's a significantly better passer and a better rebounder. Could guard 1-5. Similar scorers on a night to night basis even if Jordan has a slight edge.  Lebron may coast in the regular season but he can throw out a near 40 point triple double on command."
"that's not a hot take it's exactly what he did lol. They had Kyrie a young all star and the number one pick, then they made the trade for Kevin Love.  that's why he went to Cleveland had carte blanche to rebuild the roster to his liking"
Giannis hitting 90% FT in a game and Kevin Love playing decent defense on Curry on one possession are my favourite moments in recent NBA history
"*media be like: ""Draymond throws shade at Kevin Love"""
"AD was traded for, not signed as FA. Same with Kevin Love on the Cavs."
"Nonnegligible in value, but negligible in scoring. Most 3rd options in the modern era have been elite defenders to complement this, the only exception in the last decade being Kevin Love."
Evan Mobley  Larry Nance Jr.  Kevin Love  Dean Wade  Mfiondu Kabengele
"Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Draymond Green, Danilo Gallinari."
"Doug McDermott, Zach Collins, Domantas Sabonis, Drew Eubanks, Kevin Love.  They’re hard working, lunch pail type of guys, with a high basketball IQ."
Kevin Love
Love who? Kevin? Lmao wtf this team is half mediocre players but will still wipe the floor with just about any rotation
"Cavs always want way more than they are willing to give in trades. This is the same group not willing to trade a declining Kevin Love unless they get stars and picks back. No thanks. To get the 3rd pick we would need to give them Kemba, Dort, Shai and 5 draft picks. Fuck the cavs organization"
Kevin Love: 2011 12 14 17 18 for 5x all star appearance.  He was a hard carry for the Timberwolves.  Lebron kicked out a newly drafted Wiggins and screwed over Kyrie to get his super team.
"That Cleveland is not a super team in the same sense as what GSW was (already championship contenders) or what the nets are now.   Kevin Love was good, but he was in no way a carry."
"You’re not always who you appear to be. I know Kevin Love realt with anxiety for a long time, without speaking up about it. I think the problem is that Ben is not speaking up about it. If he put it into words i think people would be more understanding and forgiving."
"Kevin Love, Kevin Johnson, and Kevin Willis"
"For real LMFAO, we got Prime JR, Shumpert, traded for Kevin Love, extended TT, traded ALL and I mean ALL our assets, and hamstrung our cap to get Kyrie and Lebron help, and WON A FUCKING CHIP.  Like I get if you’re hating if the Cavs never won a ring and retroactively claiming Kyrie had no help, but even that would be an indication you’re stupid."
almost as bad as the LeBron gave Kevin Love depression take. This sub acts like we have some moral high ground lmao. We’re just as bad as SAS and Skip.
"3rd pick and kevin love for kemba walker, bazley and pick #6?"
"I'm good with that since the Olympics is another place where trades are discussed. If we can get Kevin Love looking better and actually move him, that helps the Cavs more than being upset and buying out his contract.  Love also helped us win a championship. 5 years ago, we had a 52 year drought for the whole city and Drummond quite frankly has done jack shit."
I guess you've never seen him put CJ miles on Kevin Love in the play offs.
"What do you call a team with LeBron, kyrie and Kevin Love?"
"You are legitimately the only person in 2021 I've heard say SexLand is ""trash"" but Kevin Love is good"
Sure one of the best PFs in the league at the time and a budding superstar PG don’t count. Just because Kevin Love got relegated to a role much lesser than he was capable of doesn’t mean he was suddenly a worse player. It’s called the Chris Bosh syndrome.  And then we just got unlucky that none of those stars wanted to team up with him in free agency when he came here.
There was some small uproar toward the end of the season when Kevin Love decided to finally have a good game and the Cavs beat the Celtics which ended up moving us down to the 5th best odds instead of 4th or even 3rd if we won the OKC coinflip. So essentially that win was the difference between our odds being 3rd best vs 5th best but it worked out.
"Sexton and Kevin love for Ben Simmons, book it"
"Wiggins had superstar level talent and hype, one of the most hyped prospects, he was traded for Kevin Love    People overvalue picks so much, proven players are always more valuable   SGA has proven he's all star level plus with the picks and Dort it's a great haul"
Ben Simmons giving Kevin Love depression
Wait what did Kevin Love do?
Minnesota have only ever got 2 no 1 picks in their entire history so yeah we aren't talking recently.  Wiggins was traded for Kevin Love. And Edward's has been around for 1 season...

"That's an insanely unrealistic trade, but I could see something like Kemba + 6 +16 for Kevin Love +3."
Why? We traded Kevin Love for him so that doesn't really have to do with our luck
Do you want Kevin Love?
"My point is that if Kevin Love  got invited, Lowry would have had a legitimate shot"
Kevin love was accepted
Kevin Love being on this team is a complete joke
Kevin love to Milwaukee!
"I think it's way more complicated than this. We're definitely in a player's market right now; if a player asks for a trade they're almost certainly going to get it. Look at how hard the Rockets got fucked.   You don't have to sit out 4-5 years to be worth trading. Look at Blake Griffin. You can play and just kinda half ass it, which I'm sure lots of players are willing to do (Kevin Love) if their team isn't attempting to be competitive but also won't accommodate their trade request. And for Zion, who every single team in the league would build a trade package to acquire, the Pels would be way better off trading him than just forcing him to stick around."
"Does 32 year old Kevin Love give you a better chance of winning in the international game? Think the US would be better off with the Plumlee's route than an out-of-form Love that gives them zilch defensively and will probably get out-rebounded by bigs on some of the other squad.    Team USA should still be an honor you've earned, not a rehab opportunity for a player that was once part of the system. But hey I don't think it sends the worst message to stay loyal to guys who've committed before &amp; fulfilled their commitments."
Kevin Love and Olympian were not two words I expected to see in the same sentence this summer
Kevin love is borderline HOF and a gold medal might just seal the deal
It’s a shame how so many people forget how good Kevin love was before going the Cavs. He’s was averaging like 27 points and 13 rebounds for the whole season. But now time has passed and that team wasn’t stacked? Like come on.
"Kevin Love: ""All around me are familiar faces..."""
"DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Love, Joe Johnson.  As for a less realistic choice, Tony Allen."
"Nah, its not ben. Ben could have played better, but it's not on ben. You should be able to beat the atlanta hawks when your second best player who's not even known as a scorer is playing terrible.  This isn't the milwaukee bucks or Brooklyn Nets. Philly is not playing Kawhi's raptors. They're playing the atlanta hawks. Even if ben sat out the whole series, they would have been favored to beat them in 4 or 5 games.  They almost did that. Those blown leads and the lineups in game 7 cost them that opportunity.  Me putting the blame on ben for the collapse is like me putting the blame on seth curry because he can't guard huerter. It's a half ass analogy, but what I'm saying is that They had opportunities to win the game and I don't feel the coach maximize those opportunities even with the poor play from simmons. Lue sat kyrie and kevin love to win a playoff game. Doc can't do that to not blow two massive leads?"
The water boy Kevin Love.
"Should’ve been Timelord over Kevin  With that being said, the Warriors really don’t need Love at all"
Best they’ll do is Kevin Love
It's almost crazy to think that Kevin love was once a player worthy of huge poster ads
I got the Kevin Love one as well as Dwight
"I mean in   2012 : DPOY, Rebounding Champ, NCAA Champion  2016 : 2x Rebounding Champ, DPOY &amp; NBA Champ the previous year, Boogie   I agree the standards has been dropping but surely you can come with better than a dude who averaged a Triple Single and the corpse of Kevin Love ?"
TIL Kevin Love is an ass. This whole time I thought he was a cool cat. F him.
If they rejuvenate Kevin Love once more they should call him Methuselah
"3 number 1 picks in 4 years when Lebron left and 2 number 4 picks.   Those players were Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters,  Anthony Bennett, Tristan Thompson and Andrew Wiggins (traded for Kevin Love)."
"No way Kevin Love makes the 12 man roster, right?"
USA Olympics is trying a new thing with Kevin Love where they put one regular person in each olympic event to show how good everyone else is by contrast.
"""showed you trade possibilities that could definitely work""   the potential trades you showed may work in salary, but they don't work when you want to win a championship. I mean really, Kevin Love and Sexton for Ben? Does Sexton, Embiid, and Harris really present a threat to BKN or MIL? Also, I didn't say CJ was the only guy, I said he was the best option that isn't untouchable. How did you prove otherwise?"
"""So Team USA has got all times greats like Kevin Durant and James Harden, exciting young players like Devin Booker and Jayson Tatum, and...Kevin Love."""
Value for points/spacing: Seth curry at about 8 million a year.  Value for attention/recognition: Lebron at 38 million.  Value for not contributing and being a black hole contract(aka Eddie curry award): Kevin love at 30 million.
Pop about to take Kevin Love and Simmons and make them Gods.
"I have mad respect for Kevin Love and what he's done to highlight struggles with mental illness.  That said, there is no fucking reason why he should be on the Olympic team."
"Oh, if we fall out of the top 5 tonight Kevin Love will be public enemy number 1.  That victory cost us a coin flip with Orlando for 3rd to give us a ~70% chance of a top 5 pick."
Mike Love gave him a stapler for Christmas one year.  http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/did-beach-boy-mike-love-once-give-kevin-love-a-stapler-for-christmas---video-181131815.html
"""Being overpaid on this terrible version of the Cavs has made people think he’s useless.""     To be fair, Kevin Love himself has done a lot to add to the idea that he's useless."
"What Christian Laettner was to the Dream Team, Kevin Love is to the 2021 Tokyo Olympic team"
CP3 and....Kevin Love were just added  One more spot  Zion should be on there
&gt;I saw Kevin Love at the Islanders Lightning game on Saturday in front of us in line at security. We’re all whispering “is that Kevin Love?” and I guess he hears us and goes “whats up guys?” and gives us all fist bumps and takes selfies with Kelvin Benjamin. Class act. Hot girlfriend.
"Of course it’s still head and shoulders above the rest.  But that’s not my point, usually USAB in the Olympics is an exhibition of the best of the best basketball has to offer at every position.  I have an affinity for the Center position because it’s what I used to play.  2016- DeAndre Jordan , Boogie Cousins, Draymond   2012 -Tyson Chandler, Kevin Love, AD  2008 -Dwight Howard, Boozer, Bosh  2004 -Garnett, Mourning  1992- Ewing, Robinson, Malone, Barkley   Don’t you think the current big lineup is underwhelming in comparison to those ?"
I think Kevin love is a lot more effective in international rules
Real talk why is Kevin Love on this roster tho
"Pretty sick that Zach Lavine just had a 28 PPG 50/40/85 season and won’t make the team but washed curmudgeonly dipshit Kevin Love will. It is good, to me"
kevin love should not be rewarded for his shitty play this season
Uh I was talking about Kevin love  lol
"Middleton, KD, Bam Adebayo, Harden, DBook, Draymond Green, Beal, Dame, Jayson Tatum  And now Kevin Love"
"You forgot to mention that the reason Kevin Love became a shitty teammate was because Lebron singlehandedly gave him depression a few years ago and it completely ruined him. So ultimately, the blame is on Lebron."
Kevin “Light Cardio” Love
What does Lou Williams have to do with Chris Paul though? How are they connected? If Kevin love got suspended you wouldn’t say this
We need fat Kevin Love back. He needs to drop Bananna Republic as a sponsor and get picked up by Papa John's.
Imagine if you could combine Kevin Love and Ben Simmons into one player.
"Here’s hoping he can regain some trade value and we can ship off his massive contract. Love you forever Kevin, but it’s time to move on."
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-kevin-love-apologizes-for-lack-of-effort-on-inbounds-pass-i-never-want-that-to-be-who-i-am/
No one is going to convince me as a raptors fan that 2018 lebron during the eastern conference massacre wasn't the goat offensive performance. dude was fading from the block to a step away from the 3 point line and hitting them consistently. WTF are you supposed to do about that..  Now about Casey's defensive schemes having cj miles guard Kevin Love in the post for straight positions..
"Honourable mentions are kinda short, no Jimmy Butler? Serge Ibaka? Kevin Love?"
Shoutout to Larry Nance for stepping up to the plate and being the guy Kevin Love couldn't be.
"&gt;Multiple sources said Cleveland Cavaliers’ former All-Star Kevin Love was interested in another Olympics run, and Popovich was interested in bringing him aboard.   I couldn't think of a single thing Love does adequately well enough **NOW** that he deserves a roster spot over anyone else on Team USA."
"&gt; I thought Casey had a good handle on how Derozan and Lowry work together which could take time for Doc to develop (and there isn’t a ton of that left for the duo).. but then again Casey may suck I’m not sure lol   Casey isn't a bad coach. But hes definitely not a championship level one given his lack of adjustments. He had has his sets and plays. But, once the game gets rolling, it can get away from him. Ask any Raptors fan from that time about Kevin Love posting up on CJ Miles like 3 times in a row and you might give them PTSD. Lol.   &gt;A lack of Lebron is real but I’d say super teams are just as difficult to manage and 76ers wouldn’t really be a super team themselves. Like if the Nets are healthy that’s a bigger deal than having to go through Lebron.  It's a fair point. But I'd say that, assuming they are healthy and their games haven't dropped off, that a back court of Lowry and DeRozan is better than Simmons and Green. At least the former has an attack from all levels. Lowry is a 3 point threat. And DeRozan can shoot the middy and go to the basket. And they both can rack up the assists. The only area where you'd see a noticeable drop off is in defence given DeRozans lack of it (and arguably negative defence).  Would it be enough to handle a healthy Nets team? Probably not. But I doubt this Sixers team can as well. So something has got to give."
What LeBron is to Kevin Love.
"I should establish what I mean by everything else playing out the same: all teams are constructed identically to how they were in real life; all non-Warriors matchups happen exactly as they happened; in matchups that happen because the Warriors don't exist teams play at the same level they played the Warriors modified by how they matchup against their new opponent. Anyway, if I had to guess, they beat OKC. OKC doesn't present the same matchup problems for the Cavs that they did the Warriors; in fact Kevin Love probably wouldn't have a problem staying on the floor and contributing because he'd guard Ibaka or Adams, and neither scares the Cavs as a pick-and-roll player."
"lmao my weakness and insecurities?   you saying no million dollar athletes get depressed? how about kevin love  or no multi millionaire successful people? what about avicii?  fuck outta here with your 'MeNtAl iLlNeSs iS wEaK' takes, no one thinks you're cool for shitting on people lmao"
Lmao I just pictured the Teen Kevin Love in those State Farm commercials lol 80lbs.
"I seriously hate KD for context.  And KD has no rings without Steph.  But the flip side of looking at that is that Steph only has one ring w/o KD.  And that ring came when he beat Lebron while Kyrie and Kevin Love were hurt.  Plus, they’re drafted only two years apart and their greatest attribute is scoring.  All time KD ranks 26, but Steph is all the way back at 70.  That’s a big gap.  9-6 All NBA in favor of KD and 11-6 all star also in favor of KD.    The big thing Steph has is 2 MVP’s to 1, but KD was runner up to Lebron 3 times.  Steph’s never been runner up, so you could make the argument he peaked at the right time."
"In my opinion, below are the 3 trade targets that are most realistic:  1. HOU - Trading John Wall's massive contract with Simmons. HOU is already in rebuild mode, so if PHI sweeten the deal with some picks, HOU can take the chance to rebuild with Simmons while trying to address his shooting woes. 2. OKC - OKC might want be able to flip Kemba with Simmons and get some picks from PHI. OKC will then have another chance to flip Simmons once his stats improves for more picks or other players later on. 3. CAVS - Kevin Love is not happy in Cleveland and wants out plus CAVS is overloaded with big man. His salary is making it hard to match in a trade package, so it might be a chance for CAVS to offload Kevin Love for a younger Simmons."
Sure you're not describing Kevin Love?
"This is disrespectful to someone like Ben Simmons with actual mental illness of the yips. He needs to see a sports psychologist.  By all accounts, Kevin Love is an egotistical jerk that quit on the franchise paying him a max contract and is a dick to all of Cleveland’s young players."
I think I love this man...also kevin
"yes!!! i, the bumbling basement dweller, with such zany idiotic takes such as “kyrie actually requested a trade to other teams” (which is 100% true and had multiple sources)  as opposed to you, le calm and composed contrarian, with crafty arguments such as: “kyrie ALWAYS wanted the celtics bro, TRUST ME, i have anonymous sources”; “[i hope the nets stay injured](https://i.imgur.com/nzgxUaH.jpg)”; and a slew of insults as soon as you lose yet another argument and are proven wrong  keep crying at home and celebrating other teams getting injured. it’s only fitting since the celtics will continue being a max player rehab center. first it was IT, then Kyrie, then Horford, then Hayward, then Kemba.... looks like Horford really enjoyed his stay there, he’s back with you! who’s next? Kevin Love? John Wall? Porzingis? i’m sure Brad Stevens has some tricks up his sleeve!"
Ty Lue gave CP3 Corona is the new LeBron gave Kevin Love depression
"kevin love is so far washed. i get ben simmons’ value is at an all time low, but it is laughable how people on r/nba actually think he is near worthless."
"I'll bite because I love talking about this.  If we're counting the Butler Heat as contenders I'm going to be generous in counting teams.  Off the top of my head for contenders since Lebron went back to Cleveland-  East:  * Cavs: tanked for years with mediocre results; Lebron got homesick * Celtics: maybe the most lopsided trade ever; let Brooklyn do their tanking for them * 76ers: the process * Bucks: drafted Giannis, got Middleton as a trade throw-in * Nets: Sean Marks is incredible.  Rebuilt them from nothing, then got lucky that KD &amp; Kyrie wanted to live in NY * Raptors: built a really solid team, traded for a top 5 guy with major injury concerns who was adamant about leaving in a year * Heat: elite scouting dept. Tons of awful contracts but bailed out because FAs want to live in Miami  West:  * Lakers: tanked for years; Lebron &amp; AD wanted to live in LA * Clippers: tanked for years; traded for cp3 (thanks David Stern), then sold high on their stars and got lucky that Kawhi &amp; PG wanted to live in LA * Nuggets: incredible drafting. * Jazz: also incredible drafting.  This is probably the best your average non-tanking team can hope to be without a miracle trade falling in their lap * Rockets: turned Kevin Martin into Harden * Thunder: tanked for years * Warriors: tanked for years * Blazers: not fair to say they tanked, but back to back lottery picks turning into Dame &amp; CJ were a big part of their success the last decade * Mavericks: tanked for years til they got Luka * Suns: tanked for years; traded for CP3 * Spurs: tanked for Duncan, then spent 20 years as the best-run organization in sports  Almost all these teams were built off players taken in the lottery, and most of them tanked (you could argue some didn't tank, they just sucked, but it's the same result).  I think you're overestimating how easily a team can trade for a superstar.  They're not usually available, and star players have a lot of power in dictating where they go.  I think Toronto, Milwaukee, Utah &amp; Denver are the only recent contenders that didn't rely on tanking, making an all-time lopsided trade, or just happening to exist in the city a player wanted to live.  Toronto went all-in on one year of contention (it was the right decision) then banked on Giannis and went back to tanking this year (also the right decision), and the other 3 managed to get their best player(s) in the late lottery and after."
"Kevin Love has one of the worst contracts in the NBA and although now maligned, Simmons was an all-star and one of the best defensive players in basketball. I think your valuations are off."
"You realize he is still human right?  I will never understand this hateful, stupid mentality...   Just because you think he's better than you, doesn't mean he doesn't feel disappointment, shame, the public hate, and so on. I mean, Delonte West / Kevin Love / Demar Derozan / Lamar Odom all made tons of money and slept with tons of people, still pretty open about their issues with their mental health   Do better dude."
"Obviously, Simmons isn't coming back. Joel Embiid is painfully aware of just how fleeting his time as an MVP-caliber player is going to be. Otherwise, he wouldn't have played on the injury that ended Westbrook's season in *Boom Town*. But Embiid also seems to understand that he can't win a title with Simmons - he can't keep waiting for Ben to turn into a worthy costar, because that day is never going to come.  Zach Lowe is right: Philly's best chance at a title was 2019 - when Simmons was their *fifth* most-important offensive player. When Simmons is as important as he is to a team like this, where he and Embiid are surrounded by relatively marginal players, his performance becomes *the* X-factor. Even though Harris *sucked* in this game, and Thybulle cracked up on a dagger three, and Curry finally lost his brother's anointing, the entire season hinged on Simmons making a play that he's made hundreds, if not thousands, of times in his life. Embiid knew that immediately. You can see the exact moment his eyes - *our* eyes - opened, and the entire city realized that they could have been finalists three years ago if not for the 235-pound ghost haunting the point position.  Trading Simmons for an All-Star, or even a borderline All-Star, seems like a joke at this point. In the best-case scenario, the Sixers deal him for a package of solid contributors who can hit shots around Embiid. Really, though, just getting off that contract would be a win. If Philly deals Simmons and a first-round pick for, like, Kevin Love and Colin Sexton, they'll immediately be better off than they are right now. (Don't underestimate Kevin Love on a good team.) If they trade Ben to a team with cap space, and get back a pick, or a minimum-contract scrub, or a pair of 7th-man role players, that's still an improvement, because the contracts and the expectations will be short and modest, and we can make one last magical Embiid run in '23.  Being a GM is hard, and I am no such thing. But one thing is sure: Embiid, and Doc Rivers, and everyone else has seen the truth and smelled the coffee. They don't want Simmons any more, and Simmons knows they don't want him anymore. For that reason alone, Philly has *got* to get off this contract sooner rather than later.  EDIT: If you haven't read Sam Anderson's *Boom Town*, you need to go to your local library next chance you get and fix that."
"Yeah the only examples I can think of were because of injury, like Isaiah Thomas or Kevin Love, they both got injured shortly after making All-NBA teams."
"taking a max contract extension is not a gamble, the sixers are the ones who gambled and lost.   no one is saying they shouldn't trade simmons but the level of vitriol hurled at this guy cause he played bad in a basketball game is disgusting. sports is the only industry where people are treated like this by the general public and then the same people who say these disgusting things turn around and support Kevin Love talking about mental health struggles."
"That’s a complete overreaction. Simmons and Embiid had one of the highest net ratings of any duo in the league this year. We took 3 of 4 games against Boston last year in the regular season and were swept without Ben. He had a bad series offensively amidst a fucked up family situation but acting like he’s in the Kevin Love tier of attaching picks just to get rid of him? That’s absurd. The Sixers aren’t just going to trade him to unload his contact, that does absolutely nothing to help them."
Can I interest you in a slightly used Collin Sexton and a completely beat to shit Kevin Love
Maybe that’s finally the Kevin Love trade—could actually be a nice piece next to Embiid
"I always point to that when people say that the Cavs won because Dray missed a game.  Lebron scored 40 when Dray was out. Then scored 40 when Dray came back. Then dray had a career game in g7 and it didn't matter because Bron had a 27 point triple double and Kyrie hit one of the greatest shots ever. Meanwhile Kevin Love got a concussion early in that series, and both Love and Kyrie missed almost all of 2015"
"His playing style suits today's NBA a lot but during the past year, he has been on trade rumor more often than Kevin Love"
"Rose was never an all-star, he never won an NBA title and he was never on the Olympic team.  https://www.newsweek.com/jalen-rose-calls-kevin-love-white-token-us-olympic-basketball-team-1604537"
"Wait, how unpopular do you mean?  More affirmative action placement for Caucasian players! The Kevin Love make-a-wish program."
"The unfortunate thing about this for Rose is that his overall point - Love is ""token"" addition to the team - is accurate. Team USA has traditionally favored past roster members and often takes token bigs instead of the best players. Literally no one thinks Kevin Love is an Olympic-level player based on his current play, right?"
"&gt; Yes he fucking is lol, how old are you? &gt;  &gt; He still gets a ton of rebounds, he still shoots nearly the exact same shooting splits as his career season highs. The only difference now is he shoots less and its largely because the Cavs suck dick and he clearly stops playing seriously most games.  If you believe Kevin Love is still an All Star caliber player I don't think we're gonna be able to agree lol"
Can you read? I never said anything about Kevin Love being good or not. Stop turning what I’m saying into what you want me to be saying.
I'd rather have Brook Lopez than Kevin Love at this point.
"yeah he can shoot, pass, rebound (offensive, defensive,and boxout), guard 1-5, play in the half court, handle the ball.  hes like a utility player in baseball.  its important to have versitility in these types of tournaments.  last Olympics it was lowrey.  not the most gifted player out there but he understands the game on a deep level and players like this can identify where the team is weak do the dirty work to make others shine.  sort of like duct tape, find the cracks and hold shit together.    I did mention in my post that love had a shit season and that is a valid concern and his age is a concern as well but to say love does not have significant talent at fundamentals of basketball is wrong.   &gt;Lolol TF are you even talking about?! B-ball IQ? Based on WHAT? What EXACTLY about Kevin love indicates he has a high b-ball iq??Lemme guess he’s scrappy and outsmarts guys instead of physical ability too huh   i could take the time to breakdown why i think hes got a high bb iq but ill just copy and paste his resume from wikipedia.      NBA champion (2016)     5× NBA All-Star (2011, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2018)     2× All-NBA Second Team (2012, 2014)     NBA Most Improved Player (2011)     NBA All-Rookie Second Team (2009)     NBA Three-Point Contest champion (2012)     NBA rebounding leader (2011)     Consensus first-team All-American (2008)     Pac-10 Player of the Year (2008)     First-team All-Pac-10 (2008)     UCLA Hall of Fame (2020)     Naismith Prep Player of the Year (2007)     2× First-team Parade All-American (2006, 2007)  Also his dad was an NBA player and his mom played hoops as well.  Like it or not K love has been eating, drinking and breathing basketball since he was in diapers.    &gt;would rather call Jalen rose a”dufus ” than to get dirty and discuss race  As I mentioned in another post in this thread racism is a huge problem in America no doubt. And I understand the Rose has a platform because he is a basketball player so using your platform which happens to be baskteball related to call out racism is understandable.  But to call out USABB (i dont know much about colangelos background but i strongly assume hes not racist and I know for sure pop aint racist) and/or klove is not the right place to be complaining about racism.  It takes away from the real racist shit going on IMO.  I live in american and experienced racism and seen a shitload of racism and I hate it with every fiber of my being and I do whatever i can to call it out and fight it.  Honestly I think KLOve being on the has nothing to do with race but maybe I am naieve.  I guess well watch the games and if klove shits the bed and does not contribute then I will eat some crow.    That being said its nice to see 3 of the 4 coaches in the NBA finals currently as minorities.  nice to see mcmillian, lue and williams earning big respect for doing a great job."
Kevin Love can’t guard a wet paper bag fool
"I understand. But you’re not “grabbing” Kevin Love, international ball or not, and going “yup that’s a guy who can switch and defend the PNR”. There’s no doubt he will be more effective against worse players, but defense isn’t the factor, like OP was mentioning.  Obviously he’s not gonna get crazy PT. My point isn’t that KLove shouldn’t play, he’s one of my all time favourite players. But, the defense part is what I was pointing out."
Ahh yeah let’s compare Larry Bird to Kevin Love
"I love the first part of your take, and then don't really agree with the 2nd part.  I would love to think KG is top 10 all time, he is my favorite player across any sport ever. Watching him play with the Timberwolves back in the day was the peak of my sports enthusiasm. Such a fun player to watch with an intensity that I have never seen matched.  KG himself in his recent book (as long as I am recalling correctly) is actually very grateful and credits the Timberwolves and Kevin McHale (and Flip Saunders) for drafting him and helping him develop. I really don't think you would have seen the same player emerge and as early (2nd/3rd season being pretty amazing already) if he went to another team in a different situation. The Timberwolves gave him everything, including a contract that broke the NBA and caused a lock out.  I agree the organization is inept though, no one can say otherwise. They made a great draft decision taking Garnett, helped develop him and made him a star, but never really did anything else in their history. Even though he is my favorite player I was glad for him when he went to Boston and got his championship after ""suffering"" in MN for as long as he did since he wasn't winning one on the Wolves (cries).  So as a selfish MN fan, I cherish the time KG was on the team, those years were priceless for a state where mediocrity is so prevalent in our sports ... but I can 100% agree that maybe he should have left a bit earlier, gotten some more championships in his prime, and truly cemented himself as an all time great (top 10) player.  Even still, he was really one of a kind, even if you want to debate his stats or number or champions, or what team(s) he played on. He does have some insane records though (from his wiki):  \- Only NBA player to reach at least 25,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 5,000 assists, 1,500 steals, and 1,500 blocks   \- Only NBA player to average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists per game for 6 consecutive seasons   \- Only NBA player to average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists per game for 9 consecutive seasons   \- All time leader in Defensive Rebounds"
Jalen is right tho! Kevin love is trash
Kevin love the superstar
"This is the thing that gets me. I could sorta understand if the coach was some dude without a 30+ year track record of meritocracy, inclusion, and progressive philosophy. But this is freaking Gregg Poppovich. The man who was out front and vocal with his thoughts on Donald Trump and his band of Qanon/racist idiots. The guy who has been progressive with his leadership decisions (see: Becky Hammon).  He permits Kevin Love, admittedly a hard-to-understand roster decision, to go to Tokyo and suddenly we have tokenism and racist undertones in play with USA Basketball?  GTFOH"
"Yea so this post is insane. Dead giveaway that Jalen Rose is spot on.  Bc there is no way on God’s green earth 75 other people agree that Kevin love actually IS worthy of a spot based on merit. 5 tool player? Guard the perimeter? Lolol TF are you even talking about?!  B-ball IQ? Based on WHAT? What EXACTLY about Kevin love indicates he has a high b-ball iq??Lemme guess he’s scrappy and outsmarts guys instead of physical ability too huh   See this is why we know there’s smoke here. I’ve seen reasonable takes from presumably white posters that say love is a bad selection but it’s likely veteran preference. Ok cool. I could maybe see that. But to see a bullshit post like this upvoted shows that at least SOME white people are consciously or subconsciously on some bullshit, and would rather call Jalen rose a”dufus ” than to get dirty and discuss race"
"I can deal with people like Kevin Neghandi and Elle Duncan on Sportscenter, and their Euro coverage has actually been okay, and I love College GameDay in the fall, but other than that, you’re right, it’s hard to watch. I don’t want shitty hot take after shitty hot take and an obsessive focus about like 7 athletes."
"Espn is the new mtv,many have stopped watching  it because the channel  dropped the real reason people originally   watched it. Maybe that reason wasn't profitable so I get it.  On Jalen Rose, Kevin Love  is a guy who I said retired years ago but didnt tell anyone.   I don't know if he made the team because he is white but I do know other guys like Brook Lopez , John Collins even a Robert Covington deserved the slot more and bring more to the table. Because with that roster what he brings is redundant, he only brings they say experience. Outside shooting debatable.  And for Jalen, Ayton played on the Bahamas team so I don't know if he can play for team USA.  If you can't prove what you say might as well keep it to yourself."
"""As it relates to the Kevin Love statement that came from my mouth a couple of hours ago... I did not say that &amp; my memory has now been changed."""
"Regardless of all of this, isn’t Julius Randle way better than Kevin Love at this point lol?"
"Kevin Love is a stretch 4, he plays better outside the paint, shoots 3s and can occasionally post up down low."
At least Kevin Love didnt have 81 points dropped on his fuckin dome
"1. There should be a balance achieved between the ultra physical style of defense played in the 80s and the lack of defense today. Something isn't right about all these little guys putting up huge numbers with no resistance - it makes the game a little boring.   2. I think if any shooter leans into a guy to draw a foul - that should be an offensive foul. Harden and his ilk slow down the game so much with this bs, it becomes unwatchable.   3. First round should go back to best of 5  4. No team should be allowed to get a number 1 overall pick more than once in a 5 season period.   5. There should be a hard cap.   6. I think Becky Hammond's best shot at a HC job is San Antonio - i doubt it happens anywhere else, especially after Portland passed on her.   7. If I were the Clippers, i'd trade Kawhi for Dame in a heartbeat. I were the Lakers, i'd trade AD for Dame in a heartbeat.   8. I don't get the love for Mike Breen. He seems like a regular play by play guy. His voice isn't memorable like Kevin Harlan's or Marv's. His catchphrase ""bang"" isn't great...............idk , i don't get it.   9. I hope the NBA spreads around their tv package like the NFL does. Get NBC, FOX, and CBS involved. Keep TNT. Get rid of ESPN.   10. Move the Thunder back to Seattle. Move the Grizzlies back to Vancouver. Move the Kings to Vegas. The league leaving two big markets was dumb, and having Sacramento never made sense. Clippers should change their name and move to San Diego. I know none of these will happen because of stadium deals, etc.   11. NBA shouldn't take players from college until they've spent 3 years minimum in college. Too many bad teams end up with young guys who don't blossom until its too late and by then, they want out of the bad team.   12. I miss players only, i know r/nba and twitter hates C-Webb, but i love listening to him. He clearly has enthusiasm and has a great voice."
"To be fair, when I saw the team announced I thought “What, is Kevin Love still playing?”"
Yeah I think he forgot that K-Love has accomplished way more in the league than he ever did. So to equate this to just being about Kevin race is wild.
"Regardless to what Jalen Rose said, why does Kevin Love belong on the usa olympics team? He hasn’t done anything great in 6-7 years."
"""I could have just said that Kevin Love is old, immobile, or any number of other legitimate basketball criticisms but instead I decided to racebait because that's just so in right now."""
"Messed up thing to say especially with Kevin Loves mental health history.  After a panic attack during an NBA game in 2017, Love decided to share his battle with anxiety and depression in an essay he wrote for The Players' Tribune. Love quickly evolved into a public spokesperson for mental health awareness among athletes. “I was nervous about how I was going to be received."
But he's just going to ignore that Draymond Green made the team. Guess who scored and rebounded more this year..? Kevin Love.
What achievements has Kevin Love had in the last three years that are being undermined? He’s either quit on his team or gotten injured three years in a row and this years was flat out bad.
Kevin Love belongs no where near this Team USA and tokenism is as good an explanation as anything else.
Steph is lights out till it gets tough and the pressure mounts. How many screens does it take to get a shot off on Kevin Love?
Kevin love making it over players like Julius Randle is blasphemy.
"Yah and it's not like ""lmao Kevin love eats chicken with ketchup"" it's ""Kevin love doesn't deserve to play on team USA cause his skin is white"""
"Let's say hypothetically that Rose was right, that Kevin Love made the team solely because he's white and they didn't want to have an all-black team. That would be a clear example of white supremacy, of the white USA Basketball staff boosting a white player onto the team for their own comfort and/or the comfort of white fans. Rose's statement was a response to that perception and an attack on white hegemony.  Now whether Rose's statement was a misguided attack or not is open for debate. Personally, I think that the idea that Love has previous Team USA experience and has some skills that the team might need despite his less than stellar play as of late to be a reasonable argument for his inclusion. There's also the fact that the 2016 team didn't have any white players as many have pointed out. Rose has a responsibility given his position to do his due diligence and research those things before making such an inflammatory claim and denigrating Kevin Love as a player.  But at the same time, I understand why he felt that way upon initially hearing of the decision. We all know that Kevin Love hasn't been at his peak as a player for quite a while and certainly isn't as good right now as some of the black players like Randle who he beat out to make the team. When you see a white staff and white coaches (with the exception of Lloyd Pierce) choosing a white player over a clearly superior black player, it's natural to question whether race is a factor. It was the wrong thing to say given all of the facts, but it wasn't as unhinged as Rush Limbaugh's statement on Donovan McNabb just to use one example."
"jalen could've just said kevin love has been shit and left it at that.  but he had to take it that extra level and play the race card.  his argument was sound until he brought race into it.  kevin love should not be there, because he sucks not because of what he looks like."
Kevin Love has agreed to a $5.1 billion contract with the Golden State Warriors
"Kevin Love for Thompson, who says no?"
Fat Kevin Love used to eat basketballs as soon as the Wolves got the lead. If it wasn't for the refs always having backups the Wolves probably go 51-31 his 3rd season in the league.
"It's up to the accused to prove the tokenism. You, me, or Jalen can not definitively prove that it was a primary factory in Kevin Love getting the nod. So yes, he is wrong."
"Regardless, why IS Kevin Love even on this team???"
"Brother are we talking about Kevin Love? He can’t defend the paint or perimeter….. like at all.  He’s a great shooter with good touch, had experience, and has a high IQ. Defense is something he’s never had lol. (Maybe some post defense sometimes)"
"White boy can't jump jokes are as old as basketball and all in good fun.  This on the other hand just sounds needlessly racial and frankly just rude.  It's not even about the league it's the freaking Olympics, like have some class guy.  Can you imagine if Kevin Love said something similar to this?"
I'm still not sure why Kevin Love is on the team
I think it’s more he was accusing Team USA of being racist by only picking Kevin Love because he’s white and not by the best basketball player to add to the team. Although he might be prejudiced (or biased) against Kevin Love because of his skin.   I do think that this sort of accusation should be taken very seriously by ESPN / journalism outlets because these comments can be very damaging and unacceptable by major media.
I misread this as Kevin Love and then I only read the Golden State Warriors. I got scared
"Well, Jalen's main point was the Kevin Love isn't good enough to be on the Olympic team.... which I agree with. He quit on Cleveland this year, and is clearly not as good as Randle at this point in time.  That point isn't discriminatory.... but then he gets into murky water when talking about his choice being tokenism.... but really, is it that crazy to suggest it as a reason? None of the provided for explanations make sense either."
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R. Smith|40.0|35.6| |Tristan Thompson|63.6|0| |Richard Jefferson|51.6|16.7| |Kevin Love|30.4|26.7| |Iman Shumpert|26.3|16.7|  OKC  |Player||| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|42.3|28.6| |Russell Westbrook|39.5|31.7| |Serge Ibaka|47.2|34.4| |Dion Waiters|35.8|31.8| |Andre Roberson|52.0|44.4| |Steven Adams|53.3|0| |Enes Kanter|48.6|0|"
So you think a guy not even from America deserves to be on the Olympic team more than Kevin Love?  Stretching real hard to make sure a white dude isn't on the team. You racist bruh?
"That gosh darn Kevin Love oppressing all of us minorities smh.   Anyone can be racist. If you’re talking about systemic racism then sure, that’s not something white people in the US face anymore. But anyone can be racist."
"Honestly the only real reason I saw for having Kevin Love in the team was to be a ""center"" with a 3-point threat, but Julius Randle played a few minutes at the 5, with better defense, with great 3PT% as a first option while also not being a whiner the entire season."
"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters. You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure. But compare it to the Cavs squad in the playoffs.   |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|52.5|34.0| |Kyrie Irving|47,5|44.0| |J.R. Smith|43.6|43.0| |Kevin Love|38.5|41.4| |Tristan Thompson|52.7|0| |Richard Jefferson|52.4|39.3| |Iman Shumpert|41.7|38.2| |Channing Frye|59.4|56.5|"
Without agreeing with Jalen i was also confused why Kevin Love was selected to the team. Is the lone reason Olympic experience?
"Didn't even apologize to Kevin Love lmao just to himself really. God damn ESPN has the worst analysts for basketball, it's so sad"
"For a league that constantly talks about equality, they really have no fucking idea what it is. Imagine if an NHL analyst said that about a black player making the Olympic team? His career would be over. He would be fired immediately. Jalen Rose didn't even apologize to Kevin love or for what he said... he apologized to basketball? Wtf does that mean?! At least he honest and say Kevin love didn't deserve to make the Olympic team because he sucks...geez"
"I think that there are tiers of players. Obviously I have a personal list but I think it’s easier to argue for tiers that most people can at least generally agree with.   So for tiers in no particular order:  -	**1-5**: Kareem, LeBron, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Shaq OR Hakeem (depends on if you value dominance or skill set) -	**6-10**: Shaq or Hakeem, Wilt, Magic, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan -	**10-15**: Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett, Oscar Robertson, Kobe, Julius Irving  And just because I said that I wouldn’t put Iverson top 30 even though he’s one of my favorite players, I’ll even go up to 30.  -	**15-25**: David Robinson, Jerry West, Dirk, Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Dwayne Wade, Scottie Pippen -	**25-30**: John Stockton, Rick Berry, Moses Malone, Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller  I’m sure people are still going to lose their minds over this list but this is what I’ve got based on my personal opinions of being a long time basketball fan as well as talking to other people that played/coached/really love the history."
"Jalen Rose got it all wrong. He's thinking this is Kevin Love on the team, it's actually K'von Love.   In all seriousness, Kevin Love is an former gold medalist, dude has kinda been on the verge of being a league afterthought. I thought this was something to just get him back playing meaningful basketball and bring in some good international experience."
"He’s talking about Kevin Love being the token. Which he is, it’s just a Mental Health Awareness token."
"OP wanted a time period of when racial double standards would end. I was simply pointing out how long black people have been systemically disenfranchised in this country. If there will ever be a time where “the double standard ends”, it is no time near the present. Considering my grandparents could not vote without facing imminent physical danger, I don’t think Jalen Rose’s feelings on Kevin Love even compares"
Kevin Love has a bad reputation with the young cavs team. His experience didn't matter there.
there is no way Kevin Love is more deserving then Randel for an Olympic spot. It's more favoritetism over racism. Love barely even played and he quit on his team. Randel missed only one game this season.
I will die on the hill that being (almost) immediately traded for Kevin Love killed his confidence and changed the trajectory of his career.
"Or maybe Jalen is so overcome by his own perception on race that he dragged it into a situation where it makes no sense to talk about. He cant take into account his own biased views and projects them  onto Kevin Love. Why? Because Kevin Love is a different ethnicity. If he thought he didn't deserve a spot, just say that. His remarks were discriminatory and ignorant."
"Better than Kevin, yes he can. He’s a better defender and just a bigger body to put in the paint. Kevin love used to be a good rebounder, now he’s just ok and that’s about it."
"Lebron and Kyrie did a lot of work in that postseason, but it's not like Kevin love was in top form. And the rest of that squad wasn't exactly impressive."
"kevin love:  “Ty Lue is great. With Ty Lue, it was like, 'Okay, we were an underachieving regular season team.' But when it came time for the playoffs, he was like, 'I got this.' Everything he set up for us, he just had a brilliant mind for his schemes, and his Xs and Os, his ATOs, everything that he did. It just made more sense moving forward when it came to playoff time.”"
"Yeah, LeBron stands out pretty heavily in this one.   But definitely can't discount the likes of Giannis, Westbrook, John Wall.   There was always those lighting quick guards who could get out and run as well, Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash and even Leandro Barbosa used to cause their fair share of damage.   There's always the dagger three type of guys as well, who could dribbling out in space, pull up from deep and kill you that way like Curry, Lillard or even Reggie Miller would occasionally hit that fast break triple.   Probably not really the question but the elite passing bigmen who can hit those amazing outlet passes would also be an interesting answer to this question, Kevin Love and Nikola Jokic specifically."
Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving were scrubs? Good lord
Deadass Kevin Love
I mean Kevin Love breaking his hand with knuckle push ups probably deserves an honorable mention
Kevin Love barely plays for his own NBA team lol.  Now he gets to represent Team USA and get another Gold Medal.
Only came back to Cleveland after they got Kyrie and could get Kevin Love who was all NBA with the Minnesota at the time. And the Warriors had won a chip by the time KD was there
Euro centers would eat him alive on D even if I do agree that Kevin Love is not any better.
"Uhh no. Healthy Pacers raps and Celtics were all much more threatening teams considering how much better the suns roster is compared to what Lebron was playing with. Suns talent wise are better than every team they’ve faced due to injury, those cavs teams were not nearly as talented  Also the “second best player” Kevin love was hurt and missed the most important game 7s"
"They have poor man's Kevin Love, and he apparently doesn't get along with Luka. The scrip clubs in Portland are weird af though. I don't know if TingPing gets down with tatted up Suicide Girls chicks with hairy pits, but if he does, Portland could be a perfect fit."
Would y’all consider Kevin love (when he was health and played) a empty stats guy?
You sure? Kevin Love is an Olympian tho
"Whats julius going to do on a team with KD tho, hes not an elite defender and they’re not going to isos in the post. Kevin Love can stroke it and is a better defender than people think, I think this is a fine decision."
Kevin Love over Julius Randle??!! It’s a travesty. Julius balled out and plays with so much heart. Definitely deserves the spot a whole lot more than Kevin Love. That dude hasn’t played in ages me he should be out of the league.
Wait…Kevin Love still plays basketball?
Kevin Love is a stretch big with good shooting splits. He's had a tough time in Cleveland (as have so many others).   People's memories are just short and some people are putting too much focus on his attitude in Cleveland and not enough on his game.
Why'd you bring up Kevin Love
"Kevin Love gets to make a lot of money, hang out with his super-model wife, do photoshoots from time to time, play in the NBA when he feels like it, and compete in the Olympics when it comes time. What a life."
Kevin Love is.
Julius and Kevin Love are the same size...
I cannot tell if you’re trolling or not. This has “LeBron gave Kevin Love depression” energy fr  Man lost a child he doesn’t give a fuck about media looking at him like he’s only the second best player on one of the best teams of all time. Reddit armchair psychologists out here damn
There is no reason Kevin Love should be on this team imho.
"&gt; Kevin Love is still a superstar talent, NBA champion, and a lockdown defender"
I would take playoff Randle over Kevin love
"Jalen should've fact-checked that Team USA fielded an all black team in 2016 before spouting off, but his point about Love possibly making the team because of ""tokenism"" is not completely blasphemous.   I know we all hate how every topic is turned into a race-related issue when it's clearly not. But why exactly is Love on the team though?   He seems past his prime and not deserving to make the team on merit alone.  Even as a backup option, it just seems there should be so many players listed ahead of him, it doesn't seem likely he'd make the final roster.  All the best white players in the NBA are international players. We are pretty hungry for an American-born white star player. Without one, we will sometimes have to include a token white guy on the team in international competition.  Who's at the top of the list? Kevin Love it is!  Ok now you can proceed to downvote me to hell."
Except for the fact that we've had multiple all-black olympic basketball teams and *absolutely nobody gave a shit* then. So fuck off with this race-baiting horseshit.  Like Kevin Love sitting on the bench waving a towel will somehow satisfy David fucking Duke.
"Imagine thinking just because he was efficient means he'll play in a system that capitalizes his strengths. Hello? Have you seen the Warriors play? They rely on guard and wing play more than anything else. I remember when Kevin Love was still a monster on those Cavs teams because he was on a: ""better system, better coach, and a superstar offensive player to take attention away from him""   Keep clinging to the idea that Wood somehow becomes a ""rising star"" lmao."
"My 2 year old: I love mashed tapatoes.   Kevin Durant, furiously typing: they're called potatoes u dumbass bitch second of all everyone loves mashed potatoes u ain't special"
"Cavs fans (mostly) feel the same way about Love. Sadly every single Olympic thread has become an opportunity to dunk on Kevin Love for having another injury plagued and disappointing year.    I hope Randle bounces back, I hope Love bounces back. But damn this is ridiculous, not reading any more “Love in the Olympics” threads"
I mean Melo got booted from the league cause he was a bad fit for quite some time there. Kevin Love has not left Cleveland. You think if he was on a winning team he’d have those some issues. Doubt it.
Kevin love is not worth anything right now
Then what the fuck has Kevin Love been playing like lol?
Kevin Love is not very good anymore and he has huge off the court issues that he brings onto the court and allows to become a problem. How is this anything you want?
Kevin Wesley Love
"Kevin Love is still a superstar talent, NBA champion, and a lockdown defender (see his defense on Curry, enough said). An honor to have him on the Olympic team."
"I mean say what you want about Kevin Love, but the opposition have Batum as their starter. Team USA should be able to bring a team of Kevin Loves and still be better man for man than most sides"
"Kind of shows how weak the US are for true centers relative to other countries. NBA may play a more ""positionless"" basketball, but FIBA do not  Regardless, AD is sorely missing from this team. I'd even put Kevin Love in there"
It would be hard for Kevin Love to draw him out while Love is riding the pine.
"lol  Kevin Love only there cuz he white!  *usa loses to france*  damn, we needed a stretch 5  smh"
"Actually to match salaries for Buddy the Lakers could just do Kuzma, Gasol and the 22nd pick, just so long as they wait 30 days after the pick is signed before executing the trade (a la the Kevin Love for Wiggins trade). Or alternately they could swap the pick for Alfonzo McKinnie."
"Other than Brook Lopez and the checked out Kevin Love, what healthy and available American big man can shoot 3's?"
Did Jarret Allen die? Like yeah they didn’t have great options but when you choose Kevin Love then yeah it’s fair to assume Pop fucked up building this roster.
"Trae Wood Randle Zion and BI wanted to play but were denied  Team USA preferred Kevin Love, Keldon Johnson, and Javale McGee lmao"
"all are in the top 10 of worst contracts in the NBA along with John Wall,  Kevin Love, and Rudy Gobert"
"1. yes, that is one of the problems with the NBA vs olympic schedule they decided on. don't recall if the olympic schedule was confirmed when they decided on NBA season. going from finals to olympics in less than a week doesn't seem ideal.  2. the roster selection was not great. didn't help that a lot of players didn't want to play, or that Kevin Love did want to play, then didn't.  3. this is generally good for the sport, maybe another country winning will allow another league/more talent to develop. unfortunately this hasn't really happened with Argentina's next generation... everyone loves soccer too much."
Dream team is really better across the board I don't see how it's arguable.   Jordan &gt; Lebron  Stockton &gt; CP3  Bird/Magic &gt; Kobe/KD  Drexler and Pippen off the bench for excellent defense  Malone/Barkley/Ewing/Robinson would fucking **destroy** AD and Kevin Love lmfao especially with Olympics rules  It wouldn't even be close imo
They had to get McGee because pop chose Kevin love over randle and burned that bridge when it was clear love couldn’t play for shit.
The sweet Karma of denying Lord Julius Randle the right to play in Tokyo… kevin love smdh
"Cavs - Wiz 2017, We were on a historic home win streak and felt like we could go toe to toe. We probably honestly should've won this game. Wall hits 2 FTs to put us up 3.. then Kevin Love throws a full court pass to Lebron and you know the rest.  Cavs win in OT, could've fully cemented ourselves as legit contenders in the East with a win that day. Oh well. That game was a banger tho lol.  Rockets - Wiz 2019, 159-158 in regulation. Just an absurd game lmao"
"It can get you a Kevin Love.  Think about that, LeGM."
Have at least decent ones like Time Lord or John Collins rather than Javale McGee and Kevin Love. Lol
Valid point but Kevin Love wouldn't be the answer. Not this version of him at least.
yeah what team usa needed out there was fat emotional kevin love to hoist up and clank shots
If only they had a Kevin Love type— someone who they could feed in the post for an automatic 2.
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristian Thompson is about as good as Steph, Klay , and Dray"
I mean Kevin Love was bad in the exhibition games.  I know that because I watched.  Apparently you stopped watching in 2015 which was the last time Love made a positive impact on the court.
"Julius randle was snubbed for Kevin love. When love was out, he snubbed miles turner for Javale fucken McGee. How do you explain that?  Did pop not make those decisions?"
"“individual talent” gets defeated by “systematic talent”  laimbeer is a big body who knew how to rough up people, but he knew how to use his size as well. you can have all the talent in the world, but if a big body rough player has a high ball IQ and times his body right in your way, you’re going to have a hard time against that type of pressure, pair that up with an equally rough help defence (team ball). on the offence, go check some clips of isiah and bill laimbeer running pick and pop / pick and roll plays.  finally... you rather have javale mcgee/kevin love as your center? ... bill laimbeer on today’s starting lineup in the olympics would’ve done way better with the type of guards on the team + he would’ve backed rudy gobert down"
This isn’t that Kevin Love.  He is slow and immobile.  He can barely get up for rebounds and he sucked as a rim protector in his prime and now that he’s washed he’s ten times worse.  Have you stopped watching basketball in 2015.  Gtfo.
"Like I said, it depends. Duncan did it without allstar teammates as the best player, with allstar teammates as the best player and he did it as a key ""role player"" when he got older. Different situations, many years apart, one team.  Lebron for example would have won less rings if he never left his teams. He always came to a better situation and improved his chances of winning every time he joined a new team. No way he has 4 rings if he never leaves the Cavs, or stayed with Miami and had to deal with Bosh and Wades health issues, or not leaving the Cavs the second time to keep playing with Kevin Love as his best player.  Duncan has won in more different situations than Lebron, and he did it on one team vs Lebron on many teams."
Warriors gonna trade for Kevin Love confirmed.
"Seriously why aren't they considering guys like LaMelo (Carmelo is probably sick of it at this point so understandable) Julius Randle, Trae. What the hell is this roster? They literally had Kevin love in there originally."
"Kevin Love barely played this season, and they really picked him damn."
don't forget they started with the corpse of kevin love 💀
And Kevin love isn’t?
Did I say that? I said someone better than Kevin Love that can shoot from outside  Now you go ahead and name a better US center that can shoot from outside than Wood
Kevin Love under no circumstance should be on this team. It’s embarrassing.
Without NBA champion Kevin Love to stretch out Gobert to the perimeter? That'd be a tough baguette for the ol' US of A!
"seems a bit silly, Grant seems like an even better version of Kevin Love."
Their is nothing Kevin Love can do at Center that Kevin Durant can't do at Center.
"You’re not wrong. I love Kevin forever because of his contributions to our 2016 championship, but it’s been a fall off even from those years, let alone his playing form in Minnesota. Injuries suck."
I mean Kevin Love was on the short list.   I mean no disrespect to Kevin Love because he’s had incredible moments and he’s a great person and wonderful advocate for mental health but Kevin Love was on the short list.
"They were supposed to be, and would have been if Kevin Love lived up to his billing."
shoulda kept Kevin Love
USA would kill to have Kevin Love now
"How many does this team even have? KD, Dreymond... Is that it? Lillard, maybe? Obviously, it's early in Booker, Middleton and Tatums careers, but that's not a lot.  Then again, in 2012, you had LeBron, Kobe, a very young KD, Westbrook and Harden, Fat Kevin Love and pre Lob City CP3. I'm not convinced that 2012 had more HoFers than this does"
"""Kevin Love is out, so we're gonna need another big...""  ""Bring in JaVale.""  ""... McGee? The dude with the hairless cat?""  ""Yes"""
Has Kevin Love played yet? Did he get injured taking a shower
Yea. He wasn't in the team initially so is definitely missing familiarity with the team. He was a last minute replacement for Kevin Love.
"LeBron gave Kevin Love depression, Giannis made Devin Booker get a haircut. Just goat things"
They went with Kevin Love instead due to his experience (not saying they were right)
"The problem with Love is he was injured the moment he got to Cleveland. Seriously, he later admitted that he began having back problems in December of his first season. He would end up riding the exercise bike every game by the second quarter, that is not normal or healthy.   I've never seen a player get rejected by the rim as many times as Kevin Love. He actually had athleticism at UCLA and Minnesota until the back problems. Then all a team had to do was go small ball and run him off the court with a 4. The 4 had a much easier goal to stay in from of Love's threes and ""slashing"" better than vice versa."
Because Team USA is only for the elite players in this league like Kevin Love and JaVale McGee.
Scoring has gone up like crazy now tho. Kevin Love was like top 5 in scoring averaging 25ppg
"But that doesn't fit my LeBron had so much help narrative. So, I will simply ignore this post that displays how bad Kevin Love was."
I cringe a little everytime I see people say that Kevin Love should be in the hall of fame and cite his championship and gold medal as valid credentials.
That's coz Kevin Love is already better than all of them.
Get Kevin Love and Rudy Gay on that roster ASAP
This didn't work for Kevin Love this year.
"From what I remember they (apparently Wade, Thomas and Crowder) were mocking and doubting Kevin Love and it had something to do with his mental health because he left a game due to a panic attack."
We are the title favourites next year so we will probably sign some ring chasers and we are hoping for a Kevin Love buyout. We really dont need to do anything significant but I would like to get Chris Boucher for pick 27 + Shamet and Alize
i was recently watching some kevin love outlet pass &amp; amare stoudemire dunk highlights. good stuff
"Counter:  Spicy P, Vanvleet and #4 for Kevin Love. I'll throw in Cedi Osman to make the money work.  Deal??"
How about if the Wolves and Warriors do Klay/David Lee for Kevin Love?
Serge Ibaka man c'mon. Kevin love has the Clooney thing going.  justice Winslow.
There’s also the Klay Thompson for Kevin Love deal that almost happened in 2014.
That reminds me of the Kevin Love for Klay trade. Sliding doors
Yeah Kevin Love who averaged 8 ppg in the finals and 40 year old rondo really made the Cavs and lakers into superteams. Pretty scary big 3 right there
"So your belief is that if we dump him for CJ or Buddy Hield, or Kevin Love our title odds over the next five years will go up?   I really can’t say I agree."
I remember in 2014 reading that the Cavs were crazy for trading LeBron's Pippen for Kevin Love
*laughs in Kevin Love*
"Kevin Love suffered a concussion, missed a game, and was ineffective upon returning. Dude averaged 4 PPG in the games the Cavs won."
It is possible to suffer from mental health issues AND be a prick. That is the category Kevin Love falls into.
"It's funny because that one quote ""I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am"" is quoted all the time but the context was like him going off for a straight minute about coverages and counters and all kinds of crazy shit. Would love to hear players just completely nerd out about that kind of stuff instead of the typical 'who wanted it more' type of shit"
"I think the issue with Kyrie is he's said a lot of dumb and controversial shit before so lots of people on this sub were already anti-Kyrie before he had his mental health break. It's not fair to Kyrie, but that's just my take on why he wasn't shown the same love the Kevin Love and Demar got.   Re: Paul George, he became a meme with his playoff performances in recent years and him skipping out of OKC to play with a very unlikeable group in Los Angeles made people not feel as sympathetic to him. Unfortunately, most people have biases towards certain guys and that's why we get inconsistent sympathy towards guys going through mental health issues."
He replaced Kevin Love
I remember some doubts about Simmons but the hype was so big for Wiggins that people were clowning the Kevin Love trade cause Cavs were “giving up a future Lebron James”
"Yeah and they played amazing defense unlike Kyrie and KLove… Obviously Kyrie was a huge loss but Kevin love was so bad in Cleveland that they were probably better with him on the bench   Plus I’m not the one discounting the Raptors title, he was bashing the Warriors title."
"Giannis is a super likable dude. Granted, anyone this side of Sarah Huckabee Sanders would be likable compared to Chris Paul, but Giannis is likable by any standards.  This stuff about Milwaukee being a fucking miracle though is getting a bit nauseating. Now that he's won a title as the best player on the team, he's in the conversation for best player in the league. With, really, only LeBron (questions about him being officially past his prime or not,) KD (questions about health) and Curry (age) being in the conversation.   Throw in smart trades/free agent signings and Milwaukee isn't a small-market miracle, but rather just a damn smart franchise who lucked into drafting the best player in his draft in the mid-first round.   I just hope Giannis stops the ""I coulda formed a superteam"" bullshit. One, there was no place he could have realistically gone and had a better roster around him. Two,  where the fuck are these mystical superteams? I'll give you KD to the Warriors, but LeBron and Kevin Love? KD and Kyrie? Kemba Walker joining the Celtics? Even LeBron with the Lakers. That's a superteam?!? LA has won a playoff series in one of LeBron's three years there. AD never won shit."
Kevin Love should just quit the NBA and dominate Big 3
Yeah Kevin love = Anthony Davis easily
Ok but it makes no sense because comparing the Spurs missing key free throws to Kevin Durant or James harden or kyrie and love being injured makes no sense. Not all asterisk are made equal. This post makes no sense
"From 2004 to 2021, almost every injury asterisk is for a player whose name starts with K:  2004: Karl Malone  2009: Kevin Garnett  2010: Kendrick Perkins  2015: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving  2017: Kawhi Leonard  2019: Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant  2021: Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving"
"KD watches WNBA tho, of course he would know Liz lol   https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/7/15/22578571/for-the-love-of-the-womens-game-kevin-durant-talks-about-wnba  &gt;“I enjoy watching the WNBA,” Durant told Insider. “I pretty much follow all the girls and try to keep up with the box scores and see how they are doing each night and watch as much as I can.”  &gt;“You know, the game of basketball is incredible no matter who is on the floor,” he added.  &gt;Durant is not just a casual fan of the WNBA. He’s invested in women’s sports. Recently, his Thirty-Five Ventures invested in an online platform, Just Women’s Sports, a sports media start-up aimed at elevating women’s sports coverage.  &gt;He’s also been seen at New York Liberty games.  &gt;As proof of how much he keeps up, Durant talked to Cash about the WNBA player he sees as most like him, Jonquel Jones of the Connecticut Sun.  &gt;“Jonquel Jones is the one that comes off top of mind,” Durant said of the 6’6” big. “She reminds me of myself with her length and how she shoots the ball. I’m a huge fan of her.”"
Best we can do is Kevin Love and Cedi Osman
We accept. Enjoy Kevin Love
"OMG, i love how much Kevin hates this."
"I don't know how Kevin Love made it either but when you look at the best bigs in the NBA, most of them are foreign. Shit, even Bam could have played for Nigeria instead of the US if he wanted."
"Wiggins and Simmons were not that highly rated, every draft profile said something like ""world class athletes but..."" then would proceed to question their effort, BBIQ, and skill development.  There were questions about Simmons quitting on LSU (and his teammates quitting on him).  Scouts talked about Wiggins saying that they would forget for stretches that he was in the game.  Fans rated them much higher than front offices did (If Wiggins was rated as highly as Zion, AD, or Kat, the cavs don't trade him for Kevin Love)."
"Easily KDs. The Lakers would probably have to go through one of the most talented big 3s of all time on the Nets, and might not even be the favorites. The Warriors had to go through the big 3 of LeBron, Kevin Love, and JR Smith."
"No, he was not.  Embiid averaged 11ppg/8reb. He was not a can't miss prospect lol. The reason he rose up the board was because he went from a bench player to playing well and learning on fly. Wiggins went from a can't miss prospect to a great prospect.   Very few #1 picks can be the center of a package for Kevin Love (who was a top 10 player at the time)."
KD gave Kevin Love depression smh
"Being in the paint makes that play much different to me. Barnett is jumping toward the hoop as much as he is toward Baylor, which on an 8 foot shot is not an unnatural thing to do. And of course he also didn't get the call. [Kevin Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIh5tjodUTU) on Victor Oladipo that play ain't."
I love the “his name is Kevin” 😂
Imagine typing all that while still saying absolutely nothing. All you're showing is that you are new to the NBA and you never saw Kevin Love with the Timberwolves
"We need to talk about Kevin   (Yes, I stole this from the top comment on the Kevin love post)"
"If Kevin Love was actually a star player that year and healthy you'd have a point. But watching that 2016 finals nobody was thinking ""damn that's a superteam."" People were thinking ""damn Kyrie and Lebron are going off, doing everything"".  &gt;Lol you're just trying to play mental gymnastics because you are simping for LeBron  No I'm not. I just have a consistent definition for a superteam. 3 star players. Kevin Love was not that in 2016.  &gt;Another example of a superteam trying to buy rings  Every team is trying to ""buy rings"" again more dumb reasoning from you. Every team is paying players to win championships."
Yes I'm sure the Timberwolves' first request in the trade talk was 'Get us Anthony Bennett please! Here's Kevin Love for him.'
"No matter who the Cavs take #1 in 2013, they are still getting traded for Kevin Love."
"That's what every lottery team fan tell themselves, and I am not even saying you are wrong. But do you think the Cavs can draft a starting 5 for a top 4 seed team? Can they even draft a starting 5 for a playoff team? They need a lot more development and trade for impactful player(s) that moves the needle if they want to be a winning team.  Dumping salary when the team is 22-50 and at the salary FLOOR hurt them on both ends. Unless they are getting that impactful player in return or they need room to max a FA... But who is giving them a star for the corpse of Kevin Love? And who is signing that max with the 22-50 Cavs?"
If you have enough star power then ring chasers will sign with you for the vet min. If the Cavs buy out Kevin Love then he's going to the Warriors or the Nets 100%
"There are rumors of a kevin love buyout+minimum deal with the warriors not to mention Poole averaged 15ppg off the bench after coming back from the g league. If he plays like that next season he could win 6moy and if we keep wiseman we'll have looney on our bench, we can definitely attract a ring chaser or two and have our bench set up well"
Alperen Sengun will become Minesota Kevin Love and end up a top 5 player in this draft. He'll either be drafted by OKC or outside the lottery
This sub and rewarding loyalty? You should see a Kevin Love thread.
"Any deal with Oubre would be a one year thing, with the other years being non-guaranteed.  If they include Wiseman and some of their non-guaranteed players, then Oubre wouldn't need a big deal.     Say they target Siakam, they would have to send out around $25m to match salaries.  Wiseman is set to make about $9.1m.  Gary Payton II and Alen Smailagic are around $3.7m combined.  That leaves Oubre making around $12.2m for one year.  The Warriors have two or three other guys on non-guaranteed deals, so they could drop Oubre's needed salary down another $1.8m-5.4m.      Even without Wiseman, it'd be about $21m for one year of Oubre.  That's around what Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and Garry Harris will make next year.  Yeah, it's not good, but it's not Kevin Love or John Wall bad.  Would be a legendary tax bill though for the Warriors though."
"I agree, but I doubt Love would do a workout. They treated him like he'd won a gold with them and trusted him. They probably typically trust players. When's the last time there was a situation like Kevin Love? It normally doesn't happen because players normally aren't lying."
"The supposed Kevin love beef came from one reporter, and wasn’t supported by love https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-heat-all-star-notes-20180217-story.html  With the additions of Rodney hood and Clarkson, they just didn’t have a role for wade anymore. The cavs really struggled in the season, so they needed some young 30+ mpg guys that could shoot 3s."
Have you ready any of the comments here or any Kevin Love posts? Because it’s the complete opposite.
Kevin Love lies. It happens. What's looking into the current condition? Making him fly to you and do a workout? You probably just don't do that for most of the veterans of the team.
"Kevin Love was supposed to be part of the competing, but he decided not to. I don't believe for a second he's been as extensively injured as he's claimed over the last few years. He stopped playing and is completely out of shape. If we were ever competitive in theory he'd be part of that. But he isn't good enough. He wasn't when we gave him the contract. He has a huge contract that's always been better than he is and somehow it's on Cleveland?"
What was the Chemistry plus or minus for Kevin Love tho
Kevin Love is honestly more surprising than Wilt there tbh
Kevin love gets paid millions. Somebody had to tell him he was trash. Maybe a reality check or retire.
It's the Kevin Love and Chris Bosh effect on a much less talented player. His opportunities diminished while still playing good. I appreciate him for doing so without complaining
"I don’t think what he said was that bad.  If you don’t do your job well and lie about your skills which leads to poor performance, you get fired.  Kevin Love could have deserved to be on the team but he was out of shape and not performing well.  It’s all on him, not Colangelo.  You don’t want your boss to tell it like it is and fire you?  Then perform well."
"Kevin Love is getting ridiculous. You can have mental health issues, which is completely fine and I support him spreading awareness, but that doesn’t give you an excuse to quit on your team, act like a man-child, and do all of this shit. He is ridiculous and I see why other players are probably getting sick of his shit."
Kevin Love is not a big name in the NBA anymore
"If LeBron James, Derrick Favors, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Ramon Sessions were on the team, it would be, ""Gay Love Sessions Favors Lebron."""
Colangelo was way outta line for his comments and Kevin love was unprofessional showing up to USA like that. Fuck em both
Kevin Love is a wine mom   Perfect
"&gt;I agree with what Colangelo said about Love but that was unprofessional as fuck to say that shit in public.  I'd rather have people say what they feel on a situation rather than give a ""hockey"" interview. And Kevin Love has done the same. Listen to post game interviews with the guy, and he throws youngsters under the bus continously."
Kyrie gave Kevin Love depression confirmed
Kevin love should focus on getting healthy and in condition
"If LeBron James, Derrick Favors, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love and Ramon Sessions were on the team, it would be, ""LeBron Favors Gay Love Sessions."""
Not really sure Colangelo said anything wrong.  If Kevin Love really told him that he was healthy and ready to play at a high level then showed up out of shape and looking like shit I think Jerry has a right to be pissed.  Love wasted their time and made them look stupid
Kevin Love is always pissed off. He came in out of shape.  He was bad in Cleveland but he threw the rookies under the bus. He deserves all the criticism.  Imagine if this was anyone else
"He was a rookie who played on a new style of basketball. His outlet passes are especially considered pretty memorable and we still have players like Kevin Love who mimic that.   But that’s kinda it though, pretty much every metric available suggests that Willis Reed should’ve won it."
"I don't mind because fuck Kevin Love, handicapping the Cavs since Lebron left.."
"Even a 5 year retrospective can be misleading, and in the best of cases (where a player spends 5 years with the same team that drafted them) it is just laden with caveats.   For example: Andrew Wiggins. What exactly was his value? He went first overall and was included in a trade for Kevin Love in like this 2nd year I think, after LeBron came back.   So he spends very little time with his original org, but was he instrumental in producing that championship in a way? How the hell do you evaluate that? Would he have produced more/faired better if he stayed with the Cavs?   There are just endless questions. If he was drafted to a different team, does that team develop him better or worse? Anthony Bennet - does his career look the same if he gets drafted in the 10-15 range? How much of the pressure of being an unexpected, and oft unwanted, number one pick was a cause of what happened to him?   Idk if that makes any sense or not."
Dude signed a max contract on a losing team and then quit on the court and threw multiple tantrums. Imagine if Paul George did the shit Kevin love did on the court.
"Really? Dude signed a max and then gave up. At least Chandler Parsons disappeared and stayed away from his team and the spotlight. Kevin Love wants to be treated like a star and puts himself in a position where others have to give him a reality check, be it his Cavs teammates or Team USA."
Fuck Colangelo. And fuck Kevin Love too.
People dont want to hate kevin love especially in a fued against a Colangelo who everyone hates
I'm Kevin Love and this is deep
"The Knicks always take on expiring contracts every few years when they think a top 10 player is coming their way during the summer (the free agent who never comes). Teams do this all the time. Taking on expiring contracts helps clear cap space for the following year. The price teams are willing to give to acquire space depends on many factors.   Again. No one wants Kevin Love now. But the right team might acquire him 2 seasons from now to set up a run at a possible free agent if it meant the cavs would take back certain items. So it isn’t zero value, but it is less than it used to be. NBA history is filled with expiring contracts being grabbed by teams in pursuit of free agents. OKC is basically doing an excessive version of this now."
Im always down to dunk on a Colangelo but i don't wanna defend kevin Love lol
"This sub literally hates everyone except Mike Breen and Kevin Harlan lol.   I personally love Jeff Van Gundy. People talk about how annoying his tangents get but I love them. A basketball game is 48 minutes long and not everything that happens in it is interesting, so sometimes it’s fun to just hear JVG gripe about shit."
Yes that squad don’t get shit confused. This team was playing Kevin Love and Garland in some of those games. And Jrue and Booker were probably still adjusting to the time zone difference. They’re gonna cruise from here on out.
"Not saying they should drop out of the Olympics, but moving forward other NBA players need to rally around Kevin Love and refuse to have anything to do with this prick.  They have the power to force him out."
Kevin Love has to be the worst contract in the league right? John Wall seems pretty close lately too
But bro was playing like prime Kevin love :(
Kevin Love?
"He’s not wrong, Kevin love played poorly this season and was not engaged his body language was terrible. Also Jerry saying this is stupid, what’s the point now, just move on"
"Ahh i see, the Kevin love way"
Extremely cool guy Kevin Love
"Kevin Love, “owe, sub me out.”"
"Man, what a dick. Larry Nance is garbage anyway. His autograph is worth just as much as a piece of dog poop sitting in the grass. Kevin Love is better anyway. I felt so bad for that kid though when he walked away with his head down. Screw that bum, Larry Nance."
"The problem is Love lying to them and then basically becoming unplayable to the point where they have to cut him makes team USA look bad.    You almost have to set the record straight otherwise people will be criticizing your organization for the move for years.  Now they're just calling Jerry and asshole, which he can live with. But the Kevin Love mistake won't have any effect on team USA going forward because the truth has been aired."
Kevin Love played a part in the laughingstock of the NBA winning a championship.
Kevin Love won a fucking championship while hiding Kyrie's weirdness for 3 years. That's all I need to know about him as a locker room presence. The Heat would kill to have him as a buy-out guy.
"what's wrong with not coddling an overpaid, overweight athlete. anyone paying attention to his game can see a soft body that doesn't get back on defense. if you want to play it's easy to see kevin love doesn't want to win"
"It's like Cleveland fans with Kevin Love. Yes, they remember the stop, but he also had a poor Finals otherwise. Fans get frustrated when players drop off in the Finals. Bad attitudes and unlikable play styles can also be detriments in likeability. Harden isn't Giannis. It really shouldn't be hard to comprehend why lots of fans dislike him. Every other NBA forum I've been to understands the reasons. It's not like we're trying to say he's a bad player. If we were, then downrates would make sense, because he's a talented player. But he had a bad Finals for us, and many NBA fans in general dislike his play style."
implying Kevin Love quit basketball
Do top guys like Durant really give a shit that the coach is trashing Kevin Love for being out of shape and wasting everyones time?
Kevin love has been an unprofessional diva for years and sneaked his way into the Olympic team knowing he’s completely washed and out of shape.   I love colangelos comment
"I know he has a blank check because he has depression, but a take this sub is going to hate, Kevin love has legitimate mental health struggles, but is also an asshole"
Regardless of? What are you smoking? Kevin Love IS washed from how he performed in Team USA.
"sniveling, betaboi anti-testosterone overload in this thread, you'd think from the replies he called kevin love hitler or something"
Ehhh.  He is speaking the truth tho. Kevin love hasnt wanted to play basketball since 2017. I wish he would just retire.
"Why are you assuming Kevin Love didn’t lie? I mean, I really doubt it was Team USA reaching out to Love. I’d bet anything Love expressed interest first"
Lmao Blake got paid $776k to be a good bench player on the Nets. Kevin Love has $60M left on his contract and would be expected to start on the Mavs. These are not comparable situations at all unless he gets bought out.
"I never said anything about Kevin Love specifically, I agree he’s had some bad moments as a teammate. I was targeting the money equals happiness stance.  It’s rather indicative of this sub’s age and underlying stance on mental health in general when they think being making money implies you’re supposed to be happy. Player expresses he’s devastated that he got traded? Number one comment, without fail, is always “I don’t get why he’s upset, he literally makes millions to play a game.” What a poisonous and ignorant take.  Yes. Dementia is also a mental health condition. In conjunction, he also struggled with clinically depression and anxiety. Look it up."
"I never said that money means you never feel negative emotions, just that you shouldn’t bitch and moan about how hard your life is when you’re making $30 million a year to not even play, lead locker room mutinies, pout IN GAME, and talk shit about your teammates. Fuck off with that “juvenile” shit, Kevin love could’ve been the leader the team needed post Lebron, but he just is not that guy."
"We should embrace the tank and take Kevin Love along with a couple of Cleveland picks. They're always picking in the lottery, it would be worth it"
Lmao how tf does Kevin Love solve any of the issues they have with KP outside of rebounding? Just as injury prone at this point and even worse defensively.
Kevin Love thinking he’s American sniper playing for USA
I said and quote Kevin love is ass. You literally spend this amount of time trying to put down an opinion that you don’t agree with. You are so persistent about it too. Like for the love of god shut up dude lmaoooo
"Jerry Colangelo, Bill Simmons, and Kevin Love. Could there be a story about 3 less likeable humans?"
"The Cavs are unlikely to trade for Siakam.  We have a logjam of bigs, specifically power forwards (Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love, &amp; Dean Wade).  If anything, a sign &amp; trade for Garry Trent Jr. could be on the cards.  He's a tad undersized for the 3, but, like I said, we're in dire need of wings.  Garland-Sexton-Okoro-Mobley-Hartenstein, with Rubio, Trent Jr., &amp; Nance Jr. off the bench to round out an 8-man rotation could compete for the play-in tournament.  Not lofty goals by any means, but realistic for the current iteration of the team."
Conspiracy theory: Kevin Love asked Colangelo to make this statement so he can get bought out.
"Y’all call Kevin Love out on this exact type of behavior constantly, it’s not surprising to anyone Love would show up out of shape and delusional about his abilities. Colangelo says exactly that and calls a spade a spade and now everyone is up in arms. There’s zero consistency with sentiments on this sub and it’s just as bad as the media hoping on every instance to be outraged."
"Maybe Love was the one being unprofessional: lying about his health and fitness and wanting to be on the team when he knew he had nothing to contribute. Not saying Colangelo is right, but I can see where he's coming from. He wanted to call Kevin Love out for his bullshit"
"fwiw Chris Paul has credited his rejuvenation to going vegan, now he’s somehow way more durable than he ever has been.  But maybe he was just eating badly and being vegan is just better than before. Guess it depends.  Love going leaner definitely cost him a lot in rebounding and strength. Prime Kevin Love would be a great center in today’s game."
That sucks but good on Kevin Love.   Larry Nance did do a lot for the city during the pandemic.
Where’s the post about Kevin Love disappointing Colangelo?
"Somehow the basketball gods need to allow a straight up Kyrie for Westbrook trade.  I think it would make both teams better anyway.  Then you'd have both bands back together...if you just believe that Kevin Love got skinnier, darker, and his eyebrows merged."
"yea, thats why I said he was giving the ball back. you said 'Kevin Love not giving a shit.'  I said ""maybe"" because you said so, I dont think he was"
"I didn't get any SHOTS FIRED AT KEVIN LOVE vibes from this,he just gave boring, work related reasons why he's not on the team anymore."
What a piece of shit : Kevin love would’ve been very serviceable for the Olympics and even if not you just don’t say this shit
"Maybe you should watch the video again.  ""Being a dick"" is not a good excuse for an NBA player.   Maybe Kevin Love should act like he gives a shit about his career."
"Lol I'm no expert but I'm sure there's a lot out there, a cursory search turns this up: https://cavaliersnation.com/2020/02/22/report-kevin-love-did-everything-rent-out-billboard-saying-beilein-sucks/"
"Kevin Love has not been good since LeBron left. Even when he was healthy over the last three years he was bad on the court. Just because he tells you he’s healthy you don’t put him on the team. No smart GM would’ve. That’s 1,000,000% Colangelo’s fault"
So Kevin Love gets a pass too?
That Kevin love was out of shape?
"exactly. Kevin already doesn't look good but at least he bowed out gracefully, it was embarrassing enough, everyone was trashing him. This is just kicking someone while they're down to make himself look better.  And I hate Kevin Love so im def not the type of person that would defend him"
"Meanwhile in the other thread, a lot of r/nba citizens were shitting on Kevin Love. No matter how washed he is, Kev doesn't deserve this public disrespect from Jerry Colangelo of all people."
"You act like he wasn't apart of the greatest comeback in NBA history? 2016 was a historic run. I can see why NBA teams would want that on their team, and offer the man a fresh start.  But bro just stop. please. I'm begging you. Why are you saying I'm for popular opinions?? Did you forget what we were even talking about here???  I'm going against the popular opinion that Kevin Love is washed up. This whole post is about throwing Kevin Love under the bus. I'm the one sticking up for him. Like how dumb are you!? Legit question."

Fuck Kevin love lol
"Didn't he say Kevin Love was going to be the 12th guy anyway?   Fair enough Love showed up out of shape and stuff, but the 12th guy being unable to play should not have that big of an impact lol."
Kevin Love has no good basketball yet to play. He’s washed.
Kevin Love was arrogant af thinking he should have a spot on that team after not doing shit the past 3 years.
Colangelo shouldn’t have said it as harsh but I don’t think it’s that wrong to call out a player if he genuinely showed up completely out of shape and/or just clearly didn’t care. People are saying why would guy want to play if you’re going to just get called out. If you’re worried about getting called out for total lack of effort then playing for team USA isn’t for you anyway. Kevin Love taking a spot from someone else and shitting all over that opportunity is way more disrespectful than anything Colangelo said. It’s insane to me that we want to protect these players egos even more by not calling out bullshit effort.
"This is gonna’ get me downvoted but I’d be willing to bet anything, the other players are the ones who forced Kevin Love out of there, for whatever reason.  If KD, Dame or whoever wished it, Love would still be on the team. I think Colangelo is taking the heat for this undeservedly."
&gt; Kevin Love basically lied his way into camp.  Which makes him seem even more incompetent.
LeBron gave Kevin Love depression
&gt;unprofessional  Oh so basically Kevin love for the last year or so.  Can't really cry about professionalism when you're Kevin love here. What he did was equally unprofessional
Hey man your right Kevin Love is a gawd on court how I didnt see it I dont even know.
"He has the opportunity of a lifetime to get paid, and he took it. Not like his skills fell off. Everyone expecting him to be like CP3 in leadership, but that's not who Kevin Love is, or ever was. Y'all are shoe-horning him into so some sort of roll he should be in, but we all know he ain't. Don't make him an asshole or a bad basketball player. He's just a key piece contender teams should consider if they want to make a serious run. That's it. There's tons of players like that in the league and that's how it's gonna be. Media blowing everything out of proportion, and you, the casual fan, who doesn't know anything about basketball apparently because he can't come up with an argument, listens to it."
"This “dirty laundry” is being blown out of proportion.  “Hey do you want to represent your country at the olympics and win a gold medal?”  “No, Colangelo said something mean about Kevin Love one time”   Lol no player is going to react like that especially since what was said was completely true"
"Yeah seriously, this teams issues is not a prime, let alone decent, Kevin Love away from being solved"
"Kevin Love can both be unqualified for Team USA, AND Jerry Colangelo can have been completely unprofessional. They're not mutually exclusive concepts."
"Listen to what Kevin Love said vs look at how he did this last season, hmmmm"
No harm was done so why should Colangelo put him on blast? You think Kevin Love's at fault for Colangelo picking him for the roster? K Love literally withdrew from the roster instead of hurting them in competitive play. Colangelo's mistake of picking K Love was rectified by K Love. So yes it's weird that Colangelo is blaming or putting K Love's name in his mouth at all. In your own words Love isn't the reason the USA Men's team isn't performing up to snuff.
You're really comparing Westbrook to Kevin Love?  I'm not even a big russ fan but that's actually just disrespectful to compare him to someone that hasn't done anything without lebron
"Cavs trade 2018 LeBron and Kevin Love  for Suns' Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and FRPs."
"Kevin Love, Chris Bosh"
"He was speaking up for mental health accommodations. But he wasn't famous like Kevin Love, Demar Derozan, or Simone Biles."
Stretch bigs:  Kevin love  Brook lopez  Karl anthony towns
Kevin Love was never a three n D guy 😂😂😂 he just became a stretch four with above average rebounding
"Not sure the Adams thing is THAT crazy.  If they get rid of Nance, their backup big is..  .. Kevin Love.  I think theres a weird idea (and im not saying you) that most teams 6th man needs to be a guard. Afams would be on the more expensive side, sure, but as a backup big, he'd be amongst the best in the league."
Maybe Kevin love. He was a bruiser on the wolves then became a 3 and d guy on the cavs.
"Shaq, Dwight free throw liability - max players. Westbrook, turnovers and shot selection - max player. Kevin Love, everything - max player. Apparently you can be a max player and be unusable in crunch time it happens often."
[Ja Morant had so many almost dunks already that could’ve been one of the best in game posterizers](https://youtu.be/4wQM_-hhE0s) especially the last one on Kevin Love lmao
Personally i like Brown. He’s had playoff success and has consistently grown as a player on a good team. Beals a undisputed bucket but on the Wizards idk. Reminds me of kevin love on the twolves statistically. His scoring is so inflated. Not sold on all stars from bottom tier teams.
"He is right. With ifs, you can rewrite history, but it makes no sense.  What happened happened. Period.  Ray Allen made his shot and the Heat won the NBA title.  The same goes for Kawhi in 2019 or Kevin Durant's missed shot. That's why we love this sport so much."
"Cleveland took Wiggins, he was traded to Minnesota in the Kevin Love deal"
Kevin Love/Sexton
"The problem is that a contender really needs good defensive bigs. The last few finals teams without a good defensive big were the last couple of Cavs teams, and outside of LeBron factor it just hasn't been a thing in 20 years, and at least Kevin Love could stretch the floor more reliably.  I think Sabonis as the #2 vs. a true superstar means you're taking the ball out of that guy's hands more to give it to Sabonis which just isn't a huge net positive, but because of Sabonis's limitations if he's not constantly involved on ball you're kind of wasting him. You also then need to play shooting players around Sabonis entirely to not make your offense stagnate which means that if you're going to pair him with another big, you need one who can shoot. At that point when you have another superstar, a shooting good defensive big, and a bunch of other shooters, what exactly do you need Sabonis for?"
I dont how people think the Cavs werent. Kyrie was considered close to a top 5 PG at the time and Kevin Love was what top 3 PF at the time
"Sounds like Kevin Love choked then, eh?  Classic Lebron fan, pulling Bron's teammates down to make it seem Lebron is carrying the team."
Of if you meant they can with half the nba injured then sure I’ll agree with you. Kevin love could also be the best player to win on a championship team if enough people get inured.
Yep. Kevin Love is a god in here. Isn't it
"&gt;Possibly a top 5 player in the early 2010s Kevin Love  At no point did anyone think Kevin Love was top 5  &gt;You Lebron fans always shit on his teammates to make it seem like Lebron carries his team  I'm not a Lebron fan. I'm actually a Lebron hater, and like to perpetuate the idea that he is barely top 3. But go off"
"I dont see what OKC has to do with this, but the Cavs had the best player in the league, Lebron, possibly a top 5 player in the early 2010s Kevin Love, and one of the best young talents in Kyrie, along with a myriad of role players. Bruh, you Lebron fans always shit on his teamates to make it seem like Lebron carries his team. This was also the case with Bosh on the Heat. The only time you can legit say that he had no help was in the late 2000s."
Derrick Rose  Zach Lavine  Andrew Wiggins  Jimmy Butler  Kevin Love.    Nice little small ball lineup with 4 all stars and Wiggins
"Minnesota Timberwolves Kevin Love  Not for the scoring as much, but I will outrebound guys bigger and taller from sheer technique and skill. It still amazes me how many guys fail to position themselves when a shot goes up and instead stand there with their mouths open.   &amp;#x200B;  I mean, there's just so much value in an offensive rebound at the park. My team will shoot 11/30 and beat your team that shoots 9/18."
"Lebron, Kyrie, Kevin Love, Ray Allen, Richard Jefferson  Honorable mention Channing Frye"
Chris Weber just said kevin love was put on Olympic team because he is white…. Yet no repercussions
Chris Weber literally said that kevin love was put on the Olympic team because of the color of his skin.  Will he be cancelled too?
Rachel “John “Kevin “loul “Chandler “josh smith” Parsons”Deng” Love” Wall” Nicoles
"He and Kevin Love epitomized the very frustrating 2013-2014 Timberwolves. Great stats between the two of them, very effective corner offense with ball movement, a positive point differential overall... and just the wins did not come. We routinely blew leads in games we should have won and just were never as good as it seemed we ""should"" have been. A very frustrating year."
"It would be Kevin Garnett just so I could have random movies on and here his pregame takes.  &gt;.... He sees me and Andrew (Wiggins) and he’s like, ‘Come here, come here.’  So we walk over there. He’s real into the movie. “You see this shit right here, this is what this shit’s about. You die for what you believe in. You die for your boys. This is that mentality we need to have going into the game. It’s about war. It’s about going down with your boys. I love this shit. This shit gives me goosebumps.”  I look, and he actually has goosebumps. I’m a big KG guy and I’m like “Yeah, I’m with you man. This is how we gotta play.” He’s like “right, Zach. You feel me Wiggs?”  Andrew Wiggins says “I don’t know even know what ‘Forrest Gump’ is, I’ve never heard of this movie.” The look on his face was like perplexed. Not anger, but just like get out of my face. So he just looks at us and says, “Y’all go get ready for the game, man.”"
I would say more Kevin love in Cleveland. He was there pretty much to provide spacing for Shaq and Kobe.
No way Kevin Love starts over Mobley
Prior to the season Kevin Love joint the Cavs he averaged 26/12/ and 4. You can’t discredit him once he joined the Cavs and his production wasn’t the same being a 3rd option. He was an all star caliber player when Lebron assembled the Cavs team. Where is this definition that it takes 3 superstars to create a super team. I’d argue if you organize / team up with two or more players in the top 10 it’s superteam. CP3 and Griffin didn’t team up. I think your missing the whole point in each of Lebrons teams he basically assembled with other top players via offseason except the Lakers with AD but that was already in works there moment he went to LA
"I know you aren't saying anything in good faith, but notice that not a single one of his teammates here is from his first run in Cleveland. Nor are we counting 2014 Dwayne Wade or Kevin Love (supposed superstar he played with in Cleveland)."
"Lebron had Wade, Bosh, Allen, Kyrie, Kevin Love. Not like lebron has been winning chips on his own?"
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
"Also Sexton and Garland should continue to improve, plus mobley and some other nice young pieces. Possibly Kevin Love contributing also? Either way, Cavs should win at least 5-10 more games"
Kevin love is better than kobe because he has superior ws per 48
"You're really doubling down on this, huh. Now, you've got to argue one point here. We're talking about draft day photos, not what these dudes have become, after they've hit the gym and grown and hired a permanent stylist. Kevin Love coming into the league looked like a fat nerd. Porzingus definitely looked like a giraffe had wandered into a suit store. Dwyane Wade is literally in the photo above wearing enough fabric for three suits. Lebron showed up in a zoot suit to his draft, looking like he had a wedding after, he even wore gaiters. Dame is only 6' 2"", and didn't have the same problems as the rest of these guy, neither did Rubio. Joel Embiid looked like a fifty year old accountant on draft day, and suffered none of the problems of looking too tall and too thin, because he was neither.   Now, if you want to talk about these dudes now. Sure, they're all selling clothes. And everything is fit for them to look right. Sometimes Lebron wears shorts and fake glasses, but sure right, whatever."
Because no one cares about Kevin Love. Simple as that.
According to npr that is the average in Hollywood. I'm sure it dif in other places. Either way kevin love is a banana republic model.
"Bro go look at the modern builds of nba players. Tell me dame Lillard, Karl Anthony towns, Joel embid, Dwyane wade, lebron james, Ricky Rubio, even my boy kristaps porzingus looks dapper as fuck.   Have you heard banana republic model Kevin Love?  Kd aside, Nba bodies have evolved a lot since Shawn Bradley monstar. It's the most stylish sports league in America hands down."
"Klay Thompson ! Haha naw Kevin love , Gordon Haywood, Duncan Robinson, and Tyler Herro.  Prob going with Duncan Robinson for my 2022 pick"
"Red Velvet? Also, Kevin Love will probably be pretty solid if he ever plays  Edit: as honorable mentions, heyward is the best"
I mean they have a lot of money tied up in Kevin Love and I assume Lance. There are always ways to create space if they need to
"Ask them if they remember Kevin Love being out the year before. Or Kyrie getting injured in Game 1 in 2015. I believe even just with Kyrie, the Cavs win in 2015. He outplayed Steph all game and actually played decent defense."
"Bball ref gives Kevin Love a 73% of getting in to the HOF, but I would expect him to be in the HOVG first, maybe in a weak induction year he might sneak in down the line"
"If you wanna go that route, without LBJ there is no Kevin Love trade, especially not for Wiggins who everybody thought was almost a surefire star. Similar to how LAC had to give up all those picks to OKC for George AND Leonard, CLE had to give up Wiggins to get Love AND LeBron."
"Kevin Love was nowhere close to being the league's worst defender. He was specifically bad at the 1 thing that GSW was able to exploit, which is forcing bigs to guard in space. In every other area of defense, he was below average but not worst in the league below average. Unless you're going to argue that RJ was an average defender vs. Steph and Klay your argument makes no sense.  Most of the time RJ got Harrison Barnes duty and nobody was really guarding him anyway."
"People sometime put too much in the ppg average, and too much on the finals series.   The team has to win FOUR best-of-seven series in order to win a title.   In those rounds, LeBron went from 22, to 24, to 26, to 29 ppg in each series.   Kyrie dropped 21 and 24 against the Hawks and Raptors before dropping 27 ppg against the Warriors.   Who do you think was the guy helping ease the load in those series so the stars could pace themselves?   Against the Hawks, Kyrie and LeBron got 36 and 35 minutes a game. Against the Dinobots, they got the same.   Then against the Warriors, LeBron was playing 41 minutes and Kyrie 39.   And in those earlier series, Love was doing his share of all-star basketball. 18/12 against Detroit. 19/13 against the Hawks.  He got 15 a game against the Raptors dropping 3's at a rate of .448 and shooting over .900 from the charity stripe.   &amp;#x200B;  So sure... LeBron and Kyrie were taking the lion's share of the shots in the finals because they were the best best, but had they both had to go all out in the Eastern conference playoffs, Kyrie would have likely been limping in the conference finals and sitting on the bench recovering from injurie in the Finals, the same way he's ended most other playoff runs.   Kevin Love still help spread the floor because, even though he wasn't playing well, the Warriors still knew what he could do if they didn't cover him.   &amp;#x200B;  Frankly, the Cavs are lucky they got a franchise player who has a little humility because, even when LeBron and the Cavs were giving him more shots than anybody on the team in 2017, he still wasn't happy playing second fiddle to LeBron.   Had Love taken Kyrie's attitude, that team would have been fucked from the get.   But he humbled himself, and the team won a title in large part due to that.   Plus, he a [concussion that series](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15983799/2016-nba-playoffs-kevin-love-cleveland-cavaliers-elbow-head). Even when you are well enough to play, a concussion can really mess with your equilibrium.  &amp;#x200B;  I get what you are saying: You don't need a super team. We know that. The Raptors. The Bucks. Hell... LeBron and AD was a dynamic duo.    &amp;#x200B;  But that Cavs squad was a super team.   I mean, Ray Allen scoring 9pp against the Cavs didn't make the Celtics less of a super team in 2008."
"Part of it is the Cavs spacing required K Love stay away from the block.  Kevin Love could have done a good job scoring in the block on any of those people, although Draymond would have for sure bothered him.  Kevin Love is an excellent passer and post scorer, and those two things just weren't needed on the Cavs.  They turned him into a spot up shooter.  He did his job well, they went to 4 championships and won one."
"Just how big do you think the defensive upgrade was from Kevin Love to 35 y/o Richard Jefferson? Don't get me wrong, RJ was a great role player and played his part but he had almost nothing to do with the Cavs winning game 3."
"Kevin Love is and was a better shooter than RJ. Why would having a worse shooter, no matter their height, be to your advantage? Unless you're talking about defense?"
"Here's how I see it: Kevin Love was a beast in Minnesota. But he never really recovered from the many injuries he got in Minnesota. And he never played that well on the Cavs. During his entire time with the Cavs, he was plagued with injuries, had a streaky shot, and was a below average defender at a position where defense was his most important job."
"I have never seen something so trivial be made into such a big deal. Kevin Garnett is out there telling people their wives taste like Cheerios and you fuckers love it, but so help me god lebron makes fun of dirk one time and you will never let it go ten years later. Dirk doesn’t even give that much of a fuck"
Kevin Love and Kyrie would certainly make the playoffs in the East that year
Only works if your name Kevin love
LeBron gave Kevin Love that concussion
Kevin Love was the second best player on the Cavs. LeBron just made him worse.
Plus the Kevin Love touchdown to LeBron corner 3 was something else
"Dray got himself suspended and he only missed 1 game. Iggy played the entire series and Bogut missing 2 games isnt exactly the same as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love missing the entire series lmao Cavs 2nd best player was Matthew Dellavedova, comparing that to Draymond missing a game cuz he wont stop kicking mfs in the nuts is fuckin shameless"
Kevin love was not that good in l Cleveland I wouldn’t even consider then a super team tbh sure he was great before but that has nothing to with the cavs
"Look at the data. Everyone playing below their standard. Lebron ts is just 50,5% and kyrie the 2nd option took more shot and his ts is below Kevin love. And love is actually good passer or even great for big man. He's no dray but he certainly is good passer."
fair enough i think if you asked majority of nba fans about the 2016 finals Kevin Love’s name isn’t coming up once. He wasn’t as bad as what few say and he wasn’t anything special. Shit when I think of Kevin Love and the 2016 finals i think of the couple possessions he locked up curry but that’s about it.
Come on Kevin we love you but you gotta stop with the burners.
"My GOD, use your brain without hindsight of 4 years later.   Yeah, the 73 win team added KD. But the Cavs beat that 73 win team to claim the title. Both teams were breezing through the playoffs. And why should Kevin Love feel like an underdog as defending champion that only lost 1 game in the playoffs so far? Which is the fucking topic of this thread.   How can you be so close minded and not see that his position has some merits?"
Yes he is. Got to meet scoonie at a grizzlies vs cavs game a couple years ago. Same game Ja tried to dunk over Kevin Love. Scoonie is a nice dude
"In all honestly does anyone even bring up Kevin love when mentioning that finals series? Dude is basically an afterthought from that whole series imo. It was literally the lebron and kyrie show, while steph threw the series away single handedly."
Where is Kevin Love?
"&gt; Kevin Love put up 17 points, 13 rebounds, and 2 assists on 49% TS. For a third option, those are solid numbers.  Is this really the bar for third options? It's not like Love is providing playmaking or defense either, sheesh don't remember it being that bad."
"Him playing his career with bums is why teams don't need to give their best effort and regular season defense comes down to effort.  Until he does literally anything when it matters, I'm looking at his numbers with skepticism. Blame Kevin Love if you think that's unfair."
"He was underutilized because he couldn't keep up defensively. There rumblings in 2015 that David Blatt wanted Love traded. Love was being played off the court by the Warriors the same way Gobert is against stretch 5's. It's why even though Gobert is a DPOY, no one really respects UTA as contenders. And also why Kevin Love really wasn't a star player in his CLE stint"
"False. Kevin Love was incredibly and was the only reason that we even sniffed 20 wins.   To simply put it, he has never had a quality team around him here."
I love the dubs but reading this I was like “uhhhhh wasn’t Kevin love hurt this series??” Like cmon now. Op almost blatantly leaving info like that out smh. Context is always needed
"&gt; 15 PPG could be good for a 3rd option, if they are scored efficiently.  During the playoffs the third options for the final 4 (and Spurs) in 2016 were  Raptors -  Jonas Valanciunas 13.8 PPG on 57/0/74  Thunder - Serge Ibaka 12 PPG on 52/45/75  Cavs - Kevin Love 14.7 PPG on 39/41/84  Spurs - Tony Parker 10.4 PPG on 45/25/86  Warriors - Draymond Green 15.4 PPG on 43/37/74 (highest scoring third option)  So Love was from the top 5 worst from 2, 2nd best from 3, and 2nd best from the line. He also shot more 3s than even Green though, 5.6 to 4.5"
"It's weird how you don't understand that Kevin Love didn't feel like an underdog when he and his team go 12-1 in the Eastern playoffs.   And yes, teams like Raptors are trash if they don't have Kahwi on their payroll, but the Cavs played good basketball and were rolling."
"Lebron is mentioned in the OP post by name twice. And this thread is piggy backing off the other threads that have happened in the last two days of this subreddit about which of his teams are/are not super teams, how good/bad Kevin love was, and other related topics.   So how is this my fault? People like you will keep lebrons nuts on your chin just to be contrarians. FOH"
Huh? I already said Steph made the right decision going for the three. You absolutely want Steph Curry going for a three when on an island with Kevin Love. Shot just didn’t go in.
Steph injured still better than 90% of the league but you’re kidding yourself if you think he can’t shake off Kevin Love easily when he’s healthy.
"Kevin love was an all star who averaged 26 ppg before joining Irving and Lebron to form a super team. Just because one of the superstars on a super team doesn’t perform well during the playoffs doesn’t mean it’s not a super team. Lebron may have not started the super-team trend we now have I’m looking at you Celtics, but he definitely helped popularize it. Lebron stans are hilarious"
"""defense""... lol. You do realize we're talking about Kevin Love?"
Kevin love top 10?? Who TF thought that. Too bad he never did anything for my wolves
"Come on do the fun ones that will get you in trouble, Rudy Gay, James hard-on, Kevin love"
You mean the Kevin Love who threw a tantrum in the middle of a game last season? The biggest mental midget in the league Kevin Love?
"Kevin Love plays poorly, it’s LeBron’s fault. Great logic there buddy. Did you hear the one where LeBron gave Kevin love depression?"
Do you not remember when Kevin Love could have broken the record for most points in a quarter but Kyrie got jealous and stopped feeding him
"Kevin Love was concussed during the finals, no wonder he didn't play well.  I swear you guys will put down anything and anyone to make Lebron seem better."
"Lol kind of different. CP3 actually missed multiple games. Steph was healthy enough to drop some awesome games. Issue is, he felt he had no choice but to go for the three. And he’s right, he’s Steph Curry with Kevin Love guarding him."
Kevin Love has been trash for soooooooo long. Had LeBron. It got him a title he's be retired
"I'm not going to look, but I imagine this list came out not too long after he had some huge games against the Knicks. I watched a lot Knick games last decade, and saw many players have career nights against us  For example, it felt like Kevin Love was going to sleep walk into a 30/30 game every time we played him"
"It isn't just about fully committing.  Kevin Love fully committing to the defensive end and say improving his reaction time slightly doesn't change the fact his foot speed would still make him one of the slower perimiter defenders in the NBA.   No matter how much people wish,you can't put square pegs into round holes. This is just GM Bron wanting an All-Star  player over a youngun. Love though was always gonna be a defensive liability and Lebron's Heliocentric style and Irving's icocentric play meant most all star players available to them would have been a bad fit.   Watching Wiggins improvement on D last season,makes me think in a good environment with Lebron as a rookie he could have been the kind of swiss army knife D player for Miami that Bosh was"
It’s really not that big a difference he put up the same ppg as Bosh and more rebounds per year. Both took huge drops in their ppg in order to win a chip. Kevin love is more apparent because he is probably a better player than Chris Bosh. That team was more a big three than the heat teams.
"You’d be going up against a better lebron, kyrie, and Kevin love with an all time offense"
Kevin Love is one of the most overrated players
Fat Kevin love&gt;&gt;&gt;in shape Kevin love
Bro the Cavs were winning the East regardless. They had still in peak form LeBron. He got injured in the first round in 2015 &amp; missed the whole playoff &amp; LeBron with a screwed up back still drug them to the Finals with even Kyrie missing playoff games. Idc about stats if you’re not producing wins. The NBA is the only team sport where one player’s impact can impact winning &amp; Kevin Love never did.
Kevin Love will play at least 18 minutes (total) this season.
"So 15-20 rebounds a game 'might as well not be on the court'..what a clueless take.  Kevin Love was easily a top 15 player in his prime on the T'Wolves.  He dropped about 25 pounds joining the Cavs, which took away a decent amount of his post scoring ability, but he was still a very good stretch 4, a great rebounder, and probably the best outlet passer in the game, which is pretty helpful on a team with LeBron and Kyrie.  Yes, he could be picked on defensively, but so what?  Team went to 4 straight finals and he was absolutely a big part of it, period."
They might have won if Kyrie was healthy. Kevin Love is a non-factor against the Warriors.
And people say Curry wasn't  playing through a grade 1 MCL sprain mid playoffs😂 The next Finals  a healthy Curry barbecue chicken'd Kevin Love in ISO multiple times
"Sorta, but this massively undersells Kevin Love. Kevin Love can be a leading scorer far more often I’d say primarily because at his prime he’d absolutely dominate a mismatch in the post. Lauri doesn’t dominate mismatches, and prefers catch and shoot even against smaller players from what I’ve seen."
Crazy….Kevin Love Lebron and Kyrie combined for 84.
"It's hilarious how many people here think Ben Simmons is worth anything.  His contract is negative value, almost as bad as the Kevin Love contract.  Ben being paid $35M/yr was based on him being young and expectations to improve each year.  Ben Simmons if anything has regressed, and seems to have little motivation to improve or provide leadership.  The Sixers are going to have to provide Simmons AND other players and/or picks just to unload him."
"which is why i think he’ll call the cavs bluff, i really don’t think the FO wants kevin love to be in the rotation over the youngins"
We'll give them Kevin Love straight up
"""We'll give ya Kevin Love and you'll like it!"""
"Lakers should just wait and see if the Cavs buy out Kevin Love, you do not need DJ who can’t even catch lobs at a consistent rate"
"Yes, she is about to get sent home and finish out her contract like her name is Kevin Love"
"Him, Sidney Crosby, Andrew Luck, and Bryce Harper were all hailed as the wonder kids future GOATs. And he's the only one to stay healthy and maximize his potential.   Sidney Crosby also did a fantastic job living up to his hype as the next one but obviously the concussions sucked. Bryce is fine. But he didn't meet his expectations to the likes of LeBron and Sidney Crosby.   But like I think Lebron's the first athlete who kinda controlled his career and his legacy. Shouts out to the Big O for introducing free agency. Like often we are left wondering what a players career could have been had he been surrounded by talent. How good could Andrew Luck have been had he had better O-line protection. How good could Aaron Rodgers have been had the Packers drafted WRs in the first round instead say a QB. How good could John Elway have been had he had a run game all his career.   LeBron was like ""oh you are not going to get good players in the primes and just get big names past their prime.....alright bet"" and then went out and pulled in Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Then came back and forced the Cavs to correctly trade for Kevin Love even with Andrew Wiggins going to Minnesota.   Lakers and Heat are the only teams who actually set up LeBron to succeed. Cavs didn't do it till LeBron forced them to.   And then dude had a inner circle coming into the league who he lifted to great lengths.   Granted Klutch Sports Group fucked over a bunch of players and I hope Nerlens Noel gets at least $40-50 mil in compensation."
"Bonus drama points to him for being teammates with the following players before: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and even Shaq.  &amp;nbsp;  Having an opinion as an ex-teammate of LeBron James itself will get clicks. But along with that he's also a teammate of all the guys above and a lot of them either had beef with others there or have fanbases that have had rivalries/beefs with one of the other fanbases. Examples: LBJ fans vs KD fans, LBJ vs Kyrie, KD and his fans vs WB and his fans, Harden fans vs Westbrook fans, LeBron and his fans vs Celtics and their fans, LeBron and Ray Allen vs Celtics, LeBron vs Pierce, Ray Allen vs Rondo, etc.   &amp;nbsp;  There's plenty more headlines and drama I haven't even listed yet but Kendrick brands himself as someone who can provide unique, locker room insight, so it gets more juicy for drama lovers (especially when he's forced to pick a side)"
Fat Kevin Love and Fat Melo with Lebron would probably be unstoppable.
He dunked all over Kevin Love in the NCAA tournament. I hate that he couldn’t stick in the league for very long. His name is Supreme Bey now
"Bron was able to team up with d. Wade and Bosh. He also got to recruit A. D.. Kevin Love is the only star talent outside of that and Love has always been injured or underperformed. Shaq must be mentioned too. But by the time Shaq reached Cleveland he was also on a downslope.  Kawhi played with a DYNASTY so he didn’t need to recruit. He then forced his way to play with Toronto, which was an amazing choice for him. He then recruited PG13, who is probably better than everyone not argued AD. D Wade was hobbled by the time the Heatles formed so I take PG.  Kobe was able to force pickups of Gasol, Dwight, SHAQ, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone.   KD was able to join maybe one of the best teams we’ve ever seen. He then was able to recruit Kyrie, James Harden, Blake Griffin, and Lamarcus Aldridge.  Bron has done nothing unprecedented with his recruiting. No “elite talent” wanted to go to Cleveland. If Bron played with the talent/fits that Kobe and KD have then he’d have more rings."
I gotta wonder how they come up with those percentages. How on earth does Kevin Love have a 73.5% chance to get in the HOF according to basketball reference? Makes me question the validity of their system.
"I mean Griffin gave up 13 million and only made a couple of millions from the nets.  I know Kemba made most of it back, but we dont know what kinda money Jordan or Kevin Love is being offered"
"I don’t know if you’re kidding here again. They take the buyout because a lot of the time they don’t give up too much money. What they do give up is often just the amount their new team is paying them so these guys aren’t giving up anything in some of these cases. Otherwise, they’re at least making up for some of the loss as Kemba did.   You’re also talking about veteran players who used to be stars. They’ve already made a ton of money so giving up some of it for a chance to play and contend isn’t that big of a deal.   I haven’t seen more reporting on it, but if Kevin Love still wants to play basketball and the Cavs we’re willing to allow him to keep almost all of his money, I’m sure he’s the buyout. That’s the key. He obviously doesn’t want to be on the Cavs. He’s not against a buyout, he’s against giving up a significant amount of his money. If they find a number which is closer to his liking he’s gone."
"DeMarcus Cousins and Paul Millsap are still out there as free agents. Also Kevin Love could be bought out at any moment, so the Lakers can easily have 10+ career All-Stars if they wanted.  The Lakers gotta catch 'em all!"
Can we get a 4? Paul Millsap or Kevin Love?
"I mean not really, they get more cap flexibility to build a team around the supermax guy and the problem we are trying to solve is keeping supermax players on their original team and this makes this easier. We aren't trying to solve the Kevin Love stuck with a terrible contract situation, buyouts exist for that. Also since the cap hit is less those albatross contracts are less bad on the competitive balance side even if owners pocket books aren't happy."
I mean it isn't quite to the same level but that is basically what the cavs are dealing with in Kevin Love. You either buy him out or you just deal with it. Unfortunately there is no perfect solution here. At least with this provision it makes players leaving much harder on the player which should help smaller markets retain their superstars which was the stated intention of the supermax.
Vince no more dunking  Andrea Bargnani  Hedo Turkoglu  .....  .....  .....  Demar getting robbed at the dunk contest  Coin toss Ross  Getting blocked by Paul Pierce  CJ on Kevin Love
"I mean I was kidding about the contender part, but why take buyout if you dont have to? Do what Kevin Love does and get all your money"

"Somewhat related to meeting an NBA player, I met Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) from Entourage while he and his family were vacationing at the beach I used to work at. He was with his in-laws and had just had a baby, so he was kinda pumped to have a young guy to chat with for a bit, especially after I told him that meeting him had made my day. I’m Canadian and had played against RJ Barrett when I was younger, so we talked about how RJ was gonna fit on the Knicks and whether the porzingus trade was a good call. We then started talking about the Raptors and how pumped I was that they had won it all. Turtle said his player comp was Fred VanVleet and he loved watching him cook in the playoffs. I told him my player comp would probably be Kevin Love because I’m a relatively unathletic  white guy who can crash the boards hard, bang down low, and shoot well. Turtle roasted me for saying Kevin love is my player comp and after that, he got stuck on dad duty, so we didn’t talk any further."
"PG: Ben Simmons.   SG:  Pat Bev.   SF: PG.   PF: Kevin Love.   C: Kendrick Perkins.   Reserves: Paul Pierce, Kwame Brown, Kyrie Irving, LeMeme, Scottie Pippen, J.R. Smith, Kristaps Porzingis"
"Jordan Farmar, Kevin Durant, and Jamal Crawford were really cool from my experience. A lot of these guys are super down to earth or don't even realize their fame. Gotta love kind superstar athletes"
"Giannis: Gianstrosity  Charles Barkley: Championship chuck and why I’m not  Shaq: Myths and Tales of the Coats  Ernie Johnson: Orville Redenbacher, Colonel Sanders and why the NBA was my third option  Rich Paul: Green and how easy it is to be if you’ve got it  Lebron: What I manage in general terms, sorry China  Draymond: Stuffing the box score with a High IQ  Kevin Love: Overpaid, Overrated and all that’s relative  Pop: What do you want?  Isaiah Thomas: Fame Piss-toned away after playing   Marvin Bagley: Quit spinning me around like a record"
Who wins a foot race? Kevin Love or Marc Gasol?
"He and Kevin Love donated a bunch of money to the athletic department to help fund the basketball facility, so the practice court was named after Westbrook and the weight room was named after Love."
"Yep. Nobody wanted Blake Griffin or Andre Drummond at $35 million per year. The proof is they were put on waivers after being bought out and anyone willing and able to pay that could have just grabbed them. But people were willing to get them for just the minimum. If you make it so people getting them have to pay their full salary, then nobody will want them, so they won't agree to be bought out. Which situation is better: what OKC did with Kemba or what is going on in Cleveland with Kevin Love? Cause what everyone is proposing here will just ensure that we end up with a bunch of Kevin Love situations on teams all over the league."
"As a Pistons fan would Detroit be better off if Blake Griffin was still there this year finishing out his max contract? Because all this stuff you guys are talking about would basically make it so players like him would never agree to a buyout as there would be no market for them once bought out. They'd all end up like Kevin Love, just taking a huge salary, not really contributing, but still having to be managed by the coaching staff because he's still on the team."
I didn’t know Kevin Love was on the Nuggets
Plan D) Get Kevin Love
"Kevin Love. That might be remedied soon here but yolo, I’ll throw it out here."
"&gt;I know it from following the team and reading reports over the years?  What reports? Show me the reports criticising his rehab approach?   &gt;mean just last month the Olympic team criticized his lack of readiness, being out of shape,  Colangelo said he wasnt in basketball shape...that could be for a multitude of reasons the most likely being he is coming off an injury layoff. Colangelo didnt criticize his rehab approach...youre making that up!  Dont make vague statements...I want you to cite actual reports from trusted sources stating Kevin Love hasnt taken his rehab seriously."
"The most fun one I can think of is Kevin Love's uncle is Mike Love from The Beach boys, yeah he really is from THAT Love family lol"
"I remember when I used to watch Kevin Love during the Lebron Cavs era, I always wondered if he was the most blocked player in the league?"
"Who tf gives a shit about Kevin Love lol, the guy barely even healthy enough to make it on the court  They'll probably just start Lauri/Jarrett with Mobley coming off the bench. They already traded Nance who was one of their better bigs last season"
"The Pacers GM nixed PG to the Cavs at the last second lmao it wasnt a rumor. The meme trade wasn’t about PG, they were getting rid of Kevin Love and others"
"I mean. Kevin love seems like a broken man with no motivation. He’s lost the love for the game. You wanna go so deep into your craft that you become a mad man. At that level, that’s what it takes. He needs to change his surroundings. Dude can still ball. But the question is, DOES he still want to."
I see the resemblance with Kevin Love.
"Paying Kobe was about letting a franchise icon stay with the team he'd been with his whole career. I totally get feeling like it was too much money or that it was counterproductive to trying to tank or win, but it was apparently something Jeanie Buss insisted on as payback for everything Kobe had meant to the Lakers and their fans.   I don't think the Kevin Love contract is in that same category, but if you do then all I can say is to cherish these final years of Love's career and time in Cleveland. Hopefully he'll give you faithful Cavs fans a send-off like the one Kobe gave us Laker fans in his last game."
"I don’t actually want Kevin Love, same for many Lakers fans. Our D is going to be atrocious enough.  If he’s bought out, I suspect Brooklyn is his destination given that’s where he lives."
"I don't think anyone has Kevin Love in their top 10 players of all time lists. Not many players have a ""legacy"" in the NBA. He'll be remembered as an all-star who won a championship with LeBron."
"Big long, athletic and Kevin love"
Kevin Love
Kevin Love  Klay Thompson also spent some time here but I’d pick Love since he lived in Portland longer
Damon Stoudimire or Kevin love
"Trying to be as sensitive as possible here, but is it wrong to point out that Kevin Love seems to be at the tail end of his career? He hasn't done much at all since his last signing."
"History isnt going to remember Kevin love if this how he goes out. Just like the short list of stars from 20 years ago, Love will not be on it 20 years from now."
"Kevin Love scores 100 points, but injures his hand 3 minutes in, plummeting his efficiency to unbearably low numbers."
"You're right and I was going to change my post and I think I need to about the ring I know he has one and I just haven't gotten around to it and that's good that he has one, listen you sound like I don't like the guy I like that guy so much I wanted him to come to the heat for so many years but when I read that somebody it doesn't matter who it is won't give up a little for what can be a lot and it's not like he needs the money so why not just give up a little bit to go to a team that wants him and that he would want to be on because I'm sure he doesn't want to play for Cleveland and nothing is wrong Cleveland I've worked there many times and my girlfriend lives up in Ohio and I'm there all the time so don't go off on me if you're from Cleveland or Ohio I love Cincinnati so anyways I'm a Kevin Love fan."
"As I was reading the part calling out the current players, I kept waiting to see what he would say about Kevin Love..."
"&gt;15 years from now people will look back on the conversations that are had around here every day in horror at how bigoted much of what gets said is.  I think we'll realize that closet ""progressive people"" on this sub used their ""well if I shit on Americans I can still support the foreign white person with coded language, and remain ""progressive"""" paradigm over and over again.  To wit - we all *know* you shouldn't be saying Kevin Love is more ""classy"" than Kyrie Irving (if you believe that).  But it's totally fine to say Jokic is, because, European White."
Kevin Love and the Thievius Raccoonus
idk.. because the 2016 cavs were a top 10 defense along with a top 3 offense which would have been higher if Kyrie wasn't injured  they were probably a 62ish win team if Kyrie doesn't miss like 30 games   and just offensively they were really as deadly as 2017 tbh   vs detroit - 120 offensive rating   vs hawks - 120 offensive rating   vs raptors - 119 offensive rating   vs warriors with kevin love concussed - 110 offensive rating (which would have been top 6
Are you kidding? Kevin Love has been slandered everywhere for years.
"Kevin Love's uncle is Mike Love, fr?"
Kevin Love is a simulation
Kevin love might be desperate to play with his nutsack on the sideline for 60mil. But he hasn’t shown that he’s desperate to play basketball that’s for fucking sure.
Kevin Love gave Lebron depression
Wiggins and Jordan Poole about to walk all over Kyrie and Kevin Love guaranteed
Kevin love to the Nets
"You can't make it in the nba if you aren't ultra competitive and lack thick skin. The business encourages players to be that way because if you don't win then you're cut for the next man up. Some dudes are just better at hiding their asshole tendencies from the media. Kevin Garnett was a notorious asshole but he doesn't get the same flack as kobe because he wasn't as much of a media whore. Lebron James had his ""fit in not fit out"" tweet about kevin love and is notoriously difficult to play with due to the championship expectations he puts on his teammates."
Kevin doesn't Love Cavs that much.
Kevin Love has been injured since 2016
Lol Kevin love? Overrated? Don’t people gotta talk about you for you to be overrated?
"It would be 7.5 million.   again, that's making the assumption that the cavs would buy him out for that little and that kevin love would be open to losing that money. Both assumptions that woj has said are incorrect"
"Tbf, the optics of an NBA drafting kids out of college would look pretty bad if it were introduced today.    And I don't think they'd refuse to play. It's more buyouts would stop being so frequent because suddenly it's only worthwhile if you like the team who has the most money or if you're on a ""anywhere would be better"" type team.   LaMarcus Aldridge probably wouldn't have taken a buyout from San Antonio last season but Kevin Love probably still would get bought out by Cleveland this offseason."
"Seriously, he’s always been a double double machine and his stats in his prime in Minneapolis are 2k level ridiculous. He wasn’t “carried” in Cleveland, he dialed back and filled his role on that team admirably. Kevin Love was a hell of a good player who got asked to go toe to to with guys bigger than him and more than held his own."
"Kevin love is a champion, he doesn't need to prove anything by being a bench player for a second one, someone will pay him something and if not yes he can live in California and play for one of those four teams."
never forget kevin love locked down steph curry beyond the 3 point line on the biggest possessions of both of their careers
