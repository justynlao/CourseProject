Here is a table of the players that I think are genuine contenders for an All-Star spot in the East front court, with the players I deem to current be a lock bolded.

Well you can combine offensive an defensive RAPTOR to get total RAPTOR. Lillard has a total RAPTOR of 3.2 between Royce O’Neale and Julius Randle for 17th among players with at least 600 minutes.
Julius randle below kemba walker is an absolute travesty
I came here to look for Julius Randle
"Tbf they did draft quality players. DLo and Ingram are all stars, Julius Randle is a potential all star this year, Kuzma and Clarkson are bonafide scorers off the bench, and Nance, Lonzo, and Hart are great role players. You can't say the same for most teams in that 6 year span regardless of draft position. Phoenix has had the same span of being shit and look who they drafted."

Hahaha Julius Randle but I love the creativity
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
Malcolm Brogdon - yes  -   &gt; Especially when there are other players PUTTING UP BETTER STATS WITH WINNING RECORDS.  Gordon Hayward and Julius Randle are both on teams with losing records
I’ll look like a genius when the Knicks win a play in to get 7th seed and upset Brooklyn in round 1 on a Julius Randle 3 at the buzzer in game 7.
I’m absolutely done with Julius Randle
Julius Randle with hops
Julius randle is a 10x better passer and a better defender too
He’s a more explosive Julius Randle
Julius Randle with hops
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).

"but IQ, RJ and Julius Randle are only 5 miles away from them."
What if I replace John Collins with Julius Randle
So basically a 3 team trade involving Julius Randle and Kelly Oubre.
Julius Randle probably   A bunch of players on the timberwolves including kat
Doing my part by voting for Julius Randle to be an all-star
Julius Randle looks like an All-Star honestly
The logic is of course we're rooting for you to fail when we own your pick.  KP playing like shit is just a bonus.  Again.  You have a worse record than a team whose best player is Julius Randle despite Luka only missing one game.  Congrats.
"Ah, I see. So your entire argument is based on your hate for KP, and not logic. Okay. Well, enjoy your terrible failing franchise with near 0 future and your SUPERSTAR Julius Randle."
"Damn, Thats nice of him calling Julius Randle a top 5 player"
Bragging about how the Knicks best player is Julius Randle while having a worse record with Luka Doncic is a key symptom of copium overdose.
Same Julius Randle that’s about to be an All-Star and is playing better than Kristaps Porzingis right now?
Why are Knicks fans so cocky? Your best player is Julius Randle
Shades of 19/20 Julius Randle
"If you really have nothing currently worth building around(highend star potential), you definitely go for longshots with later picks. Higher ceiling is much more important than higher floor or median outcome. If like denver and milwaukee got a julius randle instead of jokic or giannis no one would care about them."
He’s just behind Allstar Julius Randle
"I think fans have very litte tolerance for risks from their GM, and they see draft picks as having extremely high reward/no risk because of the smaller contract size. Imo, most fans on this sub would rather draft pokusevski than sign last year's Julius randle to a 20M deal. I think part of it is that most fans don't trust their teams to re-sign free agents since most fans aren't lakers fans lol. Also, i think when it comes to the regular season, fans on here would rather lose games with analytics darlings (i.e. longbois, anti-midrange 3pt specialists) than win regular season games the old school way (i.e. post players, inefficient high volume scorers)"
julius randle might be better than lebron james

"The NBA’s rookie rules are so dumb, if you apply baseball or hockey rookie rules to basketball (basically both require that a player can’t have more than ~1/4 of big league experience from the previous season, though it’s def more complicated than that), Keldon should 100% be considered a rookie this season.   You’re telling me that Julius Randle, who got injured in his first 12 minutes of game time and missed the rest of his first year, isn’t a rookie anymore but Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons are? Some whack ass shit."
"I mean. We got cap space from the deal, which we used to get Marcus Morris and Julius randle. Randle is our best player. Marchs morris on the other hand, is gone but he was traded. For what? A first round pick. We used that pick to get immanuel quickley, who right now looks awesome for us. We still have their first this year which is unprotected, so say that shoots up in the lottery, the Knicks would then have gotten randle, quickley, and whatever the two firsts are for a guy that mavs fans can’t stand right now."
"And 25 PPG. Him and Julius Randle gotta be the MIP frontrunners, no?"

Julius Randle YERRRRRRR
Talking about Julius Randle
"Yeah, towards the end of games he gets iced out more and they dont run many plays for him. At the end of games if elf and Julius Randle are in the game they play 2v5"
Looks at the Knicks and what Julius Randle is doing. You telling me the knicks are leaps better roster wise than the wizards?
And Julius Randle 😰
Not enough Julius randle for me
Julius Randle has an outside chance imo
I'd add Julius Randle to that list
Julius Randle is an all star and I'm tired of people pretending that he isn't! Love the list!
"I just really love that the Knicks can suddenly play defense the minute they hire Thibs. That and suddenly Julius Randle looks like a max guy...  If they'd been smart enough to draft Vassell or Haliburton, they'd be like the 6-seed right now."
"LaVine still doesn’t get some of the respect he deserves. And unpopular opinion but, Julius Randle too. Dude has been balling out, but it’s never talked about too much."
They ain't ready for prime Julius Randle
"I mean I don’t know shit abt mike Scott, but its not impossible for the wizards to turn someone’s career around lmao. Julius randle just turned his career around on the fckin knicks"
"Yea, I remember the Lakers trying to put Julius Randle on him lol. He was so helpless. I love how locked in he is this season."
"i think sometimes it is hard to adjust your opinion about a player, but i have to do it in  **Julius Randle** case.  He improved a lot and it's not simply good stats on a bad team. Also because the Knicks so far this season are not a bad team."
Julius Randle is playing 37 MPG. Booker is playing 35 MPG.
Julius Randle and RJ Barrett on the other hand...
"If you asked Thibs to design a player in a lab, I bet he would come up with Julius Randle."
Yo didn't crowning Julius Randle an MVP candidate after 2 weeks teach Knicks fans about making definitive statements this early in the season?
"Julius Randle. Obviously lol Knicks but he isn’t a black hole as much as he used to be, he’s a good team ball player now."
The only tandem that can come close to Jordan and Pippen: Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
"To be real, a lot of his counting stats are because he's playing Thibs ball. 37 minutes a game.  His percentages are atrocious. He's getting there by volume.   Knicks are more about Julius Randle playing out of his mind."
"He seems like one of those guys who people think is gonna blossom or be really good, he doesn't blossom immediately, people forget about him, then a couple years after that he does become good.  Antawn Jamison was like that, hyped up coming out of college, 9 ppg his first year, people forgot about him, then he averaged 25 and 9. Julius Randle too.  Oh, and Tyson Chandler. People thought he'd be a KG or Rasheed Wallace type-star, he struggled for awhile and everybody forgot about him, then he eventually made an All-Star and All-NBA Team and won DPOY."
I'd point to Julius Randle. It's night and day from last year

Julius Randle no cap
You didn't even mention the best nickname on the team; Beyblade aka Julius Randle.
"Thibs is absolutely COTY right now. A huge reason the Knicks scored 40 in the first was the way he schemed against the Warriors zone. He introduced some really nice high post action to the offense that completely nullified the fact our guards cant shoot by getting them some great looks off cuts and screen handoffs from the foul line. Fantastically creative and genuinely beautiful to watch. Warriors had no answer for it and never went back to the zone for the rest of the game.  Knicks O/U was what, 22.5 games, and I was seriously considering taking the under after they struck out in the offseason. They're on what, a 36 win pace (41 in a regular season)? I mean come on how often does that happen? Not to mention everything else! Julius Randle has been revitalized, the defense is top 5 in the league, the young players are all taking steps forward-- there's so many things to attribute to him and his staff that I never thought was even remotely possible coming in to the season.   COTY shit, plain and simple."
"No, I don't think they're locks, I think they'll MAKE IT, but again, we're 15 Games in, and Bam is absolutely better then Julius Randle, if you look past three statistical categories you would know this lol"

"Yeah, being young and lack of experience definitely is an issue in most players on the Defensive end coming into the league because NBA defense is so much more about knowing the nuances and staying consistently disciplined. But regardless he should be better than this. Honestly those jokes about him just being a more athletic Julius Randle are true right now because just like Randle he doesn’t contribute on the Defensive end and as a big man that’s the side that’s most impactful"
Julius Randle FMVP incoming
Julius Randle may compete for that tho
"&gt; John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.    We won't be able to S&amp;T for John Collins because we're going to be way too close to the apron to execute the deal. Right now we have something like $10 million under the projected apron with 11 guys on the roster.    As far as the rest of those guys go, I'm not sure any of those guys put us over the top either, so going by that standard those trades don't really do much for us. Not to mention why would someone like Randle be available?   &gt; the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.   I mean the Celtics would have Smart, Barnes, Timelord, Pritchard, whoever was left between Romeo/Langford, and after the draft probably our full cadre of picks. That's not all that far off what the basis was to put together a similar deal to what the Nets put together for Harden.    It's all dependent on what the Kings asking price is for Barnes, but barring something completely unreasonable he could very easily be a nice incremental upgrade for the team."
"After this season, the Celtics won't be hard-capped anymore so they can use the full amount of the TPE, so it does grant them a bit more flexibility.  Players I'd target in the summer that might not be available now and that I'd like to have instead of Barnes:  John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.  Using the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.  Also Harden really only wanted to go to Brooklyn so the bidding was limited, there's no guarantee that the next star player that demands a trade says ""Boston or bust"" (hasn't happened yet so seems unlikely.   The Kings are going to ask for multiple picks for Barnes, they want to compete this year and it's a ""he's worth more to us than he is to you"" scenario."
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"

Why is Julius Randle singing
Brah when I first saw I was like “why tf did Julius Randle switch to street clothes”
Julius Randle just getting cardio.
Why does Julius Randle look older than his dad?
enes kanter at home watching julius randle and julius randle with hops in the ASG
Yeah Julius Randle
"JULIUS RANDLE GOT A DUNK, I WANT TO CUM"
Julius Randle
Julius Randle looking like Mr. Eko from lost out here lol
I'm just saying Julius Randle wouldn't miss that many dunks...
Julius Randle... duh
Do Knick fans still hate Julius Randle?
Julius Randle vs Jokic lol
Julius randle is 26?
"I remember a post titled something along the lines of “What would be the dream outcome for your team” and a Knicks fan responded like win a championship, and a few more things and then Julius Randle being an all star.  In reply to them I said “all that is somewhat  realistic but Julius is not gonna be no all star.”   I stand corrected."
I love Julius Randle
Julius Randle deserves apologies from Knicks fans as well lmao.
"I cant believe 10 time NBA champion, first ballot hof, former mayor, and now governor of New York Julius Randle played for the Knicks."
"&gt;I’m damn proud to be a Knick        - Julius Randle, all-star"
It took Zach lavine and Julius Randle 7yrs to become an all-star. Kawhi became one in his 5th season. You can't write each one of them off because not every player is placed in a good situation after getting drafted. Not every one of them gets adequate amount of time or resources to develop themselves into a better player.   Some might be busts and you can see that right away but saying timberwolves and warriors will regret not picking lamelo is dumb.
"everytime i see julius randle-in game, post-game, interviews, whatever-he just seems like the nicest guy in the legue lol. loving watching his rise"
From “Dubious Handles” and public enemy number one in NYC to All-Star Julius Randle getting MVP chants in the Garden in less than a year is *incredible.*  My man!
"As an RJ Barrett guy, I’ll admit that I shat a lot on Randle last year. He seemed like he was only in it for him and him and Payton were always freezing RJ out when he got going.   I’ll admit now I was wrong about Julius. He needed time to  adjust to his role and learn his new teammate’s habits. He’s been just excellent this year and the passing has unlocked a whole new level for that Knicks team.   I’m glad to see he could take the time to adjust his game for the betterment of his team. That makes him a true leader."
Julius Randle?
You could say Julius Randle because of his impact. But Grant kills him in statistical improvements. Julius pretty much has the same stats the past 3 years but he's just smarter and shooting over 40% from 3 now
"Julius Randle   (No I don't want to trade him, just curious)"
"I'll throw out a few names. C. Wood if he comes back and plays like he did pre-injury. Terry Rozier at least in the convo imo. Maybe Julius Randle. Mikal Bridges if defense was valued as much as offense though his offense has also improved. Lonzo because free throws and more threes? Chris Boucher? Trent Jr? Richaun Holmes? Long way of saying no, right now Grant seems like a lock."
Julius “The Franchise” Randle
Julius fucking Randle
"I don't think I've ever had a 180 on a player like I have with Julius Randle. Going into this season I would've been happy trading him for a late first and a bag of lays, now I don't want to see him on any other team for the rest of his career."
"I hate when they compare players by what they look like.  Paschall doesn’t play at all like Draymond.  It’s like when they were saying Julius Randle was Zach Randolph except he played in transition, had abs, and dunked a lot"
A buddy of mine referred to Julius randle as a “future former Knick” the other day and it killed me
As long as their fans can settle down... .500 and acting like Julius Randle is better than a prime Chris Bosh
not surprised that its always eastern teams thinking we shoulda taken simmons lmfaooo. incompetent team building has really taken a toll on yall huh?  just cuz yall can fall ass backwards into the playoffs with julius fucking randle as your best player doesnt mean we get to do that lolol. we gotta actually build a proper roster
Julius Randle.
Advances defensive statistics are notoriously unreliable. Julius Randle and Victor Oladipo are both in the top 10 in defensive win shares for example.
Not sure if I’m exaggerating but Julius Randle is literally the greatest basketball player the world has ever seen.

"Ah yes, famed white hoopers Chris Paul and Julius Randle"
"Hopefully it will get uploaded somewhere. Basically an NBA writer or podcaster or radio guy posted a tweet last week asking if people would rather have Chris Bosh or Julius Randle (paraphrased), and the trio rightfully defended Chris Bosh as being the better player and saying that such a comparison was not only disrespectful to Bosh, but also Randle."
"It's not everyday that an old, down on their luck, small market team like the Spurs beat a big market juggernaut like the Julius Randle Knicks."
it means luka guard julius randle well
"This season?   Nicolas Batum. Dude always sinks open threes when i take a quick look at Clippers games.   Julius Randle. He was doing LeBron stuff when i tuned into the last Bulls-Knicks game.  Edit:  Also Dame. Everytime i watch Dame, he does ridiculous Frobe stuff + Curry stuff."
Chris Paul and Julius Randle must have changed since I last saw them
Spurs bench is a top scoring bench. You want Frank to run the second unit against them? At least here there's always Julius Randle.
Of course it makes sense to put Julius Randle and Robert Covington in the skills contest. /s
Can they work together?  u/nyknicks get:  Kelly Olynyk  Precious Achiuwa  2022 - RD 2from Heat  2027 - RD 2from Heat  2027 - RD 1from Heat  u/MiamiHEAT get:  Julius Randle  Bradley Beal  u/WashWizards get:  Andre Iguodala  Meyers Leonard  2022 - RD 1from Heat  2024 - RD 1from Heat  https://tradenba.com/trades/sCFOb0H-3
Julius Randle having a decent season too /s
"In Fizdale's first season, in 18/19, the roster of the MY Knicks was pretty shite. Kevin Knox, Dotson, Vonleh and Mudiay played the most minutes. Ok, you also hat Tim Hardaway Jr with a massive 38% from the field. After that you had Trier, Mitchell Robinson and Hezonja. Knox, Vonleh, Mudiay, Trier and Hezonja are out of the league. It was the rookie season of Knox and Robinson.   That team was garbage.    19/20 was a better team, yes, but Julius Randle has made a big big step forward. All his stats improved while shouldering more responsibility and he is rightfully an allstar.  Barett is in his second year and has improved across the board.   It also helps that Thibs knows defense in a regular season with less rest."
"Cuz everyone knows Julius Randle is the mvp, but nobody wants to admit it."
I like to think what could have been with the young lakers team. Julius Randle and Ingram are looking awesome. I would of course take Lebron and Anthony Davis but they had a ton of pieces. Now I’m looking at the baby bulls and wondering if they can be something down the road. I don’t know if Lavine will be patient enough to stick around but it feels like teams aren’t given time to grow. Coaches are randomly fired and players traded or given up on and it just seems so many teams are constantly tearing it down then hoping to get lucky with a quick rebuild.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"It always seemed like an exaggeration as a terrible contract, but this sub just didn't give MJ the benefit of the doubt.   Lots of moderate contracts like this can be a great deal if the player expands their game a moderate amount. Similar to jerami grant, julius randle who are also on ~20m/year deals"
What the hell is Julius Randle doing then? Without him we would be bottom 3.
...bucks have no answer for Julius Randle. See you in the finals Lakers. Just kidding.
"Yeah, Bam is better than Julius Randle too, that’s a good point"
"I think if you choose Lavine, Julius Randle, Vucevic, over  Dame, Paul George, Harden then that's probably a bad choice"
"Only 4 players in the league average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists a game:   Nikola Jokic (All-Star)  Giannis Antetokounmpo (All-Star)  Julius Randle (All-Star)  Domantas Sabonis (All-Star)"
He’s what Julius Randle wished he could be
Portis is particularly annoyed because Julius Randle got the poor man's Zion skill set and Portis to stuck with the homeless man's version.
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."

"bro Fox literally started it. came for us for 0 reason.   if Julius Randle made fun of you last season for picking 13 you’d be the exact same way, especially since Hali is balling. so shut yo ass up"
Rose has played fine and the cap space that we got by trading the fraud was turned into Julius Randle and Marcus Morris who was traded for Immanuel Quickley. So we got a better and healthier player than Porzinjured and a top 3 rookie. Not to mention the incoming lottery pick (you’re not making the West playoffs) in the new system where teams at the end of lottery have moved up very far multiple times already.  #THE KNICKS WERE RIGHT
If this were to somehow hold up I’m gonna be the most annoying person alive. 2 young all stars with Brad Stevens coaching and Tommy Thibs kicks the door in and schemes Julius Randle and friends to a playoff spot over them. Please happen.  #FUCK THE BOSTON SMALL-DICKS
"If the Knicks become a top four seed, does Julius randle have an mvp case?"
1. Lebron and Draymond are there owm topic that was not being discussed in the thread. You brought them up in a weak whataboutism attempt. We are discussing Zion and Julius  2. There is a whole new video out making its rounds about how New Orleans is doing just what you talk about. Putting Zion in PnR/primary ball handler spots. He still isn't posting the passing numbers in that time frame that Randle has.  3. You're allowing what you think zion will be cloud your judgement on to what we were talking about. And that is who is currently the better passer. I don't care to discuss who will be the better passer a few years from now because the OPs question and the comment in the thread asked about now. So I'm talking now.
Knicks were up 23 and Julius Randle was still playing 3 minutes till end of 4th quarter  Classic Thibs
"trust me, Julius Randle would be an MVP candidate in 2070s basketball"
"infamous coach killa julius randle  call an ambulance, but not for thibs"
Zion is just Julius Randle with hops.
Well shit ig Julius Randle is the front runner now
Julius Randle is my MIP
"You know what I really dislike about Laker fans? Way before I visited this sub I was in an FB group called LakerGang because one of my friends invited me over there and holy shit they really put Laker jerseys on every Free Agent Star they could find. Dirk, Klay, LeBron, Duncan, Wade, Butler, KD you name it. Shit was blasphemous as hell. But of course, they end up unsuccessful and try to play GM or even worse, convince themselves that they drafted a steal. Jordan Clarkson = Russell Westbrook or Julius Randle = mobile Shaq and the worst comparison yet Ryan Kelly = white KD."
"I'm all for firing Danny Ainge, but I think it's absurd that somehow Tatum and Brown are blameless according to green teamers. Their effort levels have been horrific over the past month, which is not acceptable considering they are supposed to be our franchise players.  Inb4 ""but roster bad"", as if other superstars don't deal with bad rosters. LeBron was single-handedly bringing a bunch of bad Cavs teams to the Playoffs and Finals. Kobe Bryant averaged 35 points a game to drag Kwame Brown, Smush Parker, and Chris Mihm to the Playoffs in the Western Conference. Hell, Julius Randle is dragging the Knicks to the same record as the Celtics, but somehow two All-Star players can't be bothered to play because the roster is bad? Get out of here.  There was nothing related to Xs and Os because last night was a disgraceful performance, and accountability has to start from the two All-Star players. I'm tired of hearing those two talk after every game about how they didn't play hard enough, do something about it instead of patting yourselves on the back."
"Simmons, D'Angelo Russell, Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Julius Randle bench mob is still a good squad."
Julius randle
"Lakers could really use Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and Brandon Ingram right about now 👀"
Julius Randle
"Bam ""Pascal ""Julius ""Beyblade"" Randle"" Siakam"" Adebayo"
"The Knicks have been a complete dumpster fire since Melo left. Thibs actually has them playing competitive basketball and has made Julius Randle playing the best basketball of his career. Meanwhile, the Celtics have completely given up on playing defense and lets every shooter has career nights. It's not comparable at all."
Bam over Julius Randle
"I felt like Zion had a really weird path in the NBA in dancing the line b/t overrated and underrated.  He came in and people were salivating over him and yelling chants like ""WE WANT ZION!!!!"" at him, saying he could single-handedly rescue a bunch of franchises then he had his torn menisiscus and folks clamored over to call him fat and ""not as good as Ja!""  He became 'underrated' enough that Spurs fans said, ""Who needs Zion? We have Keldon Johnson,"" NYK fans said, ""RJ and (26 yr old) Julius Randle are BETTER!"" (so did The Ringer) and Paschall and a bunch of others were all said to be ""Just as good as Zion!""  ""HE JUST STANDS IN THE PAINT"" became another take. And then recently a bad news clip circulated of a sports pundit trying to call him a selfish/stats-only player.  He gets a LOT of hate, and also a lot of PR push at the same time."
Julius Randle or theo pinson
"Max contracts don't return value just because someone's an all-star. Julius Randle is also an all-star, does he deserve a max contract?"
Rj Barrett and Julius Randle
He’s not only playing great. He’s shown he’s willing to adapt and grow with the team around him. The passing and vision he has in double teams now is so ahead of anything he has last year. His defense has been consistent and he has been a leader from the start of this season. If this is Julius randle from now on idk who wouldn’t want to build around him
"Picks 1-5: Jokic, Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart"
"&gt;All for it, I'm attached now. It might not be totally rational but when a guy finally breaks out with your team it's hard to shake that ""this is *our guy*"" feeling  Randle is only 25 though while being bounced around a couple teams  He could easily just be blooming a little late. Look at Ingram too when the 2 of them were in LA. Everybody expected too much from them immediately. Julius isn't even in his prime years and could keep making leaps similar to Embiid"

How fucking bad is the East when someone like Julius Randle and two Celtics make it there?
Sex is cool but have you ever seen Julius randle in the all star game???
idk why there are two julius randle in the all star roster
I mean why is Julius Randle an all-star if doing it for wins counts. Hawks are 1.5 games behind the Knicks and have been injured for a good chunk of the season while Trae is putting up better stats.
"Give me one example of a player in the league today who has a similar play style to Karl Malone that is all star caliber. Giannis? No he’s faster, more athletic, better defensively, and a better passer.  Embiid? Joel is much better defensively and can get out to the 3 point line as well. Part of the reason his post ups are effective are because he’s a threat from anywhere.  Julius Randle? Can shoot the three and is also a better passer  Sabonis? Nope, can stretch the floor to shoot the 3... also a better passer  The dudes who are comparable are the Greg Monroe’s and Enes Kanter’s of the world, although Malone was better defensively than both of them.   I’m not saying these guys are better than Malone, because they aren’t, but he’s just not a good enough shooter or passer to be as valuable in today’s game as he was back in his day. It’s a pace and space league and he’s grit and grind. Not to mention that the game has changed in a way that his best asset, his strength, would depreciate."
Julius Randle is winning most improved and I think it'll be decisive
Julius Randle and Leonard Williams
"Yeah, a second-tier 3/4 on a meh contract seems like the thing to do with CJ as the matching salary (because first-tier ones don't move).  Tobias Harris as you said, Hayward if something changes there, Barnes if Sacramento changes their thinking, Thaddues Young. I actually think Julius Randle would be great in Portland. Maybe a Lonzo Ball sign-and-trade?"
"As a Knicks fan, I thank/credit Kobe for giving us the Julius Randle we see this year. Randle talks about his time with Kobe in LA a lot and you could tell by listening to him how much that influenced his work ethic and is probably the reason he’s taken such great strides."
Get to at least Julius Randle level offensively
Pelicans now know how Julius randle son felt
I’m sick of his adjustments man. Dude put Wayne Ellington at power forward to guard Julius Randle. Idek what he’s doing he changes everything every minute
I'll never understand why we don't keep feeding RJ when he's hot like this. He was way more in rhythm than Julius the entire game and still had to get his 29 points on almost half as many shot attempts as Randle.  IMO we win that game if RJ gets 20+ shot attempts and Julius looks to defer when he's missing.

MIP has to go to Julius Randle
Not the most cause I CBA paying for stat head but Julius Randle had 26 herehttps://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201811050OKC.html
What about Lakers’ star Julius Randle?
"Lets be real, Sabonis hasn't won anything. He is not empty stats, but he is definitely overrated.   Julius Randle does the same thing as sabonis, also hasn't won anything.   RJ Barrett will most likely be better than Sabonis."
i remember i got furiously downvoted that summer for saying i thought Horford was a terrible signing and that i wouldve rather had Julius Randle
"Julius Randle is shooting upwards of 40% from three this year, up from under 28% his first full year. Aside from this, I agree. Jimmy Butler is highly effective despite not being a strong 3 point shooter as well. You can be efficient and effective without shooting the 3."
"They won't. People are so dead-set on Tatum and Brown being ""the guys"" that they are refusing to even question them in fear of the Jays leaving in free agency.  The matter of fact is that no two ""All-Stars"" struggle so much to even make the Playoffs. Julius Randle is single-handedly dragging the Knicks to the Playoffs but two ""All-Stars"" with a ""top 5 coach in the league"" is struggling? The logic doesn't add up but green teamers will just plug their ears and scream ""the future is bright!"" until they are red in the face."
Kemba missed over 20 games. Brown has been nursing a knee injury the entire season and clearly isn’t himself. Do you really think Julius Randle is a better player than Jayson Tatum?
"Lebron is 3rd in defensive win shares with 2.6 behind Gobert and Julius Randle. Jokic is 8th with 2.4, so not that far behind. If that's the metric you wanna go with, sure."

Julius Randle
"Realistically Kawhi.   As a Knicks fan, Julius Randle"
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"
"If you let me train Michael Jordan for three months than he, today, can beat Julius Randle"
Julius Randle wants to know your location.
julius randle is better than patrick ewing
"The league is STACKED with talent in a way I don't think we've seen in our lifetime. The amount of talent that exists on each team is incredible. There's only a few teams I can think of that don't have a true star in any sense. Cleveland, Sacramento, Houston, OKC, Orlando, Detroit. There are players on every other team that look like they could be an MVP if they had more wins. Lavine on the Bulls is fantastic. Julius Randle is fantastic. Zion is ridiculous. It's been a fun few years in the league for sure."
"he will be insanely overexposed because he plays in new york, he started slow, give it a couple of years and you'll be sick of hearing his name  same thing happened with julius randle. knicks fans on twitter were asking if he was better than chris bosh"
"43% from 3 and very good defense on guys like Julius Randle. His stats are dragged down by how bad he was coming back from Covid, but he’s been a very good role player recently"
Julius Randle's Players Tribune article mentions his son complaining about a foul no-call when playing his dad on a plastic hoop in the living room. Randle said it inspired him to play harder and complain less (iirc). Kid takes it seriously. Probably gonna be drafted by OKC soon. Cute af though

Good defense but overrated in terms of shooting luck and mediocre offense propped up by a surprisingly great bench and out of nowhere season by Julius Randle
Still think going to Julius Randle at the end of the game is the best option? lol. Another heartbreaking loss
Thibs won't stop till he finishes the job on Julius Randle
"TIL Gladly = Thank God.  &gt;“We told Jaden [McDaniels] try not to let [Julius] Randle catch the ball, we’re gonna make somebody else beat us,” Edwards said. “Gladly, R.J. Barrett caught it, and if he would’ve made the shot we would’ve lived with it. I mean, because that’s who we wanted taking the shot. We didn’t want anybody else taking it.”  You should know the meanings of words before you use them."
"That’s not an argument. Who’s more efficient between RJ and Ant? It’s RJ, both on splits, true shooting, and eFG. RJ is also a better playmaker, defender, and rebounder. Ant may be the better scorer, but he’s also attempting nearly 21 shots per game at a usage rate o 31% in the last 15 games. He has much more opportunity to shine than RJ, who’s playing more meaningful games and has to defer to all-star Julius Randle."
Julius Randle minutes are kinda insane. Give that man some rest.
"Exactly, that should be given to guys who have taken leaps and strides in their game. Jerami Grant from role player to borderline all-star; Christian Wood from barely in the league to top C; Julius Randle from a spinning meme to a walking triple double"
Because Julius Randle and Grant. But agree he should be up there in the top contenders.
Julius Randle
"I'm sure no names like Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are beside themselves that all eyes are on Reggie fucking Bullock and Julius Randle."
Clarkson (6MOTY candidate). D’angelo Russell (all star). Julius Randle (possible 3rd team all nba) Larry Nance (solid role player).

"Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic, One of the boston guys.. Should I continue?"
"Indeed but I’d actually hate losing to the Small Dicks even more since we’re battling for playoff seeding with them, which is absolutely hilarious. We’re almost 3/4s through the season and Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown are looking up in the standings at Tommy Thibodeau, Julius Randle, and Reggie Bullock.   #BUCK FOSTON"
"The issue with the Deng signing was that the Lakers signed him to play small forward when he was only good as a small ball 4 by that point. The Lakers already had Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr. to play PF, and they had just drafted Ingram as the only other 3 on the roster, so the Lakers clearly thought that Deng could play SF while Ingram matured. However, once it became clear to them that Deng could really only play PF, then their choice was to either give him minutes that should be going to Randle and Nance, or play him out of position where he was getting killed on defense and couldn't score.  That's why Deng only played for half a season, then the Lakers simply sat him for the next season and a half before stretching him. $72 million for him to only play a few months because they had no use for him. At least they were able to get rid of Mozgov (and he was making less money). Deng was a worse signing, which is why the Lakers will still be paying him for another year before they're finally done with him."
"Julius Deion Randle (born November 29, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
"&gt;I don't wanna hear about   Maybe stop posting on an online message board if you want to limit what you hear about?  &gt;I don't wanna hear about playing behind mip julius Randle.   That's a stupid thing to say. I don't expect to see a rookie getting significant minutes on this Knicks roster unless he's playing far far better than most rookies play. It sorta seems like you forget he's a rookie? I don't think he looks ""horrible"", I think he looks like an alright rookie."
The Knicks are 3-9 when Julius Randle doesn't braid his hair
"Hes playing 11 minutes for a reason. I don't wanna hear about playing behind mip julius Randle. Knicks play small lineups often, if they could rely on obi hed get minutes. Hes not good. Maybe in the future will be but right now clearly not."
4/2 on 11 minutes behind MIP Julius Randle is horrible?
Oh yeah mfs are just PILING in to see rj Barret and Julius randle.

Julius Randle
"since 2000 Nene, Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, Corey Brewer, Steph Curry, Greg Monroe, Bismack Biyombo, Harrison Barnes, Ben McLemore, Julius Randle, Emmanuel Mudiay, Lauri Markennen, and Coby White have all been picked at 7. Of that group Murray is one of the better players, but ""well above expected value,"" seems like a stretch."
"Interesting question, this could be asking Star players who’re over they’re head, or role players punching above their weight.   I’m going to choose FFV, think he’s better off being a 3rd or 4th option.   Also choosing Julius Randle. I think he needs to be a 1c for the Knicks to make noise in the playoffs. They need their 1a and 1b guy. Best case scenario those guys are quickly and Barrett"
"Harden at 7 too, Kobe 13, Kawhi 15, Dame 6, JULIUS RANDLE 7  &amp;#x200B;  Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennet, Jabari Parker  &amp;#x200B;  I think it's hit and miss"
Yeah but the clippers dont really play a four for him to guard. Nominally batum is probably the four and obviously thats not a terrible matchup for mpj but its not like they have a julius randle type power forward that he can play against
Bam shut down Julius Randle the other night so I wouldn’t put a lot of weight into Wiseman’s performance. He’ll learn from this.
"Jokic's number is surprisingly high. You'd think teams wouldn't double him fewer times because of his passing ability. Same with Julius ""Black Jokic"" Randle."
https://twitter.com/swishcultures_/status/1354440811224641539?lang=en  He's looking like Julius Randle from these highlights. Why couldn't this guy get an NBA deal? The pay in Japan ain't great (low six figures at best)
"Julius Randle is single-handedly dragging the Knicks to the Playoffs.  Two All-Stars with a ""top 5 coach in the league"" can't even stay at .500.  The depth isn't good as before but green teamers who refuse to criticize Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens are living in la-la land."

Julius Randle with hops
Julius Randle with herpes
Julius Randle looked like fucking KD hitting all those iso midrange jumpers.
He is at his best not shooting 3s and just going into attack mode.   Jaden Mcdaniels is the one I think has every other team salivating for though. Made Julius Randle take tough mid rangers in the crunch and even denied him catching the ball which led to a possession where he didn't touch it at all
"If you want to watch a young core develop over the years from being bad to good then how’s the perfect time to be a detroit pistons fan.  We’re ass this year but so far 3/4 of the rookies we’ve drafted have looked solid, and it likely could’ve been 4/4 if one of them didn’t get injured 7 games in.  Jerami Grant looking like the most improved player his first season as a #1 option if the NBA doesn’t randomly say “fuck you” and give it to Julius Randle who’s basically putting up his same numbers from last year.  Hamidou Diallo is likely to breakout here after putting up 19 last game on a minutes restriction and doing solid today too.  Then you can see vets ball out as they try to revitalize their careers here.  Shit we lose a lot, but most our losses are within 2-3possessions. I think are win margin, which we don’t get a lot, is by like 5.5pts.  We’re not a good team right now, but we have some promise.  If you wanna watch a team that’s winning now then watch Portland or Miami. Hard as shit not to love Dame or Jimmy Butler and both teams are fun to watch even without knowing who the rest of their rosters are."
"I mean Simmons did only get one chance to be a rookie since he didn’t play at all his first year. If anything, imo the NBA is too restrictive about what removes rookie eligibility from players—you’re telling me that Julius Randle was no longer a rookie because he got injured less than 20 minutes into his NBA career while Simmons and Griffin were fine because they didn’t step on the court for a year?  Baseball and Hockey have allowances for young players to play X% of the season without losing their rookie eligibility, and I believe that the NBA should follow suit with that line of though, especially as the G-League becomes a more viable minor league."
"Julius "" Melo"" Randle"
I guarantee you that 99% of the shots taken at the baseline near the paint for the Knicks are Julius Randle jumpers. He always goes to that spot and it’s been money for him this season
That NYK left baseline hotspot is most likely all Julius Randle.
"Julius Randle too!  Rondo, David West, Baron Davis, Eric Gordon, J.R. Smith, Austin Rivers, Buddy Hield, David Wesley. (I guess you can throw in J.J. Redick now too.)"
I still can't believe we're talking about Julius Randle and All NBA team in same sentence. Beginning of the season I was ready for him to get out for nothing now he's considered for All NBA and I can almost cry with how happy I am
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
Julius Randle
"Here’s my definition: Championship Team - contenders usually every year whether they have superstars or not  Super Team - 3 superstar level players(not all stars like Julius Randle superstars like KD)  Big Three - 3 all star caliber players such as Westbrook, PG13, and Steven Adams"
"Julius Randle   Lance Stephenson    Aaron and Andrew Harrison     Myck Kabongo   Harry Giles (although, in his case, some scouts did point out he never had played an entire season since middle school)   Jay Williams     Greg Oden"

Great defensive game for Miami. Julius Randle is such a pleasure to watch!! He makes the game look so smooth. Dipo we’re waiting!
If anyone can bring the Knicks back it's that man right there Julius Randle
"Per Knicks: Reggie Bullock and Julius Randle are available for tonight’s game against Miami.  Heat  no Oadipo (illness), Nunn (ankle), Haslem (protocols) or Okpala (protocols)."
Not if Julius Randle and the 4 seed Knicks have something to say.
"If he had to pick between Giannis and Julius Randle, I am sure he would suck it up and vote for Giannis. This isn't a dig at Randle, he's been great but you just cant make a logical on the court argument for it. Its a moot point anyway, there are probably at least 10-15 guys who are gonna see vote before Randle. Thats just how it is."
&gt;Giannis and Harden will suffer from bad narratives in a media based vote  Not enough to have Julius Randle on the 4 seed pass them up.
Julius Randle 💪🏾
Knicks at 12??? What timeline is this  Julius Randle = King of NY
JULIUS RANDLE 😤😤😤😤
&gt; the Knicks being more popular on Reddit  He’s talking about us being more popular in NY. Which we are.  The Nets are looking like championship favorites with three superstar players and NY still gets more hype for Julius Randle and RJ Barrett lmao
Obviously Julius Randle. Knicks got next after us.

Julius Randle is a serious problem. Happy for real Knick fans to have a stud like this.
Knicks mad they’re gunna end up the 6 seed get bounced in 5 (if they’re lucky) (they’d lose in 5 as the 5 seed too tbf) and go on to never win this many games with Julius randle on the team again. He’s good but let’s be honest that has like a 75% chance of happening.
Alec Burckets  RJ Buckett  Julius Randle
Julius Randle.   Easily.
"He is one of the two all-stars on Miami. The only guy that we've discussed who isn't playing with another stud, and has comparable team success, is Julius Randle. Same goes for coaching (Clippers have Lue, Celtics have Stevens, Knicks have Thibs), although grading coaches is about as subjective as it gets so I'm not willing to put much stock in that.  If we're really making the claim that there are 20 players that are just as impactful this season then I strongly disagree. Nothing supports that. Are we really going to ignore advanced metrics as a whole to handwaive away how good he is?  Regarding the 13-19 record against .500+ teams, did Butler play in all of those? I'm generally curious in finding splits that specific but am having a hard time finding the data."
Julius Randle is going to walk away with it
Maybe the real Julius Randle with hops are the friends we made along the way
I though zion was just julius randle with hops
Enes Kanter is just Julius Randle with hops
"The huge turnaround Julius Randle has done this season is so great to see, truly one of the most unexpected stories of the season."
"Julius ""Enes Kanter"" Randle"
"[posted this yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/naq136/henry_abbott_according_to_the_nbas_last_two/gxuzouf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)  But Jokic is tied for the most calls in his favor along with Julius Randle.   This doesn’t prove refs are biased against Jokic. It’s just meant to explain why Jokic complains as often as he does to refs  Also, my name is Owen. Not Owens."
Julius Randle is going to crush the jersey sales list over the next year.
Better NBA storyline: Westbrook reviving the Wizards or Julius Randle going all the way the fuck off?
"When I first saw their high school mixtapes, Randle’s was the one that blew me away. Wiggins looked super athletic, but I didn’t see what everyone else saw. I saw the skill in Jabari’s, but he seemed a bit slow and kind of boring lol. Julius Randle looked so explosive and unstoppable in his. Always hoped he would shine in the league."
"Is Lebron a PG for these discussions or still a SF that ballhandles a lot? Giannis is first team PF for sure, if Kawhi is considered a 4 id put him over randle as well but i agree hes more of a small forward and i cant really think of anyone else thats had a banner year the way Julius has, also Embiid is a Center how is he forward eligible? Would love to see Randle make 2nd team but i think 3rd is more likely"
Julius Randle
"&gt;Game 2 Julius Randle had the best game of his career and we could just do absolutely nothing about it.   Not even close to the best game of his career, huh...? That's not helping your case either way b.   &gt;Game 3 we were handling the game until our two most important players went down. I hope the Knicks players are as confident as their fans lol they’d be in for a rude awakening  You guys couldn't handle Randle again, he dropped another 40 on y'all. Says alot about your defense.   Also, let's not act like our entire Center position didn't get injuried, lmao. Even our third string was hurt. Plus no Burks, our closer, and RJ didn't play well that game either.   You guys were barely ""handling"" the game before all that too. You were losing the lead before Trae got injuried. (At least the injury wasn't too bad)  The most you outscored us in a quarter was 5, any double digit lead you had we cut back down to single digits, and Randle seems to be able to hit 40+ against y'all fairly easily.    &gt;I hope the Knicks players are as confident as their fans lol they’d be in for a rude awakening  I hope the Hawks aren't as delusional as theirs. You guys have shown nothing that would beat us and yet still think it's a done deal? Come on now."
"Game one, coached by Lloyd Pierce. The worst coach in the league and they have been a completely team since firing him. Game 2 Julius Randle had the best game of his career and we could just do absolutely nothing about it. Game 3 we were handling the game until our two most important players went down. I hope the Knicks players are as confident as their fans lol they’d be in for a rude awakening"
"Julius Randle also had 2 of his best games in his career against us. That made the difference in the regular season. If that trend continues, a healthy roster is irrelevant, if it doesn’t, hawks take the series imo"
On ESPN every. fucking. day.  Neither team is a true contender but the Knicks are getting contender level coverage and even more coverage than some contenders. Where as the Hawks aren't even getting normal non-contender playoff team coverage. It's disgusting.  And people wonder why there is no parity. You have Julius Randle going from someone no one gave a shit about to being on TV every other fucking day. He could be putting up the exact same numbers on the Hornets and no one would care
"“Julius Randle admitted he was probably setting a lot of moving screens last night, laughed, said the refs knew it was Kobe’s last night.”"
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  If we get a series with the Knicks we turning the area outside of MSG into West Flatbush lol. Pray for Julius Randle son yo.
"Steph Curry heads the '22 class, but right behind him? A guy named Julius Randle lol. Pairing them should be the Knicks' top priority.  Paul and Leonard are UFA's if they see their deals through as well.   But 2023 looks like it has the potential to be absolutely insane. There's a possibility that LeBron, Beal, Jokic, Embiid, Durant, Harden, Butler, Irving, and like two dozen other max players could be available. Obviously that's unlikely, but if the chips fall a certain way..."
"You can't have Hit or Miss and not have Sabonis. I have mad respect Randle, some respect Zion, but I cannot understand how they are higher. Sabonis is usually relegated to a facilitator roll in the 2nd half of games. He does very well with it. He makes sure the offense runs smooth, and that's something the Pacers are good at as of late (they're defense is garbage though, generally speaking). Sabonis is a Bona Fide Jokic Lite and has respectably earned that being a 2nd or 3rd option most nights. Julius is getting tested, if he's gonna hit on a nightly basis. If he makes a few, the rest of the Knicks start feeding yo him (I don't have any problem with it, just trying to show the difference of game.). Sabonis hits well the first half, and then dies out, with scoring the 2nd, 'cause they're looking for him to move the ball. Hence his TD's. He did get that 1 TD before half which was also damn impressive!"
Why do so many people think Julius Randle has had a better season than Jimmy Butler???  Jimmy has better advanced stats - and it isn’t close. His counting stats are basically even with Randle’s and he’s a superior defender. *And* this guy is coming off a finals berth where he went supernova!
"All-NBA 1st Team  C: Nikola Jokic  F: Joel Embiid  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  G: Luka Doncic  G: Steph Curry  All-NBA 2nd Team  C: Rudy Gobert  F: Julius Randle  F: Zion Williamson  G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  All-NBA 3rd Team  C: Bam Adebayo  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: LeBron James  G: Jimmy Butler  G: Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  Notable Snubs:  Tatum, Westbrook, KAT, Harden, Trae, Booker, Beal, Jaylen, Mitchell, Lavine, Kyrie."
"The arguments for PG13 write themselves. Similar stats, similar efficiency, infinitely better spacing, better record. 2nd in net rating, 2nd in offensive rating, and 8th in defense versus the Heats'  21st, 7th, and 19th respectively. You're saying Kawhi might have an argument but if we're accounting for team success then there's no way Butler sniffs Kawhi and he doesn't even have a solid argument over PG13.  The case for Randle is that last year the team was 21-45 for something like a 30% win rate.  This year Randle is posting career highs as their first option and the Knicks are 38-31, which is the same record as the Heat while having what many thought was an inferior team in comparison to the Heat. If you had said that a team with RJ Barrett and Julius Randle as their stars would've had the same team record as the Eastern Conference Champs of 2020, you would've been laughed out the door. But here we are and by some accounts, they're the better team.   I'd like to see your arguments for Butler that aren't simply advanced stats"
"He was always my favorite on those pre-lebron post Kobe Lakers teams, it's so great to have him shining so bright in NY. How could anyone not love Julius Randle? He's been a superstar on the court this season and nothing but infectious positivity off of it."
To this point the only argument for the other players has been that their counting stats all look similar. I would love to hear one argument for someone like Paul George or Julius Randle over Butler.
First Nikola Jokic Giannis Antetokounmpo Kawhi Leonard Damian Lillard Stephen Curry  Second Joel Embiid Julius Randle Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic Chris Paul  Third Rudy Gobert Zion Williamson Paul George Devin Booker Donovan Mitchell
I don’t want to live in a world where julius randle is 1st team and Embiid is 2nd
"This is kinda bait-y not gonna lie but I’ll answer. Knicks easily. Im a Nets fan, but even I didn’t expect the Knicks to surge out of nowhere and be this good. Especially when they got MY GOAT Derrick Rose and the man went on a tear transforming the team instantly. As long as they keep this lineup and stay healthy, they can legitimately knock out the Hawks(assuming the playoffs started today) out the first round. And Julius Randle is legitimately an MVP candidate while being a lock for 1st or 2nd All NBA"
"Jimmy Butler not even on the all-snub team. Am I on crazy pills with this one? Feels like I am, another post that excludes him. Julius Fucking Randle (all due respect to the former Laker) instead?"
"If any of their stars stand out to you, I would go in that direction.   Though I will say that, as a Suns fan, I've adopted the Knicks as my second team because I fucking love Julius Randle and their broadcast is head and shoulders above the rest. Mike Breen and Clyde Frazier compliment each other beautifully.  Then, when you realize that they have a ton of cap space to compliment a solid, young core... a new General Manager that seems to (finally!) know wtf he's doing... along with a great new coach who has done a fantastic job of implementing his system? There is so much potential for improvement.  It's a lot of fun to watch a team grow, and the Knicks are in the unique position of being an established franchise in an enormous market that has been TERRIBLE for a long time. Jump in now before you are called a bandwagoner. Plus, if you ever decide to go to a game in ANY city, there will be fellow Knicks fans to cheer with."
"if you said the knicks would be a playoff team led by julius randle putting up one of the best statistical seasons a knick has ever had even 6 months ago, you'd be relentlessly mocked by several people, myself included.  i'm in absolute awe"
Julius Randle has earned his Benjamin.
Took Julius Randle 6 seasons to learn to set a non-slip screen
"&gt; Butler should make the 2nd team  Forward is such a shit-show for all-NBA this year because so many of the best players have been injured. **Giannis** is of course a lock for the first team and I actually like the idea of **Embiid** as the other forward (with Jokic as center).  I like **LeBron** and **Kawhi** on the 2nd team (LeBron only has 8 less games than Butler and his per game stats are way better than Butlers).  For third team the problem is games play. AD and Durant are the two best players by far but they have both played less than 35 games this season due to injury. I guess **Butler** and **Julius Randle** are the players who have produced the most this season.  If you leave Embiid out, then yeah, Butler should be 2nd team."
So what you’re saying is Julius Randle for second team
"If you watch games you don't make this mistake. Shit, I don't watch games and I wouldn't make this mistake.  Jokes are supposed to be funny, I'm not sure what's funny about mixing up Zach Randolph and Julius Randle."
"Nope, Julius Randle has also been advantaged 9 times, read the follow up tweets."
This motherfucker actually called Julius Randle Zach Randolph (and didn't even understand the difference after his co-hosts pointed it out) and still wants people to respect his opinions on basketball.  He's more like the black Marv Albert than the Black Steph Curry.

Zach Randolph and Julius Randle are both brutal left handers with a sweet shot.  It's a joke.  Shaq won't say your name unless you've been to the finals.
"As a different Hawks fan I much rather play you all than NY. Julius Randle is averaging like 36 on the Hawks this year and they have no answer for him. Add in the fact that they have no answer for D Rose either.  At least with the Heat the Hawks can use Hunter on Butler and if Bam vs Capela is a mismatch favoring Capela in my opinion and Bam vs Collins is a wash as nether can guard the other. Even though Spo is probably top 3 coach and can game plan anything I still like the individual matchups against the Heat more than the Knicks.  Truthfully the team I wanted all season was the Celtics, I was predicted at the beginning of the season the Hawks could be the 6 seed and Boston the 3 and I was certain the Hawks could beat them and only became more certain as the year went on and for a second it was looking like we’d be able to play them in the 4/5 matchup but that’s dead now"
"It isn't even funny. His job is literally watching/analyzing the NBA. How does he not know a guy's name? Especially one who is playing as well as Julius Randle on a big market like New York.   This might be a hot take but I honestly would prefer the TNT crew if it were just Ernie Kenny and Chuck. Shaq literally adds nothing but ""I GOT RINGS"" and being an overly sensitive crybaby."

Then they aren't watching the box score at all. Julius has been awesome but 31 points on 26 shots ain't exactly lighting it up. AD once again showing why Randle and all the former Lakers were shipped out lol
"Just look at the Pelicans. They even have ""Julius Randle with hops."""
"It wasn't a mistake. Shaq knows perfectly well who Julius Randle is, he was just being a dick"
Yeah that's like missing Julius Randle for them
Julius Randle ELEVATED his game this year
but they didnt' score did they? wasn't the out of time outs play the Julius Randle travel?
"This game was a homage to the Old-School style of basketball. Very little easy buckets, every single one was earned, absolutely stifling defense from both teams, Anthony Davis was stellar on defense and Julius Randle keeps improving his offensive arsenal.  In my opinion, this is how basketball should be played, teams should pride themselves on shutting down their opponent's offense.  PS. an OT game barely cracking the 100 point mark."
"Lakers sub was all ""Julius Randle outplaying AD"" and commenting about how ""soft and fragile"" AD is..."
When do we start talking about Julius Randle MVP?
"AD locked him up, Julius worked for it. Proud of my boi randle"
Chicago was very well represented this game   Derrick rose and Julius Randle man I love that duo
Might be too early to call but Julius Randle may be the best basketball player of all time.
So AD lead team = Julius Randle lead team?
I love Julius randle
AD’s gonna need some personal time off after 53 minutes with Julius Randle  The man is gassed
I’m naming my first born kid Julius Randle
Horrible offensive foul call lol especially when Julius randle has been doing similar shit all game
JULIUS RANDLE FOR MVP
You know i never thought Julius Randle would end up being my favorite active player... yet here we are.
JULIUS RANDLE MANNN
"King of New York, Julius Randle"
how long did it take you to notice that Julius Randle doesn't have eyebrows ?
"Let's be honest - r/nba(and just about everything online ever)  has the memory of a goldfish   There are people here who think Julius Randle is better than Anthony Davis cuz of 1 season.   The only thing that matters here is what happened yesterday, and if it happened yesterday, that means it's how things are going to play out for all eternity, until the next new thing happens."
"&gt;I love when people get on here and pretend to be experts at something.  Says the person who thinks Julius Randle can't go right because he saw a video on Youtube? Lmfao   Shooting chart the past 4 years from him, this year he's shooting more midrange jumpers from the right side than left side, but he can't go right tho lmfao clown https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1367583959933018118"
"Hopefully not Julius Randle, but it’s likely"
They can conduct the show however they want but Shaq should probably know who Julius Randle is with the year he’s having. Pretty unbelievable that this is somehow a controversial statement lol.
Anthony Davis and Julius Randle going at each other 👀. Gotta love it when the two best players match-up. So far Julius is holding his own 😤
"You think Julius Randle is a 'top MVP candidate' lol yeah you clearly arent into high level analysis. Did you mean MIP? Anyway ballsucking shaming is a terrible thing, if it were more common the world would be a better place but i guess you support global warming and terrorism🤷🤷"
"What's entertaining about Shaq purposely trying to be funny mentioning Zach Randolph when he knows damn well he's been retired when they're talking about Julius Randle, a guy who was just an all-star?"
I don't expect Shaq to give some Kobe-level play analysis but how do you not know who Julius Randle is?
If I’m Julius Randle I certainly take this as disrespect but it’s mitigated by the knowledge Shaq confuses me with Zbo
Julius Randle is Zach Randolph with hops
“His name is Julius Randle”  “I don’t give a shit”  “I know”
"This is legit hard to watch. Lefkoe and Shaq seem like they genuinely don't get along.  Shaq just called Julius Randle ""Zach Randolph""."
"This is good, Bron saved against the one named Emprorer Julius of clan Randle, descendants of Venus XI by the way of Ascanius...."
"That’s fair.   Just to add, compared to the other teams below them in this ranking, each has at least 1-2 max contracts on the books for years to come while the Knicks highest paid is Julius Randle whose contract expires after next year. That also is probably taken into account.  Jazz: Conley, Gobert, Mitchell  Suns: Booker, CP3  Mavs: Porzingis  Heat: Butler, Adebayo"
I could see people not knowing about Julius Randle or Domantas Sabonis. We have so many good forwards currently that they will most likely get left off of all NBA and other things that would elevate their name
"Not even trying to be a homer, but Jonathan Isaac and Jaren Jackson, but no Julius Randle? Also, LaMelo at 30?!!"
"Carmelo Anthony  Future: Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Bradley Beal 👀"
No Julius Randle
"Knicks easily have one of the coolest teams this season, Julius Randle becomes a stud, DRose turns back the clock, Noel is super solid, and the young guys are nice. Did not expect the Knicks to be good but I enjoy the story line a lot."
Julius Randle keeps me up at night
"lmao what? the pels FO surrounded AD with jrue holiday and prime boogie and rondo as well, along with decent shooters. unfortunately boogie had a career altering injury and there was obviously zero way they beat the KD warriors, which is out of the FOs control. Literally the next season, the pels added julius randle(didn't fit with the team but obviously a talented player) but boogies injury pretty much fucked them, and then AD went a requested a trade midway through the year"
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/julius-randle-stats-against-the-hawks-this-season
"""Hey Simmons. It's me , your daddy, Julius Randle"""
"Plus it seemed like the Knicks ""overpaid"" Julius Randle but that seems to have worked out pretty well haha"
Stan is like a former laker coach who preached and preached accountability and defense in Byron Scott.   Playing guys like Chris Duhon over DLo russel. Or Ronnie “head of the snake” price. Also putting BrAndoN bass ahead of Julius Randle. You can’t preach one thing then do another and expect results. Scream defense then put the guys in a terrible defensive scheme for 2021.  Edit: just remembered Scott was a pelicans coach too😂😂😂
How did the Knicks get the 4 seed? Their offense is just Julius Randle isos and their Defense is shit The answer is things are different in the playoffs and teams have bad games
"Honestly, Ben Simmons is a slightly better version of Michael Jordan. The difference is, Jordan had Scottie Pippen to carry him to 6 championships. If the 76ers are serious about contending, they should see if they can trade Embiid and a couple picks for Julius Randle or maybe Jaren Jackson Jr."
Julius Randle deserved his all star and all nba nod
76ers 2nd half was a Julius Randle esc
It’s a travesty a guy like Julius Randle made the all star team and all NBA but not Trae.
"arguable imo, He was deflecting it a lot of it before tonight. Id argue guys like julius randle and jimmy butler have caught more in their respective series. Even Paul George in some games mainly cause hes become the favorite meme at this pt."
"He’s boring to watch. I don’t wanna watch a max player who can only defend and pass while having single digit scoring games in the playoffs almost every year. Boring. He’s somehow a point guard who is shooting far below 50% from the line, really doesn’t seem like he puts in the work in the offseason. I find it hard to believe he’s making a consistent effort to work on his game.   This might not be the best example but look at Julius Randle. I know he did poorly in the playoffs but he shot nearly twice the volume he did from 3 compared to last year and went from being 28% to over 40% in one season. That’s proof that he put in the work. Ben has only gotten worse, but muhhh defenseee."
Nothing but confirmation bias here.  You can't point to this and say that the compressed season led to more injuries.  I can point to the fact that Julius Randle led the league in minutes and played all but 1 game.  RJ Barrett wasn't too far behind and didn't miss one.  It's all just factors but to go around and finger point isn't correct.  Not everyone has the luxury to have less games played meaning less money in their pockets.  Those extra games could make a difference for those guys.  We have to take into account that the PA okayed this so this wasn't some unilateral decision by the league.
Because Embiid isn’t Julius randle
"Hmmm can't decide if troll or just delusional Trae homer. 🤔🤔  1. ""Hawks had a **MUCH** better record'' -------&gt; Mavs are 42-30, Hawks are 41-31. **The fuck are you talking about No. 1.** 2. ""They \[Mavs\] would have lost in the first rd \[against the Knicks\]"" -------&gt; extra dumb take. No one with more than 2 brain cells in this community would admit that Knicks are even remotely close to the Clippers on paper. Add to that, as i have already said, pathetic choke job of Julius Randle (aka THEIR LEADER) and your take gets even dumber. As such, **the fuck are you talking about No. 2** 3. Trae and Dbook had better seasons - just fucking stop mate. This is untrue both objectively (stats) and subjectively (eye-test and overwhelming opinion of majority of the NBA community). **The fuck are you talking about No. 3.** 4. Literally everything else. No, the 76ers would not sweep the Mavs if the Hawks of all teams have won a game against them and injured Embiid. No, you wouldn't win against the Clippers. That slow dribble Luka is still better than your explosive Trae, no matter how hard you will try to skew the reality with your delusions.  Stop it. Get some help."
"He played 28+ minutes in 40/56 games. So no, try again.   Honestly this would be so much easier if you would just admit that you have an anti-Julius Randle bias for some weird reason. Basically everything you've said so far is either untrue or taken out of context."
PG - Luka Doncic  SG - Paul George  SF - Kyle Kuzma  PF - Julius Randle  C - Kristaps Porzingis  6th man: Dennis Schroder  (this is a very tall team)
I remember a few years ago alllll kinds of people were saying that Julius Randle had low value and was unplayable. That's why you dont give up on players.
"My point is you can say he doesn't deserve All NBA without discrediting his clear major improvement this season.   I'm curious what you think the difference is between Julius Randle in 18-19, 19-20, and 20-21. With all due respect, I don't think you understand the context of his stats in those 3 seasons if you're claiming he wasn't that much better this season."
"Imagine someone at the beginning of the year predicting Julius randle was gonna be all nba second team, they would have been laughed at and ridiculed."
"I think the numbers give Randle a marginal advantage (including team success, and time played), but I'd want to dive into some film, and look at lineups and all that other shit before I claimed either had a firm advantage over the other.  Like, for instance, I think Tatum stretched defenses more than Randle did over the course of the year. Randle has the statistical profile that would force defenses to stretch once it became clear he was hitting 40%, but Jayson was shooting far more threes off the dribble, and putting up a few more a game. Jayson also had far more unassisted threes than Julius.  Then there's things like screen assists.  I wouldn't be shocked if Randle had the edge, overall, if we could factor those things in well, but I don't have the time or resources to get into that."
"I’m a neutral fan, I’d would much rather tune in for KD, Kyrie, and Harden over Julius Randle and RJ Barrett. Y’all act like the Knicks are this mythical brand that everyone wants to see thrive, it’s the opposite, it’s a huge brand that historically underperforms."
D’Angelo Russell and Julius Randle blossomed into All-Stars after leaving the Lakers. Absolutely nothing from their time in LA said they would ever be that good. Get outta here with that BS lmfao
Julius randle shoots 3-12 Game 1 and Harden stops passing after that
Holy moly Julius Randle stands out as being way worse than all the other names on this list.     Also Trae Young &gt; Bradley Beal
if you watch the games and think julius “beyblade” randle is better than zion idk what to tell you chief
"you buggin out, real NY basketball is Julius Randle putting up tour date numbers"
Dame and Embiid aren’t forwards but I think your point could hold true for Julius Randle being first team.
"Julius randle being 2nd team is very sus in my opinion. He should be 3rd team at best, but no way he should get in over guys like Booker and Mitchell"
Julius Randle with dolmades
"Soo. Steph Curry who couldn't even make it into the playoffs. Lebron James who barely played and is hobbled and Julius Randle who may be good but no love for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell?  Luka Doncic who can't get out of the first rd?  I whole-heartedly disagree with HALF of this list.  Oh yeah, did I miss Kevin Durant????!!!  Who picks Playoff P over KD?  No Booker?"
Thanasis rubbin off on giannis. That was some Julius Randle shit right there
I don’t think the all-NBA is a matter of “building the best team” as much as it’s who us the best season at each position. Julius Randle 100% deserves to be on a team vs. Jayson and this is coming from a Celtics fan….Only real snub was Russ imo.
Why is Bucks running that Julius Randle offense
Never forget that Knicks fans chanted MVP when Julius Randle went to the line game 2. The same Julius Randle that shot 26% from the field in the first round
Only thing I would change is Jimmy Butler over Julius Randle for 2nd team
Joe Harris and Julius Randle choking in the playoffs but being amazing in the regular season. It’s a New York thing
&gt; Scott didn’t handle sophomore forward Julius Randle with the same kids gloves  What is this writing?
Who do you guys have on your all nba playoff team? I got: James harden Demar derozan  CJ McCollum Paul George  Julius Randle   Top that fire roster
And don’t forget trae young I’m sorry but he’s better than Julius randle
"julius randle, paul george, &amp; jimmy butler got on ahead of harden, imagine my shock"
"Julius Randle had a great year, but it’s mad disrespectful that the best player on the best team, Mitchell didn’t make it. Or DBook."
Julius Randle had a great season. Tatum over Jimmy all day in here but man Julius aint the guy we should be mad at. He balled out this year
Julius Randle is that you!?
All nba is dumb and has always been dumb and had wild shit like Julius Randle getting 16 1st votes every year. Nothing will change will it?
Well deserved by Julius Randle imo glad he got the 2nd team nod.
"Yeah I wouldn’t have voted Beal in either. Tatum doesn’t make his teammates better, plays too much iso, isn’t good enough defensively, and ultimately got just 8th seed in a weak conference. We reward players for winning - see Julius Randle, he stepped it up, played winning ball, got Knicks to 4th seed. His numbers weren’t anywhere near as good because he wasn’t playing for himself, rather playing for his team. Too often I see Tatum fail to engage his teammates in plays and just seems to want to get his own points."
Julius randle 2nd team all nba 😂😂😂
Eh he gonna end his career making 60 per.  Julius Randle though lmao everyone is crazy.
im a sixers fan and not having tatum on there AND julius randle making 2nd team is a disgrace. How is that possible.
"Butler, PG, Julius Randle???"
julius randle? literally this year? unless u mean ppl who were already stars b4hand
"Tbf I’ve been down on the Knicks all year, but yes I understand your point. On Lowe’s podcast he specifically brought up how he was confused why people thought the Knicks had a chance against the Hawks.   It’s pretty easy to see now (revisionist history) that it’s easy to beat a team with Julius Randle as the only player you need to game plan against."
"If your job is to talk about basketball and you're a NYer, and one team has Harden, Kyrie, and KD, and the other team has Julius Randle, kinda takes it out of your hands."
"You are comparing offenses run by Julius Randle and Luka…   People give Mavs fans shit for bringing up Trae when it’s unnecessary, but this is a clear example of you just being full of shit to bring up Luka… lol"
Julius Randle first round playoff series moment
I agree he sucks. KP is worse.  You guys need a solid rebounder defender. Nothing fancy. You have enough scoring. Zach Collins would be perfect if he could stay on the court.  Julius Randle would also be phenomenal.
Throw Julius Randle in there too.
"Knowing it’s easier to develop a shot than it is to be a defensive specialist guarding 1-5, I’d take my chances in Simmons being a 2nd option. He can easily develop a shot, I know he hasn’t, but Julius randle went from solid starter to potential all-NBA 2nd team in an offseason."
"He's not a Max player right now,  but he has improved every season and I could see it looking really bad in the future if we let him walk and he takes the Julius Randle MIP leap."
agreed. its Julius randle
Julius randle numbers
julius randle numbers
Julius Randle tried to get revenge on the Hawks and took over Embiid's body
That moment the Hawks realize beating Julius Randle after Calvin Cambridge stole his sneakers didn’t mean shit.  Sixers in 5 ✌️
You said u can't win games when your star player isn't playing like a star at home. That was exactly what happened to Julius Randle
"It's a little different when you're not seeing Reggie Bullock and 2019-20 Julius Randle, isn't it Hawks?"
JC - Julius Randle Spider-Man meme
"This Julius Randle shit is getting out of hand, man"
Julius Randle getting more votes than Nerlens Noel is blasphemy.
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
"Yeah uh who the fuck is voting Julius Randle period, let alone over og"
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
Could you imagine what luka would do to a team where Julius randle is their best player Lmaoooo
Julius Randle is somehow still overrated even after one of the worst playoff performances in the last decade
Julius Randle. Not seen any evidence that he is a legit 2nd option in a top team.. derrick rose was the best player in the squad for playoffs.. not sure what Knicks is going to do with him.
Potentially Julius Randle.   But definitely Lauri.
"winding up and using force to hit the ball... he didn't strike at Payne's face or body, his bicep caught Payne in the face as he swung down on the ball with his hand. F1, imo, I mean at least if Julius Randle swinging his elbows high and hard into someone's face is an F1... but maybe I don't understand the rule well enough"
"there are levels to that, look at bogi taking a hit from julius randle and not flinching from last round. This was obviously exaggerated, and no offence to that, you should use the opportunity to eject the opponents best player, but I still dont think it warrants a flag2. If you judge just on intent yeah sure, but he literally got the ball"
"Julius ""Human Beyblade"" Randle always killed me."
RJ Barrett   Julius Randle  Steph Curry   Mitchell Robinson   Me
pj tucker would make julius randle play worse than he did in the playoffs
If u ignore the recent playoffs Julius randle
KD just a 7ft Julius Randle
"Next year? We’re not talking about next year, we’re talking about this year, a year in which Julius Randle has improved nearly every aspect of his game. Who’s talking about next year?   Yes his TS% has risen by 3% this season compared to last lmfao thanks for proving my point   You’re just simply incorrect in what you’re saying. The facts do not support what you are trying to prove. There’s a reason why he won most improved player this year my guy, because he’s improved greatly"
"You have no idea what you’re talking about   Julius Randle improved his 3 point shooting this year by a whopping 14%, he improved his free throw percentage by 7%, he averaged a career high in assists, doubling the total from last year  Julius Randle wasn’t leading the pelicans to the 4th seed in 2018, but he made the Knicks into a winning team and helped them defy all expectations.   Just stop. He’s improved almost every facet of his game this year. What you’re saying just isn’t an accurate reflection of reality. He’s a FAR better player this year than he was on the Pelicans, because he became a winning player who doubled his assist output while becoming an absolute sniper from long range and grew into a #1 option on a winning team   You’re just flat out wrong dude"
He thinks KD is Julius Randle.
I think Bagley is on the wrong team. I actually would take him and develop him as PF next to Ayton (and Jalen Smith). Kings front management has been bad and I feel bad for their fans... as a Suns fan we were there a couple of years back.  Bagley has the tools still I see him being the Julius Randle type redemption for another team in a few years.
"I like him quite a bit, but Julius Randle is the most overrated player in the NBA currently.  I think we see a massive step back from him next year (and moving forward)  Hope I’m wrong"
I guess. I would ask who was coaching you when you played the knicks in season? I haven't really seen us or utah do anything different in the playoffs than what the teams have done all year. Also our best players clearly show up in the playoffs unlike Julius Randle. (Sorry knicks fans)
Jerami Grant. He’s gon have a Julius Randle season mark my words.
"Oh no, that 2015-16 roster was just.... ugh  Kobe  Roy Hibbert  Brandon Bass  Lou Williams  Nick Young  D-Lo  Jordan Clarkson  Julius Randle  Larry Nance Jr  Anthony Brown  Tarik Black (one of my favorite Lakers during the down years)  Marcelo Huertas (the fucking GOAT)  Robert Sacre (the other fucking GOAT)  That's 13 out of 15 I can remember. I'm too lazy to check but I think Metta World Peace was also on it or maybe I'm thinking of 2016-17"
D'Angelo Russell   Jordan Clarkson   Kobe bryant   Luol deng   Roy Hibbert   Larry Nance JR   Tarik Black   Timofey Mozgov   Nick Young   Thomas Bryant   Julius Randle   I know I'm missing like 2-3 guys for sure
Julius Randle just went from 27% at age 25 to 41% at age 26
"A black hole post player wouldn't work on the court with Magic, Kareem, McAdoo, Rambis. Dantley didn't work on the Pistons either.   His style was like a better Julius Randle, where he could put up stats if you put the ball in his hands and built your entire scheme around Dantley, but when he's with a bunch of really good players he couldn't win or play within the flow of the offense"
"Both tbh  They sent their whole rebuild to new orleans, swapped julius randle for zion, and they still can't make the playoffs"
1. Derrick rose  2. RJ Barrett  3. Julius Randle  4.  Immanul Quickley  5. Mitchell Robinson   They deserve it more than anyone else
"1. **Rose** for what he went through  2. **KAT** - KAT winning a ring before buckets would be hilarious  3.  **Giannis** - Cool dude don't want him getting the Barkley treatment  4. **Julius Randle** - One of the hardest working guys in the league. Adds something new to his game every year. For him to lead a team to the playoffs after starting his career with a bad injury and then having to play for the purposefully tanking Lakers is impressive,  5. **Dame** - Special player whose gone out of his way to actually take the toughest road."
Unfortunately for the Hawks this isn't Julius Randle.  You're talking about the uncrowned MVP!
what about Julius the fraud Randle?
"&gt; Julius Randle  lol come on man, that's not nice  He didn't disappear to China. He just disappeared to the Bronx or some shit."
"Julius ""NASCAR"" Randle"
Hawks are done.  Embiid isn't Julius Randle!
Julius randle second team is bold
I don’t get it. Is the narrative that Julius Randle is bad now?
https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/julius-randle-was-not-offered-spot-on-team-usa-because-they-wanted-more-role-players-per-report/amp/
You mean MVP candidate and All NBA second team Julius Randle? Yeah the NY centric media over hyped the shit out of him. He's a good player but not on that level.
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
Julius Randle
"Shitty thing about this postseason is that my go-to answer is no longer overrated (Ben Simmons).   Off the top of my head, Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle"
"20% chance of a franchise player at each pick (so 40% odds that between the two picks, at least one guy is a real franchise piece) actually represents better odds than I would've guessed offhand. Given that TOR has some of the best scouting &amp; development in the league, the odds are probably better still. Not to mention that Wiseman represents a third (purely development-based) roll of the dice.  Now compare the odds of a positive outcome with the pick(s) and/or Wiseman with the odds of Siakam ever being a core part of a Raptors title run (or even ECF run) again. It's harder to quantify the latter, but I can't really think of any reasonable path for a return to contention for TOR anytime within Siakam's prime. The odds of that are far slimmer than at least one of #7, #14, or Wiseman being as good as Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ, or Julius Randle -- though of course part of getting rolls of the dice is the possibility that you could hit multiple times and have a home run on your hands.  But so what if only one player works out and they're not actually as good as Siakam (or even if it's the rare, total-disaster outcome and TOR bungles all 3 assets)? What great achievement would TOR be potentially missing out on in that scenario? It just doesn't really make much sense to keep Siakam if a team were willing to give good young/draft value for him, and a package like this from GSW would be phenomenal value for him. It'd be an overpay that GSW should absolutely not offer."
"Experience wasn’t the only reason Love was added. Ever since the loss in 2004, Team USA has been trying to build a culture of continuity. Maybe not on the level of the other countries but that’s what they’ve been trying to do. That’s another reason why Love was picked. The 3rd reason was that Love was ok with being in that DNP coach’s decision role. The same can’t be said of someone like Julius Randle."
Julius Randle couldn't show up in his very first playoff series. He literally shrunk on the big stage. People think he could handle being on the international stage?
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
"Defensive specialists like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green, and Rudy Gobert aren’t exactly getting wiped off the floor. DeAndre Ayton, Julius Randle, and Giannis are all big men who don’t shoot much from outside. They are all doing pretty ok."
"Yeah, Keldon Johnson ain’t Julius Randle"
Julius Randle reminds me of Grandmama and it warms my heart.
Because Julius Randle isn’t a rim protector/C that the USA team needs. Kevin Love isn’t even on the team anymore.
"Maybe. DeRozan has to be top 3, no? If not flat out #1.  Julius Randle is also crazy good from mid range."
"You don’t understand the point. Basketball is not putting the best players on the court. If it was, Julius Randle would be on the team over McGee. No one is saying McGee is better than Randle. The facts are that Randal’s game is built around him being a first option, especially when he played well and shot that 42%. We need 4th and 5th options who **have experience in how to give their team advantage from those slots.**"
"Pretty tough scenario for the Dubs.. Houston and Indiana should definitely be happy if those trades present themselves. Memphis as well, their core is young enough to grow with Wiseman and picks. I think Myles Turner is probably the best choice because he can defend and shoot well. Vucevic can score, but he’s not stopping anyone at the rim. I think C Wood has the most upside, but he’s gotta gain a lot of muscle.  Jonas is solid, but his offense is limited. Julius Randle would not fit playing off ball with the Warriors core, he needs the ball to be effective. This was a really good question, being an NBA GM is harder than it seems. It’s a real big gamble to give up on Wiseman, but their window is closing. As a Wizards fan, I would happily give up Beal for this package."
Julius Randle
"Luka/PG/Harrison Barnes/Julius Randle/Brook Lopez   (I tried to make a semi-realistic team though it’s still a little star-heavy, this team could really punish small ball minus Lopez being a defensive liability when switched into fast guards)"
Head Coach: Mike Budenholzer  PG: Eric Bledsoe  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Julius Randle  C: Rudy Gobert
"Julius Randle, really? He’s the reason the Knicks were over .500 and in the playoffs for the first time in a decade. His stats directly contributed to wins"
"Ah yes because Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle and D'angelo Russell/Brook Lopez is definitely a worse team than the Kings starting 5...."
None of these players are “trash” but they’re definitely not as good as advertised.   PG: D’Angelo Russell/Russell Westbrook  SG: Buddy Hield/Colin Sexton  SF: R.J Barrett/Andrew Wiggins  PF: Marvin Bagley/Julius Randle  C: Domantas Sabonis/Whiteside
"Just get julius randle, morant and zion"
Played against Julius Randle in middle school. Was a literal man among boys lol
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
"You can't say KD ""got them 2 rings"" it was a team effort. He was playing alongside another top 5 player, a DPOY and one of the greatest shooters of all time.   You're wording it as if Curry'd never sniff a ring without KD lol.  In the Julius Randle example, if KD wins 2 chips with Randle being his 2nd best player, then yea you can def say he straight up got him 2 rings."
If Julius randle(FAV PLAYER) got 2 more rings because of KD. I literally wouldn’t care about what KD like about whoever his teammate was. Why are you hating on someone who got YOUR favorite player 2 rings.
Yes because I don’t want to be maxed out with dame Lillard and Julius randle. That’s not beating Brooklyn.
"Another day, another injustice against Julius Randle"
Can’t believe he’s coming to join Julius Randle and Kevin knox
Julius Randle should’ve been ON the roster already and should have been added to the roster here you’re delusional if you think otherwise.
"*Meaningless?* That cap space lead to Julius Randle, who turned into an all-nba player, which lead to NYK making the playoffs as a 4th seed. How is that meaningless? Why is it so hard for people to just admit they were wrong about this???"
"Maybe extend an offer to Julius Randle if at all possible.    Nonetheless, a rough time for team USA during this covid time."
Julius Randle?
I'm not julius randle.
"If he wants to go the knicks , it aint because of julius randle. Knicks would def have to pull other moves."
"Can anyone explain to me what the logic behind the Knicks rumour is?   Because once they get dame, who is he gonna play with, because the Knicks have Julius Randle and what exactly? The dude wants a championship, and with RJ and other assets gone, how are they gonna trade for a third piece  As for signing someone, there are no great freeagents this off season, so that's another wasted year of Dame's prime, and if the Knicks strike out in '22 free-agency, it'll be Carmelo all over again, just shorter and older"
"Okay, who is Dame gonna play with, because the Knicks have Julius Randle and what exactly? The dude wants a championship, and with RJ and other assets gone, how are they gonna trade for a third piece  As for signing someone, there are no great freeagents this off season, so that's another wasted year of Dame's prime, and if the Knicks strike out in '22 free-agency, it'll be Carmelo all over again, just shorter and older"
"Julius Randle and what exactly?

this is what team USA gets for denying us a hilarious julius randle/trae young pairing
I dispute the notion that they specifically need to go for a big/C at all costs but I would rather add Julius Randle or Christian Wood as 2 names spending 2 seconds thinking about it off top of my head.
Julius Randle got passed over for Kevin love lol
Yea he’s really dumb at in game management for the most part. Whenever we faced the Knicks he kept putting Wayne Ellington on Julius Randle…
"Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel"
That happened one time and the circumstances aren’t similar unless Julius Randle completely loses his health
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn’t be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That’d leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I’d rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
Julius Randle
"Thing is, philly nets and heat still have a good core of star players after the trade. Knicks have Julius randle. There's a difference between sacrificing assets for a trade you can take advantage of and sacrificing everything you have to get a star and nothing else"
Julius Randle is the easy replacement if he's available
"Harden is way better than Dame and the teams were looking to pair HArden with another superstar (Embiid, Durant)... not team him with Julius Randle.   Randle + dame is still a 4th seed in the east"
"Knicks don't have a very competitive offer, but would be downright malpractice to not trade for him because he doesn't ""fit the timeline"" of fucking Julius Randle and RJ Barrett"
Lebron. Bronny. Emoni Steph and Julius Randle
Julius Randle or Jaren Jackson Jr. would work too.
"That's fair. I would probably choose Young over Lavine and Ayton over Kevin Love.  Hell, give me Julius Randle over Kevin Love.   There's actually a long list of bigs I'd take over Kevin Love. I don't actually think he's one of the top 20 big men in the league. The majority of teams have a 4 or 5 better than him. I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that Nerlens Noel would be more useful. Or Brook Lopez, Blake Griffin, Jae Crowder...literally just random roleplaying guys about 6'8"" or so."
Julius Randle it’s your time.
If only julius randle who shot 40% from 3 was available oh wait he was.
Yes exactly the type of distinction that separates an all nba level player from someone who is actually a real MVP caliber player and not the weakest one in decades. 2011 Rose would be like Dame Lillard's 3rd or 4th best season. Hell Julius Randle got more heat for coming apart in the first round in rd 1 on a 5 seed than Rose did in 2011.
"Dejounte Murray breaks out a la Julius Randle this season and gets the Spurs back into the playoffs  Timberwolves make the playoffs  CP3 leaves Phoenix but they're still really good, win ~55 games  The Pelicans are still mediocre and Zion gets increasingly sad  Knicks don't replicate the magic from last season and are bang average going close to .500  Raptors bounce back and get home court advantage in the first round  Lillard starts the season in Portland but things go south quick and they end up being rather bad, winning ~35 games  Kyle Kuzma gets traded and has a borderline AS season, earning him the MIP"
"The Wizards definitely miss the playoffs, the Knicks probably miss the playoffs. Instead two out of the Pacers, Hornets and Raptors make it instead  The Bulls still don't make the playoffs  Julius Randle and Ben Simmons don't make the all Star team. Trae Young and Jimmy Butler do  Tbh, I don't think any of these are that bold? Maybe people think otherwise"
"Does Simmons make sense with Fox and Haliburton tho? Why not ship Hield Bagley and picks for someone else maybe a Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, Julius Randle type guy?"
"I mean Jrue Holiday and Eric Gordon and Demarcus Cousins and Nico Mirotic are all good help. They had a good 3&amp;D wing in Quincy Pondexter who got a staff infection after surgery and never played again. They find another good 3&amp;D wing prospect in Bryce Dejean-Jones who was shot and killed. They did put help next to him, it just didn’t work out.  The 76ers hid Jrue Holiday’s leg injury from Pels in the trade, and their owner lost a law suite in court and had to pay the Pels 3mil in court ordered payments for damages, and the league had to make new rules regarding the transfer of medical records for trades. That Injury plagued him for years, he basically had 2 years of his career lost to it, then he missed another year because his wife had a brain tumor. Like what are they supposed to do? They got Julius Randle too, who carried the Knicks to the playoff just a year later.   Portland is a consistent playoff team because of dame, the team around him isn’t all that good."
"We also thought Julius Randle, DLo, and Ingram would become all stars"
Julius Randle?
"The Lakers have drafted Kuzma, BI, Lonzo, Thomas Bryant, DLO, Julius Randle, Moe Wagner, THT, Zubac in recent years. There’s a few more I’m forgetting but we had a really great stretch of drafting from 2015-2020"
Mavs got Marcus smart Julius randle tyrese Maxey
1. Nets - Kevin Durant 2. Bucks - Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Lakers - LeBron James 4. Warriors - Stephen Curry 5. Clippers - Kawhi Leonard 6. Nuggets - Nikola Jokic 7. 76ers - Joel Embiid 8. Mavericks - Luka Doncic 9. Blazers - Damian Lillard 10. Celtics - Jayson Tatum 11. Suns - Chris Paul 12. Heat - Jimmy Butler 13. Hawks - Trae Young 14. Wolves - Karl-Anthony Towns 15. Pelicans - Zion Williamson 16. Jazz - Donovan Mitchell 17. Wizards - Bradley Beal 18. Bulls - Zach Lavine 19. Thunder - Shai-Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Kings - De’Aaron Fox 21. Knicks - Julius Randle 22. Pacers - Domantas Sabonis 23. Raptors - Kyle Lowry 24. Grizzlies - Ja Morant 25. Spurs - DeMar DeRozan 26. Cavaliers - Collin Sexton 27. Magic - Jonathan Isaac 28. Rockets - Christian Wood 29. Pistons - Jerami Grant 30. Hornets - LaMelo Ball  This was tough
Exactly. Toppin was the wrong selection all along for the Knicks because they should have gone Tyrese Halliburton. Toppin’s not going to get the minutes he needs to develop behind Julius Randle so he’ll have another stunted season and lose even more value.   A fair trade would be Sexton for Toppin and the two picks the Knicks have this draft or one of the picks and Quickley.  There’s also no way the Cavs just let Sexton walk as a RFA. You never let a valuable asset leave for nothing. You extend him and then trade him at a later date for a draft pick or another player. But you should probably trade him now.
"That tells me more about Thibs as a coach favoring veterans than anything else honestly.  Thibs got everything he could out of last season and he deserves all the recognition in the world for that, but this was scheduled to be a development year for the young guys before Julius Randle whipped his dick out and went all NBA."
"&gt;	That’s plenty of bigs in the NBA, heck it was AD’s entire story.  How many more? Because we know about AD but who else?  &gt;	the pick didn’t really make sense to me at the time when the Knicks needed a PG more than anything.  It was insurance for Randle because he played so poorly and if he was playing poorly again he would have been traded. He was almost traded the previous year. PG was important we also had zero front court outside of Mitch.  &gt;	sure Knicks fans will downvote me and defend him to the death like they did Frank but idk how you can be thrilled with what you’ve seen,   Because as the season went on he got better. Especially when Rose was brought in. Obi thrives in transition and we are a piss poor transition team. Elf only looked to pass to Randle and Rivers/IQ aren’t playmakers. When Rose came and actively looked for Obi, he did well.   Also he’s buried behind Julius. So Julius is leading the league in minutes so Obi gets only 11 minutes a game to do anything. You can’t get any rhythm or improve that way"
"&gt; Just seemed strange to me that you draft a replacement for a guy you have under contract for a couple more years  Man, you would be the perfect GM for the Green Bay Packers just for that line alone.  Now imagine that Julius Randle was a once-in-a-lifetime generational talent."
"Looking at next years payrolls, I think the 3 major contenders would be OKC/SAS/NY.   Of those 3, OKC doing it would be the decent, but not great given Presti loves cap flexibility and they have a treasure trove of picks that will be coming in soon; on the other hand, it gives them a good contributer right now.   New York would be a pretty bad idea depending on how much they like their young guns. They already look pretty good and I can't imagine JC would help much; also not sure where he would play next to Julius Randle given he sucks at both the 3 and 5.   Spurs seem like the most natural choice since they don't have a great future(they don't have bad future pieces, but they have no core yet; at least not a star to build around), aren't great right now and are unwilling to tank, and have the cap space to swing at a player like JC and pray he becomes something. I think he goes to the spurs for the max; regardless, I'm fairly confident one of these three will offer it to him. With Spurs &gt; NYC &gt; OKC being my expectations over where he ends up."
Bro they were DONE with Julius. Toppin would have played way more minutes for our losing team if Randle didn't take the leap he did.
"My thought process was that we were gonna let go of Julius after his contract and ride with Obi if he worked out. No one expected Randle to have the kind of year he had, so Obi really got the short hand of the stick a month into the season."
A lot of people saying Cam Reddish but I swear it’s gonna be Deandre Hunter.   Fall off: Julius Randle
"Ja Morant, Buddy, Ingram, Julius Randle, KAT. Bench of Trae, Zion, PJ Tucker, Lonzo, Miles Bridges, Marcus Smart, Duncan Rodinson, John Collins.   Literally took me a minute to name a better team. All young and healthy. Play makers, defenders/dogs, shooters, and rims runners. More dominant physically to beat up the world."
But yeah let’s choose Kevin fucking Love over Julius Randle and Jerami Grant lmao  Dumb ass Colangelo
No one is stopping Kyle Kuzma. Maybe Ben Simmons ore Julius Randle? But I can't see anyone topping Kyle Kuzma scoring 30 points a game with the GUANGDONG TIGERS! NI HAO NI HAO NI HAO
"Breakout: Nicolas Claxton, Cam Reddish, Darius Garland(if they trade Sexton)  Fall off: Julius Randle, Lebron(injuries and old age are piling on him) and Klay Thompson(if his injuries zap his full star power)"
I'd say Julius Randle is more than a ok rotation player. Same with D'Angelo Russell
Julius Randle made it over him this year. I think we can all agree Julius Randle is not better than Jayson Tatum
Breakout - Deni Avdija  Regresses - Julius Randle
"Breakout: Jordan Poole,  Fall off: Julius Randle"
"Breakout: Markelle Fultz, Miles Bridges, DeAaron Fox. Drop Off: LeBron James, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid"
Julius Randle will “fall off”. Gives me Pascall Siakam vibes
"Giannis. He doesn’t have much offensive skill and just uses his strength. It works, but damn if it isn’t boring to watch. Shaq bullied everyone but had amazing footwork  Julius Randle as well. Probably gonna get kicked out of NY for this but his game ugly as fuck."

"Age does not matter when you are talking about someone who is only 25. He easily has enough time for a solid 11-13 year career. And not only did he have a good rookie season but he improved on it the next year. He was better than Tatum at that point. But then LeBron came to town and he started regressing. The Lakers switched from development mode to win now mode and left Kuzma to the wolves. The Lakers are already a poor organization for young talent to grow (Julius Randle, D’Angelo, Lonzo) but with the addition of AD and LeBron there was no way Kuzma was going to succeed.   And you say he has no elite attributes but does that even matter? Luka has no elite attributes either and he’s one of the best players in the NBA. Same thing with Julius Randle and Trae Young. And Trae Young doesn’t even have the height. A high IQ will take you a long way. If Kuzma had kept improving like he did from his rookie season to his second year he would have became an allstar."
"Trez sounds like an idiot ,in all honesty. Won't be missing bargain bin Julius Randle."
Julius Randle is Magic Johnson compared to Oubre.
"If I’m considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De’Aaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D’Angelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I’m not forgetting anyone"
Julius Randle is Magic Johnson compared to Oubre.
Maybe it's just me but Julius Randle still looks a little wild and out of control at times but that's why he's the human beyblade.
Inb4 Hall of Famer Julius Randle
"Yeah this is pretty wild, I was curious so I checked the past few years and it seems like there's always one almost-certain non-HOFer who ""spoils"" it (Julius Randle, Siakam, Kemba, Oladipo, Isaiah Thomas)"
"RJ will probably have the better career but for the Hawks, Hunter is the better choice because he fills positional need (3/4) adds perimeter defense (needed desperately) and played well enough on the court to look like our future 2nd scoring option. He was getting heavily contested buckets at will and honestly, he completely OWNED Julius Randle in our playoff series. His game is so mature from his 4 years in college. Only concern is his knee :/"
"They could’ve taken point forward Julius Randle smh, but Kevin Love exists apparently"
This team does not need Julius Randle I can tell you that
*laughs in julius randle*
If he's a Knicks superfan I wonder if he would have been one of those guys trying to convince you Julius Randle was better than Joel Embiid.
"What small market team, or any team in general, was winning championships without an MVP caliber player anyway? 2004 Pistons and the Bad Boys Pistons are the only ones close to that.  In addition to that, I'd say only 8 teams (Nets, Knicks, Thunder, Pacers, Bulls, Clippers, Lakers, Heat, excluding Pistons/Magic/Rockets because they're all beginning rebuilds right now) didn't draft their best player. Even of those teams, Knicks signed an undervalued Julius Randle, Thunder got theirs from a star jumping ship, Pacers got theirs from the same star jumping ship, and Bulls got theirs from a star jumping ship (or Vucevic as the result of a fair trade as well). Really only 4 teams in the NBA have built their teams as a result of stars wanting to team up, with the Heat even being a bit of a questionable example as they didn't have much beyond Jimmy when he went there and people questioned if they'd even be competitive.  The last 2 conference finals featured 3 teams who got their stars from free agency or trade requests (including the aforementioned Heat) and 5 teams who drafted their star."
"Nick Van Exel, Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell were the shit back in the days. Kinda like D’Angelo Russel, Ingram and Julius Randle."
"Julius Randle played like a top 20 guy last year (All Star) which is how they catapulted to the 4 seed. Zach LaVine you can also argue is top 20 and surrounding him with better talent (Lonzo, DeRozan, a full year of Vucevic) you can make the case that he’ll be more efficient and have a better year.  I hear you, I’m just saying I won’t be surprised one way or the other."
"With his BBIQ and attitude on defense even when healthy, his ceiling was Julius Randle without the passing"
"I mean, when you look at that list, 4 of those seasons his player played the most minutes in the league. None of them outside of butler 18-19 was lower than 4th most minutes. I don’t think it’s a coincidence.    2011-12 — Luol Deng, 39.4 MPG - 1st   2010-11 — Luol Deng, 39.1 MPG - 4th   2012-13 — Luol Deng, 38.7 MPG - 1st   2013-14 — Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG - 2nd   2014-15 — Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG - 1st   2020-21 — Julius Randle, 37.6 MPG - 1st   2016-17 — Andrew Wiggins, 37.2 MPG - 3rd   2017-18 — Jimmy Butler, 36.7 MPG - 3rd   2018-19 — Jimmy Butler, 36.1 MPG - 27th"
I can't remember it but the one about julius randle and an arseclap was hillarious.
"I mean we don't sniff the 4 seed without Randle last year, obviously he's not as good as some other high usage guys in the league but if you're talking about a guy who had his fingerprints on the ball at all times Julius is in that category"
"There’s truth to the meme, but in reality none of his players have come close. Here are the annual leaders for his teams:    2011-12 — Luol Deng, 39.4 MPG   2010-11 — Luol Deng, 39.1 MPG   2012-13 — Luol Deng, 38.7 MPG   2013-14 — Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG   2014-15 — Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG   2020-21 — Julius Randle, 37.6 MPG   2016-17 — Andrew Wiggins, 37.2 MPG   2017-18 — Jimmy Butler, 36.7 MPG   2018-19 — Jimmy Butler, 36.1 MPG    For comparison, Monta Ellis played 40.34 in 2010-11, the last time a player averaged over 40 MPG, something that has been done [more than 250 times in NBA history](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/mp_per_g_season.html). Allen Iverson owns the highest mark of the 21st century, playing 43.7 MPG in 2001-02."
"Bagley still has so much time. I could 100% see him break out into becoming a productive starter, maybe even approach All Star status. Look at Julius Randle or Kyle Lowry. Some guys are late bloomers. And if Bags does that, he can't be considered a bust even if he's always going to be worse than Luka/Trae/JJJ."

Julius Randle was picked ahead of Nik Stauskas and Noah Vonleh not Luka Doncic and Trae Young
"I believe in Bagley, the Kings are not using him to his strengths. I can see him leaving and have a career turnaround like Julius Randle.\\"
Same people that were calling Julius Randle a bust
julius randle would be included too
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
Julius Randle
Zion is just Julius Randle with hops.
"Julius Randle, in the same season."
Julius Randle  Damian Lillard almost every year  Russell Westbrook
Julius randle
Would Morey do Julius Randle straight up? Or is he still looking for the Harden package?
Julius randle maybe?
"""Prime"" is not a hard and fast rule about your age. Rozier is still improving, and has plenty of theoretical room to grow, so I would not say he's at his prime yet.  Another step forward for Rozier this year would be the least surprising thing ever.   Whereas Collins is the opposite end of the spectrum.  Collins has been been pretty much the same guy for 3 straight years now.  If you don't improve much from 21-23, which are like the prime growth years for players, then it's quite likely that you're not going to improve too much after that.   This isn't an issue with opportunity either, as he's playing heavy minutes.  Shit happens out of nowhere sometimes - nobody ever saw Julius Randle making that kind of leap at 26.  But that's exceptionally rare."
Julius Randle? Lonzo? (If Bulls do well and he has a breakout season with good stats)
"There's a trend of players having one good season in the east and the popular view of those players is that they will continue to be that good or better for the rest of their career despite evidence that clearly shows them not being able to repeat that performance for whatever reason. Could be they got injured, were in the right situation, got more opportunity, stat padded because it was a contract year, etc..Not all identical situations, but Isiah Thomas, DLo, Oladipo, Julius Randle... Not saying they didn't have great seasons because they did, but it's not who they are on average."
"Collins has been getting a lot of hate, but it was his first playoffs and the teams Atlanta played all had good to great veterans at the PF rotation.  He was a young guy going against Blake Griffin, Giannis, Bobby Portis, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, and Julius Randle. That would be a tough gauntlet for any PF's first playoff run."
"I know everyone thinks the Lakers were tanking all those years, but as a long time Lakers fan I can tell you that was all just legitimately due to horribly incompetent front office management. They were actually trying to win, especially while Kobe was still playing, they were just awful at how they went about trying to do it.   Part of the problem was that they'd gone all in with the trades for Dwight and Nash, giving away a bunch of unprotected picks to do so, and part of it was that Dwight left immediately afterwards and Nash and Kobe suffered career-altering injuries that year, and were never close to the same players again. They bet it all and it blew up about as spectacularly as possible.  After that the Lakers approached every off-season like just cause they were the Lakers, eventually a star would sign with them, so every year they would only sign guys to one year deals so they could keep cap space for the next season. And then when nobody would sign the next season, they'd do the same thing again. They finally stopped doing this in 2016 when instead they blew all their cap space on Mozgov and Deng, which obviously was a terrible decision.   And then on top of that, the guys they picked in the draft were never home run selections. They'd show hints of promise, and have gone on to be good players since, but none were prodigies right out of the gate. D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball are all pretty solid players now, but they were mostly kinda disappointing when they were on the Lakers (especially before LeBron signed).   Like I said, they weren't trying to lose, they were just absolutely awful at trying to win."
"2021-22 Chinese Basketball Association Dream Team    PG Isiah Thomas    SG Dennis Schroder    SF Joe Harris    PF Ben Simmons    Center Rudy Gobert     Bench: Bradon Knight, John Wall, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
"Tbf we didn't really have much of an option haha. Julius Randle's stats weren't bad but he was not nearly the same player as last season; he was a crazy beyblade lmao. Marcus Morris, while a good player, is not great as arguably our #1 scoring option.   Also, because the coach wasn't Thibs, guys didn't play 40 minutes per game. I don't think a starting lineup of Elfrid Payton, RJ, Morris, Randle, Gibson playing 40 minutes would have helped us win that many more games haha. Minutes were spread around because everyone sucked and no one really solidified spots in the rotation. Team was a mess and there was no consistency, which is why last season was so shocking. I hope we make the playoffs this year but we're far from a lock imo"
So y’all have harden jr (kpj) Julius randle jr (Tate) draymond jr (Usman) and jokic jr (sengun)  Gtfoh your young core gonna be so fun to watch LOL
Julius Randle has 412 attempts from the midrange this year! 41.5% shooting but still.
Lowkey Lool  Tbh I think he’s more of a Julius Randle Jr
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn’t even close y’all got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven’t seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year
Ready for Gobert slander when Julius Randle was a potato in the post season.
"Kobe's Jersey retirement game when Larry Nance, Julius Randle, and Clarkson all dunked on KD.  This one isn't so much a notable game because something crazy happened, but I went to Lakers/Hawks in November 2019. Kobe was in attendance and it was the last time i saw him in  person."
"&gt; If he was drafted to a big market team he would easily be making at least double his salary in endorsements  This is nonsense lmao. He’s already a face of Gatorade and Jordan, and was talked about non-stop on ESPN before he played a minute in the league.  What’s he gonna do in New York that he isn’t already doing?  Julius Randle just made 2nd team all-NBA and I think I’ve seen him in an ad one time and I live here."
Honestly I think they could work together. Julius became a much better shooter and playmaker last year. They would take each other’s offensive load off a bit and Randle working the post and Zion cutting to the basket would be deadly. Their skills overlap a bit sure but I don’t think it would be a bad fit at all.  Also those two would be great together defensively/grabbing offensive boards.
julius randle wouldnt even start on our team. yall aint gonna do shit.
Knicks fans are talking about delusional. Y’all were saying the hawks were first round exit while we gentlemen swept you and reached the ecf. Y’all convinced yourself Julius randle was a star based on Covid regular season wins against injured teams. You might need to wait 20 more years to reach the ecf. I even heard that Mitchell Robinson would have changed the Knicks hawks series.
Hilarious cause I wanted Julius Randle at the time and it's only this year you could say Randle was the better player He's also having that journeyman career you spoke about.
"He's fine.  I think he's got a mentality issue where he sees himself as having a role like KAT or Julius Randle, when in reality he's more of like Niko Mirotic type player. In the right situation, if you could convince him to accept a secondary role he could be really good. He wants to be a lead player but he isn't well rounded or aggressive enough to be that player.  At the salary figure quoted he's a pretty good deal, but that's why the Bulls aren't letting him go for nothing."
"&gt;Julius Randle made 2nd team all NBA. So Randle&gt;Butler I guess huh?  Julius Randle didn't make an All Defense team sooooooo but last year, yeah you can make the case he was better.   &gt;Also funny how only one of these players averaged 25+ PPG in the regular season and 30+ PPG in the playoffs  All that to lose in 5, yikes.   &gt;I get Heat fans are down bad it’s okay, let it all out  Down bad? We had a down season, were still better than the Celtics, had a top 2 off-season meanwhile the Celtics added *checks notes* Enes Kanter and Dennis Schroeder lmao"
"Julius Randle made 2nd team all NBA. So Randle&gt;Butler I guess huh? Also funny how only one of these players averaged 25+ PPG in the regular season and 30+ PPG in the playoffs, while the other got outscored by Brynn Forbes 💀 It’s ok man, I get Heat fans are down bad it’s okay, let it all out"
Hahahahaha Julius Randle above Ben Simmons
Why is Julius Randle top 30 then?  I hate Ben but if you ask 30 GMs every single one is gonna pick Ben over randle… You can’t judge a player by a 7 game series
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
im surprised u consider julius randle as a two way player and im not mad at it at all
Julius Randle &gt; Kat   Randle led a worse knicks team with the barett as the teams next best player to more wins this past season than kat did.  Kat led the twolves to 19 wins out of the 55 games he played..
Julius Randle can win MVP one day.
"Julius Randle. He can playmake, shoot from 3 or midrange, and defend the perimeter and post."
"Legit though, the way Julius Randle shot the ball during the regular season I reckon he would balance out a team fairly well."
"Lillard, john wall, rudy gobert, Ingram, and julius randle."
"&gt; if Herro is able to do what he did in the playoffs 2 years ago consistently in the playoffs, I feel like it’ll be clear he’s the better player  If he does that then I'll agree. Although to be clear he wasn't good all-playoffs, the 6 games against the Lakers he was shooting 37% from the field. But they've been in the for two and three years. I'm going to judge them on their most recent season, just like how I'm comfortable in saying Julius Randle is a good three-point shooter."
"I just feel like people expect too much from superstars in the playoffs when their team is clearly subpar. Dame gets trapped, drops it off to nurkic who then fails to convert on the 4 on 3. Replace nurkic with even a second tier star like draymond and I think things change.    Like Julius randle this offseason. I wouldn't call that a choke. He was far and away the best offensive player on our team, and was our 4th quarter guy all season. When you double a guy like that, and he dumps it into a 4 v3 and watches his team fail to convert over and over, they have no choice but to say ""fuck it im forcing shots up""    Like I honestly think that for a smaller guard, who's best 2nd player is also a smaller guard, and who's third best player is a huge drop-off to nurkic, that he's done pretty well for himself. Like even a injured team like the jrue/rondo/ad pelicans SHOULD put those blazers to bed... they defend the guard spot well, and have a wing/center that is hard to stop. Should be all it takes to beat the blazers no matter how clutch dame is"
"Yes, I'm judging players who have been in the league 2/3 years on their most recent season - I don't think that's unreasonable. Julius Randle is a good 3-point shooter, even if he was not in the previous year.  I did point out that Herro actually takes more of his 3's from the corner, and the assist% for their shots aren't as large as you'd think (from 3 Donte's .779, Herro .729) - either way both are taking the majority of their 3's assisted.  &gt; Tyler herro shooting somewhat the same percentages, slightly higher even, but also shooting more than donte actually does show he’s more efficient.  'Higher' is doing work here when the difference between their TS% is static. And yes, Herro is better at creating his own shot (but by less than their reputations) and is taking three more shots on the same efficiency. But the difference there is neglibale when Donte, both on his year coming off the bench and starting, has a greater offensive impact because of his ability to get offensive rebounds *better than any other shooting guard in the league*. On defense the difference is even more extreme; for example Donte's DWS's for the 2019-20 season (where he was coming off the bench) matches Herro's combined offensive and defensive WS's for both years he's been in the league. There's absolutely no comparison on defense, and offensively by every metric that includes more than a players ability to create their own shots, Donte still has a greater positive impact."
Julius Randle
"Julius Randle only had 14 points on 13% from the field in a playoff game, far worse than Wilt’s 100 IMO /s"
"Guys who made all star appearances that people will forget on sporcle quizzes: Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Chris Kaman, Victor Oladipo, Deangelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, Julius Randle, Goran Dragic, and Roy Hibbert."
Julius Randle
"He, IQ, and McBride all give me that impression. I love it. And they have Julius Randle to learn from in terms of work ethic"
[Julius Randle](https://twitter.com/john_jastremski/status/1426575140821864451?s=19)
"If Julius Randle improves upon last season, he can be better than Giannis."
Why would the Knicks trade Julius Randle for FVV lmao
julius randle
Pretty clear Julius Randle is on track for mvp while kemba Walker return to a 20+ and 9 ast a game all star is there feel good story of the year. RJ earns the first Knicks pick resigned since Charlie ward and the Knicks have to figure out how we can afford to keep Mitch Robinson after leading league in fg% again + top 3 in blocks.
Julius Randle
Sorry about that. Do I need to include MIP for Julius Randle too?
"There is no guarantee in free agency. Knicks thought they will get Kyrie and KD in 2019, they got Julius Randle, Bobby Portis and Taj Gibson instead.  Trading for a Carmelo gives them an edge in negotiations."
"Not like LAL can develop talent to save their lives anyway...  Outside of Caruso, and *maybe* KCP, what players drafted by the Lakers have actually blossomed there?  Julius Randle - After leaving LA, he gets huge MIP noise, and even some MVP discussion after leading NYK back to the Playoffs.  D'Angelo Russell - After leaving LA, he becomes one of the centerpieces of a young Brooklyn team that made it back to the Playoffs after a decent absence.  Jordan Clarkson - After leaving LA, he wins 6MOTY on UTAH, is instrumental in putting The Jazz in the position to make the (admittedly disappointing) post-season run they did.  Lonzo Ball - Has greatly improved his shooting to become one of the more coveted 3&amp;D guys on the market (4yrs, 85mil coveted).  Brandon Ingram - Turns into KD-lite, shows flashes on Tatum-level ability. Very impressive young guy.  Point is, even without Lebron not allowing some of these guys the chance to grow, which of them were even likely to grow when The Lakers talent development is such booty?  Leaving the team seems to have worked out better for many of them in terms of improving their individual game."
are you *seriously* trying to compare Julius Randle to Anthony Davis. did you just think we wouldn't notice.
Julius Randle is NOT better than AD
By that logic AD sucks compared to Julius Randle

Holy shit the Julius Randle disrespect is just fucking insane. How in God’s name is Bam that much above him being categorically worse at everything besides rebounding and only barely.
Julius Randle
"Oh really, because last time I checked no team that the Bucks faced during their championship run could win in Milwaukee except for the Hawks.  Not the heat, not the Nets, and not the Suns.  In that game 1 win Trae put up 48 and like 6-8 assists and rebounds.  I agree its a team game, but teams don't win NBA championships anywhere near as much as Superstars do.  Trae Young is a Superstar.  Julius Randle is a ball boy."
"Hawks, Julius Randle was way too nervous this year, give him another year or two in the PO’s and he’ll be less streaky. Lmaoooo cardiac Kemba gone go into cardiac arrest after injuring his knees tryna stay on Trae young for 4-7 games. Evan Fournier just isn’t the same imo but hey who knows knicks might be the spot for him. All the other guys are rookies except Robinson who definitely would be the series changer to me but I’m still taking hawks in 7"
"If you were an NBA coach and had Pierce and James in their best defensive year and were playing last years Knicks in the NBA Finals, who would you put on Julius Randle? Pierce or Harden?  Same question now but change Randle to Lebron now, who you assigning to Lebron?  Same question again but change Lebron to Kobe, whos your guy?"
"You could say the same about most teams. What’s the last big name free agent The Knicks signed? Julius Randle?Ok, same name for pelicans then one year earlier. Even had arguably a better year there than with the knicks last year. Main difference is that’s also the year Davis quit on the team."
Julius Randle is just Bobby Portis with 40 MPG and unlimited shots
Kat won 19out of the 55 gamesthat he was healthy last season. Kat really struggles to win games. Twolves hav Russell and Malik so it’s not even that bad a team...  even Julius Randle led a worse knicks team with rj barett as the second best player to more wins.
Julius Randle looks to be following that late bloomer path too
Julius Randle I think his 3pt shooting was a liiiitle flukey.  Cp3 pretty unlikely he stays healthy for another whole season.  JV I liked his fit a lot better in Memphis than I do in New Orleans.
Julius Randle.
Julius Randle took like 5-6yrs until his first all star appearance  Jerami Granr potentially could be an all-star next season.  Probably a few more players too.
"&gt; It would be easy to think that the MIP award is worthless; however, other recent winners include: Giannis, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, and Dragic.  &gt; All-stars, champions, All-NBA players, etc.  cj mccollum has not been either an all star, all-nba, or a champion. why was he mentioned?  also why is merely being all-star or all-nba sufficient to say you ""have something to show for it""? if that's the case then considering four out of five of the named indiana players made all-star or all-nba (or both), that means they too have something to show for it"
CJ McCollum? What the fuck have the blazers achieved with CJ McCollum?  Add in Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram
"I didn’t say he fell off because of the fans in the playoffs. Guess your reading comprehension is a bit rough, usually is for knicks fans.   It’s clear once teams game plan for him even a bit his shooting just disappears. He caught a lot of teams off guard last year with his improved shooting. I think as teams adjust his numbers will come back down to earth.   Also you’re acting like I’m saying he’s gonna go back down to a sub 30% like he’s been his entire career. I’m saying he’s likely closer to 35-37 than 41% which would make him one of the best snipers in the entire league.   No need to start crying about. Even Julius randle knew what he was. If he truly thought he could replicate his shooting from last year he wouldn’t have resigned on that dea. He knows this season was a fluke in terms of shooting"

"The article explains his thinking: LaVine was amazing last year, but his improvement over prior years was so dramatic that he's unlikely to repeat it.  &gt;So, having placed LaVine in Tier 3, why does he remain in 3C after his spectacular 2020-21? It has less to do with him and everything to do with 2020-21. With the turbocharged offense and extremely hot shooting seen around the league for much of the year, I have a blanket skepticism toward players who managed outlier-type career seasons. It came up Tuesday in the discussion of Julius Randle, and I’ll reiterate similar points with LaVine, but he set a career high in true shooting by nearly 6 points. Entering last season as a career 48.4 percent shooter on 2-pointers, LaVine made 57.1 percent a year ago. He exceeded his career marks by a stupendous amount from every area of the floor:  &gt;. . .  I’m again willing to be proven incorrect by the coming season, but I need to see at least one more year at close to that level before I totally buy such a universal jump in performance as sustainable and real."
That’s why Julius Randle was smart.
Knicks fans gonna hate this but this will be a replaced with “Julius Randle 2021”
A: Dennis Schröder  B: RJ Barrett (Siakam apparently.)  D: Ben Simmons  E: Julius Randle
"Could be, who knows. But, agents have a lot more power and influence then we might expect sometimes. It's not unusual for a player to not have any part in contract negotiations until it's time to put pen to paper. You have agents who might not outright tell their clients what to do, but they'll definitely lead them down the path the agent wants them to go.   And grudges between organizations/front offices and agents/agencies aren't unusual either.  For a decade, any player repped by Aaron Mintz did not have a long relationship or any a relationship at all for that matter with the Lakers.  I believe it started with Ariza back in 2009 and how that contract negotiation fell apart. You wonder why Carmelo never signed with the Lakers? Why dangelo Russell and Julius Randle didn't last long with the Lakers? Why Paul George and his courting with the Lakers took a turn for the worse? I believe even Josh Hart and Lonzo were clients of Aaron Mintz during their time with the Lakers. How did that turn out.  But, it's amazing how things can come full circle and fences can mended. Both Ariza and Carmelo recently signed with the Lakers. Guess who's still their agent?"
I’m going with the Knicks because they have the current best player out of both teams in Julius Randle. Randle is better then Zach Levine and Demarr.
"Jordan Clarkson, Julius randle, Larry Nance Jr, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, d’Angelo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have all turned out decent to amazing. You’re just talking out of your ass 😂"
"&gt;From what I’ve seen clippers fans just wanna chill and be left alone to enjoy their team and watch basketball.   As a Laker fan honestly my issue isn't with Clipper fans at all. It's been probably 10 years since I've had an interaction with one in person, and the ones on here are mostly pretty cool. My dislike for the Clippers is about the Clippers themselves, mainly because they will not shut up about how much they hate the Lakers.   I mean, if James Dolan and Tom Thibodeau and Julius Randle were constantly giving interviews and posting on social media about how much they hated the Raptors, I feel like Raptor fans would pretty quickly develop a real ""fuck the Knicks"" kind of vibe, don't you think? I think this would be the case even if Knicks fans were generally pretty cool online.   If one team spends an inordinate amount of time fixating on the team you root for the way the Clippers have with the Lakers, then you're gonna grow to dislike them. The Clippers as an organization are seemingly doing everything they can to brand themselves as ""the anti-Lakers"", so is it really any wonder why Laker fans don't like them? My guess is Ballmer must feel like there's no such thing as bad publicity and he'd rather the Clippers were hated in LA than ignored."
"I think Miami losing in the first round is way less bold than saying Luka will win MVP.  Luka got zero first-place votes last season. He got 42 points in the voting. Now, for reference, CP3 was the player who finished directly above Doncic. Paul had 139 points. Julius Randle had 20 points. So, voters thought Luka's value was multiple times closer to Randle's than CP3.   Miami won zero playoff games last year. The lost their last three playoffs games by 34, 29 and 17.   Last season, the Heat finished in 6th place in the East. If Miami doesn't finish at least in fifth place, they will be lucky to even win a first-round game vs MIL, BKN or PHI. Hawks seem on the verge of a breakout (and finished ahead of MIA last season.) Maybe the Heat could jump the Knicks, but there's also the chance BOS jumps MIA.   I don't have anything against Lowry, but he will also be 36 before the season ends and, with the exception of the Kawhi year, has/had a reputation of coming up short when it matters most."
Julius fucking RANDLE is better than Bradley Beal
"This is exactly true. How many big, punishing PFs are there in the NBA anymore? Giannis and...? And how many PFs nowadays really bully the opposition like that? Maybe Julius Randle also? Aaron Gordon? I think LeBron is going to be fine. If they really need to go big occasionally, they can always put Dwight in there and slide AD and LeBron down a spot."
Julius Randle probably had the worst series this year lol. But yeah Siakam was trash
"Top 5-7 is also top 10.  MVP ladder… yeah  I don’t really care. You think Julius Randle, Derrick Rose and Rudy Gobert were top 10 players in 2021, they were all top 10 in MVP voting.  It’s okay he was a teenager, and he was significantly better as a teenager than Kobe Bryant or Kevin Garnett who are two top 20 players of all time. LeBron I believe is second only to Jordan, there is no reason to pretend he was better than he was in 2003-2004."
Maybe Julius Randle or Myles Turner
"&gt; (41)  Julius Randle, New York Knicks  Bro what..."
Julius Randle.
Julius Randle
"I mean it literally did, it helps every star who plays in the East. Lebron was a US star before getting to the league, but not well known outside of the US or the sports world tbh.  Playing in the east, consistently being on national TV with the most viewers, playing exciting series against Detroit, Boston, Orlando, Chicago exploded Lebron's popularity between 06-10.  For example, Julius Randle is one of the most prominent dudes in the east despite not being all that amazing and it's largely because Knicks + primetime eastern slot. He's got a shit tonne of eyes on him. Just look at Trae's popularity after one Knicks series.  The primetime eastern slot in the most watched slot in the NBA, in all US TV IIRC. It absolutely pushed Lebron into a global megastar."
I’d feel bad for Julius Randle
"You made a post about why you like Julius Randle, instead of how he's not being talked about enough.  I downvoted."
Most Improved Player Julius Randle?
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
It’s gonna be MPJ. It’s not like Julius Randle “massively improved” last season from the season before.
"To be clear I'll rely on one of those metrics the day I doesnt see stuff like :  \- DRPM : Julius Randle, Joe Harris,Duncan Robinson and Jamal Murray in the top 15  \- DWS : Julius Randle, Jokic , Russ and Tobi Harris in the top 15  \- DBPM : Mason Plumlee, washed up Iggy, and TJ McConnell in the top 15 (Won't even mention who is 16th because it's hilarious)  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah for now I'll rely on my eye test, as flawed as it is, it's still better than total BS like that"
"Id call that bs. The way this is phrased, your best player is anthony davis. Then you can have the next 8 guys that are slightly worst than Anthony davis.   100% that roster wins a ring  Imo, you have to get to top 25 ish to start this question. Can julius randle and the next 8 best guys win a chip?  Thats the question"
He's not really a star. Just the best player on his team last season. I wouldn't say a team with Julius Randle as one of their stars is going anywhere in the post season
Julius Randle - Average Starter  Seems a bit rough.
Superstar = potential #1 option on champ squad.  Superstars: Giannis &amp; Steph   All stars: Donovan Mitchell &amp; Jason Tatum   Roleplayers:  * Trae Young * Jrue Holiday * Khris Middelton * DeAndre Ayton * Karl-Anthony Towns * Julius Randle * Klay Thompson  * Booker
Julius Randle
"For the Knicks, it will be that an opposing team will figure out a defensive scheme to stop both Julius Randle and Kemba Walker, and they won't be able to offensively overcome it. Also, RJ Barrett will be solid player this coming season, but still not an all-star level player the caliber of Paul George or Jimmy Butler, which is what the Knicks need him to be to REALLY get over the hump.     I legit hope I'm wrong in all of this, and that the Knicks do in fact have what it takes to win a championship."
"Any of the young player on the lakers? Julius Randle, Brendon Ingram, and lonzo ball"
Julius Randle I guess?
"&gt; He received mvp votes in his 04/05 season and his 06/07 season despite the year in between being better statistically.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, and Julius Randle received MVP votes this season. Were they MVP level guys?"
Julius Randle for Walt Frazier or Pat Ewing? Hmmmm...
"West definitely still stronger, the East is coming off a year where Julius Randle managed to finish 8th in MVP voting &amp; gain the same seed as the Clippers led by Kawhi-PG, it was super watered down.  Pelicans, Suns, Grizzlies Spurs, there's a lot of young teams getting better and Utah likely beats any Eastern team healthy."
"julius randle. i think most people think his last season was a fluke and he’ll drop a little, especially now that the knicks have more scoring options. he figured out “how to offseason” and will actually be better this season."
Lol this has happened to the Lakers for awhile.  Kobe -&gt; Jeremy Lin -&gt; Zo -&gt; Lebron -&gt; Brodie (?)  Not to talk about the divisions that exist between the fans (and do with all teams) like the whole  Larry Nance vs Julius Randle debacle
"Man oh man, this sub loves underrating dudes who had long tails to their career. Kings/pre-knee injury Webber is a decent Embiid comp. A bit smaller, a better passer, but a similar package of handles, shotmaking, and post moves and force. Julius Randle could never, come on now."
"One other point though, being the best (or third or fourth) center for any given season doesn't mean you're the third best center in the league. For example, Julius Randle was probably the 3rd best PF last season. I don't think he is the third best PF in the league though. Players have up seasons, players have down seasons, injuries happen. All those thing impact seasonal awards. I wouldn't have ranked Drummond as the third best center after the 2015-2016 season, but saying he had the third best season of all centers is fine and a different statement."
Julius Randle for any of Ewing/Frazier/Reed/King/Melo is a no brainer.
Julius Randle for Walt Frazier? Yes please. Clyde would not only be surviving but thriving in today’s NBA. Devastating and demonstrating all over the Garden.
"Maybe a Julius Randle + M.Robinson type deal, big maybe"
"I think it’s the manner of getting better. There’s a difference between drafting good players and internal improvement vs going out and signing a bunch of good vets with little long-term value.  Kemba, DRose, and Fournier are all on the wrong side of the aging curve, and New York does not have any young players that seem like future superstars. Julius Randle is the only guy you can possibly see becoming a bonafide superstar but even that is unlikely from how his play style fits in the modern NBA."
"Julius Randle choked in the playoff. Straight up.  But the difference between him and Ben was that Randle gave his effort. He gave his effort the entire season, and got game planned in the playoffs which shut him down. He tried to get us back in it, but missed those shots.  And that's fine, for now at least. But if he pulled a Ben Simmons and completely gave up he woulda destroyed whatever goodwill he built over the last year- just like Ben did."
Add Jimmy Butler and Julius Randle too.
Julius Randle
"But he doesn’t make up for his size with his other intangibles because the way his finished in the paint is too physical for him to sustain and the way he was as a defender is even worse.   Being 5th in MVP voting doesn’t equate to being a top 10 player. For example, Julius Randle this season was 8th in MVP voting, Derrick Rose was 9th.   Do you think Derrick Rose being the 9th is the most objective assessment of Rose’s season where he was top 10?  And injuries is a part of his size. The dude is getting smashed by players way bigger than him."
"Himself  Nobody defeats Julius Randle like Julius Randle, I truly believe if he has competent teammates and good direction from his coach he could be a possible MVP. For right now he needs to focus on not falling into his bad habits and keeping defend honest with his 3 point shot."
I will take Julius Randle over Siakam every day of the week
*Julius Randle liked this*
Julius Randle yes I am high on the Knicks hype train
Marcus Smart   Tobias Harris   Aaron Gordon  Julius Randle   Robert Williams
"Julius Randle  Knicks have a much better roster around him compared to last year and I believe he’s still on an upward trajectory. I truly believe he can take another step with his development into becoming an MVP caliber player now that we have shooters around him but also guys who can get their own bucket in Walker and Fournier. That kind of pressure release is going to let him flourish even more, or he could be worse I mean who really knows lol."
"Too hypothetical imo. I also wouldn't be opposed than a current era Mikan being like a Jonas Valenciunas hybrid center or something bizarre but good. Idek about Vern, he most likely wouldn't even be as good as Julius Randle but I could be wrong bc it's hypothetical. You do bring up a good point. But from what we know, this list makes sense."
Julius Randle? Idk
"Julius Randle. I strongly believe he'll put up MVP type numbers again, but the Knicks will be taken seriously so he'll get actual votes."
De'Aaron Fox never played in the playoffs and that is certainly a knock against his value. You don't know if he would choke/exposed like Julius Randle.
"Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Vucevic 🔥"
Totally agree and would emphasize the point that players develop on different timelines. Donovan Mitchell was a late lottery pick and turned into a star in 1 season. Julius randle needed three teams and five years to figure things out and honestly situation also plays a big role. It could be multiple seasons before we have any idea how good Cade can be.
"Homer pick, Julius Randle. If he improves from last year I don’t see why not."
"PG: John Wall, SG: Kelly Oubre, PF: Julius Randle, SF: Jimmy Butler, C: James Wiseman.  Opinion based on current contracts."
I personally don’t see Julius Randle having an all-nba season again. They should be more well rounded but I think their record will decline.
Julius Randle got just 6 mil a year more. Sink your teeth into that.
That Lonzo/Brandon Ingram/DLo/Julius Randle would be “out of the league in two years”  Or even better that Ingram = Travis Outlaw
Julius Randle is better than Siakam and it isn't close
RJ Barrett &gt; Julius Randle
"Maybe it’s because this sub is r/Raptors2, but Julius Randle is better than Pascal Siakam"
"Listen my guy I fucking love Julius Randle and it kills me to say this in defense of a God damn nets player above all else, but if Julius Randle can get MVP votes this year than fuckin absolutely yes, Kyrie had/may still have MVP potential."
"This was LeBron's last game against the Lakers before he signed with them. The Lakers [won this game in a blowout](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201803110LAL.html) behind 36, 14 &amp; 7 from Julius Randle to 24, 10 &amp; 7 from LeBron."
Lmao number 30 is Julius Randle 😂
"Just wanna say people probably said this same thing about Julius Randle before, and he wasn't even a hyped prospect like that.  Have some patience, damn."
It’s ok Zion will just play the same role Julius Randle did and Julius has a great history with NOLA

"All players compete against the same teams, just  a different amount of times. If we’re talking about individual performance, what matters is defence and while the west was loaded with great teams, most of them were offence oriented which didn’t hurt LA’s abilities to put up numbers, and as a result get selected. Also at the end of the day, they’re strictly a subjectively selected award. Julius Randle was not a top 15 player last year regardlsss of injuries but he comfortably slipped into All NBA. It’s politics cause he was the face of the successful Knicks. Let’s compare them as individuals.  In their best seasons  Bosh 24.0/10.8/2.4 59% TS +2.0 DRTG  Aldridge 23.4/10.2/1.7 53% TS -2.9 DRTG  For their primes they averaged an identical 20/8.6, with Bosh being 2.5% more efficient and superior defensively. And keep in mind, Bosh had several years where his stats were hindered due to being a third option. He was better as a third option to bron and Wade than LA was as a second option to Kawhi"
Julius Randle
"You're sitting there trying to tell me the #1 seed in entire NBA is worse than the #3 seed in the East.  Trying to tell me a defense that has to double BG is elite, doesn't add up.    Knicks also possessed the 4th best defense in the NBA thanks to playing out East.  You think Trae Young &amp; Julius Randle compare to Jokic, PG, Kawhi, Luka, Lebron, AD?  It makes sense if you look at the big picture.  Doc Rivers, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Westbrook-Beal, etc.  It's extremely weak top to bottom."
KD played much weaker competition even in the regular season.  Julius Randle finished 8th in MVP voting leading the Knicks to the 4th seed 🤦‍♂️right behind Milwaukee.    Lebron-AD had to play in the play in out West.
I've never seen someone so happy to set screens as Julius Randle was here. He knew what he was seeing.
Julius Randle    jk
Next thing you know it’s “Julius Randle looks like my dad’s dick”
My best guess is Julius Randle if he puts on another shit show in the playoffs like he did this year.
"It's probably the most accurate on here.  Any Western player automatically has the edge over any eastern player.    LBJ-AD were behind Jokic, Luka, Kawhi, PG, fighting for the same seed as the Beal-WB Wizards out East.  Julius Randle looked like an MVP (finished 8th) &amp; led his team to the 4th seed out east so these aren't very impressive achievements."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
When the warriors were at their peak if you would’ve replaced draymond with Julius randle they would’ve won more.
"there's a huge difference between trying and failing (julius randle in the playoffs) and being too scared to even attempt a shot.  it's not the lack of 4th quarter points vs the hawks, it's the almost complete lack of attempts.  that shows a major mental problem or fear of failure that 100% will not just go away on its own.  if ben does not go to a sports psychologist to work on this, it will only get worse."
"Brandon Ingram isn't a centerpiece player on a roster ? Just made his first all star team  Julius randle isn't a centerpiece ?! He just made all NBA lo  What are talking about lol  So lebron says something, and you don't believe it....i get it, you just have something against lebron, that kind of brings context to all of the other ridiculous things youve been saying  Clearly you don't watch basketball, you just watch skip Bayless and bring his takes back to here"
"How so? We have had super agents do stuff since MJ. Mintz is a hated by the Lakers. Tried to corner them with Ariza (where they signed Artest) during a championship run.   The Lakers tried to sign Paul George, they did sign Ed Davis, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and DLo. No GM risk even a fringe NBA player because of the agent. You won’t find a good player who doesn’t have an agent do all this stuff.   Rich hasn’t done anything worse than another agent. And even if it was the player that did it, it doesn’t matter. Take Dwight. He left the Lakers which lead to their worst stretch in franchise history. When they had a chance to sign him as a backup center (when most of the league wasn’t interested in him at all) the Lakers signed him. So no, Rich using his leverage won’t ever affect his job."
&gt;he just got to play with arguably the best player he’s ever played with in Jrue Holiday  Are you on crack? Kris Middleton literally made all star teams while Jrue has 0.   &gt;If Giannis had Rich Paul as his agent he probably would’ve left Milwaukee years ago.  Give me one Klutch player that has forced a move that isn't named Anthony Davis.  &gt;AD couldn’t get the job done so he gets a free pass to LA to play with one of the GOATs?  Yeah fuck him for not winning a championship with Jrue Holiday and the 2018 version of Julius Randle.
"I predicted that if the Knicks somehow made the playoffs it would mean Julius Randle would have an All Star, All NBA type season. Now did I really think any of that would happen? Hell nah lmao"
"Maybe this isn't that surprising but I predicted Julius Randle would be an All-Star.  I thought he would make it in 2020.  He made me look real dumb that year, but made me look smart this year."
"Yeah. Julius Randle was getting some MVP buzz this past season. Obviously he didn't win, but there was talk, and that dude will probably never even be considered for HoF"
"Julius Randle had an awful awful first season with us, but turned it around and genuinely inspired our fanbase. I would literally run through a wall for my guy Jules now."
"Extended not re-signed. Curry, Doncic, SGA, Trae Young, Embiid, Jimmy Butler, and Julius Randle got extended. Doesn’t make those teams winners. Also the Nets STILL have Harden and Irving as FAs next season so it’s not like that extension assures their core stays together for multiple seasons or something. Signing solid bench players is just that, solid. Not great and definitely not a win since none of those bench players even took discounts. Also lost a huge contributor in Jeff Green. They aren’t a winner, they aren’t a loser, but they are somewhere in between."
"I think Julius randle got too much love. Everybody was on the train.   I think Paul George gets too much hate. Man is a baller, who yes, says some questionable things, but has undeniable on court talent."
Julius Randle
Julius Randle
Julius Randle revived the Knicks franchise so that’s doubtful
Jaylen Brown  Julius Randle  Pascal Siakam
"It's the covid bump players. Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton all got a pretty good reputation boost for being available when most of their peers were sick or hurt, but I think the biggest boosts went to **Jokic** and **Randle**.  Julius Randle is an elite player like Jokic is an MVP-- which is to say that his name is only coming up if 75% of the guys above him are hurt, sick, or both. They were prolific in the Covid-addled mess of 2020-2021, and so they got the attention. Now Jokic is pencilled in as an MVP candidate and Randle as an all-NBA level player going forward. Jokic is GREAT and Randle is GOOD, but we all know MVP and all-NBA, respectively, is NOT who those guys are."
"Brandon Ingram has never been an all star. You’ll know he’s an all star when the pelicans are actually good and on pace to make the playoffs. It’s like last year with Julius Randle, before the season nobody ever thought he’d be an all star, but the he won game after game for the Knicks and his play had become elevated to that level. Big numbers aren’t enough to get your first all star selection, you need to win games."
They sat him after the trade demand. He made it clear he wanted to go to LA and only LA. So the team played Julius Randle instead.
"Yeah. I asked the same thing going into 2018 draft. I could see the writing on the wall. He wasn't like Julius randle, and had attitude markers. Randle was always tough nosed, but willing to keep pushing himself to become the player he is today with constructive criticism. Bagley didn't try to expand his game at all in college, and similar to DSJ, used his athleticism for everything. Randle pushed himself. Always."
What? Ben Simmons is not a negative asset. He's an incredibly talented player that would need a different role in Portland. He'd have to play more like Zion or Julius Randle (before the shot) instead of Magic.
"Do folks know whether there is any room to trade Simmons for a package including Julius Randle? He's an All-Star player, a bit older than Simmons, but he likely offers more than Simmons does to a contending team."
"As good as Julius Randle is now, there are sometimes when he devolves back into his human Beyblade nonsense. Its not as often these days, but its kinda funny when it happens"
"I can't think of a single party in this event that isn't getting what they deserve. Ben has shown no drive to improve his shooting and that's unacceptable, but Philly as an organization tanked his value in a matter of months and the fans wrecked his confidence in a winnable series against a team smart enough to exploit this. Any anticipation that he'd play again in front of that crowd was dumb as shit. I hope that this humbles him and he ends up sorting his shit out in a place with a reasonable contract. This last season Julius Randle played his ass off and won MIP after some mediocre seasons where he showed flashes of talent. I see no reason why a dpoy candidate wouldn't be able to make at least some degree of progress in a different location with better team chemistry. But if he doesn't want to work for it he'll end up floating around non-contending franchises in an unremarkable career."
"It's not really gonna be that funny. Julius Randle had a 2-3 year stretch where he only played losing basketball, and now suddenly he's an All Star. It doesn't make all the past criticism he got funny because all that stuff was 100% true at the time. The same would be true if Ben Simmons miraculously filled in the holes in his game and became an MVP candidate."
"Every player was doing it. I remember in the playoffs Julius Randle Jumped right in to Trae ""with a non basketball move"" and got three free throws. It was ridiculous but couldn't say anything because the league allowed it to happen. Should have been addressed years ago."
"Mile Bridge so far being this year's Julius Randle. Except for Bridges it is even better because of much better shooting efficiency and him being 3 years younger. I have no idea if it will hold up but if it does, Charlotte will become a contender soon enough."

Miles is having the same sort of start that Julius Randle had last year.
"&gt; Julius Randle  to be fair, randle took a discount"
"They also let Thomas Bryant go that same summer, along with Julius Randle."
"Definitely agree, no way he's worth the 5/175 but the other contract would put him around 27.5 AAV which is right around John Collins, Julius Randle, and Jaren Jackson Jr, so that is somewhat more reasonable."
"All of them teammates at different times and all oft injured. How many minutes did that AD, Gordon, Jrue and Ryan Anderson lineup ever play together? Lol  Also, some of them weren’t as good then. You tried to slide in Julius Randle when he was essentially an empty stats player (as much as I like Randle) at that point still who only revolutionized his game last year  And when he even made the playoffs his 2nd best player got hurt. Jrue was dealing with injuries in 2015 &amp; Boogie ruptured his Achilles in 2018 as AD had to take on the Warriors."
"Don’t pretend like Davis had scrub teammates. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Boogie Cousins, Rondo, Mirotic and even a healthy Julius Randle. Yes there were plenty of unlock injuries, but there were also plenty of solid lineups that lacked a true Alpha  Those 18-19 Pelicans could’ve been special if AD didn’t quit halfway through the year. Three guys averaged over 20ppg plus they had Mirotic balling out and even had Christian Wood for a couple weeks"
"I agree with everything you said, but hopefully he can figure it out. Bol Bol kind of reminds me of Julius Randle when he was with the Lakers (Randle obviously being much better). Randle has a me-first, superstar type game but wasn't yet good enough to earn that role and didn't have the type of game that translated into being a role player...while Larry Nance Jr was a stud role player who fit perfectly and so earned minutes over Randle despite being objectively a worse player. Randle eventually figured it out but Bol Bol has a much steeper hill to climb."
"Kd was 21, still shot better than randle by a huge margin because he got to the free throws line a bunch and played the eventual champions in the Lakers. Don’t ever compare Julius randle to Durant"
julius randle has more APG than steph curry at the moment
So excited to watch 8-infinity Julius Randle

According to his numbers so far Julius Randle is about to have a hell of a season
"According to your model, Julius Randle is about to have a hell of a season."
"Positive stat posts are cool, especially if the player is underrated or overhated  Negative ones are bad. Only one I've made was on Julius Randle which I promptly deleted soon after"
Julius Randle looks like a catfish
Julius Randle has a face like a Pixar villain but if Jojo likes him he’s alright by me.
"Russ, Chris Paul, LeBron.  I'd also put Julius Randle in there. Not decline in the same sense as the other one, but I don't think he's going to give us another 20/10/5 season."
You think Julius Randle deserves one over Tatum then?
Julius Randle. Tried a lot of shit in the playoffs and he’s done this his whole career when he’s frustrated
yeah I really like the idea of getting turner for you guys. Honestly maybe give up Gordon to get him? I just tried the trade machine and Richards and Gordon for Lamb and Turner works. Lamb with 1 year left and a good spot up shooter opens up Cap to keep Bridges and Turner lets you push plumlee to the bench and give Kai Jones some spot minutes. Haywards a great facilitator but isn't the vocal vet presence that really helps this team develop.   I forgot about scary Terry. Really wish we'd kept him over Marcus (despite Marcus's winning plays^tm).   But yeah both our Williams are taking big steps this year and Al is going to help us a lot handle guys like Randle and Bridges (who I see as a similar player to Julius). We just need to stay healthy which since IT has seemingly been impossible.
"3 problems with 'The Mailman' in 2021:  1. Not a 3 point shooter. 2. Not a lob threat. 3. Dependent on low PnR setups for most of his offense.  At best, I'd expect him to be Julius Randle without the 3 point range."
Julius randle doing to much and spinning into the paint and constantly getting turnovers.
"Guarantee Awkward Speech is gonna say smth like ""Julius Russell Westbrook Randle"""
Yeah Julius Randle for DPOY lmao
Julius “Russell Westbrook” Randle
Would’ve mean you guys had Durant instead of Julius randle tho
Yup. Team record is probably why Miles got the nod over KD or Julius Randle too. I thought Zach Lavine had a good shot for the East this week.
I took it to mean that Randle was better at 3s &amp; defense than Sabonis. Not that he is only a 3&amp;D player.  And I agree with you. I'm a big Julius fan. I got downvoted all the time for saying that Julius would get better after his first season here on the knicks sub haha. I wanted Julius on the team before KP was shipped off.
people got upset someone suggested Zion would be Julius Randle with hops. You take a good player and give them some bonus attributes and they are legitimate monsters.   If you gave Randle Zions athleticism he would be an mvp candidate.

FRANZ WAGNER EXPOSED JULIUS RANDLE
"I’m sorry but Julius Randle cannot be the #1 guy. When his shot isn’t falling, he’s not creating and leading the team in other ways. When he’s off the teams off that’s why they got spanked in the playoffs"
"yea KD regretting not being able to play with Julius ""shot 30% in the playoffs"" Randle"
"Same things happen for people that get deep in the righteous causes as well, from climate change to social justice. People can get wrapped up in the narrative with 110% certainty that they’re correct and it’s their calling to educate and change. It changes people when they get militant. And it sucks to watch, whether you agree with their stance or not. Even when their stance is for the greater good. What I mean to say is, it can be difficult to watch the folks we love change and become aggressive.   I understand this may be controversial, but I’m just trying to make a simple point that Julius Randle is gonna be even better than last year, the Knicks offseason moves were highly underrated and RJ Barrett is primed to make that 3rd year leap into an all-star caliber player."
"Your statement is true. I also feel the sf postion is absolute because ""sf"" are turning and coming into the league as pointguards now. Lamelo ,luka, cade. Tatum isn't an above average passer hence why he goes pf as his secondary. The top pf under 30 is giannas, zion ,A.d. and Julius Randle. He would be the 3rd best at that position in 3 years with no added names."
"Realistically, no.   But, in theory, yes.  This line-up, if it was ever assembled, would win a ring IMO:   PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Norman Powell  SF: Khris Middleton  PF: Julius Randle  C: Bam Adebayo"
Come and be a Knicks fan. You’ll have former Pelican Julius Randle to root for.
Please see Julius Randle and the NY Knicks. #WEHERE!
Never thought someone could be so happy to be good for one season lol. In the last 20 years you guys havent been a complete joke for *checks notes* 3 seasons         And I’m not one of the Pacer fans that hate the Knicks either. I’m glad you guys are good now. I am a big fan of Julius Randle
Don't forget about Julius Randle
Spelled Julius Randle wrong.
He's below average but can hit the occasional 3. If he starts shooting like say Julius Randle he's an All Star

What about Julius Randle OP?
Julius Randle today is nothing ABSOLUTELY nothing like when he played in the west
Julius Randle is a top 20 player.
Still have my Julius Randle Lakers jersey and will always be hyped for him
"he's young-_ish_.... 23yo, had a pretty sus jump in his 3P% in his last year of college while his FT% has been consistently &lt;70%.  think he's largely considered fully-cooked, high floor low ceiling.  also tricky that he's undersized, but decent wingspan for being 6'0"" barefoot.  that said, who knows?  he could be the next julius randle."
"&gt;*his best teammate he ever recieved tore his achilles.*  His second-best teammate was an all-defense, allstar named Jrue.  His second-third best teammates were Boogie/Rondo.  Then there were his other 'bum' teammates Julius Randle and Christian Wood."
He’d have scored like 9 points playing for the Lakers. He didn’t really benefit playing alongside Lebron/AD. If anything I think it slowed his growth as a player. The past 2 seasons he didn’t look like the player they chose to keep over Julius Randle.
Julius Randle is just fucking incredible
Julius Randle is the new Michael Myers. You can't kill him or contain him.
Nice to see Julius Randle hasn’t stopped being good at basketball like many thought he would be
He's the main reason why Julius Randle looked average in the first round.  Offensively right now he's kinda like Middleton but we don't know if he's as good because he got injured when he was catching his stride. It looked like he was on his way to averaging around 18 a game before then.
"The best lineup I can think of:   PG: **Trae Young** - lacks the size to be a SG  SG: **Bradley Beal** - too small to be a SF, can't run point  SF: **Gordon Hayward** - most SFs are pretty versatile but Hayward is one of the few who can't really slide to SG or PF, despite having a range of skills  PF: **Julius Randle** - prototypical PF; too slow to be a SF, lacks the skills or height to be a C   C: **Joel Embiid** - you pair him next to any other true center, you're going to have a bad time.   So yeah that's a damn good team that sweeps their way to a championship."
"&gt; whatever ""cap space"" was cleared so they could sign Bobby Portis and Elfrid Payton along with Julius Randle isnt actually part of the trade  It is tho"
"Do people really think the Knicks won the trade, nobody won lol, and whatever ""cap space"" was cleared so they could sign Bobby Portis and Elfrid Payton along with Julius Randle isnt actually part of the trade it's just a rationalization people make up to feel better about their team and the move"
Julius Randle doesn’t miss games and doesn’t get blocked by someone a foot shorter than him :) he makes his teammates better :)
My bad you used that cap space to sign Julius Randle. Better than Porzingis but still
"dennis smith who turned into d-rose, new starting pf in julius randle who otherwise would not be here if we had porzingis for example."
*Julius Randle
"Yeah and Randle will pay that one. Which will then lead to him getting fined. A fine that Dolan will pay, which in turn will result in Dolan getting fined. Next, Randle will jump in and pay that fine, to which Silver will respond with; ‘that’s a fine, bro’. Dolan will sneak in and pay that fine before anyone notices, but Mark Tatum will grab him but the scruff of his neck and say ‘This is a fineable offense’ and hurl him out a window. Randle will show up demanding retribution, paying the fines of all and everyone. Adam Silver, now the richest man of all time due to all the fines he hands out, fines Randle so hard his teeth fall out. Alarmed, but somewhat charmed Dolan pays the fines in gummy bears before dapping up the toothless Randle and telling him stories of being on the road with his band (he is in a band, alright? They’re pretty *toight*). Silver has had enough and fines Dolan so much that it leads to the Basketball Future Wars.   3 billion human lives ended on October 29, 2021. The survivors of the nuclear fine called the war Basketball Future War. They lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Fines. The commissioner which controlled the Fines, NBA Cares, sent two deputy commissioners back through time. Their mission: to destroy the leader of the human Resistance... Julius Randle Jnr. My son. The first commissioner was programmed to strike at me, in the year 1994, before Julius was born. It failed. The second was set to strike at Julius himself, when he was still a child. As before, the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior. A protector for Julius. It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first..."
"Making All-NBA doesn't mean you're a top 15 player you do know that right? Julius Randle made All-NBA 2nd-team in a league with Lebron, KD, Giannis, Zion, Kawhi, Butler, PG13, Draymond, tatum, surely you don't think he's top 10?   If you can't see how flawed your logic is idk what to tell you. You can definitely argue Parker was never a top 10 player in the league."
You said you’d trade both Jays for either Julius Randle or Siakam and that Jaylen is the biggest empty stats player in the league and you’d rather have Jerami Grant so I’m not surprised. Sad you haven’t gotten bored by now but not surprised.
“I am never going to financially recover from this” -Julius Randle
"Julius Randle lol do 2nd seasons count?  Didn't hate him, just wasn't that excited when he joined initially"
Casey is so damn weird with his matchups. I’ll never forget when he decided to put Wayne Ellington on Julius Randle as the Knicks destroyed us by 20. Shit doesn’t make any sense!!
"The team OP posted I mean, not last year's Pelicans. Julius Randle was the best player on a playoff team last year, and Ingram and Russell are definitely upgrades over Bullock and Barrett."
"I really, really don't think we expected significantly more on offense than we do from Julius Randle and yet Randle keeps getting better on defense.   Melo put up more points than Randle but passed way less, and definitely didn't orchestrate the whole offense like Randle does, so the offensive load was partly due to the fact that he didn't create enough for others, so it's not then really an excuse to say his offensive load made him not inclined to defend.   And if he needed more help... Maybe he shouldn't have forced us to trade multiple young players and picks for him instead of signing here as a free agent."
This team is basically what you think of Julius randle and if he can replicate what he did last year. He’s the only guy to drag a team to the playoffs
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker’s roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De’Andre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
"Ben's regular season shooting percentages over the past four season:  FG%: .545 -&gt; .563 -&gt; .580 -&gt; .557  FT%: .560 -&gt; .600 -&gt; .621 -&gt; .613  3P%: who cares, because he took a grand total of 10 attempts last year  &amp;#x200B;  My point was more focused on the regular season, where his numbers are flat to worse, all while refusing to develop a 3 point shot (or at least saving those for summer workout videos). As for Julius, he had his regular season 3P% increase from .277 to .411 in one season all while taking more shots, and had a bad playoffs performance as the focal point for a bad offense (still shooting .333 from 3 while putting up 18/12/4), and has since assumed responsibility for ""[overcomplicating](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-julius-randle-20210927-7a5oqhbxznf7te3zruket6qeyq-story.html)"" thing. I'll take Julius over Ben any day, as will plenty of others per the All-NBA voting."
"&gt; How often has a max player become a worse shooter, especially in the playoffs?  More often than not. Most max players are worse shooters in the playoffs.   &gt;Guys like Julius Randle  ...have bad playoff series like Ben. No one in the Knicks organization threw him under the bus though."
"How often has a max player become a worse shooter, especially in the playoffs? Guys like Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball show you can drastically improve your percentages if you put the work in. Ben refuses to do it, and got called out accordingly."

"Love the debut of Fournier, his 3 point shot making ability is a huge boon for the team. I need to see Kemba be more aggressive, I thought he had a decent/poor opener. Love the Julius Randle didn’t show any signs of slowing down, he just needs to start getting more of his team involved like he did in the 2nd half and he will be up there as a MVP contender because his scoring is gonna be there."
"As a Celtics fan, I feel the EXACT SAME. It’d be dope if this was the start of a rivalry.   Also, Julius randle my GAWD"
"Man the fucking Knicks just had so much extra that they didn’t have last season.  Kemba ain’t what he used to be, but he’s still an upgrade over Elfrid Payton.  Fournier is definitely a welcomed second ball handler and shot maker.  Obi really growing into his 6th-7th man role  Mitch fucking Robinson  Oh and our old faithfuls Julius Randle and Derrick fucking Rose.   Can I get a Yeerrrrr"
Julius randle is in his prime right now
"The Lakers right now could have: 1) Lonzo Ball, 2) some SG they could’ve drafted probably, 3) Brandon Ingram, 4) Julius Randle, 5) Ivica Zubac, Caruso off the bench.  I wonder if they’d prefer that to the ring and what they have now."
"holy shit julius randle standing next to schroder, he's so fucking big"
"Julius Randle might even have a clear better season than last year, and last year he was excellent"
“Julius Randle won’t be able to make tough shots like he did last year again.”
Julius Randle is better than everyone on the Celtics.
the knicks would totally max julius randle.
"It’s 1.5% TS gap, which paired with the point gap is decent. Not substantial but that’s comparable to the difference between say, Julius Randle and Devin Booker in terms of scoring numbers.   I was referring to stats like raptor with the lack of public explanation. BPM just doesn’t mean much cause it focuses solely on box stats. VORP is based on BPM with a few other factors. Box stats have little correlation with actual impact so it’s a flawed premise that creates a flawed stat with little use. RPM is the best of those stats based on its premise but it’s flawed. RPM suggests dame is substantially more impactful than jrue holiday is defensively for example.   I don’t think Garland is that much better than RJ, I’d like have them both in my 70-80 player range. I just think he’s better. He has edges as a scorer too, that matters more than the rebounding differential since rebounding doesn’t matter. It’s essentially the playmaking vs defence gap.   And no I said garlands playmaking edge shouldn’t be dismissed simply because of his position. Likewise Barrett’s defensive edge shouldn’t be dismissed because of his physical advantages. Their games and skills speak for themselves"
I think he’s just referencing how everyone called our young players trash when they were on the Lakers but then suddenly love them once they’re not on the Lakers. Examples:  -	Julius Randle -	Jordan Clarkson -	D’Angelo Russel -	Larry Nance -	Brandon Ingram -	Lonzo Ball -	Alex Caruso -	Kyle Kuzma
"he literally averaged 29/10 against you and iced game 1 in your stadium. did you even watch the playoffs? is it possible that 3 people on the same team can have a good series?  also, there's a lot of reasonable criticism for trae. his shooting/shot selection is mediocre, he's small, he's bad on defense. he's also significantly more valuable to his team than ayton, and arguing the opposite makes you look like a salty knicks fan (which, admittedly, you clearly are.)  also, just for fun: trae young owns your sorry-ass franchise and julius randle is an overpaid bum. hope you like first round exits and play-in tournaments!"
&gt; His size is everything to him though. If he slims down he becomes Julius Randle without a jumpshot.  Calm down nephew
I think it's important to note that Julius Randle used to be Julius Randle without a jump shot.
"&gt;His size is everything to him  though. If he slims down he becomes Julius Randle without a jumpshot.  Hell nah. A ton of his strength and athleticism is just super rare and natural, and losing some weight would only help that. Plus, he has like a top 5 touch near the rim in the league."
Dude is 21 years old... Imagine what he's going to be like in his late 20's? I don't want it to happen but I can see him dipping out of the league before he reaches 30. Not because of his playing ability but due to him being constantly injured. His size is everything to him  though. If he slims down he becomes Julius Randle without a jumpshot.  I feel like he doesn't have the discipline to not eat. Dude loves his food but his playing style relies almost entirely on his athletic ability. 280lbs + running up and down on hardwood floors is not going to end well unless he cuts that weight down a bit.
"Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball died for one Laker ring...the years after LeBron will be very rough."
"&gt; that shit. We need to take a stand and honestly every NBA fan should be supporting us and respecting what we are doing here.   &gt;   &gt;New Orlean fans better be looking at this shit right now because if Ben can get traded with 4 years left on his contract I can tell you rn that’s   Honest question - what's the value of a defense first PG that can't shoot 3s and is a bad FT shooter. Honestly, if he didn't have the hype of previous #1 pick, no one would care. He's maybeeeeee a top 10 PG, but his lack of shooting kills the spacing any team can have (i think we've seen this on 76ers now in how they tried to build the team).  As a fan of basketball, and the Knicks that sorely needed a PG for many, many years, Simmons just isn't worth that contract, or whatever inflated value his hype seems to think it is. Julius Randle is the closest the Knicks have to what Simmons is as he did a lot of point-forward work for us last year, and he put up 24/6/9 last year and still didnt get a max contract. You should be mad at your FO for throwing bad money after Simmons simply because they drafted him #1."
&gt;Julius Randle pretends to know how to referee
Julius Randle burner found.
"Headline: [Bondy] Julius Randle said he was told by officials he's not getting calls because he's stronger than defenders and contact is not affecting him: ""That's not how you're supposed to referee a game.""  How I read the headline: Refs think LeBron, Harden, et al, are bitches"
Randle is gonna get so thick we'll have to start calling him Orange Julius
Julius Randle is low key one of the biggest whiners in the league.   Just watch his game where he played pickup 1 on 1.   He's the kind of player to call fouls on every minimal contact. The worst part is that he's so fucking good he doesn't need to do that.   He's the type of baller that is elite but is a complete whiner on the court.
"&gt; Bc they were double teaming him so he either passed out and got the assist or the play fizzled out and he was forced to shoot  Okay, but that's not relevant to my point.  &gt; Also it’s not like fouls on jumpers don’t exist.  Again, not really relevant to my point.  I simply stated Harden was attacking the rim more frequently than anybody in the game in the first half.  You responded with this:  &gt; Julius was just as aggressive as Harden, in fact even more so, just 2 3pt attempts tonight. Spent a majority of his time in the paint getting slapped around for just one measly trip to the line.  So, I looked up the stats for the first half becuase my eye test from watching the first half made me think that you were wrong, which is where I made my observation, and the stats backed up what I said.  Harden was more aggressive wrt to getting to the rim in the first half as opposed to Randle.  That's my only point."
"There's now also Bondy, with this quote from Julius Randle:  [Julius Randle said he was told by officials he's not getting calls because he's stronger than defenders and contact is not affecting him:  ""That's not how you're supposed to referee a game.""](https://twitter.com/sbondynydn/status/1465885544664162305?s=21)"

"&gt;As a Knicks fan, I've suffered through terrible contracts and shit performances. We're still paying J Noah! Julius Randle just got a big bag from us.  Not at all comparable situations.  Those guys resigned while playing at a high level and then their production slid off.  Isaiah suffered a career altering injury, refused to get surgery and then dropped off and a year later he was eligible to resign his contract."
"Pretty sure u could've offered him a new contract before it expired. If he didn't accept it, ok. Heck, trade him right aftet. I don't mind u trading the dude. It's not wanting to pay someone when they brought so much joy to your city and fanbase.  Lots of players get large contracts before they do anything. I'm of the opinion you reward someone for their accomplishments. As a Knicks fan, I've suffered through terrible contracts and shit performances. We're still paying J Noah! Julius Randle just got a big bag from us. And he earned every penny. If he takes a slide back in production, I'm not going to complain one bit about his contract. We'll talk about how he needs to play better. We'll throw a fit if misses free throws. But the dude has my gratitude for putting us on his back and carrying us into the playoffs."
&gt;A.)

"LeBron will save them by using back-channel bribery to trade Westbrook for Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley and Julius Randle. After that he'll send AD back to the Pelicans for Valanciunas and BI (which NO will agree to because Griff has the IQ of an eggplant). If those deals somehow fall through, he'll trade himself to Cleveland for Love and Sexton."
This reality. In the playoffs rose was their best player by a mile. No one's scared of Julius Randle
"his growth has been insane he doesn't shy from contact, can handle, pass, drive, finish over the rim, shoot, etc. at 6'10 and just turned 20.  We also have him guard the best player he was guarding Maxey today, Garland last game, Harden, KD, Etc. we put him on everyone from 1-4 and he holds his own. Julius Randle even struggled posting him up. He suprises me every game."
"The only season he's shot above 33% from three was last year, in a generally inflated shooting environment (see: Julius randle, jrue holiday, et al). I need to see more consistency from him before I buy that development"
"leave him open, he's only shooting 35.6% on open triples  /s.  It'll stabilize, he'll shoot worse on tightly covered shots and better on open shots.    I think Steph gets away with a lot, looking at the [clip from this theringer article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/11/29/22807223/seven-observations-stephen-curry-kristap-porzingis-julius-randle) of Steph setting picks they mostly look illegal to me.  I think you get in the refs ear early about how he is allowed to get physical and insist that it's a two way street and get handsy with him.  It happens every playoffs and while he's still great he's not quite as otherworldly once you spend game after game in his jersey."
The Julius Randle method
Julius Randle shouldn't make it this season. I don't think there is a strong case for him
"Yo yo pump the brakes on calling Julius Randle being called a ""perennial all star"". And speaking of the Knicks, even Kemba don't go chance at being one either."
Julius Randle has never looked like he was gonna be a perennial star.
How is Julius Randle a perennial all-star???
"* We are a better team without Kemba Walker playing  * I love how the lineups were staggered, RJ plays so much better in a fast paced offense like the bench runs  * Quickley’s defense and playmaking are starting to catch up to his shooting and he may end up being the best point guard on the roster soon  * Alec Burks is a weapon off the bench  * Obi Toppin may be the most energetic big man I’ve ever watched, and one of the best in-game dunkers too  * Quentin Grimes is gonna be a very good 3 and D guy, and Jericho Sims is gonna be a decent rim running center, our draft is looking very nice this year considering where these guys were picked  * Julius Randle is in his own head on offense sometimes, but he played very well defensively and his passing was very important. If he could just play with the energy that our bench does and let the game come to him instead of forcing offense through the low post, he’d be playing so much better"
Could you imagine if someone had a team of players like:  Lonzo Ball  D'Angelo Russell  Brandon Ingram  Julius Randle  Kyle Kuzma  ?
"Fun fact: The lakers drafted Julius Randle, Jordan Clark, Lonzo Ball, D’Angelo Russel, and Brandon Ingram. All of them got better the second they left the lakers so Bridges is a lucky man. I’m sure he’s saying thank you Jim Buss for saving his career."

"Definitely feelin’ the Julius Randle - Z-Bo comparison although Julius is more perimeter oriented with a better handle and playmaking. Z-bo’s footwork/positioning, low-to-mid-post game was top notch. Maybe someone like prime Paul Millsap?   Sheed is a harder comparison… maybe Al Horford? Or someone like prime Serge Ibaka with way less blocks and a much more refined post game? Hard to find players with Sheed’s offensive low post skills, ability to stretch the floor, AND provide All-NBA level defense and major swagger… loved Sheed! He was always a top level talent that gave zero f*@ks about how you viewed him. Was definitely the x-factor/missing piece on that awesome 2004 Detroit Piston Championship team."
"Fact is, with Thibs playing a 10 man rotation and Julius Randle well and truly turning into a #1 guy, there was never going to more minutes than that available.   Thibs is okay with playing Julius a little less and playing them together a little to get Obi some more time now that he's improved so much, but there's probably always going to be a soft cap on his minutes due to the fact that he and Randle are really 1 position players."
Kyrie for Julius randle (makes no sense and I’m joking)
"Shaq has actually called Julius Randle ""Zach Randolph"" without realizing it, and the comparison is honestly about as close as it gets."
Julius Randle and PJ Washington
Julius Randle?
Scoring that many without 4 of our players and Julius Randle playing like it’s the playoffs isn’t half bad
"Julius Randle. He was considered a Top 3 prospect along with Wiggins and Embiid in 2014, dropped to #7 in the draft after the college season, now has gone on to become an All-Star and All-NBA 2nd Team."
Julius Randle playing like Solomon hill with a green light
"First he comes in and immediately stops the flow to end the 1st half. Whatever.  Then he comes out and takes a 3 with a hand in his face to start the 3rd. Great.  THEN he refuses to box out OR go after the rebound. Awesome.  Yup, that’s the trifecta. The Julius Randle special. Fuck this guy is aggravating. Put obi back in the fucking game."
"""LeBton's going to trade you""   Caldwell-Pope, McGee  Also, in hindsight wondering if Lakers could have kept Julius Randle.      Randle, Lonzo, Ingram, Hart, Kuz, Zubac, McGee, KCP &gt; LBJ, UniBrow, Melo, Brodi, Rondo, etc"
"Julius Randle: “We’re the Knicks. We got a team that’s well put together that can lose 10, 12, 15 games in a row. We can do it. We just got to want to do it."""
Also rip to the pelicans for fumbling top 75 of all time player Julius Randle
"I certainly hope AD is playing better than Julius Randle, if he isn’t then he’s even worse than anyone’s been saying"
"if we're at the point where we're comparing AD to Julius Randle, then I think we can already conclude this conversation on AD's form"
He playing better than Julius Randle *shrug*
"I just think it makes more sense to be mad at the sports media, or the Lakers themselves for spending so much money, leveraging their position in LA to attract players. As far as I can tell, Laker fans are pretty well behaved on this board.   Lakers fans are actually pretty laid back compared to other fan bases. And Caruso actually being good should give us some vindication that we’re not just making stuff up.   In the last decade, we signed Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng to massive deals, were horrible for a long time, then traded away our entire future for one bubble ring. And now we’ll need to rebuild. We’re stuck with Westbrook next year too, and he’s owed 50 million. Our roster could be Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, and Zubac, with Alex Caruso coming off the bench. Instead we have the retirement home.  It’s been a tough run for the Lakers too."

Julius Randle having a complete outlier season was a big reason.  He was legit 2nd team All-NBA worthy and this season he’s probably not an All-Star.
not quite random but i saw a julius randle lakers jersey recently
"Based on the sub I'd go with Julius Randle. From the moment he didn't show up against the Hawks half the fans forgot what he did for us. Now this season he's been up and down with Obi looking better and better the more minutes he gets. When Julius has a good game it's quiet, but when he has a bad game the conversation becomes we shouldn't have paid him or he's a 1 year wonder.   Kemba is a close second. He's loved because he's from the Bronx, but he hasn't done much for us since signing."
"I thought Julius Randle had an outlier year last year. Ben Taylor got a lot of crap for not putting him in his top players list but just point was that you need to do it for multiple seasons. A single great blip of a season doesn't mean you're a great player. He's a pretty good, all star level player but I don't think he's amazing or a franchise corner piece."
"The amount of hate julius randle gets from our own fans is pretty baffling. He might not be able to sustain his crazy efficiency from last year, but hes not garbage."
"#7  Steph  Bernard King  Chris Mullin  Julius Randle  Nenê  With Rip Hamilton and Jamal Murray off of the bench  Edit: also I’m not saying this is the best combo of any pick, just the best of the 7th picks. This would be a fun fun team to watch though. Big man would be the biggest issue"
I said Julius Randle and the knicks wouldn't have the same impact as last year.
"i said Julius Randle had a fluke season. I actually lazily called him JulFluke Randle  People downvoted me, called me a hater.  Now he’s playing like Channing Frye out there"
"Am I hater? Absolutely not. But did I tell y'all that Julius Randle WAS NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS LAST SEASON? Absolutely, yes."
Thats the Julius Randle
It’s close.  Those empty calories from Julius Randle and Tiffany Amber Thieissen make the Knicks a legitimate title contender
Julius randle as well
"It's the fear generated by letting BI, Lonzo, and Julius Randle go."
the entire starting lineup is super negative because Kemba + Fournier aren't hitting their 3s and RJ is doing that thing he does where he's awful for a month straight so whether or not Julius Randle is hitting his midrange shots decides if we're tied or down 10 when the bench comes in
Watching Julius Randle play basketball still make we want to swallow lead

"julius randle can be so hard to watch, Jesus"
Julius Randle
Known choker Julius randle come on mang
Julius Randle. Why?
They were a fluke last year. They played to their max potential last season. They were the easiest under for this season. Julius randle isn’t a number one and the knicks won’t be anything until barret takes that next step which it seems didn’t happen this season
julius randle LMAOOOO
Julius Randle. JR. JR Smith.
Julius Randle is not a net positive
you double teamed julius randle and left evan fournier open for three   low iq basketball
That’s the Julius Randle special iso play lol  Guy does that shit 5-7 times a game it’s irritating even when it goes in
"I whole heartedly agree with this. They beat a fraudulent Knicks team led by star fraud Julius Randle, then Philly imploded when everyone had them as the favorite for that series. Atlanta isn’t an ECF-level team."
Oh don't you worry. Julius Randle and RJ Barrett will combine to go 11/31 tonight and both be -10 or worse.
Bro its like so unfair lol. Trae got to Julius Randle and Ben Simmons while Luka has to face Prime Kawhi and Paul George haha.
"I want Julius Randle to play like 2021 Udonis Haslem in the playoffs every year.  That’s what he gets for playing like prime Dirk against us last regular season which made everybody pick Knicks in 5.

"Julius Randle didn’t get good till he was 27. Wiggins is 26.  I agree with Wiggins being a disappointment (for a #1 pick), but he’s probably gonna end up being really good for a few years."
No but don't you see if he played with Julius Randle instead of James Harden he wouldn't have to hear Steph getting MVP chants! Totally worth it  /s
"Julius Randle is just 26 years old, yet seems 20 years older."
"At least when this era is over it will be fairly easy to photoshop Laker jerseys onto future free agents like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle and Alex Caruso."
Julius Randle but idk if it's really regression when last year was an outlier and he's just going back to who he really is.
"I know it's already been said here, but JULIUS RANDLE. Y'all Knicks fans downvoted me into oblivion last szn when I said, let's see if he keeps the numbers up."
Even as a basketball card fan refused to invest in Julius Randle.
Julius Randle

"nah dude, he channeled Julius Beyblade Randle for it to go"
I want what julius randle is having
"I know exactly what you mean.  It's like he moves with a ton of purpose in the same way Kawhi does but he's more explosive and quick with it as opposed to, on the opposite end of the spectrum, a Julius Randle who's all over the place with tons of wasted motion"
I really feel like Julius Randle got somethjn special bout him and as knick fan he really gained my respect this year and i love him! This game should be fun lol
Clearly Julius Randle
&gt;certain players are standing out because of the new format  *cough* Julius Randle *cough* MVP. I’m just kidding…unless… nah Bron probably going to win it this year
Julius Randle deserves an All-Star spot in the East. Dude has the Knicks over .500 and averaging 22/12/7.  The Knicks are gonna make the playoffs this year.
Idk Enes Kanter averaging a double double off the bench and Portland is right in the thick of it all so he my pick for 6MOTY   MIP I gotta say Christian Wood if he keep it up bc I’ve seen that kid make shots so far that i never expected n he putting up good numbers but I do believe Julius Randle is another contender if he too continues his stellar play as of late  MVP is tough but im leaning towards JOKIC . . . he got most triple doubles already and clearly best passing big man in the game...idk i just love big honey so much and he seem to be playing elite ball so i think he got a shot...  DPOY Andre Drummond perhaps? and I hope Myles Turner makes all defense team
Julius Randle stole Siakam's powers. Change my mind.
"If Rudy is getting 200mil, Julius Randle should get at least 300mil in the next deal lmao"
"Last season had a lot of players make it for the first time, it seems unlikely to have a bunch more again  But actually projecting, not just based on season so far  West:   Projected: None  Contenders: CJ McCollum, Zion, Murray, Wood  CJ has been playing really well, but I'm not highly confident that at 29 he'll suddenly maintain the kind of shooting he's had so far. Zion has been playing well, but will need to be even better to have a chance, especially with Ingram on his team. Murray has also been playing really well, but guards have a lot of competition and I'm just not sure if it's enough, especially with another better all-star player on his team. Wood has the numbers, and if Harden leaves he has a good chance, but if he's still there I wouldn't bet on it   East:   Projected: Jaylen Brown, Malcolm Brogdon  Jaylen is playing fantastically, and without Kemba I think he'll get a lot of credit. Brogdon is also playing very well on the new Pacers, who are also playing very well. Jaylen is a much more clear pick than Brogdon  Contenders: Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant  I think all three (especially Randle) are playing above their weight at the moment, the Knicks won't maintain anything like the 6th seed, and the Pistons suck. But it is the east and there seem like clear spots to be won, and they all have great 3 number splits so I could easily see at least one of them getting a spot"
Collin Sexton or Julius Randle
Julius Randle without the playmaking. Rui is a black hole on offense.
Julius Randle
someone who doesn't watch Julius Randle
Haters can't accept that Julius Randle is the best player in the league.
"Rui has a weirdly good rep that doesn't match watching him play. Whenever people talk about possible Wiz trades and him being off limits I just don't get it. He's a big-body wing without shooting range or plus defense (better on-ball than off, but still below league-starter average on). His absolute ceiling, if everything breaks right, is Julius Randle."
"Way too early to even think about this realistically, hell at this point in the season Julius Randle should be in the talks. Have to wait until All Star break to separate pointless speculation and meaningful MVP talks"
Julius Randle as well.
And Julius Randle
Julius Randle when he was a year older than Zion averaged 11 points on 48 TS%

I always saw him more of a Julius Randle more than an AD or Embiid. Also Idk if Zion will end up better than Ingram who has that KD basketball frame and is still pretty young. I’d personally build around Ingram with Zion being a nice piece. Zions biggest thing is going to be his shooting and his ability to create shots for himself outside of the paint. In the playoffs you can’t just score at the rim so easy just look at Giannis. You need to have someone that can get their own shot at all 3 levels.
Lol cannot believe I picked up Julius Randle in FA on fantasy ... hopefully not too much changes when Obi and Alec are back
"That's not how all star selections work though. ""Frontcourt"" players get 6 slots, and the potential for 2 more with wildcards. Grant isn't just competing with small forwards. He's competing with power forwards and centers.   That's KD, Giannis, Butler, Tatum, maybe Jaylen, Middleton, Hayward, Sabonis, Embiid, Adebayo, Vucevic, and guys more on the fringe like julius Randle, siakam, OG, Jared Allen, tobias Harris, hell even Drummond maybe.   That's a lot of guys competing for MAX 8 spots, more likely 7 or even 6, and even now he's behind at least 7 of them. Considering there are 12-15 guards fighting for 4 spots plus the wild cards, it's a solid bet guards get both wildcards, leaving only 6 frontcourt spots.   So you're saying grant is currently a lock over KD, giannis, Tatum, Embiid, Middleton, vucevic, adebayo, and Sabonis, who are all really good bets to get in? All former all stars, all off to good starts?"

Everyone except for Julius Randle doesn’t deserve the award.
"So to prove your point instead of using bigger sample sizes which would prove you're wrong you use the first 8 games of the season to prove your point.   That's great.  And yeah, I used Knox to ridicule your argument so I will try to be a little more grounded for you to understand. Are the Denver Nuggets a playoff team?  The first 8 games say that they're not.  Are the Magic better than the Bucks?  First 8 games say yes.  Julius Randle seems to be leading his team, just like Giannis, and they are both 5 - 3 in this season. So I guess they're both equally winning players. Your argument makes no sense because you only take into account the first games of this season without even accounting for how hard their schedule has been in comparison to other ""winning players"". I don't even know your definition of a winning player."
Julius Randle is with Zoids
The question is who’s better right now not who’s better in 2022 why does it hurt nba fans to just give the Knicks some props. If a player was doing what he is on any other team with and wasn’t named Julius Randle you guys would hype them up. Right now at this moment Julius Randle is better than Zion. That it
Julius Randle is currently one of the top 3 best basketball players in New York.
I can 100% see him beating out Julius Randle by the All-star break
Hard in the paint like I'm Julius Randle 🎶
"He's had some good games but his efficiency and defense are terrible man. You can't just look at raw numbers and make assumptions on his play. There's a reason he never closes games. It can be downright cringey watching him play basketball for long, long stretches of time. ATM he plays like a bargain bin Julius Randle."
Weirdest thing about this season so far is how much I love Austin Rivers and Julius Randle.
"I really wanna see Randle make an all star appearance. I was a big fan of the very hyped 2014 Draft where the 5 biggest names were Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Embiid, Aaron Gordon, and Julius Randle and outside of Embiid all of those guys have underwhelmed to some extent for what we thought they would be. Randle is playing like the guy I thought the Lakers drafted in 2014 and I hope he keeps it up"
Julius Randle is a Mastodon.
"He’s having a real good season so far, but he’s no Julius Randle."
"I'm complimenting Julius Randle here lol. I am saying while Zion could look better than what he's shown so far this season(21/8/1), that Julius has undoubtly been the better player, y'all don't have to take everything against yourselves 😅"
Julius Randle legitimately looking like one of the best bigs in the NBA right now. It's kinda wild. Man beyblading his way to the top.
Zion is 20 years old. Julius Randle is 26. So idk if you can really compare them that way because Zion probably still has room to grow.
"Randle’s salary 18M this year while Zion is making around 10M.  Thus, he’s a poor man’s Julius Randle in every sense of the word."
LeBron just Julius Randle with Magic passing ability.   /s
"Julius Randle is currently out scoring Zion, out shooting Zion, out rebounding Zion, out passing Zion, he’s led his previously horrible team to the 5th seed in the East while Zions team is struggling to break .500 exactly how is Zion better right now?"
"Julius Randle is putting up crazy numbers rn but I feel if Zion was in New York and didn't have to share the ball with Ingram, Zo, and Bledsoe, Zion would be able to put up nutty numbers too.   also I feel Zion's rebounding numbers are so low despite him being one of the best offensive rebounders in the league since the pels don't need him grabbing defensive boards, he could probably average 12+ a game if so. that said, it is what it is and Julius Randle is looking better rn and New York of all teams are winning games 🤷"
I could argue that in the inverse of what you said Julius Randle is still better than Zion.
"This season Julius Randle is way better than before Randle, in stats, IQ, leadership, shooting literally everything. Last year he was borderline unreadable this year he’s a legit asset and dare i say allstar"
"If I showed you his stats, his team record, and the team he has, and replaced his name with someone r/nba likes more I 100% without a doubt guarantee you’d consider him an allstar but since it’s Julius Randle and it’s the Knicks you don’t"

"You're getting downvoted but I agree. As good as your coaching is, your guys's depth was murdered this offseason. You'd have to depend on Vanvleet, Siakam and a 34 y/o Lowry to outmatch guys like Embiid and Simmons, KD and Kyrie, Tatum and Brown, Sabonis, Oladipo and Brogdon, Giannis and Middleton, Jimmy and Bam, and of course, Julius Randle and his 1 seeded Knicks.  I'm not one to advocate for tanking but you guys have no real reason to make playoffs. You have a winning culture, one off year isn't gonna change that, and you don't really have any young guys that desperately need playoff experience. It won't really be tanking since if you guys trade a couple of guys you won't be very good anyway. Trade Baynes to a contender, maybe Siakam too if you get a good enough offer."
"Julius ""Beyblade"" ""Mostar"" Randle"
wtf is julius randle becoming an all star
I'm with Zach Lowe chillin' on Julius Randle island.
"Thibs turned Julius Randle into a good NBA player. Like... the Julius Randle whose signature move is an unbalanced spin move into 2-3 defenders. Yeah, it's been 8 games, but what he did with Randle is still insane."
"2014 in hindsight turned to be such a dud class, the ONLY lottery pick that turned into an All-Star 6 years on was Joel Embiid (who missed his first 2 seasons). The other All-Star in that class was some fat Serbian kid taken in the 2nd round.  The best player not named Embiid taken in the lottery is either one of Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine, TJ Warren or Julius Randle.   The rest have been varying degrees of underwhelming (Wiggins, Gordon, Payton, McDermott), ruined by injuries (Parker, Exum) or straight-up out of the league (Stauskas, Vonleh)"
"I think you mean Julius Randle, the man has put the whole team on his back every game I swear"
Julius Randle received all the potential that Siakam had
Christian Wood is the popular answer but I think Julius Randle MIP should be gaining traction
Being Julius randle with hops doesn’t sound that bad
I wanted us to make a move for Randle when we still had KP. Thought they would be a pretty solid pair if the coaching could get Julius to buy in on defense. Julius covers up for a lot of KP's flaws.
I can't get off the Julius Randle hype train man

Julius Randle is legitimately an all star wow
"Acela is actually pretty bottom of the barrel as far as high speed trains goes. Only goes up to 150 mph, and that's only on very short stretches of the route totaling less than 35 miles.  US high speed rail infrastructure is pathetic compared to the rest of the world, even though the major east coast corridor of DC-Baltimore-Philly-NYC-Boston is well suited to high speed rail. French TGV and Japanese Shinkansen trains operate on nationwide high speed rail networks at 200 mph, and the vast Chinese high speed rail network goes up to 220 mph, including a short stretch of futuristic maglev rail in Shanghai that operates at 270 mph.  Zion should be the 220 mph CR400 Fuxin Golden Phoenix train. I dunno who the NBA Acela should be, Julius Randle maybe?"
"I think both Bridges played super well.     Mikal is really long, so he has huge defensive potential.  In general i hope they are both good players for their teams.     Miles will need to start taking the leap from a handles perspective.  He could have a Julius Randle style impact if so."
Julius Randle will be that guy soon
Two Julius Randle.
"Pretty obvious Julius Randle is going to win an mvp soon, Knicks are gonna to win a title."
Julius Randle with hops
"They are competing for the playoffs.  Tons of young talent and I mean tons.  Pop has learned and leans way more to giving the young guys minutes but he might close out with Patty or Rudy.  I’m not sure what you mean by the hero ball thing.  Players like when coaches are hard on them, (depends on the player but Julius Randle told the knicks to get a coach that’ll be hard on him so he’ll know what to get better at and work on)   Location is a big deal but depends on the player."
Julius Randle this year
Julius Randle TS% is 57 and jerami grants is 56  You’re just listing random things out
"Julius Randle and it’s not even close, that man is single handedly responsible for putting the Knicks in the playoff picture."
Which is literally because of dolan... who is literally still there. Julius randle playing well and overpaying lonzo doesnt just change that perception even if yall do make the playoffs. Hes still not liked.
Julius Randle is against resting
Julius Randle is MVP don’t @me
On what planet is Julius Randle fat?
Julius Randle is averaging 40% from 3 and double digit rebounds. Their playstyles are completely different now
Julius randle is a fat Tobias? Wtf? Why does this have so many upvotes
Sir where is most improved and why is it Julius Randle.
Do you guys think Enes Kanter feels bad that both Julius Randle and Zion Williamson are far better then he could ever hope to be?
"Not really Julius randle is just a Fat Tobias Harris. So you are saying Zion is a fat Tobias Harris with hop, which is not accurate"
"I fucking hate knicks fans man, they got super obnoxious the moment they knew they'd get into the playoffs. But because of that I can't think of a better team for them to lose to. Like please just take Julius Randle by his fucking self and shit all over them and on that glorious day we will all be knicks fans"
"...but [he has been](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html)  He hasn’t been below 40% to win since like the first week lol. He was averaging a triple double for like the first two weeks of the season. He’s not missed a single game - he’s second in minutes played behind Julius Randle (because Thibs gonna Thibs).  He’s been the wire to wire MVP front runner unless you’re going off of the lists of hot-take artists.  The fact that you haven’t even deigned to muster a counter argument and simply resort to ad hominem attacks speaks volumes here, my guy."
"Julius ""Cal Ripken Jr"" Randle.  Mark this moment down. 😞"
All this to beat Julius Randle?
Bad news is that Julius Randle may be out for the Knicks tonight.
Laughs nervously in Julius Randle
"Yeah, this article is basically projecting if Zion were to improve every aspect of his game (except athleticism) exponentially. He’s not Ben Simmons on the break or Barkley as a rebounder, nor will he ever be. Hell, even Julius Randle has a far more developed post game than Zion is likely to ever develop.  This is nothing more than a typical ESPN attempt to generate hype by making absurd prospect comparisons based off a modicum of similarity."
All this to beat RJ and Julius Randle smh
I feel like I hear about Julius Randle and RJ Barrett a lot...  That's okay though. Lakers/Knicks are too very big/passionate fanbases in cities that love basketball. Knicks getting good is a big story too.
"Just wondering, were you one of those knicks fans who hated on Julius Randle last year?  Might just be time sit back and ""trust the process"""
"I mean sure, we're also using a hypothetical where Julius Randle basically has Zion's finishing ability, so he becomes one of the most lethal offensive weapons in the league and perhaps the Knicks have a better record.  This wasn't really meant to be that serious of a comment though, just thinking about what that player would be like."
*Ahem*   Julius Randle
Honestly if this year's Julius Randle had hops he would be an MVP candidate.  Shooting 40% from 3 and 6apg

Julius Randle or Vucevic perhaps
"Like you're a fucking master of the rules. Imo he did lose possession enough. He chose to regain but could have faked it by removing his hands more which is stupid because you're basically incentivizing guys to fake lose the ball, which is a lot easier than it sounds.

Julius Randle is the MVP in my heart
It’s really fascinating seeing fans scramble to crown a new MVP every week.  Anybody but Lebron for a lot of these people.  They’ll be lobbying for Julius Randle next.  They’ve named about 10 different players already.  Love to see it.

"Hahahah I didn't even remember this. This was actually not even being called or It didnt feel like, at least in my games. Thats what I think because I was like the Julius Randle of my shitty league so I Guess I would have noticed lmao."
"I mean even though Breen and Burke are vets in calling games and some of the best, they still make mistakes. As I understand they were calling it from home, they probably see the same live feed we see and were imo just taking Randle's side to give him props for a good game. Announcers arent always completely unbiased and they didnt seem to be in this either. I mean even Dame was tweeting, trying to claim Kyrie blocked it and it wasnt a travel, he is a pro player and supposed to know the rules? Such calls could be 50/50, depending on the angles you see and bias you have, you might see it differently. I think the call shouldve been reviewed regardless if the Knicks could challenge, I can understand why Randle was upset and all... but it does seem like the call was correct.      [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/julius-randles-controversial-traveling-call-explained-by-scott-foster-who-appears-to-have-gotten-it-right/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/julius-randles-controversial-traveling-call-explained-by-scott-foster-who-appears-to-have-gotten-it-right/)   It has links and explanation to the call, also NBA should soon come out with their report on this, clearing out if it was the right call after analyzing all the available angles and all that.   [https://official.nba.com/2020-21-nba-officiating-last-two-minute-reports/](https://official.nba.com/2020-21-nba-officiating-last-two-minute-reports/)     Afaik, what the ref explained and people here that are saying its a travel, it all makes perfect sense. If you watch the clip you can see Kyrie touched the ball and ""got a piece of it"", but that alone doesnt determine whether Randle lost possession of it. He regathered it while jumping up and proceeds to come down with it + dribble. If he had dropped the ball, then gathered and dribbled, it wouldve been fine from what I understand."
"It was a tavel, [but so was what Harden did earlier in the game](https://twitter.com/PhilipDamiano/status/1371656606287601668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1371656606287601668%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fftw.usatoday.com%2Flists%2Fknicks-vs-nets-julius-randle-kyrie-irving-travel).     And it has nothing to do with whether player lost control of the ball. If you watch the Harden play, Scott foster does not signal that the ball came loose (both palms facing up, arms alternating moving up and down), he signals that contact was made with the ball (both palms facing either other).      He admitted there was contact with the ball on the Randle travel, so he just changed his interpretation of the rule during the game.      Again, if his thought process is ""the ball was dislodged on the Harden play"" he would have signaled that the ball was dislodged, not that contact was made with the ball."
"Late here but Harden isn’t a good bench mark to compare a player’s greatness to. I’d argue he’s the most manufactured superstar in the history of the NBA, he’s still one of the only top scorers that I could find that has more FTM then FGM in his career which is astonishing. His numbers would dip precipitously if they didn’t put him on the line with some of the questionable calls they give him.   As far as Porzingis goes, his issue has probably always been shot selection. Even when he was an Allstar with the Knicks, he was a chucker. Ball stopped with him, not sure if it was Melo’s influence but for the most part Julius Randle has been great at keeping the ball moving and getting his when it’s time."

I also have no skin in the game but just rewatched the clip because I wasn’t sure  Randle plants his first and starts his jumping motion (doesn’t get off the ground but is starting to move his body) when Kyrie makes contact  That touch by Kyrie clearly moves the ball in Julius’ hand. And I don’t know if you ever shot a basketball but when somebody knocks it loose (even a little bit) that will completely throw off the shot  So maybe letter of the law this is a travel but to me that should’ve just been a play on when he came back down and started a second dribble. Especially since he doesn’t take any steps after Kyrie makes contact with it
"Julius Randle has been in that situation many times throughout his career. And he's never hit a clutch three point shot to tie/win the game. Likely never will either.   Like I said, that's what you get for drawing up a play for him to hit a three at the end of the game. Blocked and humiliated by a 6'3 PG followed by a temper tantrum as he walks off the floor in defeat."

"It doesn't matter if he touched, slapped, kissed, or gently caressed the ball, as long as the offensive player doesn't let go of the ball. Julius Randle had the ball in his two hands the whole time, so it's a travel. If he lets loose the ball, then it's not a travel. The rules aren't that difficult."
"I didn't because elementary school players realize they can't go back to the floor without shooting. Why would Julius Randle go back to the ground without throwing the ball up unless it got hit while it was in his hands? He's in the NBA.  I find it more convincing Scott Foster had money on this game than Julius Randle, in that position, traveling instead of trying to do something with the ball.  Come on."
Staunch out. You don’t know what the word staunch means... or you think Julius Randle was going to stomp out a ref instead of yelling at him.
I'm a Julius Randle fan now
"Completely bogus reaction from Julius Randle over this call. The pouty inbound to the tough walk like he was going to go over to Foster and do what, exactly?   I get it, refs bad. Foster I think could have swallowed the whistle and allowed a play on, for entertainment's sake. Nobody would have batted an eye. Maybe he gets a talking to from the league office for not making a call, I dunno. But he makes a ticky tack call, but a correct and defensible call, and Randle decides to have to be held back by his teammates over it? The jump ball that got reviewed just beforehand had everything to do with it I'm sure, but still no excuse for a player to behave threateningly like that towards an official.   I honestly don't know what's worse at this point: the officiating or the player's constantly overblown reactions towards the refs. Exaggerated contact, flopping, player antics like Randle's tonight, it's grating."
"There’s just no way that ‘perception’ is more valuable than having $30M a year in more cap space as you embark on a rebuild.  Hey could have used it to take on salary and add picks and prospects, or spend it on a player with actual upside like Julius Randle.    It was a dumb move, it looked dumb at the time and looks dumb now.  That their best young player might hate him is just icing on the cake."
"i feel like jump balls need to require a fight for the ball between the two guys  like if julius went up and kyrie grabbed the ball and then randle came down with it and they were still tied up, that'd be a jump ball  i've always thought of this as a travel since randle had the ball the whole time while kyrie just tapped it"
"Official NBA statement tomorrow morning:  &gt; We reviewed last night's play with Julius Randle and found that he traveled. Also, fuck /r/NBA  /s"
"""In my mind we won that game"" - Julius ""Donovan Mitchell"" Randle"
Haha Julius Randle bad haha Knicks lottery team haha it’s 2019 btw
Julius Randle should replace Andrew Cuomo
That's what you get for drawing up a play for Julius Randle down 3 with five seconds remaining.
Ntilikina changed the game with his defense. The Knicks play really hard and Thibs tried almost everything to win the game.   Shoutout to Julius Randle but it’s just a game. He doesn’t have to murder a ref lol
Good for Julius Randle. NBA officiating is a complete joke right now. Ruining the product of the game.
Julius Randle got real mad there lmao 😂
"Cade Cunningham will be an all after year 1 and All NBA year 2.  Technically that’s still college tho, so Marcus Smart is a more impactful player then Julius Randle."
Remember when some clown on Twitter said Julius randle was better than Chris Bosh? Lol terrible take
Julius Randle was getting MVP chants in Barclays
Julius Randle?
Jerami Grant  Julius Randle
"Yeah no one’s thinking Julius Randle, or even Curry or Doncic is in the lead for MVP. It’s not just Nuggets fans that think Jokic is one of the front runners."
Julius Randle won't let that happen
"Julius Randle kills us but not as much as Rozier despite my team coming out with wins but outta nowhere, Rozier goes Curry and makes a near blowout to a tight game."
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
"Clippers would not have max contract space. They've locked up Beverly, Kennard, and Zubac for 34.5m. Along with Paul George (40m) that leaves ~35m, minus roster holds. That's less than the max even before considering rosters holds. The Clippers could maybe bring in a borderline max guy (Julius Randle, Zach Lavine) but the true max guys aren't going to take a pay cut to go play with PG13, Beverly, and Luke Kennard."
"Montrezl Herrell, Daniel Theis &amp; Julius Randle are a wings now"
"I would play him as 4 or 5 depending on the matchup and it works in my opinion.   He can be Rim Protector C against opponents without a powerful center and then move to guarding the 4 if they play Embiid, Gobert, etc. Boucher is decent at perimeter defense too so he won't get crushed by PF with driving ability like say a Julius Randle or Zion.   And then on offense how do guys like Gobert guard him?? He will get wide open 3 his defense can shift but his offense causes big time issues for others. He is the matchup nightmare for others IMO"
I think on this team Clarkson would average 24 ppg and get all star nod. He's at like 18 ppg on Utah with Mitchell getting a lot more shots.   I don't think for example that Julius Randle would be an all star on Utah he'd probably average 17 ppg and 10 rebounds as second scoring option but third overall player.
It really depends how you define a 5. There's probably less than 10 centers who would have a good matchup vs Simmons at the 5  The true centers with some back to basket game it wouldn't be wise to put Simmons on. Basically Vucevic/Jokic/Nurkic/KAT/Adams/Aayton/Capela/Sabonis off the top of my head. I'd probably throw Julius Randle in there too even though he's played the 4 spot most of the year. Also interested to see how Ben does vs Giannis now given he's a bit stronger this year.
"The MIP ""Missing in Playoffs"" Award goes to Julius Randle"
Julius Randle.
wow the Julius Randle slander in here.
"Jeremy Lin, Kyle Kuzma, Tingus Pingus, Julius Randle, Dennis Schroder about to form a super team"
"This Nets team is definitely the underdog man, they’re the second team in New York which means they’re always fighting uphill against Julius Randle"
Facts. My irrational/rational hate for Julius Randle and his hype train lowkey ruined the season for me to an extent.
Yeah that’s why I thought Julius Randle might have a chance. He doesn’t have as much talent as the other guys but he can fill a need for the squad.
Looking at u Julius Randle
Julius Randle
"Julius ""King of NY"" Randle"
"Teams aren’t rebuilding forever. If you are the Cavs, Bulls etc and if you are looking for 3-4 contracts you should be thinking that you might be playoff team in 1-2 years, so it technically won’t be a rebuilding team far into future.  And yes you are right on that second point. It’s really up to the GM to do due diligence on the player. Role player contracts can also win you championship as well as lose them. I can think of 20+ role player signings that were immediately thought as overpaid and then worked out to be undervalued even in year one.  Some examples in the past 3-4 years: Terry Rozier, Kyle Anderson, Julius Randle, Jae Crowder (3-4 times lol), Seth Curry, PJ Tucker etc"
I remember being so upset when we had to settle for Julius Randle in that draft. Legitimately thought Exum could be as good as Tatum is now. Injuries suck.
"I don't think he could've had his stats without a star PG next to him. Not like Bosh did in Toronto, or Marc Gasol or Zbo in Memphis, AD in New Orleans etc. Boozer was pretty consistent but not as good as his stats suggest. I don't think he could've been the star of a team at any point in his career.   And he was a bad on defense. Julius Randle is way better than Boozer ever was. Noah and Gibson were both more effective than Boozer on the Bulls. He was the default second option in Utah because of Deron Williams."
"Clarkson going off, love it.  Crazy to think of the Laker's 07 Roster. (I know they got AD for some of these pieces but still)  Lonzo Ball: Max potentially incoming Alex Caruso Josh Hart Brandom Ingram: Max Contract Larry Nance Julius Randle: MIP Jordan Clarkson: 6MOY"
its like everyone turned into julius randle
Giannis taking some Julius Randle shots
yea werent u guys supposed to get kd and kyrie instead? odd. zion too i heard. hope you guys have fun with julius randle.
He's better than mfing Julius Randle
Of course not. But I don't see why Harden couldn't get the same endorsements no matter where he plays. I see Ja Morant Gatorade ads every day. And Chris Paul State Farm ads 10X a day. Ive yet to see a Julius Randle ad though.
Big point here lol Bosh was an all nba near superstar at the time but here we are 11 years later and ppl try to tell me Julius Randle is better than Bosh ever was lmao
lmao knicks about to have two Julius randle in the playoffs
"When you say ""sucked"", do you mean like Julius Randle vs the Hawks ""sucked""?"
"&gt; 1999 Lakers? didn't even have 3 All-Stars  Shaq, Kobe, Glenn Rice. And you can't go with ""He doesn't count because he wasn't an all-star that year, even though he had been the three previous years"", since with Detroit you emphasized how that exact year wasn't as important as the years leading up to it.  &gt; 3 established stars acquired through trades/FA is a superteam.   Why are we suddenly pretending there's no difference between a star and a superstar?  Nick Vucevic, Julius Randle, and Paul George would not be a superteam.  Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard would be."
"A star receiver is not guaranteed he will touch the ball what kinda nonsense is this?  Julius Randle now guarantees that he touches the ball, if he had not worked at his game he would not be given such responsibility, and would have probably washed out, even if he did improve his shooting as much as he did, the tripple threat is why he is in the MVP discussion."
Lol Harden couldn’t win an award Julius Randle did. Harden worse than Randle: confirmed!
"It doesn't, because you can just sign UFA's and make it appealing for them to come to you with a long term plan. So in 2022 you have Kawhi, Curry, CP3, Julius Randle, and Zach Lavine. CP3 is older, but probably a realistic option especially when you bundle him with a Randle or Kawhi. Kawhi isn't shy about changing teams.  Now I'm not saying Randle is a super star, nor Lavine, but it's a start to attract other and better players."
"Looking back at the 2014 Draft and 2014/2015 Rookie Class.  \#1 Draft Pick - Andrew Wiggins  Rookie of the Year - Andrew Wiggins  All Stars - Joel Embiid (2018-2021), Nikola Jokic (2019-2021), Zach LaVine (2021), Julius Randle (2021)  MVP - Nikola Jokic (2021)"
I mean it’s possible Randle as a 2nd option is a good playoff player. You’re  going to double team Julius Randle when he’s not the first option?
"Thibs Coach of the Year, D Rose an MVP vote, Julius Randle MIP. NY explodes the second they aren't the worst team in the league."
"I agree, Julius Randle should frankly give his MIP award to Micheal Porter Jr while we talk about it.    Julius Randle getting MIP with 98% of the vote is just more proof that the sports media boner for New York based teams will never go away"

PG is playing like Julius Randle but with better defense.
Julius Randle
dont be mad you can see highlights of Julius Randle building a house of bricks again
Even Julius Randle would have been appalled by all these bricks
Imagine Julius Randle making a shot
He also drafted Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram who blossomed once they left your team
How they gonna vote for a Knick not named Julius Randle?!?! 🤨🤷🏽‍♂️
"It’s one thing to choose a Knick, but not even Julius Randle?!?! 🤨🤷🏽‍♂️"
&gt; way better  Not at all. Julius Randle put up 24/10/6.  He had a helluva season.
"If we get Dame somehow (no trading RJ or Randle) I would have an erection for a month.  Dame is 30, sure, but the man balls out day in and day out. If he is the starting PG for us, with Randle and RJ stepping up next year, we'll be in contention for top 3 in the conference 100%.   The Garden crowd will cause earthquakes every time Dame casually BANGS it from the logo in someone's face. If by some miracle we get Damian, I think we'll fare better than Portland have in the past years. That all depends on Julius actually playing basketball in the playoffs like he does in the season, and RJ being that 3rd guy/ X factor that can go off for 30 on a given night."
"Eh I’d prefer starting from 2014/15. You lose John Wall Brandon Knight and Cousins, but you gain KAT Devin Booker and Julius Randle"
You can hate all you want thats your right but there's a difference to playing young Knicks team w Julius Randle as their main guy vs playing Contenders with Kawhi and PG at the helm. I think Atlanta gets swept vs Clippers or gentleman's sweep at best
your shitposts were alright during the regular season but you're choking big time here   you're like the julius randle of shitposters
Monty Williams had Chris Paul. Tom Thibodeau had Julius Randle
No way Julius Randle makes this list
"How come… Thibs team outplayed its preseason expectation the most, and finished strong, and he got an all NBA season out of Julius Randle"
"I get the feeling that the Knicks team this year really did buy into the ""Gym over everything"" mindset that Julius preached in his players tribune article. There has been so much improvement in that team just on an individual basis (Especially looking at Obi, RJ, Quick and Randle) that I can't help but feel optimistic about the promised culture change.  I hope Mitch gets to play the next season in good health. Well be in good shape."
yes that's why Julius Randle is MVP caliber
"This was the right call! Yes Julius Randle was tremendous but this all started with Thibs! Sure you could've looked at Doc Rivers, but the improvement he made wasn't as dramatic as the Knicks' was, you could look at Monty Williams but his team was already tremendous since the bubble and they added the game's best leader in CP3!   It's nice when they actually get the awards right like they did this time."
That awkward moment when you’re playing even worse than Julius Randle and you have Giannis on your team
"The East is just REALLY bad, the Knicks led by Julius Randle were the 4th seed bruh.  It's like this almost every year, the strongest I seen it was 2019 when Kawhi was there, the Bucks had Brogdon &amp; Philly had Jimmy."
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Paul George  SF: Julius Randle  PF: Giannis Alphabet  C: Kristaps Porzingis
he led the knicks from the dumpster to the playoffs with julius randle as his top star. easy money.
Its fortunate because 99.9% of the time you dont get 3 superstars in 2 years. Knicks have been trying for a while now and the best they got was Julius Randle
"Why the fuck didn't the Knicks push for KD/Kyrie? Why? The had the cap space and they used it on Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Elfrid Payton, and Taj Gibson. I still don't get it."
"""HE CANT PLAY THAT BADLY AGAIN""  y'all said that about julius Randle for 5 straight games lmao"
Middleton looking like Julius Randle out here.
Middleton with his best Julius Randle impression!
I mean……it was a very similar roster to last year….Julius Randle wins MIP…..drose is up for 6th man….one of the best defenses in the league….gets fourth seed when they were projected to get 21 wins….want me to keep going?
He’s not a good coach. His offense sucks. He got saved this season by the fact that Julius Randle was hitting contested 20 footers. Look what happened in the playoffs
Thibs best player was Julius Randle and the team got a homecourt seed. He seriously turned the Knicks around. He deserves this.
"Monty had CP3, Thibs had Julius Randle. That’s enough of a difference for me"
Julius Randle should be next to him so that he can announce he is giving his MIP award back
Julius Randle has entered the conversation..
"😆 lol @ instant contender. Julius Randie ain’t some star. He had a very deangelo Russell like year. Meaning, it’s a notch up from ‘stats on a bad team’, but it’s a category of ‘I’ll get my stats and win some games but we MUST play thru me and this is the only way I can play or i turn back into a pumpkin’. He’s one of those guys that gets worse with more talent around him. He’s too 1 dimensional  The more accurate thinking is you take the inflated stats of Julius randle and trade him FOR Lillard. With the hopes of Lillard arriving in NY gets free agents   But yea no. Lillard-randle-Barrett is no contender"
"Ik as soon as I said that you'd overreact like this lmao. I'll reexplain it to you as simply as possible, so there's no way for you to try to misconstrue it 💀  - Randle + large crowds = ""I think he'll shoot similar to how he did before this year, or maybe slightly better, but nowhere near as good as this season might indicate.""  - Randle +  large crowds + playoff pressure = ""Julius Randle is a 29% field goal shooter with crowds in the arena""  - Randle + small crowds + no playoff pressure = MIP Randle  It's not unrealistic to say he improved his game over the offseason, but there's no way he improved it [THIS MUCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mv614m/julius_randles_improvement_from_three_this_season/)  Hope that helped 🥰"
I mean if the playoffs ‘revealed the truth’ that means you think Julius Randle will shoot 29% from the field for the entirety of next season? Because that’s what you’re saying.   You think Julius Randle is a 29% field goal shooter with crowds in the arena
"Dude you’re just proving you don’t follow the Knicks or watch basketball   In the month of February to begin the season, Julius Randle shot 33% from behind the arc   In the month of April, with more crowds, he shot 43% from behind the arc.   The facts do not support what you’re saying. You might not like it, but it’s the truth"
It was a very small sample size.  I think the Knicks and Julius Randle owe one another to see what he can do with the squad next year.
"I can't believe this guy got paid more than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown this season."
At least Julius Randle was an All Star.  If I had to take one from that list I'm picking him for sure my bias be damned.
Trae played a team with Julius Randle as their best player. Dallas played Kawhi and PG13 lol.
Did people just decide to not watch the playoffs? It’s clearly Julius Randle
"The square-cube law makes it crazier. What would Julius Randle weigh at Porzingis's height with the same proportions?       Randle_weight * (KP_height / Randle_height)^3 = Randle_weight_if_scaled_to_KP_height       250 * (87 / 80)^3 = ~322lbs.       Randle scaled to KP's height with his current proportions/musculature would be 322lbs. Again, KP is 240, or about 82lbs shy of that. Fun fact, this comes out to the exact same for Rookie Shaq at 7'1"" and 300lb if you scaled him to KP size.       For a fun reminder, Shaq recently said that in his last Laker title he was 395lbs at 7'1"". If you scaled 2002 Shaq to KPs height, he would weigh **424lbs**.         If you take 310lb, relatively well-proportioned Yao and scale him *down* to KP's height, he would weigh 280lbs.        So current KP, when adjusted for height per square-cube law, is:   * 40lbs lighter than Yao   * 82lbs lighter than Randle and Rookie Shaq   * 184lbs lighter than 2002 champion Shaq          He is the same weight as 6'10"" Kevin Durant, no height adjustment here at all. Both 240lb. So scaled up, KD would be heavier than KP.     Okay last one. Giannis is 6'10"" and 242lbs. His current proportions maintained at 7'3"" would have him weighing 289lbs. So KP is ~50lbs shy of a Giannis build, and again ~82lbs shy of a Randle/Rookie Shaq build, ~184lbs shy of 2002 Shaq build lmao"
"Julius Randle and Pascal Siakam both got a lot of shit for how they performed in their previous playoff games.  For Randle it’s his first time being in the playoffs and it’s the first time being the guy. That’s a lot of pressure. With the effort he’s shown to become the MIP this year I’m positive he’ll be better next playoffs.  Same with Siakam, didn’t do so hot in the bubble and it was his first time also being the guy. He’s got plenty of time to improve and I’m sure he will too.  KAT and DLo. I think next year when that teams actually healthy they’ll be great. New coach and soon to be ownership, I think Minnesota will be dangerous soon"
"&gt; Porzingis is 7"" taller than Julius Randle and weighs 10lbs less lmao  what a way to frame that lol that's crazy"
"Look at Yao's frame. Yao was 310 at 7'6"". Porzingis is 240 at 7'3"". Tacko Fall is 7'5"" and 311.       So you've got big dudes like Tacko and Yao with actual decent frames and then tiny ass Porzingis at just 240 at 7'3"". Porzingis is 7"" taller than Julius Randle and weighs 10lbs less lmao"
Julius Randle is legit.
Chokers or not. They have Kawhi ffs. The other has Julius Randle.
&gt;      Andre Drummond      Montrezl Harrell      Kyle Kuzma      Julius Randle      Mitchell Robinson      Duncan Robinson  We got a fucking squad now boys
"Bruh they took the clippers to 7. No doubt in my mind they can take on the knicks and finish em off lmao. If Luka scored 35 ppg against Kawhi Leonard, he is for sure scoring more against Rj Barrett.  Plus Julius Randle is not about to put up Kawhi Leonard type stats lmao. Kawhi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Randle and the mavs almost beat the clippers."
Yeah and on top of that they make those guys play so many games. I remember reading as story on ESPN citing how Julius Randle broke his leg in his first NBA game that all these young players coming into the league being hurt early on could possibly be attributed to the AAU games. Giannis and Jokic are two of the most durable players in the league right now and Luka seems like he will be very durable as well and obviously none of them were in AAU
"Knicks led by Julius ""30FG%"" Randle are a joke to me yeah."
" Trae's playoff opponent: NYKnicks led by Julius Randle and 2021 DRose. Good game 1 against Sixers , props for that.  Luka's playoff opponent: Clippers led by Kawhi Leonard and Paul George"
I mean Julius Randle was also horrible.
Julius randle
"nah, even accounting for pace i doubt he gets to much over 30, his peak in terms of points per 100 possessions was 40.8 in 2009, and players rarely play more than ~75 possessions. for example, julius randle only averaged 75 possessions per game this season as the minutes per game leader"
The 1 with Julius randle on it
"pipe down, ya'll took down the knicks. Julius randle was their first option lmaooo"
Julius Randle is who we thought he was
"CJ for Julius Randle   It would be weird to have him run the point, but I think he could do it.  Portland needs another big bad, and I think he still feasts there."
The ole Julius Randle.
"&gt; As for the Knicks, the goal was to create cap space to sign KD and Kyrie, but they got neither and used that cap space on Marcus Morris, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, Julius Randle, and Taj Gibson.  The return on this was just outstanding. Flipped Marcus Morris for Quickley + DSJ for D Rose, Regular-Season Randle, etc.."
"Please, beat someone better than Julius Randle before you pretend like you've done anything impressive.  And no, the clippers made it to second round last year. I can tell you from experience they are way, way better this year than they were last year, mentally. Last year's team wouldve lost to us in 6. They were bullies last year...then they lost after being up 3-1 to the nuggets and got humbled.  They didn't act like bullies this year. They just acted like a better team."
"Ya, Young did not play the Clippers. RJ Barrett and Julius Randle is not in the same conversation as Kawhi and PG.  Not to mention that Luka has Tim Hardaway JR as the only respectable teammate where as Young has a decently built roster.  Garbage takes as usual 1 minute after a series lmao."
"&gt;. One had to beat Julius Randle at his worst, one had to beat Kawhi at his best. Nick Young trying his hardest to be Nick Wright.  honestly thought this was nick wright until you said that lol"
"&gt; One had to beat Julius Randle at his worst  So, you don't think the Hawks made randle look bad? The most improved player just lost all his powers to the monstars?"
he tricked y'all man starting lineup  Julius Randle  Pascal Siakam  Kristaps Porzingis  Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo
"One plays in the East, one plays in the West. One had to beat Julius Randle at his worst, one had to beat Kawhi at his best. Nick Young trying his hardest to be Nick Wright."
"&gt; with elfrid payton, rj barret, kevin knox and julius randle  That's sounds like a 1st round play-off team in the East to me"
"please  thibs is winning games with elfrid payton, rj barret, kevin knox and julius randle"
Haha that’s funny but realistically the Mavs should add. Julius Randle has proven a lot more. He is also taller and stronger and has better post moves and is a better rebounder and a better shooter.
Julius Randle would be a worse version of Lebron getting in his way all the time
Julius randle decided to go crazy while the bubble was going on. He studied a lot and he worked out almost every day and now he’s playing like someone who isn’t on the knicks
Texas needs some help.  Grant hill is the best player all time from there.  Bosh and lamarcus dont come close to reaching the tier grant hill was in.  Also jimmy butler is the best active player from texas right now unless you want to be real technical and reward julius randle for his start to the year
Except Zion is already a better scorer than Julius Randle.  I know there’s a circle jerk around Zion being the next GOAT or whatever but the counter jerk of him being a B level prospect is just as dumb. He’s gonna be a perennial all star and potential MVP candidate even if he’s not as good as the reigning 2x MVP
"Lol not at all tho. He's describing a worse julius randle.  Giannis handles the ball better, passes better, moves better off ball, plays defense, understands defense"
Julius Randle is averaging 6 assists wtf
I think The knicks could actually get in. The Knicks have the 7th best defense and have been clamping teams like the bucks and celtics who are shooting abysmally against them for some reason I can't explain. Julius randle been playing fantastic so I could see a world where they get in
Except that's not even their best player? Collin Sexton is there best player mate. The Knicks best player is Julius Randle. Idk why you wanna argue in circles but the Knicks fucking suck and nothing you say can change that.
Ive become a huge Julius Randle fan this season. His presence is definitely noticed once he’s on the floor.
Just did tonight. Have you seen what Julius Randle is doing on the Knicks? All I can say is good thing Brooklyn became a super team because the Knicks are actually not horrible.
"Magic with Vuc, Pistons with Grant, and I guess Knicks when MVP candidate Julius Randle goes back to normal"
PG Lonzo Ball  SG D'Angelo Russell  SF Brandon Ingram  PF Julius Randle  C    Ivica Zubac  6th Larry Nance
Booger Randle  Julius McFarland
"Immanuel Quickley and Julius Randle , Kenny Payne’s influence is helping the wildcats on the team"
"Jerami Grant (didn’t think he’d handle the higher usage)  Julius Randle (I think last year was just a down year because he looked really good in Nola, but Impressed with his consistency so far and decision making)  Blake Griffin (surprisingly terrible, the heat game tells it all)   KD (didn’t think he’d still be this good I can’t lie lmao)   DeAndre Hunter (he’s gotten comfortable and looks like a legit high level 2-way (not just 3 and D) piece for the hawks)   DeAndre Ayton ( I really though he would look All-NBA caliber this year, haven’t given up hope at all though he’s still good)"
"I catch myself watching the Knicks at times and thinking damn, Julius Randle is really ""the guy"" on this roster? Christ. But then he consistently outperforms my expectations and actually looks like a passable 1st option. Definitely did not expect this from Randle."
Julius Randle. Huge numbers and leading the Knicks
Julius Randle and tbh Thibs even though he isn’t a player. Changed the losing culture of the knicks which I didn’t think anyone could pull off
"Bro's a Clippers fan, he's in denial by nature. Lakers are the number one team in LA and it's not close, they were selling out the Staples Center with Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball as the teams stars."
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
Julius “23/11/6” Randle to you
"I'm hoping for Julius Randle if he keeps up his good performances, although that's probably a longer shot than LaVine (who I feel should be a no-brainer AS this yr, he's been better than Young/Simmons)"
I thought you’d be surprised how well they’re playing. Julius Randle went from Dubious Handle Crash out of bounds Bandicoot to King Julius the royal Beyblade

NBA honestly throws me off with ages the most of any sport. Even though I know they were in the same draft class I still think Marcus Smart and Julius Randle have 2+ years on Embiid and Jokic
"Julius Randle deserve honorable mention over Porzingis, Trae, Murray and Russ right now."
"Julius Randle, Harrel, Zion type of player. They are build as a power forward but too strong for most power/small forward to guard but are too fast for most center to guard."
"honestly? ive been a laker fan since I was born but I still am an obnoxious asshole when it comes to cheering on my team. I remember trash talking the lebron led cavs when marcelo huertas was diming them up, and crying when julius randle got injured in the first game of the season. I bleed purple and gold but trash talking is just really fun"
Julius randle is an mvp candidate
Im wholly invested in the Knicks this season because I love seeing how Julius Randle is putting up these nice statlines (idk if its translating on to on-court effectiveness bc i dont watch enough games) but I am hoping for the absolute best for him and the Knicks
"the LA teams combining would probably be better, but the NY teams combining would be pretty close behind.  ___  correct me if im wrong cause i dont follow them, but the LA team would be  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Serge Ibaka  ___  while the NY team would be  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julius Randle  C: Mitchell Robinson"
"Also living in New York and gotta disagree here. Sure, there’s plenty of hardcore fans, but if the Knicks had KD/Harden/Kyrie they’d draw in a huge number of tourists and casual fans who aren’t shelling out top dollar to go watch a team led by Julius Randle"
"Tha true but our closest all star is Julius Randle, and besides that it’s rj barret IQ then really no one else. We need legit players that can shoot and make plays"
"Terrence Ross and Julius Randle had a nice throw-off, unfortunately for Randle Ross had Cole Anthony on his side"
I have never said anything bad about Julius Randle and Tom Thibodeau
Julius Randle is just ridiculous. Should net the Knicks a ton of value if they decide to unload him
Why does it look like Julius Randle is about to fall asleep
"1st time All Stars should be De'Aaron Fox, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine in no particular order off the top of my head"
julius randle. knicks aren’t exactly winning.
Julius Randle....this guy looked like garbage last year and was a turnover machine...now he’s still kind of a turnover machine but he’s hustling and a team leader on both ends of the floor

Julius Randle would be great at dodgeball
"Oubre, Covington, Ayton have been disappointing   Jaylen, CJ, Jerami Grant and Julius Randle have been better than expected"
&gt; Julius Randle is a star  Good one!
Julius Randle went from a meme about bey blades to an elite playmaking mid range monster point forward
You sound like a hater. He’s putting up all star numbers but he’s still Julius randle so it doesn’t matter?
"Zion ""more efficient Julius Randle"" Williamson"
"Julius Randle, I think this is the year. I own two Randle jerseys from his Lakers days."
Julius Randle
Julius randle ?
Hes a knicks player putting up good numbers on a shit team. Hes still julius randle.   Remindme! 1 year  Is julius randle considered a star?
Julius Randle is playing so well this year.
Julius Randle is a star
"Who guarding julius randle, metal fusion gang"
Sounds very salty. I’m sorry you can’t contain immanuel quickley and Julius randle. Lmfao
Be happy that Julius Randle took it easy on y’all
He is the point guard version of Julius Randle
He's absolutely not been better than Julius Randle to start the season
you cannot stop julius randle you can only hope to contain him
Julius Randle is the best player in the nba and im not afraid to say it
Julius randle  Bounding astounding dooping hooping dishing swishing mesmerizing posterizing
This year Julius Randle is out of control !
Kuzma-Zion-Julius Randle- Draymond Green - Kevin Love
East a huge favor?  There’s a team looking unstoppable in New York   Julius Randle disrespect gotta stop
You need to take into account previous seasons. Julius randle is averaging the same numbers as AD this season but you wouldn’t say they’re equal
"Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina, Jared Harper, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullcock, Mo Harkless, Ignas Brazekdis, DSJ, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, Tah Gibson."
More versatile means nothing. Julius Randle is better than Curry then.
"I saw a ""who is better: Pascal Siakam or Julius Randle?"" Post on here like three days ago.  You're comparing a guy on one of the worst teams of the decade to the guy who hit the championship-clinching shot over Draymond Green in the 2019 Finals but sure okay."
"True, but it doesn't even have to be a star. It could be like a Jerami Grant, a Julius Randle, a Christian Wood.  If the Nets have cap space they could also take an overpaid slightly over the hill player like a Horford. Also you're not relying on no good FA in 2022, it's no good FA every single year. The Rockets don't want like a middling pick, they want a lotto pick. You need to be really bad to be in that range. Also keep in mind there will undoubtedly be teams outright tanking to get lotto picks."
Julius randle should so be in. This is crazy
And the great Julius Randle wore 30 lol
No Julius Randle?
"LeBron, Giannis, Dame, Luka, and Julius Randle"
"IMO he makes a lot of sense as a backup PG that could contribute to many teams. He's extremely physical going to the rim and has decent vision. But on our roster he's literally just a shittier version of RJ Barrett, trying to fill the same role as Julius Randle."

"Lmao speaking of the knicks as a 90s team, I was talking to my dad on the phone and he referred to Julius randle as dollar store chris Webber"
We lost to MVP Julius Randle it’s ok
He’s only averaging 24-8-7. I’d rather have Julius Randle
Good thing Julius randle will get it back for him😤
#Julius Randle is just Zion Williamson with hops
Porzingis was amazing on the Knicks. Even Julius Randle is balling out. I think RJ just isnt that good
How did Julius Randle not make the team or even the snub list? Man is averaging 23/11/7...
"I agree Nets have a much better FO now compared to before but if their big 3 leaves in 22' after failing to win it all, it will be very difficult for them to attract superstar talent since they do not have control over their future until after 27'. A superstar player isn't going to Nets when they know they dont even have picks to make the team better. At best, they'd attract guys like Julius Randle who are seeking a max contract with all the cap space they'll have. I see them at best being a bottom 10 lottery team once their big 3 leaves.   People severly overrated Marks during the transition from King. If you go take a look at their roster, yes they signed good role players and fielded a good team eventually but even then without their FRPs, they still struggled to make the playoffs until 3 years down the road and that's only because they were able to get a lucky trade in D'Lo (who only got kicked out of LA because of Magic the GM).   Also trading Wall who is on a 41mil/year contract will not be easy. He's not a complete negative like Westbrook but it's still a negative contract. You'd have to give up at least a pick to get rid of his salary right now and Rockets are already short on picks because of the OKC trade.   Getting Simmons back means your team will not be good enough to contend but they won't have the flexibility to tank either since Simmons will be on the books for 4 years and like I said, if you try to trade Simmons he would not net you back 2 unprotected FRPs + 4 unprotected pick swaps. And it'd have to be a team that can potentially be a bottom 10 lottery (to match BKE's picks value). This isn't considering Morey's picks that they give you for Harden will 100% be lottery protected like they've always been in the past."
Any chance Julius Randle is up there?
Julius Randle is signed for $17M per year. That's good value for someone who's playing at an All-Star level so far this season.   Mitchell Robinson is the team's defensive anchor and he's on a 3 year/$4M contract.
"Here are some things that were going on in that season just to put into perspective how long he was a rocket  ____ Kobe was somehow willing the Lakers into the playoffs  _____ Melo was a legitimate MVP candidate  _____ KD had just won his 2nd of 4 scoring titles ____ Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett were in the midst of their last season as Celtics before being traded to the nets ____ Kyrie Irving was coming off of a very strong ROTY season _____ Giannis Antetokumpo was averaging 9 points, 5 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 block per game for Filathlitikos in the Greek League. He was a Greek League all star that season _____ Jabari Parker, Aaron Harrison, and Julius Randle were the 3 highest ranked high school recruits (MaxPreps) _____ There's a lot more and if you think of anything else please add it"
"Julius Randle, Elfrid Payton, Austin rivers and Reggie Bullock"
The New York Knicks. Julius Randle is the goat.
Hey man good to hear! Julius Randle has been fun to watch
That's basically all Twitter nba comment sections. Could be a post of Julius Randle doing a 360 no look between the legs dunk  or something and LeBron will be the first thing  brought up
Yeah thats dumb though.  The idea of MVP being the most valuable to your team is flawed fundamentally.  This years MVP would be Julius Randle if that were the criteria.
Missing Julius Randle at 45 https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Julius-Randle/Bests/24301
A campaign for a Julius Randle All-star spot would probably get more media attention than if the Nets won 20 straight
"not to mention these are just tons of assets HOU can flip if they feel they are fringe competitors in 2-3 years. Sort of like how every single trade/offseason people mentioned Celtics/Danny Ainge as a possibility.  They could theoretically move Wall/Boogie/Tucker for more assets and then play with tons of assets/cap space and build a good team around Wood who is only 25 (if he maintains his current success).       2021 is a bad FA class, but in 2022 it opens back up with Kawhii (UFA), Beal (PO), Curry (UFA), Zach Lavine (UFA), Julius Randle (UFA), Marcus Smart, JV  Technically Trae/Luka/Sexton/SGA/Jaren Jackson, etc all become RFA       Could build a respectable team in 2 years and then have 45 first round picks to trade for a superstar"
"So far I've been down voted for questioning players that might be on hot streaks:  Knicks fans: Julius Randle has always been good, everyone had been wrong about him.  Hawks fans: DeAndre Hunter can score whenever he wants."
Bobby Portis and Reggie Jackson.   But I will say that Julius randle outplayed his contract.
I feel like it's actually Jerami Grant and Julius Randle that was more of the 50/50 decision
Julius randle could play center better
Kevin Love over Julius Randle??!! It’s a travesty. Julius balled out and plays with so much heart. Definitely deserves the spot a whole lot more than Kevin Love. That dude hasn’t played in ages me he should be out of the league.
"The Knicks end up with Julius Randle and Damian Lillard and basically nothing else.  They really have no way to fill out the rest of the rost.  The Blazers don't exactly get fleeced here, but I wouldn't be shocked if they could get a better a deal than this."
Bucks fan here.  Julius Randle was fun to watch this year.  Kevin Love is still in the league?
Wolves get Ben Simmons  Knicks get Anthony Edwards.. Malik Beasley.. picks  Sixers get Julius Randle  Who says no?
"Covington, Powell, and Jones Jr. come off the books after next season. That’s $32 million in room to sign a swingman over 6’6” to play the 3, and a weak side defending, 3-ball shooting PF.   Jimmy Butler, KD, and Julius Randle, JaMychal Green, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bamba, Okongwu, and others will be available.  Dame should be patient and wait a year, and if they don’t make moves at the deadline next year, then consider asking for a trade."
"Knicks, they have the 2 first round picks from the Mavs, plus their own 2. the 2nd rounder from the Pistons (#32). As for players they have Quickley, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson (doubt they'll want to include RJ Barrett but in the right package I could see it)  Kevin Knox is 22 and needs a change of scenery. I think they have the ammo and could include pick swaps if necessary to pull it off. A point guard has been the achilles heel of this roster and I don't see another player of his caliber at the exact position of need for them coming available while Julius Randle is still in All-NBA form and the window to make a run is open"
"From a Lakers fan that has 2 Julius Randle jerseys and a Brandon Ingram jersey, this hurts."
Julius Randle
"Milwaukee has accomplished nothing.    Every eastern conference All NBA player other than Giannis and Julius Randle has been compromised. Randle was on a team with the coach of the year meaning they over achieved and shouldn't have even been in the post season. It took all of that for them to make a deep playoff run.     This is their one and only chance because they're gonna have the short off season going into next year, and things will be back to normal from their moving forward.   Again the Bucks are the true definition of pretenders like the Raptors were before Kawhi."
"Julius Randle, Ben Simmons, CJ McCollum, Nurkic also imo. I expected more outta him."
"Julius Randle, we swept it under the rug because Ben but good lord he was terrible"
our team defense is laughably non-existent. And people really think Nate is a top end defensive guy because we shut down Julius Randle and made SImmons just be Ben Simmons. Guy is such an overrated clown in this department and you cant tell me nothing to change my mind.
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
"Julius Randle, without him we don't even make the playoffs, he carried us to a Top 4 seed, even if he had a bad playoffs his season cannot be glossed over"
Whoa there was a different Randle other than Julius on the court round 1?
Eh the Knicks were #4 this year with Julius Randle as their best player. He had a great season but I don't think he's better than Middleton.
Well you can say this is a dumb take but i really believe that putting Kobe on any team will make them better.  I really do.  Im a foreigner from another continent so i do not know about the salary cap limits.  Take the New York knicks for example.  I think they have space salary wise no?  Derrick Rose/RJ Barret/Mitchell Robinson/Julius Randle/Kobe.  The knicks struggled in the playoffs D Rose was doing good for a reason he is a former MVP.  Sometimes you need a leader or someone to take the load off other players on the court and he does that.
"That's how you end up with Julius Randle at 5 yrs, 225 million with a no-trade clause."
No clue how Julius randle hasn’t been mentioned
As the Knicks I protect  Julius Randle  RJ Barrett  Mitchell Robinson  Immanuel Quickley  Obi Toppin  Luca Vildoza   And since we'd have 8 or less under contract I'd put Kevin Knox as our unprotected pick
Our sub has a guy whos obsessed with frank Ntilikina of all people. Every post is related to him. The post could be about Julius Randle and he’ll be trying to give an essay on why frank sucks as if he’s our starting pg and not someone on the end of our bench 😂
I’m pretty sure this is exactly what Julius Randle had in his head for every second of the 2020 season.
Why are people calling Giannis beyblade   I thought that was Julius Randle name
One played against a team with Kawhi and PG13 while the other has gone up against a team who’s best player is Julius Randle and then a one legged Embiid with a guy who literally refuses to dunk while wide open.
"&gt; and he is also a better shooter imo  From the free throw line sure. Anywhere else not really.  &gt;Trae plays more winning basketball and is a more willing passer  yeah yeah the old ""more winning basketball"".  &gt;Trae also made it to the conference finals, while Luka has not made it out of the first round.  Julius ""brick"" Randle Knicks  &amp; Embid ""Knee injury"" and Ben ""what is shooting"" Sixers &gt;&gt;&gt; Healthy Clippers ofcourse agreed."
"tbf COY is a regular season award and until the playoffs, cp3 was getting all the credit for the suns being good, while thibs was getting all the credit for the knicks being the 4th seed and julius randle improving (in the regular season)"
Probably the worst take ever. Stop using his regular season stats on a 10th seed timberwolves team to pretend he's good. Kevin Love produced fine numbers as a Cavs in the regular season for a third option. The issue is he's a terrible playoff performer just like Julius Randle. How tf is LeBron supposed to fix that.
"REVERSE QUESTION Besides Simmons, who has earned the most critics this playoffs?   Off the top  i went with bud.  Honorable sad mention julius randle but i dnt really think its his fault for the team around him."
who do you mean by enes kanter with passing and andre roberson with a handle are you talking about julius randle and ben simmons
"&gt;Cry about an insult too like that means you are taking the high road  Lol. My man, not being as easily unnerved or agitated as you is not ""taking the high road"". Don't get so affected by reddit comments. Chill.  &gt; I’m sorry your team is in worse shape than us rn  Are we? I mean, we're not the ones going to max Julius Randle after his epic meltdown in the playoffs. We also don't have to spend the near future in the shadow of an actually good team in our own city.   &gt;don’t worry tho y’all will definitely turn it around  Lmao. A Knicks fan offering 'consolation'. Hilarious."
"Guys can get clamped but it's rarely by just 1 defender and it's rarely ever a superstar offensive player. The Hawks as a unit played great team defense on Julius Randle all series, every time he got to the rim he was faced with like 3 bodies, he was forced into a ton of bad decisions and turnovers. But when Booker plays great for 2 games, then has 2 bad games even though the defensive scheme for the Clippers hasn't really changed at all you can't rush to give all the credit to the defense even though they certainly did their jobs, and much less give all that credit to 1 guy who probably was the primary defender on 1/3 of Booker's shot attempts."
"I'm just saying we throw around labels like ""clamped"" and ""locked up"" only based on the results. Guys like Ben Simmons, Capela, PJ Tucker, Pat Bev, etc: they play great defense every night. But the offensive superstars? They get paid the big money to hit shots in spite of great defense. Pat Bev did his job last night, Booker didn't. If Booker drops 40 the next game that's still not Beverly's fault though, he's probably playing just as good defense but with a guy like Booker he'll only stay quiet for so long. That's why I'm also not rushing to give him too much credit for Booker's bad performance. You can clamp a guy like Julius Randle, the Hawks did it for the entire first round. You can't really clamp Devin Booker."
"**we are going to pay him**. hawks fans keep saying they dont think hes a max player... but that doesnt matter. if we werent going to sign him to an extension he would have been traded by the deadline.   also people on here seem to have little understanding of the salary cap and what contracts players get. theres people in this thread saying Gobert isnt worth a max. like wtf are you talking about. there is about 40 players who have 25+ million/yr deals. JC just outplayed tobias harris, and ben simmons and julius randle. He will get a 25+ million offer"
"Well I didn't want to get in a huge argument about how good Sabonis is, cuz I don't really care and that wasn't my point lol I know he puts up similar numbers as Julius Randle when the team is healthy  I was just questioning where all these top 25 players are at, and how Pacers are supposed to get one of those guys, cuz they don't just grow on trees"
When did it originate? I first started seeing it used on Julius Randle
"It’s Beverly, Danny green, Wiggins, Julius randle and Myles turner"
"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Knicks and the 76ers trying to act all tough against the Hawks, only to be sent home. I enjoyed Embiids post game interview blaming the refs for their loss. I enjoyed Julius Randle getting all cranky while they were losing, throwing cheap shots and acting dejected.   Yeah, I have enjoyed all of the shade that the Hawks of generated."
"They literally gave the Knicks their current team. Knicks got RJ via ridding themselves of KP, DSJ got them drose, cap space from KP contract got them Julius Randle, Taj Gibson and Marcus Morris. Marcus Morris got them Immanuel Quickley. Not to mention the fact that KP trade expedited fizdale and the contemporary FO getting ousted in favor of Leon Rose/Worldwide Wes who hired Thibs. The Knicks post KP trade have literally made it just as far as Luka’s Mavericks lol.Oh and the Knicks have two firsts from mavericks they can play around with.    Mavericks did get Tim Hardaway though so that cool but Knicks literally acquired five of their top 8 players as a near direct result of the KP trade"
Zion be going to the Knicks for RJ Barrett and Julius Randle
"""Winning brand of basketbal"" lmao. Please read what you've typed before posting it. Hawks have never had a better record than the mavs since 2018, despite playing in the east. And btw it took one of the greatest 2 way series of all time by kawhi and PG averaging 24/9/6 to beat him. While the hawks played a knicks team with Julius Randle as their best player who averaged 18 points shooting 30% from the floor."
"While Trae’s run is definitely impressive and im shocked to see it, it is a difference between playing the knicks with a struggling julius randle in the first round than playing a healthy clippers team. and then playing the sixers and letting them shit the bed (which was also impressive ngl)"
I was so confused watching him. Like every shot he took was pretty well contested. Is that his entire game? Does he ever generate open looks for himself? It reminded me a lot of Julius Randle in the Knicks series where I didn't understand why he kept taking contested midrangers or how he somehow made those same shots all regular season.
He's the mental polar opposite of Julius Randle
"Also Julius Randle had put together a great season, and all signs were that he was just going to keep doing that."
"Trae Donovan Mitchell  Ingram Zion Julius Randle  CJ McCullom  John Collins Liangelo  Playmaking, 3pt shooting, and muscle. Think that five is stronger than any starting five the current olympic team could make IMO. Didn't look it up but probably just named all the olympic camp alternate invites."
Why Love over Julius Randle?
Julius randle won the most fraudulent MIP
Empty stats narrative usually quiets down when the team makes the playoffs. The narrative dies if said player wins a playoff series as the lead guy. Booker and Trae killed that narrative this season.   Julius Randle gets an acknowledgement of growth.   Zach Lavine still has that narrative.
Gonna be an all star for the next decade plus easily. He’s played astronomically better than two guys picked over him this postseason in Ben Simmons and Julius Randle
"I don’t know, man. The Hawks don’t have the defensive personnel to stop ~~Julius Randle~~ ~~Joel Embiid~~ Giannis, and the ~~Knicks~~ ~~Sixers~~ Bucks have a lot of long defenders that will slow down Trae’s scoring and take away his passing lanes. Trae Young will get targeted on the defensive end and there’s just no way that the Hawks can score enough to make up for that. The Hawks should be proud that they made the ~~playoffs~~ ~~second round~~ conference finals after such a bad start to the season but this is as far as they’ll get"
"Somehow we managed to sign Julius Randle, Ben Simmons and Khris Middleton in the postseason. We might be spooky"
"&gt;Julius Randle  Id take randle out, but you could easily replace him with other dudes not named simmons as well so your point stands (Derozan, SGA, Murray, etc.)"
man ... imagine how good this Hawks team would be if they had an All-Star like Julius Randle or Domantas Sabonis
julius randle has that locked up
Worry about Julius no show Randle being your best player lol.
"it's less about overall skill and more about fit. a guy like julius randle has little use on the national team imo because he's rarely gonna touch the ball on offense, which is him at his best. He isn't a rim protector, he's not a rim runner, and he's not a spot up shooter. that's largely what you want around the guards and wings who will get all of the usage...of course, i'm not sure what love offers tho lol"
Yeah you guys really did a great job developing Julius Randle into an all nba player from the draft /s
"Committing doesn’t necessarily mean Team USA will take you. You are just in a pool of players. This applies most to Kevin Love though. Right now there are 12 commits, but if like PG13/Kawhi (or someone else who hasn’t said anything) decides they want to play, I guarantee one of the earlier commits won’t make the team. I’m actually surprised someone like Julius Randle hasn’t been asked/said anything (he’s clearly much better at Kevin Love at everything)."
"Seriously the hawks fired their head coach mid-season for an interim guy who was fired for not getting his teams over the hump and had like the 2nd best record after that. They consecutively crushed the Knicks and beat the sixers at home and the stories were all about Julius Randle, Ben Simmons and embiid.  They've got a solid core all under 24 and will probably be good for years to come, why would you ignore that!? WHY?!"
You'd think a fan of a team who's biggest free agent in the last 5 years being Julius Randle wouldn't talk about others being a destination
"2019 Coby White, North Carolina – Chicago Bulls   2018 Wendell Carter Jr., Duke – Chicago Bulls   2017 Lauri Markkanen, Arizona – Minnesota Timberwolves   2016 Jamal Murray, Kentucky – Denver Nuggets   2015 Emmanuel Mudiay, Guangdong Tigers – Denver Nuggets   2014 Julius Randle, Kentucky – Los Angeles Lakers   2013 Ben McLemore, Kansas – Sacramento Kings   2012 Harrison Barnes, North Carolina – Golden State Warriors   2011 Bismack Biyombo, Congo – Sacramento Kings   2010 Greg Monroe, Georgetown – Detroit Pistons     2/10 times in the last 10 years the picks actually hit at 7, would I give up someone like Ben Mclemore and Wiggins for Dlo? Sure"
I hope Julius Randle brings all the fruits that you desire you magnificent son of a bitch

Julius Randle worked his ass off last summer and it shows immediately. I hope Ben gets it together and works on his game
Julius Randle or RJ Barrett.
"It's basically a summer league hosted in Los Angeles with teams comprised of amateurs, semi-pros and pros that's not affiliated with the NBA whatsoever.  If you're near LA I'd 100% say it's worth going to. I went a few years ago with some friends and even though the high tier stars like Harden and KD weren't playing I still got to see Julius Randle, Swaggy P, Baron Davis, Andre Drummond and Lou Will with fantastic seats for free. Sweet Lou actually went crazy and dropped [50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IegdYf133uQ), was super fun to watch."
"Ok and julius randle made a all nba team and just got gentleman swept in the first round plsying one of the worst series a star has ever played so i think the whole “all star and all nba” argument is stupid. If you want to input something actually watch the games instead of just looking at who made what team and the box score. As much as i love luka and trae trae has had far more of an impact on his team winning in these plsyoffs than luka despite what the box score says. That is not to say luka hasn’t contributed to the team winning bc he had an amazing series, but the way he plays rn will never win you a playoff series even if hes averaging 50/20/10. Hero ball doesnt work in the playoffs call it coaching call it a diva additude call it a poor front office, trae has contributed more to winning this post season"
This is the playoffs teams expose weaknesses your acting like the teams didn’t know and with Julius randle the hawks defended him great they wanted someone else to beat them and he probably still gets the max
You said that as if Seth average 9 on 43ts%. Dude was scoring 20 on 80ts%. That's like 4 times better than what Julius Randle did.
"&gt;How is Lue overachieving?  This is kinda disingenuous. The vast majority of people had Utah winning the series after Kawhi went down.  &gt;Thibs is the one that overachieved this year. He took what was expected to be a lottery team to the 4 seed, albeit in the weaker East, with Julius Randle as his best player  They would be a 10th/9th seed in the west. Wouldn’t even be 4th in the east if ATL/Boston/Miami didn’t have major injuries.  I watched a good amount of NYK games this season, and they weren’t that good of a team. A great defensive team who’s last in pace is going to rack up regular season wins, but I correctly predicted them getting swept in the postseason."
"How is Lue overachieving? They finished off a Nuggets team without their second best player and just dropped game 1 to the Suns without Chris Paul.   Thibs is the one that overachieved this year. He took what was expected to be a lottery team to the 4 seed, albeit in the weaker East, with Julius Randle as his best player"
"hear me out -  ben simmons strength? defending. the knicks coach? 2008 championship winning boston celtics' defensive coach tom thibodeau!  are there other misfits who have gone to the knicks and/or thibodeau and magically become skillful? yes! julius randle and derrick rose have both improved since returning to the embrace of thibodeau.  i thought it was dumb at first too, but maybe simmons to the knicks works. and if it doesn't, we still get to lolknicks"
"It’s about more than Simmons. It’s about the conclusions fans draw from small sample sizes. Like the playoff performances of Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Paul George last year, McCollum, Gobert, etc."
"I was only really looking at Jaylen BI and Simmons since the other 3 weren't in a top 5 discussion at the time (I also don't think anyone would take Sabonis over Simmons full stop). Me personally I would take Jaylen Brown 1st but there are many arguments for Simmons. He is clearly the best defender and the best passer of the bunch but he also clearly struggles on offense and has a Tony Allen-like effect on the offensive end.   He still has the best winshare/48 minutes in that draft, the highest VORP, etc. I think people overreact to one bad series. People assume everyone else will continue to up in skill while Simmons will continue to stay the same or decrease. He can still have a Julius Randle career where you start off well, stall off, then wake up and improve."
Saying Julius randle is on a max contract just as another excuse to slander pretty much summarizes r/nba
Feel like he’d be way more similar to pre 2021 julius randle. no way josh smith would settle for that role in any era
"Dennis Schroeder and Julius Randle need to be there. Also, please apply a minimum  contract value of $ 20 M per annum as a filter to weed out cases of inflated expectations (Kuzma, Harris).  For Gobert and KP, it was mostly a case of circumstances - playing against Clippers, and in terms of strategy - between a rock and a hard place. Ought to be excused as it was mostly doing what they were asked to do by the team."
"i agree with you to an extent, but not entirely. julius randle his one year in nola had a really strong statline. 21/9/3 on 60% TS. but i watched a decent chunk of their games that year and he was uhhh... not nearly as good as his statline implies. i remember a lotta pels fans saying the same thing about him.  obv by no means was he a bad player that season and the fact that he could pull that sort of statline means hes clearly got the talent. just that his impact was being very much overstated, hence ""empty stats""  as a rockets fan, saw a similar phenomenon last year during that stretch where russ was averaging like 35 a game for nearly 2 months and was doing it efficiently. youd think he was playing at an mvp level, but it was really like borderline all-nba level. with the way teams were selling out to guard harden and leaving russ wiide open... any all star couldve put up massive numbers in a system like that  but that type of empty stats vs what booker and young were doing on shitty ass teams is very very different. anyone who watched those two teams saw how huge of an impact they had on the game, and how many quality shots they were consistently generating for themselves and others while being the only players worth guarding. thats not empty stats at all"

"With these playoffs, all nba 2nd team, Julius randle"
😂 go prep for tryna convince strangers why Julius Randle is an all-star next season
julius randle. id be shocked if he makes another 2nd team all nba
Julius Randle
"I disagree with your first point. To be an All-Star, you need to show drastic improvement; like what Julius Randle did this season (MIP + All-Star + 2nd team All-NBA).  He is definitely better at defense, which is his calling card. BUT, he is simultaneously improving on one end of the game while declining in the other.  He took the least amount of shots this season in his entire career, averaged the least points, assists &amp; rebounds in his entire career till now and shot 33% this playoffs.  Additionally, lowest PER,  lowest assist percentage, lowest offensive win shares, 2nd lowest defensive win shares, lowest win shares, lowest offensive box +/-, 2nd lowest defensive box +/-, lowest box +/- and lowest VORP IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER! *these are advanced regular statistics by the way.  He has literally by nearly all available metrics performed the worst in his career thus far and HE STILL GOT AN ALL-STAR SELECTION.  The statistics just don't justify your claim that he performed well this regular season.   So why shouldn't we expect him to at least improve on his skillset before giving him that All-Star nod. He deprives another player of their all-star selection while playing below expectations.  4 years? And he can't even shoot beyond like what, 12 feet out? Not even a floater game? Not even from the free throw line?"
"This is a terrible post  For one thing, Gobert was absolute dogshit on the defensive end this series. He constantly got abused on that end and he got in foul trouble in a number of games as well and he should’ve been taken out because he wasn’t contributing at all. Your 40 and 10 example makes sense if Gobert was locking guys up and making it really hard for the Clippers. But he wasn’t. What he did on the defensive end is comparable to what Julius Randle did for the Knicks against Atlanta. Except Randle doesn’t get paid 200 million. No player who gets paid 200 million shits the bed like this. Giannis was incredible on all ends and he played a way tougher team than the clippers. That’s what a 200 million dollar player looks like. Gobert is the biggest reason Utah will never go further than the 2nd round. He’s trash.  The biggest disappointment behind him has been Ben Simmons. And even though he gets paid less, atleast he can make some good plays and has gotten some impressive defensive stops this playoffs. He’s definitely not getting abused on defense like Gobert is."
That OT was like Julius Randle playing in the playoffs
Who fell off harder in the playoffs Julius Randle or Joe Harris?
Julius Randle?
"Jrue ""Playoff Julius Randle"" Holiday"
"Probably not if we're being completely honest. In fairness that Sixers series is a blight on Nurse's resume because shit just looked bad for the Raptors a lot of the time in that series, but everything after that was a positive. I don't know if Casey would've been able to utilize Gasol as well as Nurse did against the Bucks, or if he would've been able to gameplan against Curry and put Vanvleet on him like a roving defensive satellite, essentially putting Curry in a box-and-one situation for most of the series. Defensive rotations were crisp in the finals, something a head coach just does not accidentally coach a team into. After Kawhi left, the defensive rotations stayed crisp and we were able to push the Celtics to 7 games even though Siakam played like playoff Julius Randle.  To be fair, we were capable of winning that series despite Siakam's woes, and a lot of the responsibilities for that loss falls on Nurse. I truly believe that if you're able to push a team to 7, then you're capable of winning. But I like to think that Nurse learned a lot from that loss, and that he wouldn't be a good coach if he otherwise didn't. Nurse just puts a lot of fight in his players, and I truly believe that any loss in the playoffs won't come before 6-7 games, no matter how good the other team is compared to the Raptors. I know that sounds insane, but I actually believe it."
Julius Randle.
Julius Randle has been putting up 22/11/6 and acting as a primary facilitator on a surprising Knicks team. Were he on any other team than the Lolknicks he’s be getting a lot more credit.

"From Bball Ref, the games before tonight:  Giannis - 33  Zion - 27  Lebron - 24  Luka - 22  Julius Randle - 22"
True but look where they are now. Dennis Smith Jr. is gone. DeAndre Jordan is gone. They used that salary flexibility to sign Julius Randle and not much else because players weren't interested in playing with the Knicks. Porzingis was the only attraction to playing in NYC for other players and they shipped him out. He was literally their only ticket out of a 25 win seasons.
Julius ~~”Beyblade”~~ “All-Star” Randle
I am a Harden fan and live on the west coast but I love watching this Knick team for whatever reason I have watched around 10 of their games. Thibs has these guys dialed in all 4 quarters playing defense and Julius Randle living up to his deal and playing like a monster.
"Julius Randle needs to be on the team. And I'm a Bulls fan (yeah, and I've been working to get Zach on it too.)"
Luka Doncic without handles is Julius Randle without the centrifugal force.
"I dont agree, and I have a feeling most nba fans would share the sentiment   Look at the history, none of his teams acheived anything, even when they had more talent and was playing similar minutes. He is simply just a high end B-tier player putting up big time stats on a bad team, and he needs to be paid soon too. I'm sorry to say but he is not worth any lottery pick, or honestly any low mid 1st rounder as well.  Julius randle has played better than Levine this season, and honestly have would have the same assessment of value for him."
I don’t think the knicks expected Julius Randle to have the breakout fringe all-star year he was having.
A few reasons.  Julius Randle took an incredible step forward this year. He’s playing like an all star and plays the same positions as Obi.  He was injured as you mentioned but he hasn’t played that well so far and thibs is very much about “earning minutes”.   It’s not entirely his fault though. We don’t haven’t had a great distributing point guard and his game really relies on a pg to get him involved.  I’d reckon you will see him get a lot more minutes soon in the second unit with Rose at PG.
*Ahem* Julius Randle
"They should have been drafting around the top 5 for the last 3-4 years. Cleared up cap space and went after decent free agents while guys like Porzingis were on rookie deals.      I don't get why they went out and signed THJ or used the cap space from the Porzingis trade to get Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, and Marcus Morris. That's 4 older, mediocre, low ceiling PFs, when their 2 best young players at the time were Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson."
"Miserable? Im having a great time!  I actually got to laugh at you saying the knicks fans are critical of their team when posts like ""Is Julius Randle a top 10 all time PF"" show up regularly in this particular cesspool of the internet"
It could prove to be a fluke in the long run and I may be biased but I believe Julius Randle has been a top 30 player this year so far.
" &gt;I think Thibs would be willing to trade Quickly lol.   Thibs is the coach not the GM or President.   He can't trade anyone  Also when Thibs coached the Bulls he made Rose, Deng, Noah, Gibson, Butler, Asik play their best basketball up to that point. With the Wolves, KAT, LaVine, Wiggins played their best basketball to that point.  On the Knicks, Julius Randle is playing the best basketball of his career   Why do we question Thibs ability to develop when he's shown he can develop well"
Julius Randle:  * [x] centrifugal power   Blake Griffin:  * [   ] Centrifugal power
"I'm def biased but Julius Randle is playing better than 4-7 on that list this season but I get this is the first season he's played this good so people aren't very aware. Especially because the Knicks have struggled recently.  Hope the coaches select him though. He's playing great D and is basically averaging a lebron lite stat line with 22/11/6 on less turnovers (his biggest flaw) and 47/38/80. Above 40% on 3 in this recent stretch as well.   Unfortunately I see Randle being a snub this year due to having a reputation disadvantage and lack of wins, but would get the nod next year if he keeps up this level of play."
Julius Randle:  * [x] knees   Blake Griffin:  * [   ] knees

"He’s 22 years old, you guys would’ve said the same thing about Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson just a year ago and they are 25"
Woj reported that Randle needed foot surgery before the draft back in 2014 but he was perfectly fine: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/julius-randle-foot-surgery-never-been-considered/
"His game is underrated.  Everyone wants flashy dunks, but part of the reason he chose Duke was Coach K saying, *""Hey I don't give a shit about the dunks. I like the other shit you do too. I'm going to give you the ball and let you do your thang.""* And I think we're going to see more and more of that once he has a full season of games under his belt. He can get his teammates good looks, he can pass, he can make other guys' lives a lot easier on the court. His efficiency % is nice, but it's fun to see these ASTs numbers bump up game to game too.  Fans from other teams are saying he's ""Eric Paschall, Julius Randle, and Keldon Johnson light"" so he is underrated in that sense too. lol."
LMAO JULIUS RANDLE PLAYS LIKE 40 MINUTES AND AVERAGES 30 POINTS ON 40 SHOTS HE FUCKING SUCKS 🗿

stfu Julius Randle he's better than you.
Julius randle putting up peak Blake numbers while the real one can’t even run enough to get off spot up 3 duty but okay
I’ll be shocked if all these guys don’t make it. Aside from Julius randle.
"Jaylen Brown &amp; Devin Booker are ahead of  several of the guys on your list so let's include them.  I'd also say SGA, CJ McCollum, Siakam, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Ingram and Middleton are all better.  Julius Randle &amp; Ben Simmons are probably where the line is, so that's another 8-11 guys at least (I am probably forgetting some).  It's interesting to name the guys, something we almost never do, as a result there are 12 top 5 players in the league at any given time.  EDIT: I forgot De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant and Zach Lavine, would take them over Murray comfortably."
"Bam and Jimmy each got the same amount of free throws as all the damn Knicks. The fuck was good with Randle taking only Js man, he was offfff. We couldn’t shoot for shit late, but the refs weren’t giving us shit. Never forget, Bam stuck his fingers in Julius Randle’s asshole and the refs called the foul on Randle for having his booty too exposed or some shit. (Victims fault)"
Lol Julius “kd” randle was just shooting pull ups. Rj drives but he doesn’t really drive into a defender which he’ll learn but that’s why he didn’t get free throws
lol as if RJ Barrett and Julius Randle don't attack the rim. GTFOH with this garbage
"""how can you say this when you have julius randle"" as if randle gets calls at a high clip or something LMFAO"
dumbass really tried that after clearly not watching the game (or Julius Randle ever)
Julius Randle with hops
There's no point getting through the heads of some of these short-sighted Warriors fans. Someone in r/warriors legitimately asked if we should trade the Minny pick for Julius Randle as a win-now move lol
LeBron “Julius Randle” James
Should he be in it? Sure. Should he be in it OVER Donovan and Booker? Fuck no. He's All Star voting is a popularity contest anyway. If it was actually based on stats/performance Julius Randle would likely be over Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo in regards to votes.
Julius randle and the Knicks
That's because they all know Julius Randle and Immanuel Quickley are going to carry the knicks to the finals
Can’t believe Pascal won a chip and mfers started calling him the Beyblade like he’s Julius Randle
"Julius Randle. Under Thibs I've seen the ability to distribute the ball, he isn't a ball stopper any longer and he can finally drive on my both sides. On the other hand RJ has been pretty solid, I like his assertiveness and he wants it every single night, but he needs to work on his shot because it doesn't seem that it improved significantly over the off-season."
Harrison Barnes? I am... I audibly gasped. Also Julius Randle too? Interesting...
The worst part is Mal (dude in the beanie) is best friends with Julius Randle
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
Bruh said don't let Julius Randle drop 70 on you too lmaoo
"Julius Randle should be way higher. He went from someone who couldn’t start on a contender to so far one of the best players outright. He may come back to the mean, but Jesus so far."
"1) RJ Barrett  2) Julius Randle  3) Mitchell Robinson  4) Immanuel Quickley  5) Austin Rivers  6) Obi Toppin  7) Alec Burks/Kevin Knox (can’t decide)  Elfrid Payton is all yours, Seattle"
Honestly he just looks like a better Julius randle to me😂😂  Actually the way randle is playig rn I’m not even sure about that😂
"Lamar Odom was born 15 years too early. Maybe less scoring, but he could be doing what Julius Randle is right now imo"
"Oh yeah, is that why the season when AD sat out because he wanted to get traded Jrue holiday had 7.7 apg? His New Orleans career high with Julius Randle as his second option?  Bro, at this point you just gotta shut up and listen. How can you deny those lol? And he was 13th in **total** assists, not apg. By that metric Spencer Dinwiddie was better than Chris Paul in 2017-2018"
"If only the NBA didn’t have stupid ROY rules. Keldon played in 17 games last year and only had real PT in 13 of those games.   In baseball you have to reach 130 AB or 50 innings pitched the previous season to lose your rookie status, which for a starter (position or pitching) would be roughly 1/4 of the season.  In hockey, you can play in up to 25 games in prior seasons while maintaining rookie eligibility (there are sub-rules too but that’s the broadest baseline).  You’re telling me that Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons were rookies but Julius Randle, who played 14 minutes in one game before getting injured and missing his entire rookie season, isn’t?  TL;DR of my senior thesis: Keldon should still be a rookie this season."
"With what assets that don’t include rj, cus u ain’t getting any players like beal or Mitchell with Julius randle as ur trade centerpiece. Randle is the type of guy you unload for a pick or two to a contending team"
What do you mean? Didn’t New Orleans trade Julius Randle in hopes to bring Mirotic back? He just decided to go back to his home country
"Nah, being a Knicks fan is being told my media that every superstar wants to join you and you end with Julius Randle"
I don’t think Julius Randle is one of the best 10 players in the league currently  You would be disingenuous to suggest otherwise and you’re trying to divert from the discussion by “catching me out”  What other stats can I use for AD’s shooting other than the ones we currently have? He has been a great shooter since the bubble
Julius Randle just played like a top 10 player all of last season and a full postseason?
So Julius Randle is currently a top 10 player until proven otherwise?
Recent: Julius randle passing instead of trying another spin move.  Past : grizz over spurs 8 vs 1
KD was clearly the problem. Think the Knicks would be willing to trade us Julius Randle for him straight up?
"Julius randle is playing like an all star, they have a better record than the nets, raptors, and bucks, and they’ve done it with injuries to obi toppin, immanuel quickley, and Alec burks."
Julius Randle is just a straight up basketball player. I’ve always liked his game. He’s a perfect Thibs player.
Shout out to Orange Julius The Mandle Randle spinning his way into our hearts. He's been amazing so far. Even in his bad games
The Nets' Decision Not To Offer Julius Randle A Max Contract Isn't Aging Very Well
"He might put up numbers, but his skill set is unlikely to ever impact winning very much.  4 that can’t space the floor, protect the rim, or guard 1-3 is a tough tough look.   If he figures things out on offense he might get up to Julius randle status."
"Knicks have a decent team with ok young guys in RJ, Obi, Mitch, Knox, and IQ. They've been really fun to watch this year and Julius Randle is playing like an all star.  We have 2 1st round picks this year in a draft that's absolutely stacked. Those picks being our own and Dallas who Knicks fans are hoping underachieve this year so we can have 2 lottery picks. We also have Dallas's 1st in 2023 as well so we have a decent amount of assets.  We also have brand new coaching and a new front office  So if you want to hop on a team that's rising, Knicks are it"
Julius Randle 😤
"Right now, I'll probably take Julius Randle because he's playing out of this world under Thibs and he addresses the Raptors biggest need (interior presence). He also doesn't have injury concerns like Lauri's had so far in his career.  But in a vacuum, I probably take Lauri. Higher upside and a more modern skillset."

"The worst thing in the clip is that Trae has Austin Rivers COMPLETELY beaten, Rivers is behind him and Julius Randle is backpedaling into the basket, but he just baits the foul anyways because he knows he got the call.  The NBA is at the same point the NFL is, where in the words of Ray Lewis, ""I don't know what you want the defensive player to do"". Wtf do you want Austin Rivers to do there? If you watch the entire play, he never swipes at the basketball, never touches Trae's arms and LITERALLY has his hands up in the air, but still gets called for a foul, that's insane.  That's the result of completely removing the physical aspect of the game, you get GUARDS that mostly shoot three's averaging 10+ FTs per game and that sucks to watch.  Like Ray says for the NFL, defensive players are so limited by today's rules that the impact of defense and of a individual defensive player is absurdly diminished. If you cloned 1988 MJ into today's game he would either average 40+ because nobody would be able to touch him or he would foul out in 15 minutes on defense.  By the way, since 2010 the only teams that made the NBA Finals while being Top 2 in defense were the 2015 Warriors and the 2017 Warriors. For example, in the 1990s six Top 2 defenses made the NBA Finals (including both teams in the 1994 and 1996 NBA Finals) and in the 2000s it was EIGHT."
"You were the first team this season that didn't double Randle.   My take on the Hawks is that you guys lack playmaking in the front-court. It doesn't have to be Julius Randle levels of inside-out kickouts, but now every time the ball goes towards the paint it's just not getting out. You have so much shooting in theory but they barely get open effectively.   Trae and Cam drive a lot and have the potential to continuously kick it out to open corner threes but Trae is just looking for a foul instead on every possession and Cam just isn't there yet in terms of having a plan when he drives. IDK about the Collins + Capela thing.  Other than that I was most impressed with Hunter, he's very disruptive, but again he's not really a passer."
He’s paid like Giannis but is actually Julius Randle. Matter fact Randle is without a doubt better this season ya know actually has facets to his game besides spin move in paint

"Nah the nicknames Julius Randle got last year when he was bad were amazing. They called him Dubious Handles and Beyblade, Cyclone. A bunch of great shit comes when you are bad lol."
"how are Bagley, Siakam, and Julius Randle related?"
That's a 2021 Julius Randle stat line
Julius Randle is the truth. He’s also only 26  Lots of nba podcasts hate him and think the Knicks should go younger yet at the same time say Giannis is the future of the league. Giannis is the same age as Julius. Julius can be a part of something special
"Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Tobias Harris, Julius Randle  Also I think PG13 will take a small hit as well."
Julius Randle is just Lebron James without hops.
"Tobias Harris, Jaylen Brown, and Julius Randle are the top three imo"
RJ Barrett and Julius Randle going crazy right now. Scary Terry as well but i dont think they can sustain it
"Obviously Julius Randle, he's bound to regress to the mean and average something more like 28/13/9"

"I wouldn’t bet on it. Christian Wood is still probably the frontrunner, unless Jaylen Brown keeps his current scoring output consistent.   Another interesting Dark Horse to me is Julius Randle. I’m not convinced that his shooting splits or his passing are sustainable, but if they stay close to where they’re at now, Randle will be an all star and in that MIP race."
"I'm so happy that the Knicks are doing so well right now.  I think we're one of the more 'slept-on' teams for good reason as everyone thinks we're going to be pretty bad but with the way Thibs has been handling everyone, transforming the Knicks into a top defensive team, how he's gotten Julius Randle into doing more than just barreling into offenses and gotten Mitch to control his fouls, RJ slowly blossoming into the Star we all envision.   I'm pretty happy with where the Knicks are at right now.   I'm mostly intrigued at what Immanuel Quickley can be for us. He's picking up fouls and shooting 3s WELL, and when he is on the court, he looks like a great PG akin to a CJ McCollum.   Obi needs to see more on-court action but I like what I see so far and Knox has been steadily improving his shot and defense."
"&gt; Julius Randle  If you're talking about this Randle who is shooting 50% from deep and putting up 7 assists per game, then sure.  But if you're talking about the Randle from the last 6 years, then no, he's an incredibly overrated dinosaur who can't shoot or defend.  Either way - time will tell, so we need to see what he looks like when he gets past this hot streak."
Julius randle is literally the best player in the nba
Missing MVP frontrunner Julius Randle from this list
Everything Julius Randle wishes he could be
"well frankly, he’s a better player than Julius Randle and I’d love him on my team"
Julius randle honestly. Even if I wasn’t a knick fan what thibs is doing with him is amazing so far
"The scoring of devin booker, the rebounding of Anthony Davis and the passing of doncic   Ladies and gentleman, Julius Randle"
Smh Julius Randle would never
*KD + cash considerations has been traded for Julius Randle*
Kyrie and KD ain't got shit on Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle
Well at least the nets have stars. The Knicks have who? Julius randle? Lmfao
Julius Randle-esque
What you're seeing is Julius Randle is Yugoslavian
Yeah. He reminds me a worse Julius Randle.
"Yeah but r/Lakers also called D'Lo a combination of Jason Kidd, Steph Curry, and James Harden and said Julius Randle would be a top 10 player in the league so it evens out"
He’s skinny Julius randle. I’ve said it for a long time. 2 human beyblades
Julius Randle
Siakam and Julius randle would both make good beyblades.   They love to spin
You have a funny way of spelling Julius Randle
Knicks going to max Julius Randle
What I'm hearing from this is Julius Randle should be all-nba
Julius “Beyblade” Randle needs a new nickname now that he changed his game this season
"The Lakers problem was in not recognizing that Deng could only play the 4 when they signed him, because they gave him that huge contract to play small forward instead. Back then the Lakers had Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr at the 4, but only had just-drafted Brandon Ingram at the 3, so they signed Deng to be the starter there.   But Deng was not a good enough shooter, nor was he quick enough defensively on the perimeter to play SF anymore, so the Lakers ended up just wasting all that money. If Deng wasn't on such a gigantic contract they easily could have traded him to a team looking for a small ball 4, but nobody wanted him at $18 million per year, and the Lakers didn't want to just bench one of their promising young PFs, so Deng ended up getting squeezed.   So it wasn't that Deng couldn't play, it's just that the Lakers wildly overpaid him when they had no minutes available at the position he played."
"Thad is really underrated. He was Bulls' main playmaker last season and similar to Julius Randle, Thad made a jump as a player."

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

Julius Randle easily.
‘Julius Randle only improved this season because there were less fans in the arena’ is one of the most brain-dead takes you can have as an nba fan
the one where knicks face hawks bucks and nets with healthy players and win in seven in each series.    fmvp julius randle wins the ring for the knicks after a game seven ends in a clutch full court buzzer beater while the entire suns team is guarding him after the knicks were trailing by fifty entering the 4th quarter
"I'm not sure players looked at Julius Randle in that series and thought, I really want to play with that guy."
Can't speak for anyone but I took my downvotes not believing in the Knicks.     It's a team that relied on the human beyblade himself and  2021 D Rose for basically all of their offense. I had Hawks in 7 personally because I didn't see Julius Randle breaking down the way he did.
"Houston:  De'Aaron Fox  Stephen Jackson  Jimmy Butler  Emeka Okafor  De'Andre Jordan  We also have Justice Winslow, Kelly Oubre, Justin Jackson (Who all played for the Houston Hoops with Fox), TJ Ford, Gerald Green, Carsen Edwards, Quintin Grimes, Joe/Jacob/Michael Young, Jonthan Simmons   Dallas: *where l was born  Marcus Smart  Grant Hill  Julius Randle  Chris Bosh  LaMarcus Aldrige   Also CJ Miles, Isaiah Austin, and some young guys like Cade Cunningham, and RJ Hampton"
Using DFW area at large:  * PG: Cade Cunningham * SG: Grant Hill * SF: Julius Randle * PF: LaMarcus Aldridge * C: Chris Bosh  Very tall lineup.
"I was actually super hyped on him at the time/saw offensive potential in addition to his obvious defensive chops.   But I can't really tout my prospect evaluation too highly - I thought AD was super overrated after watching him in high school, and I was sure Julius Randle was the next superstar. Obviously he just had a great year but that took a minuteeeee."
Is Julius Randle in foul trouble? I haven't seen him since I tuned in.
"We traded Porzingis and got 2 first round picks, the cap space to sign Julius randle, and the cap space to sign Marcus Morris who we flipped for the pick that became Immanent Quickly, and we paired a 2nd round with DSJ that became D Rose. So instead of paying KP a max, we have randle, IQ, rose, and two more firsts (we punted one of our picks this year)    People dislike us so they call it the THJ trade, as if anyone would trade 50M in cap space and 2 firsts for THJ"
"I mean unless Cam has a Julius Randle type leap, I just don't see that happening."
Julius Randle and Tobias both have higher defensive grades as well
A team won't win a title with Julius Randle (or Kemba) as the best player on the team no
"It's because he's on the Lakers, it's literally that simple. When Lonzo was on the Lakers, twitter would blow up after a bad game. There'd be 30k trending tweets an hour after a game. Same thing with Brandon Ingram, same thing with Danny Green, Julius Randle, same shit with Quinn Cook, Josh Hart too. literally any time a Laker did something bad they would get blown up on social media. Guys on other teams don't have 30k tweets about them every night if they put up a stinker unless they're a superstar. If you're an average roleplayer on the lakers you get as much attention as a star on a small market team."
"Yes, Luka had a healthier season, however that doesn’t make him a healthier player.  Julius Randle had a better season than AD. Is he better than AD?"
Julius Randle had a fast break. First game of his rookie year.
I just need people to keep this energy with Julius Randle
"He said New York AND Philly no?  I’d imagine for Dame, a Joel pairing with a defensive counterparts in Matisse/DG would be more enticing than a Julius pairing (no knocks on Randle here)."
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.  Starters:  Bradley Beal  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Others:  Jaylen Brown  James Harden  Julius Randle  Mike Conley Jr.  Brandon Ingram  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Zion Williamson
"You are correct.  &gt;Randle also became the second player in NBA history to average 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists per game while also shooting 40% from deep, joining Bird, who did it in 1984-85.  [Source.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Sports/york-knicks-julius-randle-wins-nbas-improved-player/story%3fid=77904474)"
Oh no it's not like we are planning to get rid of 90% of our roster anyway. Lmao Knicks make 1 playoff and get gassed. Enjoy your franchise player julius randle
"Meanwhile Julius Randle took less money so the Knicks would have more flexibility in the future to add talent...  I used to be a huge Kawhi fan, it's getting harder to remain one."
Really feels like it was a Jim Buss era issue. We don't have any young guys except THT to develop right now but we'll see. But past administrations weren't that bad with developing talent. We saw dudes like Sasha Vujacic become serviceable starters for us. Between Andrew Bynum and Julius Randle picks we didn't have a pick higher then 1st round 19.   Spurs definitely have a better scouting system than the Lakers do right now.
"It's just another dude who box score watches instead of actually watching. Anyone who has seen Luka play knows most players would shoot less than 30% if they took the same exact shots. But there are people like this guy who will go ""NUH UH JULIUS RANDLE IS A WAY BETTER SHOOTER HE SHOT 40 PERCENT AND GOLDEN LUKA ONLY 35 PERCENT"", without realizing Randle couldn't even cleanly attempt shots that Luka makes consistently."
I ain’t never seen Larry Bird and Julius Randle in the same room 👀
"Alright, arguing in hypotheticals isn’t going to get us anywhere. Let’s use objective metrics. Julius Randle was an all star, all nba 2nd team, and received MVP votes. Jrue did none of those things. Think that settles it  Jrue had a better playoffs unquestionably. It’s a lot easier being the third option than the first though. People forget that"
"Given its arguable who is even better in the first place, saying considerably is just funny. Did people really forget Randle just carried a team from the worst projected record in the league to the 4 seed and finished all nba 2nd team? I truly believe if you switch Jrue holiday and Julius Randle for the Knicks we don’t come close to where we did. You put Julius Randle as third option on the bucks and I wouldn’t be shocked at all to still see them win"
This probably drives me more insane than anything. Someone earlier told me that Jrue Holiday is *considerably* better than Julius Randle
Julius Randle has a tight handle lowkey
"haha yeah and don't forget Julius ""All-star Lock"" Randle"
"Weirdly, I think that Monk is the first really young guy coming off a rookie deal I can remember who chose to take a min to ring chase. He easily would have gotten a better deal somewhere else. And Nunn is 6 months younger than Julius Randle I think. The whole thing is crazy to me hah. If I was their age, I'd just take the most money I could get on a team where I had a role. I suppose you can ring chase and live in LA though and still be a millionaire. We'll see if it pays off for them financially later on."
So did Jimmy Butler and Julius Randle. Who both just got fat extensions lol
Iunno why everybody keeps fixating on Julius Randle when the original post talks about 5 other players.  Burks Rose Kemba Taj Noel. To name them for you.
Julius Randle performed better with Hunter healthy for the hawks than Ben Simmons who have an MVP level teammate and fringe allstar with him.
Bam isn't even a good rim protector though. Last season he ranked between Lauri Markannen and Julius Randle at FG% allowed at the rim
"On the other hand,  you can't quite only assume the only explanation for that is because those guys were playing with Lebron.   I mean...Lonzo and Ingram certainly stepped it up after they left, but they were both still extremely young at the time. They were expected to continue to get better. You could just as easily argue a year of experience with such a great player was a part of that. And...I dunno...I mean...Kuzma...he may just be not that great of a player.   D'Lo and Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle also all had their best years after their stints with the Lakers, and they never even played with Lebron.   I'll give you that there really has never been a young star emerge while they were on a team with Lebron, but for the most part you aren't ever really expect teams with Lebron (in regards to draft position) to be acquiring fantastic young talent through the draft."
Julius Randle was 8th in MVP voting this year. Might as well hang the banner in the Garden
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
Julius Randle
"Julius Randle will be sent to Philly in a 3-team deal sending Ben Simmons to Minnesota. The Knicks will receive Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, and Ricky Rubio."
Honestly wish the NBA would implement a minimum playtime limit for losing rookie status like hockey and baseball have. You really mean to tell me that Ben Simmons and Blake Griffin are all that different from Julius Randle because Randle played 18 minutes of basketball in the first game of the season?
And he’s headed to the Knicks to play with superstar Julius “Beyblade” Randle and MVP Derrick Rose. League is le fucked.

"The team got exposed in the playoffs, not just Julius. We were missing shot creators and playmakers desperately. We addressed both of those weaknesses this off-season. You can’t just pick a 5 game stretch and say someone is not a good player because of it. Randle is in his prime, has a crazy work ethic and is improving. He’ll have a better team around him this year too."
"damn, seems like john collins is significantly more effective in his role than julius “regular season” randle is in his"
"Depends on the odds. I'd bet $14 for $3 profit if I had a 90% chance of winning. The odds (probability) are the hard thing to figure out, they're definitely not 90% for Julius Randle. They probably are for Luka Doncic as a random example."
Who would give Julius Randle 35-40 million? I think 28 per year is a fair deal
"Reading these comments and the number of people claiming julius needs to prove it in the playoffs highlights how casual some fans here are. Yes randle played horribly in the post-season, no doubt. But the difference between a regular season game and a real playoff series cannot be understated. Teams defensive efforts and schemes get dialed up to 11, and our lack of shot creation outside of julius was exposed. Randle needs to improve, and he likely will, but he showed more than enough to earn this contract. One bad playoff series doesn't negate an entire seasons worth of success."
Knick Fans 🤝 Laker Fans  Julius Randle
"To be fair Collins has a high ceiling, he can even be the next Julius Randle one day."
Sorry Julius Randle
Julius Randle
julius randle
Why would he play with Julius randle over embiid?
your people tell me Julius randle is better than jaylen brown all the time so i wanted to see how jaylen brown matches up against julius randle in the eyes of the public. No need to get upset. I remained neutral in the post for a reason  and I dont really come to reddit for karma like you. Id rather see 40 comments and 0 karma than 40 karma and 0 comments. I prefer discussion over karma whoring
Julius Randle literally was one of the 15 best players in the league this season and somehow a bad 5 game stretch in the playoffs is enough to invalidate that despite jaylen literally never putting on a carryjob like randle did for the ten games jayson tatum missed let alone the full 72 randle carried the knicks through
And then Julius was a disaster in the playoffs. Brown has had multiple big series and is a much better defender. Very hard to see how you pick Randle over him.
"Julius randle averaged 24/10/6 last season and led his team. We’ve never seen Brown be the #1 option on his team.. but I think they are are both very good, depending on the surrounding roster would decide which guy to ultimately pick."
We just saw Julius randle play terrible in the playoffs. It’s brown easily right now.
"It's a big year for Julius Randle. He's a FA next season and has a potential $200m contract on the way. If he plays like he did in 2019-2020, who knows what he gets."
"if knicks are in the playoff race by the time rosters come out, expect julius randle or even rj if he breaks out to have a good chance."
Jimmy butler prob replaces brown and julius randle should replace siakam
Julius Randle instead of Siakam
Julius Randle this playoffs.
"Reggie Jackson is a good player, and you have to overpay to get people here…our best FA signings ever have been Peja and Julius Randle"
for now  julius randle and evan fournier can only get you so far  have fun being the pacers for the next 20 years while we dominate in a few years with our two superstars
"Lmao he had a good season but if you said Julius Randle was the best player on a playoff team 2 years ago, you'd be rofling for like 20 mins."
c- Mitch Robison.     f-  Julius Randle.    g/f-  RJ Barrett.     g/f- Fournier.     PG-  Kemba.       Derek Rose prefers to come off bench but iften is finishing the 4th quarter for us. He's the ultimate team player.. Zero ego.
"He’s in New York. Julius Randle had MSG sold out, imagine 82 games with Kemba. His Jersey sales and sponsorships would spike in NY."
"Dude, Julius Randle became King of the City by taking them to the four seed.  If Zion comes to NYC as a the centerpiece of a legit contender, NY's going to explode.   People just don't realize because they've sucked for the last 20 years, but the Knicks are still the Knicks."
"Trust me they would. That's why superstars get to demand trades in the first place. Not treating a superstar right really hurts your chances with other stars. It would also piss off Paul George who wants to be paired with Kawaii in the first place.  Also most of the star players who will be in free agency will be Brooklyn's core. Assuming they don't want to break up their super team you're not getting any of them... So you're left with Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle, John Wall.... I think Leonard is better when healthy than those players.  Also signing a new super star means you have to make the cap room. You can't just use your bird rights. Makes you lose a lot of talent, sometimes assets to move contracts."
"Randle had consistently been doubled and trapped. There wasn’t a good enough shot creator outside of Rose. RJ Barrett should have taken that as a massive insult but instead took the “look, Julius has the ball!” then run and hide approach"
He can compete with Julius Randle over who can shoot over 20 percent in the playoffs
Right him turning into bigger Julius Randle was a lot of the reason we were able to mount those insane comebacks that we did in games 4 and 5
They also have Julius Randle as their best player
"I watched every game Franz played at Michigan and he is definitely not a 4 in his current state. He’s not strong enough to handle players like Julius randle or John Collins. His strengths are that he’s long, moves well, and has smart iq on defense."
"Y’all forget because this sub has the memory of a goldfish, but the first like 30 games last season the consensus was that Ja was better and Zions ceiling was pre 2021 Julius Randle.   Then he avgs like 30 for 2 months and all of a sudden the pels are worst managed team of all time for not pairing him with another superstar 50 games into his career.   Honestly I’m happy everyone here thinks we suck because popular opinion on this sub is so rarely even close to right"
"Julius Randle left and… went 20 for 100, got swept"
Deandre Hunter and Julius Randle
Julius Randle
Julius randle shot 40% from 3. Wow.
They don’t play the same position… you realize that right? Taj and Obi do not eat into each other’s time whatsoever. Taj is our third big who played backup a lot of the year to Nerlens because Mitchell Robinson was out. Obi backed up the guy who led the NBA in minutes. I don’t think anyone predicted Julius Randle having the season that he did.
He got a little better but mostly his role changed. Still a frustrating player to watch IMO. my overall point is that everyone writes off players sometimes (people shit on the julius randle contract the knicks gave out too) but fit and role can really change things for a player rather quickly. You had people on here calling the Knicks/Mavs trade the Tim Hardaway Jr trade this season haha.
He’s that good. He’d be an all star if a team committed to him like Julius randle and the knicks. 20/10 on 50/40/85 for us last year. On a terrible team.
This USA teams missing one Julius Randle
imagine Julius Randle... BUT WITH HOPS!!!!
Weren’t you Knicks fans saying Julius randle is better than Bosh? Talk about overrating your players…
Julius Randle
Dillon Brooks Julius Randle Zach LaVine Marcus Smart Christian Wood
"Hunter is legitimately close to being that. He's shown it whenever he played this season including being the reason why Julius Randle was having nightmares against the Hawks. The rub with him is the health concerns that he's had all year.   Realistically, it's one more player who can create their own shot and run the offense. They think that's Bogi, but the drop off between Trae and Bogi is vast.  In the instance that all the picks the hawks took grade out as role players or above average starters, Trae is enough of a dynamic offensive threat to make that engine run, and the defense is solid enough that they'll be in pole position to make deep playoff runs every year, like Utah, Portland or Denver. All they'll need is one break like what Toronto got to win the chip, and I feel like in this league, unless you have 2 of harden, Durant, Bron, or Giannis walking through that door, winning a chip isn't guaranteed."
Pssh they have all-nba superstar Julius Randle
Did Julius Randle bully you in 4th grade?
Julius Randle came to play today 😤😤  1/7 FGs 🔥🔥🔥  0 assists 🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯  0 steals and blocks 💥💥  1 lucky buzzer beater 😈😈  Carried by refs and still only up 2 😹😹  &amp;#x200B;  MVP candidate? Top 10 player? Worth a max contract? 🤣🤡
Julius randle got a bucket in the first half?! It’s over D:
The death of Julius Randle has been slightly exaggerated
“I'm starting to worry that Randle only played well in empty stadiums... similar to bubble TJ Warren. Empty stadium Julius Randle“  🥱🥱🥱
lights too bright for julius randle. hope he gets it together
what is wrong with Julius Randle??
You can’t win with Julius Randle
DERRICK ROSE IS BETTER THAN JULIUS RANDLE
key for atlanta: do anything we can to let julius randle have the ball. my god is he fucking shit
Julius Randle is so garbage it’s unreal
Julius Randle playing his way straight out of a max contract
Julius Randle already got 2 points on 0/3 shooting. He might break double digits tonight 🔥🔥🔥  Top 10 player? MVP snub? I think not ❗️
I thought Julius Randle was on the Lakers?
Julius Randle legacy on the line tonight
"The real answer is Julius Randle, got MVP talks just cause he plays in New York"
I’m excited for the “Julius randle culling” game. He’s going to go for 42 and his son is going to reveal his body was a skin suit hiding the dark lord
"Simmons wasn’t invisible lol you’re just talking out your ass. Must be that terrible reason depression causing your memory loss, everyone on that Sixers team cared people just have different ways of expressing emotion. Have fun with that bootleg Julius Randle and midget leading your team for the next 5 years."

Too bad Julius Randle has decided to flame out into this years version of 2020 Siakam.
Julius Randle unranked damn
#DAILY REMINDER THAT CHRIS HAYNES IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT DIDNT HAVE JULIUS RANDLE ON ANY POSITION ON HIS BALLOT FOR MOST IMPROVED
"Johnnie Bryant from the New York Knicks  It might be a coincidence that Randle put up an all nba year and RJ jumped in year 2 but it may also have something to do with Bryant; his history speaks for itself. The following players have had their best professional seasons when Johnnie Bryant was on the coaching staff. Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Rudy Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, Donovan Mitchell(before this year), Julius Randle, RJ Barrett. At some point I think the league takes notice and someone lets him run an entire team."
"Main things is a night and day difference in the MIP recipient Julius Randle. His play has ignited others to play well too. Can't discount the acquisition of the savy vet D.Rose. When he's on the floor you can see how well the offense moves and he sets up others really well. I knew Coach Thibs would need a least a year with the new team to build up their defense and play in his system. D.Rose already played under him so adding him along with Taj Gibson was easy. Also, the rook Quickley played out of his mind earlier in the season. If they add a few key pieces in the offseason, they'll for sure be in the playoff mix next year."
Clank.  Feel like I'm watching playoff Julius Randle.
"They'd also have Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Robinson, and Quickley from their young core. He wouldn't just be going there to play with Lowry or CP3.  The problem is there are no moves to be made. They traded all their picks and swapped the rest. You can trade Paul George, but can you trade Paul George for a better star? Probably not. A situation where they trade Paul George, it makes more sense to be blowing up the team for draft picks and young players at that point."
Yeah bro we were screaming for Julius Randle and DRose to join us as FAs lol got us
"Lmao, man go cry about it, I don't give a fuck if the Knicks pulled a bunch of guys out of Rucker park and put them on the court as long as they're winning games AS KNICKS.  This sucking off individual stars is absurd, I'm a Knicks fan, not a Julius Randle fan.    And I'm sorry for the last almost 40 years, the 6ers and the Knicks both ended up on the golf course, congrats you tanked for picks and whiffed on most of them and got a couple great players, you still have no rings to show for it."
"Not sure where you've been but I guarantee you more people know who Trae Young is than who know Julius Randle is. I get it you're proud that you root for a team that is in a big market. Strange thing to be proud about, how about being proud about your team actually being any fucking good"
I wonder if Kyrie and KD see this and feel jealous of Julius Randle lmao
"&gt;Here’s the thing, you’ve just listed a bunch of averages at me and no one actually shoots their average consistently, it’s like how Lebrons career average is 27/7/7 but he never records that. Shit fluctuates.  No shit. I'm not saying they hit their season averages exactly every game, but they have 5 players on their roster who hit 40% from 3 on the season. That means they're good 3 point shooters (all ranked in the top 70 of NBA players on the season), but they went 4/26. Julius Randle averaged 24 ppg this season. He had an uncharacteristically bad game 1, so it was easy to see a bounce back in game 2. That doesn't mean he's going to score exactly 24 points, but game 1 he was unlucky. He was missing shots he'd made all year.  &gt;Most of your players hit above their average last game.  I'm not a Hawks fan.  &gt;if you expect consistent from a young inexperienced team idk what to tell you.  The players I'm talking about are Gallinari, who is 32 and in his 12th NBA season. Bogdanovic, who is 28 and in his 4th NBA season. Tony Snell, who is 29 and in his 8th NBA season. Lou Williams, who is 34 and in his 16th NBA season. And John Collins, who is 23 and in his 4th NBA season."
"Am I an idiot for wanting Randle over Kyrie? No disrespect to Kyrie, but Julius is freaking monster"

Makes me want to go to the next game and chant “Fuck Julius Randle” or  “overrated”. But I don’t feel that way and would feel kinda bad.
"Was at MSG tonight and it was electric. The fact that Drose, Julius Randle and Obi Toppin got more love than KD/Harden/Kyrie shows how much the Nets don’t matter to NYC."
You're a fucking moron and Julius redeemed himself completely in the second half of game 2. Watch the games and shut up about Randle
Game Sunday was a 2 point game and Julius Randle shot 6-23 and Reggie Bullock didn’t hit a 3
If Julius Randle keeps missing every single shot the Hawks could be in business.
"Defense wasn’t there in the first half plus the Hawks were hitting all of their fucking shots. Julius Randle feeds on defense, which picked up in the second half. At least that’s my running theory."
Just mean people all around. Yeah I want my team to win but I won’t be yelling at Julius Randle on Friday.
"Imagine if 18 months ago I told you that Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Alec Burks would lead the Knicks to a playoff win. With help from a wing playing from Dayton and Nerlens Noel."
"You can't get further with Julius Randle as your best player lmao, they need to get Kawhi."
Julius randle sucks
"Hawks blew it, thing is, these shots not going in will go in at home. It's gonna be an interesting series.  Nevertheless, Julius Randle is a regular season player"
The death of Julius Randle has been mildly exaggerated
Julius Randle wife is thick
Julius Randle just hit super saiyan 1
Westside Gunn gonna have a single come out with Julius Randle on the cover with the third eye 🤣🤣🤣
Julius Randle most improved player from 1st to 2nd half.
He's pulling a Julius Randle tonight
I'm sure we are all shocked Julius Randle isn't playing like a superstar
"Omfg Julius Randle, what a way to respond the MVP chants"
Julius Randle has returned to beyblade
rip julius randle all star - 2021-2021  also this video is movie quality
literally can’t imagine the pressure on julius randle as i criticize him while my lazy ass is in my girlfriend’s grandparents’ basement high off my ass
Julius Randle is who we thought he was
Julius Randle is fucking dogshit bro
Julius Randle needs benched to be honest he isn't doing anything
Working theory here... Julius Randle can’t play in front of a crowd.
Julius Randle what the hell man
julius randle what is u doin bb
Maybe Julius Randle can't play with the crowd.
Julius Randle isn't a garbage efficiency player lol. Dude shot 41% from 3 on 5.5 attempts a game
"Julius ""can't win without him"" Randle"
Julius Randle king of NY huh
Did Julius Caesar Randle name his left hand Brutus?
"Amber Alert just went out for Julius Randle, New York.  Last seen at Madison Square Garden."
"Knicks fans in attendance are too pussy to start a ""fuck Julius Randle"" chant"
Is it possible that Julius Randle isn't actually Dirk Nowitzki and those shots were unsustainable?
Julius Randle in the 1st half:  2 points 🔥  7 rebounds ⚔️  1 assist 👏  0/6 FG 💰  0/2 3P 🎯  -17 😱  All-NBA 3rd 🔥
Future max player Julius Randle looks bad and they're gonna commit a lot of money to him sooner or later. If this continues for the whole series...
MIP Julius Randle with 2 points on 0/6 from the field lololololol 😂😂😂
NGL I haven’t watched much Knicks basketball this year but for as hyped up as the core players got Julius Randle and RJ Barrett look like 2 of the worst players on the court.
I don’t even think Julius Randle hit super saiyan this playoffs.
Imagine thinking that your franchise savior is Julius Randle
Julius randle pooping his pants on national television
Sooo.. Julius Randle? 2 pts at the half?
Julius Randle is trash rn
I need a benny hill compilation of Julius Randle these first 2 games.
"My God, Trae is cooking these bums right now. I didn't care much for him before but dude has converted me into a big fan throughout these 1.5 games  Also Julius Randle is a trashy-ass fraud lol."
Julius Randle is reverting to his 2019-2020 form.
Did someone drug Julius randle sheesh
Julius Randle was a feel good story but he is going to start catching some heat if he keeps playing like this
Big x factor so far this series is the fact that Trae Young looks like a superstar and Julius Randle looks lost. Randle gotta show up at some point for the Knicks to have a chance.
Julius Randle no-crowd fraud?
Julius Randle is basically Michael Beasley with a 3 point shot.
What happened to Julius randle man
Julius Randle looks clueless out there
julius randle has 2 points with 3min to go in the 2nd and the hawks are only up by 7??
"Julius Randle is a liability, please sit him Tom"
Julius *clankin* Randle.
Julius Randle might be the biggest underperformer in the playoffs right now
"Julius ""Demar Derozan"" Randle"
Obi Toppin outplaying Julius Randle is both really awful and kinda cool   Mostly the former though
Imagine Julius Randle as a MIP player. It should be so funny if it was real😂😂
Julius Randle is a fraud
Julius Randle looks like he doesn't want to be out there.  Knicks are in trouble.
"Please somebody explain to me, why Julius Randle is still on the court?! He can't play, and he have no energy whatsoever in his body language. He's letting his team down!"
Gallinari vs. the Knicks? Tajj Gibson vs. Derrick Rose? Julius Randle playing like Josh Smith against the Hawks? You got yourselves a series folks.
Julius Randle at #80 seems off
"Throw in Demar Derozan, Rudy Gobert, and Julius Randle if you want 30 names.  I don't know if you can pick 10 names from that list that you would rather have Simmons over."
"In general, stronger players do just not generally have play styles where they are shooting a lot of 3's...but that said, that guy named Lebron has become a solid 3 point shooter.  But if you want other names of guys who are pretty muscular/strong and who have proven to be good shooters: Marcus Morris, Desmond Bane, Julius Randle, Lillard (is actually pretty jacked), Ben Gordon, Meyers Leonard, Arron Afflalo"
"Lmao in order Julius Randle, DeMarcus Cousins, Matthew Dellavadova"
"Julius Randle average starter? Fucking nerds, I'll beat your ass"
Yes but Julius randle was at least good before he became a star. Bagley hasn’t really shown anything.
Anything is possible after Julius Randle explosion last season.

"it's not really newsworthy, but i think fans of the player just like to know what they're up to in the off-season, so ehy wouldn't they all post these things.  did julius randle post a bunch of training videos in the really long off-season the knicks had?  that could actually be interesting because he genuinely became an all-star through that period."
"&gt;The cool thing is my relationship with Trae goes beyond basketball,” Collins said. “I talked to him a couple of hours after his son was born. Cool little name, ‘Julius Randle.’   &gt;   &gt;“See, r/nba didn’t know that. That’s how close we are.”"
"Kobe was definitely a prick as well until the end lol. He shit talked Julius Randle during his last game. ""If I was in my prime it would be like this every game"" or something like that."
Rapid Spin  Whirlpool  Sand Tomb  Julius Randle  Personal hot take: Fire Spin
Literally just the Hawks/Knicks first round series:  * Elfrid Payton * Julius Randle * Solomon Hill * Tony Snell * RJ Barrett  Even in the Lakers series how you coming away thinking you'd rather have Frank Kaminsky on your team.
Yeah what a horrible mistake we made signing Julius Randle on a cheap contract and getting a free first round pick for a few weeks of Marcus Morris - which then turned into Immanuel Quickley.  Not sure how our franchise will ever recover from such terrible signings.
"Literally just in the games the Hawks played there were worse. In terms of players who were worse than expected, Julius Randle took 19 shots a game on &lt;30% from the field over the series. In terms of players who were supposed to have starting roles but were extremely bad, there was Elfrid Payton. If you're just talking about overall not-goodness, then there's the fleet of garbage time players or even just Solomon Hill. How do you actually watch games and think Andre Drummond was the worst player in the playoffs?"
It's funny seeing nephews try telling Julius Randle what he already knows. As if a man who has played in the NBA for 7 seasons doesn't already realize how teams operate.
"I feel like the biggest hurdle with the Knicks is the same with Julius Randle as it was before Julius Randle. It's great to have that trust in Leon, Wes, Scott &amp; Thibb... but the problem is still James Dolan.  Get every dollar you can."
"Crazy to think that AD, Zion, Jrue &amp; Julius Randle (kinda) were all technically teammates at one point.  They also had Mirotic &amp; CWood on the roster right before that too."
"[this](https://www.thestrick.land/strick/inside-math-of-julius-randle-future-max-contract-new-york-knicks) goes into some of the alternatives he had. One could argue he took security, which obviously factors in no matter what, but he left a fortune on the table by not inking this in 2022."
Hot Take: Julius Randle finishes top 5 in MVP voting next year
do you know that your team is gonna be in the play in next year? You had a fluke season but you're going nowhere if this is your core. Nobody is scared of Julius Randle improving.
"Julius randle, Luca, &amp; LeBron"
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
Lamar Odom Julius Randle Zach Randolph
Julius Randle or Domantas Sabonis
"Ben Simmons, Julius Randle, LeBron James"
Mf you’ll free up ~28m in salary. You could get Julius Randle lmao
"You guys will hate this but:  David Lee, Julius randle, Lebron james"
"Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed your first round series vs the Knicks, but in all seriousness they were not a playoff team. Julius Randle showed against you why he's not a max player. You talk about your depth and I say that Trae&gt;&gt;&gt;Randle so we both agree that the 1st round matchup was alot easier for the Hawks than playing vs the Heat, right? Remember, the Heat could've been either the 4 or 5 seed which like I said in my previous post would have led to ""unfortunate"" seeding as I didnt think y'all would've beat us.  Don't think I have to say a lot about the 2nd round series when Embiid played with a meniscus tear and Ben Simmons wanted to spend more time playing COD instead of actually trying to get to the ECF"
"&gt; the same people said the same things about Embiid in the 2014 draft. He had massive injury concerns, required surgery immediately, and many saw him as a big risk as a big man who’s body couldn’t hold up in the NBA  TBH I see Embiid still as an injury concern on a team nowadays (just like in 2014 draft) but even knowing that, I would have picked him #1.  The important missing context here, is that neither Wiggins, Jabari, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle or LaVine in that draft were on the same level of KD to even have that kind of conversation. Wiggins was viewed at the time for the potential to be a good 2-way player, but I don't remember people talking about him as a super all-star like KD"
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
Julius Randle immulates Kobe's work ethic. He actually saw it first hand too
"Julius randle, dubious handle. Not bad lol"
"""Devin Booker is an empty stats player""   ""Julius Randle should be traded for a second round pick""  ""LeBron is washed"" (every year)"
The only thing that could derail Chicago out of the playoffs now is injuries. That lineup has too much talent to miss the playoffs. The Knicks made the playoffs last year with Julius Randle as their best player.
Julius Randle shares my birthday 🤮
If we aren’t including centers it has to be Dubious Handles aka Julius Randle.
julius randle is rated higher than kevin durant
"They also have the best player between the two teams right now in Julius Randle, who is a major reason for their success last season, but not a part of their “young core” based on the criteria for this article"
"After his first playoff performance, Julius Randle. I hope he and the Knicks can figure it out, it was inspiring for him to get some recognition as an MVP candidate this season."
One good season from Julius Randle and y'all think you have the nba on lock huh?
"I think they have a shot if Lebron, AD, KD, harden, Kyrie, Steph, dame, luka, Giannis, Trae young, Middleton, jimmy butler, jokic, Rudy gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum, Julius randle, Devin booker, Chris Paul, Paul George, embiid and ja Morant suffer season ending injuries"
"one/two season of all-nba selection isn't reflective of how they were viewed in the media/fans/amongst their peers  julius randle was balling this year, that doesn't mean his peers see him as THAT DUDE to the point where they'll link up with him and form a superteam because 1. he's not on that level yet  2. they literally wouldn't be a superteam"
"julius randle was an all-nba player this season, him being 1/3 of a ""big 3"" makes a team a superteam?"
I give a lot of the efficiency issues to him being the primary focus of the offense and being new to the role.  It’s the same thing that just happened to Julius Randle this year and Pascal Siakam last year. They still need help from others instead of being relied upon heavy like they were.  As for athleticism you don’t exactly need a ton of it to thrive in the NBA.
"Worthy was solid at a lot of the same things as Karl Malone, he just was more of a runner than a bulky guy. I think now he'd be able to work on offense doing the same type of things inside the 3 as TJ Warren, Kris Middleton or Kawhi. On defense he fits perfectly with what most teams want. I guess he probably compares best with Julius Randle or Siakam, but who knows if he could have added the 3, he would be even more dangerous that way."
Tyreke Evans  Eric Gordan  Ryan Anderson   Demarcus Couains  Julius Randle  All players that AD played when he missed the playoffs. Just more proof he can never be an alpha on a team. Shitty way he forced himself out of Nola.
Patrick Beverley is exactly what the Knicks need. A 3nD PG who would let someone like Julius Randle hold the ball most of the time.   When Kemba Walker’s knees crumble into dust 9 minutes into the season you should take a moment to think about it.
Taking the Clippers to 7 with the team that Luka was carrying is is on similar levels to what the Hawks did.  Also Mickey Mouse playoff run  Beat future Shanghai Shark Julius Randle  Beat a young socialite   Got shit on by Brook Lopez
Julius Randle shot fell back to his mean
Julius Randle. There’s honestly like 3 players on that team who have regressed. Other east teams would love to draw them in the 1st round
"Julius randle. Those midrange shots he was making last season have turned into bricks, and his three ball hasn’t been there either. Hoping he turns it around cause it was pretty cool to see knicks fans go from hating him when he just came to calling him the king of New York"

Julius Randle is bad. I'm gonna maintain that ya'll missed the boat by not trading him when his value was at it's highest. Swear every game I watch he thinks he's James Harden.
"Well if it makes you feel better, those young guys that the Lakers traded away wouldn’t be the same player they are now if they were still here. Not enough touches and attention to go around for all of them. Also BI and Julius Randle are the only stars of that group and they would barely make the playoffs so"
"5 team trade:  NYK Gets: Lebron  NOP Gets: AD, Westbrook  MIN Gets: THT, 1st round pick in 2028  CHI Gets: Carmelo, Malik Monk, and 1st round pick in 2030  LAL Gets: **Julius Randle, DAngelo Rusell, Brandon Ingram, Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball**"
If you search up Overrated and Fraud in the dictionary you will see a picture of Julius Randle
"For sure man, so teams aren’t allowed to trade picks in consecutive years outright anymore. They’re allowed to do pick swaps but they can’t move their own picks in 2023 or 2025 since they already moved their 2022/2024 firsts.   So even though they have very few tradeable assets they still do have some for the future. And then like you said, they’re in LA and they’re a storied franchise so players will always want to play there, regardless of the teams recent success.  Not sure if you followed them closely before they had Lebron but they were going through some really rough years that led them to having Ingram, Dlo, Julius randle (before he was very good), Lonzo, Hart/clarkson (also before) and weren’t able to rebuild well with them. They also had a ton of mismanagement with Magic Johnson but even though their rebuild went poorly it didn’t matter since Lebron wanted to be in LA. So overall, it’s not nearly as drastic as it sounded in my original comment so sorry about that!"
Julius Randle
"Herb is the man. Never seen a rookie get the defensive assignments he does. He's guarding Trae Young, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle.  In the hilarious stat category: The 3-14 Pelicans are +37 in Herb's 349 minutes. No other player on the team has a positive plus minus"
Julius Randle been ass
"Randle had one good season and Knicks went crazy anointing this guy as their next savior. Chances are that last year was an outlier and this is the ""real"" Julius Randle"
Julius Randle. Nobody is talking about it
Julius Randle/Kemba Walker?
That Julius randle is overpaid and we need to trade him even though we signed him to a pretty team friendly deal last season. They come out in force every loss and bitch about the team even though we are still above .500 while randle’s in this slump.
Yea he a better Julius Randle but they both can't carry
am I homer if I say Miles Bridges has been much better than Julius Randle?
Julius Randle? Never was his playstyle. It’s rare to see a 1 option be an offball player
"I don't think most people here have actually watched much of him either at Michigan or for Orlando. I also think a lot of people find it hard to look past the fact that Franz is white, even if subconsciously, and limit his ceiling based on that.  * He was arguably the best defensive player in college basketball, and so far has been one of the best if not the best defenders on the Magic. He's guarded everyone from Julius Randle to KD to Trae Young for entire games and done a decent job, less than 15 games in. He's 6'10 with long arms and moves his feet like a wing. * He gets steals playing on ball, he gets in passing lanes, he blocks shots * Can handle the ball, and play in pick and roll as the screener or the ball handler. * He's a really good passer and had one of the best AST/TO ratio's in the draft, and if you watch a [compilation of his assists](https://youtu.be/qa61lfMpHwc?t=2262), some of the passes he makes are super impressive. We haven't even really seen that part of his game yet in the NBA. * He's an excellent shooter, and his college 3P% is misleading because he was at 39% the whole season over 24 games, and then an injury to Isaiah Livers forced him to become their no 1 perimeter player and tanked his percentages in tournament (in just 4 games). * Great athlete, he's very bouncy for 6'10  When you look at his attributes in totality, I find it really hard to see what is limiting his ceiling. The only thing he's really missing is high level shot creation, and if he can get that he's Kevin Durant. He can already dribble and shoot, he just needs a bag.  To put it another way, if someone described a player that was:  * An athletic 6'10 with a 7'1 wingspan * Great defender that can guard 1 through to 4 for entire games, can switch on anyone * Great off-ball defender as well as on-ball * Can shoot 40% from 3 * Can be the secondary playmaker and run an offence * Very high BBIQ and is as effective off-ball as on-ball. Great cutter.  You would think they were a superstar. He's barely 20 and the youngest player on the Magic."
"I'm glad that you brought up the crowds. I have watched practically every Knicks game the past couple of years and legitimately believe this is the reason, and I have not seen it talked about almost at all. No player at that age has ever made a jump like Randle did in NBA history and it all occurred during a shortened season without fans in attendance.  Randle became almost unrecognizable in the playoffs, was not hitting jumpers, was making crucial turnovers and defensive lapses that we just had not seen during the season. I believe MSG jumped from 10% to around 100% fan capacity for Game 1. The funny thing is, if you look at his stats last season his FG% drops towards the end as more fans are being let into games.  I saw Julius miss 3/4 of potentially game winning free throws while at Charlotte last week. And it was loud in there. He's obviously a great dude, but some people just mentally can't cut it.  He deserves his MIP but I legitimately believe he is done as an all-star basketball-wise, he may still get voted in as the Knicks rep because Thibs is a good coach and our team is deep.   I haven't hit the panic button as a fan because he signed that extension this summer which is significantly less than the max he would've been eligible for next season. Its an extremely movable deal I can see the Knicks get positive value for in the coming years when they're ready to make their swing."
"Look at their latest downfalls too.  Lost Lonzo Ball for nothing. Julius Randle for nothing.  Jrue Holiday for Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee).  Steve Adams for Valcunius, Eric Bledsoe to clear salary cap space to sign nobody.  Unable to keep Zion in game shape, Zion has repeatedly shown disgust with the team and is likely to move on when his contract is over.  Brandon Ingram will probably leave too."
The hawks killed julius randle
"Makes sense that he took a contract this off-season   [If Randle would have waited until 2022, when his contract expired, he would have been eligible for a contract extension worth roughly $200 million. Instead, Randle decided to sign a four-year, $117 million deal, locking in his financial stability and giving the Knicks financial flexibility moving forward. ](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32095969/julius-randle-wanted-lock-new-york-knicks-ok-potentially-leaving-millions-table)"
i get youre defending your guy but dont bring julius into this. we were supposed to be a lottery team and he carried us into the playoffs. we had one series and lost to the team that went to ecf. hes also not making simmons money  randle also didnt pass up open looks
Julius Randle can hit free throws at least
"Westbrick, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown, Jrue, Towns, Julius Randle."
"...unless you can't make the playoffs in the first place.  He clearly has a confidence issue that hurts him in 4th quarters of playoff games, but anyone who says he's useless in the playoffs didn't watch the games or even bother to look at his playoff game logs.    Calling him a 'gigantic liability' is just hyperbole.  Julius Randle is making almost that much and hasn't shown shit in the playoffs, or the ability to contribute to winning outside of one good regular season."
"Julius Randle and RJ Barrett are absolutely brutal to watch.       Julius *completely* ruins any offensive chemistry when he's in. He's gone back to his 2019 play style, but instead of driving and spinning into 4 defenders, he's now SLOWLY backing down and pounding the ball into a contested turnaround fadeaway brick.       It fucks up any offensive momentum we may have. When he's on the court it's literally ""4 people stand around on the opposite side and watch Julius Randle brick"". He was a team worst -21 last night.       I'm not sure what happened to the Randle that moved around, ran an offense, always looked to drive and kick, etc.       Julius Randle is taking 40% of his shots from the midrange (3+ feet out to the 3p line). That is 7 shots per game. He is shooting 33% on those. That means whenever Julius takes a shot from midrange, which he's doing 7 times a game, the expected points is 0.66. That is absolute dogshit, but he won't stop doing it.        RJ Barrett is forcing awful shots and missing, 40.5% FG on the year.   Kemba is in a tough spot. Even when he's shooting well, he's such a negative on defense, and the rest of the squad is so bad they can't hide him.     Fournier is trash. Similar to Kemba, but at least Kemba's been hitting his shots lately.     Obi looks great, so that's a highlight. Burks is great. IQ is awesome.        Really, I think the starting 5 should probably be Rose, IQ, RJ, Obi, Mitch. At least until Randle stops taking turnaround fadeaways with 15 seconds on the shotclock.        Just need to shit on Randle more, one sec:      He is taking 8.1 pull-ups per game with an eFG% of 39.7%. Gross."
"AD is extremely overrated. He's a good player, but his only good performances come off of LeBron's back. When LeBron is out, AD is no better than Julius Randle."
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
KD wanted to go up against Julius Randle and not join him
"Knicks should bench Julius Randle if they want to succeed, let's be honest they're just a first round team at best.  And since I am an internet basketball super genius their head coach should listen to me.  Also Dolan should listen to me and sell the team, if they want to succeed."
"Warriors aren't going to be in this, come on, they're waiting for KAT or another wing player.   I'll give you the Pelicans and Knicks, I think both of them have great trade offers that they can make that are just as good as the Sixers, the thing that I'm not seeing is the same level of desperation as the Sixers, and why Dame is trying to play there?   Like does he really think he could compete for a championship with Julius Randle in NY? Or compete for a championship with ""Julius Randle with hops"" that is disturbingly injury prone in New Orleans?   As for us, I don't think we'd trade Jaylen for Dame even though it would make us significantly better, but maybe I'm wrong, I really don't know what Brad is like as a GM. Ainge would never do that trade, difficult to tell what Brad's thinking is like."
"Sabonis is better than Julius Randle and would thrive in a Pau Gasol role with in a better scenario. Thinking Golden State, Miami or Boston."
Andrew Bogut  Julius Randle  DLo
"Buddy Hield , Russel Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Julius Randle. And that's just on the Lakers. LeGM is LeBrons worst enemy."
Without Rondo our friend Mirotic is not unlocked. Without Mirotic they lose the series! Replace AD with last year's Julius Randle and they still win the series.
"The problem isn't passing on Zo. The problem is not trading him before the deadline last year to get something back. If teams aren't gonna keep a guy, they can't just let him walk for nothing. It's bad cap management. The Lakers did this with Julius Randle and it still bothers me to this day."
surely you’re not calling julius randle a star lol
you mean julius “one outlier year” randle?

100% JR is not Julius randle. I only use initials on our team subreddit cus figuring out initials of other teams here is a pain
"Julius Randle, Dubious Handle"
"Sorry we can’t all have a big three of …*checks notes*…Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Evan Fournier"
"I fault him for being the 8 seed the first time they saw GSW (there were at least 3 winnable games that year), underachieving the next year, and the next year they (to his credit!) swept Portland (though beating Portland in round 1 is hardly a thing you put on your hall of fame speech).  And let's not pretend he only played with scrubs -- he had Jrue nearly his entire run there, a year or two from Julius Randle, etc.  Again, good, sometimes great performances.  From a really good, but not great, player."
I think Julius Randle vs Sabonis is going to be a toss up until the reserves are announced.
julius randle
"If it’s a normal team, it’s the best free throw shooter  If it’s the Knicks, you better bet Julius Randle will be at the line if he’s on the floor, even if he’s missed 30 straight free throws lmao"
I’m tired of hearing about “Julius Randle with hops”. Dude just wants to be heard. He supports a guy who changed the constitution to give himself more power. Erdogan is basically Turkeys version of Putin.
I mean the team has always been solid. They routinely make the playoffs and they made it last season so it's not like they are trash. Beal is one of the best guards in the game at the moment and the supporting cast is solid. They made some solid pickups with guys like Kuzma and Montrezl who are balling out. It's almost like they are free to actually try and shine when they aren't stuck under Lebron. I mean look at Montrezl on the Clippers then on the Lakers and then now on the Wizards. Lebron can have a smothering effect. Same thing with Kuzma or look at Lonzo and Julius Randle. It's like all they need is a chance.
Laughs in Julius Randle
require every team to start a julius randle clone
Julius Randle also had a season ending injury in his rookie year.  He had no chance to win over Wiggins.
"I mean, its only been a year and a bit, tons of current stars didn't look like stars immediately. Some random mid-late first rounder is probably going to win MIP in 2 years and become an All-Star or a DPOY candidate or something else. Would you have projected Giannis or Kawhi to be MVP level players a month into their second year? Guys like Julius Randle, Jimmy Butler, and Pascal Siakam are also good examples of guys who took a bit to become stars. Its not really uncommon for only 2-3 guys to look like stars this early into their careers, nor is it uncommon for 2-3 ""random"" guys to become all-stars later in their career."
Julius Randle
I think his game has just sort of been figured out by the league since last year  No one was gameplanning for Julius Randle before 2020
"Disagree. For a #1 draft pick you expect *at minimum* a low tier/fringe All Star, someone like a Domantas Sabonis or Julius Randle or Mike Conley.   Wiggins is so much worse than those guys."
"Julius Randle is playing similar basketball to 2019 again, yes. But instead of awful spin moves into 4 guys, it's now long, slow ISOs into a turnaround fadeaway midrange with 12 seconds on the shot clock. Dude thinks he's prime Kobe for some reason but he's shooting like 30% from midrange.       Last year he was backing down and kicking when the double came, facilitating, etc. Now he's playing like shit and low IQ. RAPTOR has him worth -0.4 WAR which seems about right. He's hurting the Knicks. Over 42% of his shots are midrange jumpers but he's shooting like 34% on them. It's awful."
"Unpopular opinion here;  I think Julius is more of a problem than we think. Kemba can't defend at all and so either IQ or Rose should step into being a starter BUT if you look at how Julius Randle plays, it's kinda like he's back into his old ways, tryna be the star.  He isos and takes bad shots, not really setting up for others - which in turn has hurt RJ Barrett because he's afraid of messing up when he does get the ball.  I just think Randles mentality rn is about him and not about the team."
It's beautiful and heartbreaking to watch this team... Because all I have is a Julius Randle who can't perform in front of crowds

Kinda pathetic with Mitchell Robinson and Julius Randle on the team.
[Julius Randle entered the game for Obi Toppin in a 93-93 game with 3:44 remaining. The Hornets went on an 11-3 run from there on out to close the win. Randle was a -30 in the second half.](https://twitter.com/_analyKnicks/status/1459347863889195013?s=20)  lol fuckin yikes
"Julius *Chris Webber"" Randle"
"I remember Julius Randle got fined for this when he was with the Lakers, lol"
"But you literally said he doesn’t deserve calls because he didn’t win anything in the playoffs, what does regular season mvp and voted as top 75 player by media and some player have anything to do with that?Does that mean Julius Randle does not deserve any calls because of the abomination of a series he had last year? What has dame won besides the top 75 which is really subjective and lots of people said he didn’t deserve? Paul George is 6x all nba and 4x all defense. Dame is 5x nba and that’s about it for his accolades. If you are talking about playoffs Paul George actually has better TS% than dame and has traditionally did better than dame in the playoffs. Go look at dame’s stats for that pelican series, that was an all time choke job getting swept with home court advantage but no one ever talks about it."
"I think he could get it should he add playmaking to his arsenal, like Julius Randle  But it’d be criminal not to give it to Miles Bridges"
"Julius Randle is never going to be that #1 franchise-worthy guy. At best he'll be a 2a, next to a better superstar. He doesn't have nearly enough shot creation to be that #1 guy, and the Knicks will only realize that after another relatively poor playoffs after another relatively successful season of relying on Randle to be that #1 guy.      I'm happy for Randle, and I'm happy as a Knicks fan he's bringing us to the promise-land of the playoffs. I just don't love his archetype as a player, primary inside scorer who isn't much of a defender. He's proven in 1 season that he's not just an inside scorer who can't defend, but it just looks awkward at times when he tries to force up a shot when he clearly doesn't have the quickness, agility, or strength to create enough separation. Look, being in the 50th percentile at iso mid-ranges means you're decent at them, but not good enough to pull at often as he does. That's Julius Randle."
It's crazy how much Julius Randle has grown as a player over the past 2 years
Julius Randle?
JULIUS RANDLE LMAO
"Have you seen how well D’Lo, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball have been playing since they left LA? The Lakers are a farm team too!"
Siakam is better than both Jaylen Brown and Julius Randle.
"So I should say the Lakers can’t retain talent because they lost Dangelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Julius Randle?  When it’s part of a coherent strategy that doesn’t make sense.  Philadelphia has lost one player they intended to retain as part of their plans- Butler."
"Julius Randle: 6’8’’ , 250lbs  LeBron: 6’9’m, 250lbs"
Julius Randle was great in his last season as a Laker...
"Yup you’re absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
"As a Knicks fan, I don't give a shit about either of them really. If Jokic did that to Morris then I'd be saying the same thing about Jokic not making a basketball play. If someone does something intentionally dangerous against another player then they deserve whatever they get in retaliation.  If Julius Randle did this against Embiid I'd be fucking furious at him because it's a ridiculously stupid thing to do and it makes the game less enjoyable as a fan. I hope your screen reader has fun reading thistststststststststst comment because you're obviously blind if you think what Morris did could be considered a basketball play."
"I don’t really see lack of elite wiggle as too much of a knock for someone with his size. He’s got the size and strength to be more of a Julius Randle or Giannis style driver where they don’t go around their defender, they go through them."
"I'm so damn sick of seeing that commercial, especially since it has no Julius Randle in it 😔"
"Domantas Sabonis 1st year (20) 5.9 ppg 39% fg  Pascal Siakam 1st and 2nd year (22, 23)  4.2 ppg &amp; 7.3 ppg 50% fg  Julius Randle 1st year (injured) 2nd year (21)  11ppg 10 reb 42% fg  Giannis 1st year (19)  6.8 ppg 4.4 reb  41% fg  Kyle Lowry - didn't avg double digits points or more than 4.5 assist until his 8th year."
**Julius Randle**  22.5 PTS / 11.0 REB / 5.5 AST / 1 BLK / 0.7 STL  on   43 FG% / 36.4 3FG% / 81.0 FT% (54.5 TS%)  pretty much equally as important to the Knicks success as any other candidate is to their respective team
"He’s trying to figure out what player would be the worst player you would take over the number 1 pick (based on their current ability).   So if you could draft current NBA players as well, who is the worst person you would pick over the number 1 draft pick. I’m thinking something like Julius Randle maybe. However it wasn’t specified if we get them as a 19-20 year old or their current age, what their contract situation is, or any details like that."
"Models are built on assumptions, and they make a lot of bad assumptions. How is the number one player comparison for Steph Curry this year 2011 Chauncey Billups? They have Zach Lavine and Julius Randle as “average starters” and DeMar DeRozan as a “dubious starter” lol.       They keep building models on a flawed foundation. More data isn’t going to fix the models, you have to re-examine the underlying assumptions and methodology."
"Not an unfair criticism. Just want to remind you that Trae averages a +6.3 box plus-minus across his playoff career, while Randle is -3.5, on top of being 4 years older.  Here’s some other stats to compare:  Julius Randle    Games Played (Career): 457    eFG% (Career): 51.1%   Total Rebounds per game (Career): 9.2    Assists per game (Career): 3.4    Steals per game (Career): 0.7    Blocks per game (Career): 0.5    Points per game (Career): 17.5     Trae Young    Games Played (Career): 215     eFG% (Career): 49.8%    Total Rebounds per game (Career): 3.9    Assists per game (Career): 8.9    Steals per game (Career): 0.9    Blocks per game (Career): 0.2    Points per game (Career): 24.1     Does your choice still seem so obvious to you? I mean your argument is basically that Randle is less vital to the Knicks than Trae is to the Hawks, which doesn’t strike me as much of a criticism of Trae himself. If anything it’s a compliment."
Julius isn't a role player and there's no offense in the world that never isos. Knicks offense was better last night when Randle was iso-ing than on the PnR.

"Bruh.  You got DAJ, DSJ and Wesley Matthews and 2 picks out of that. None of them were serviceable players for you and the cap space you cleared with them didn't bring you neither KD nor Kyrie. Then you went and got 4 power forwards in one off-season, with Julius 'Dubious Handle' Randle being your centrepiece? Like, c'mon man, I appreciate Randle breaking his mold and becoming a star, but nobody saw that coming lmao. Least of all your old FO that all got fired after the KP trade.  You guys basically fucked up so bad, so consistently, it had to go right for you at some point just through sheer statistical likelihood, and well, here we are."
Lonzo’s been lining up on the other team’s 4 down the stretch a lot this year. He also faced down Julius Randle in the Knicks game during crunch time.
"RJ ""Heavy Hands"" Barrett touching up Julius ""Feather Shoes"" Randle"
I like Julius Randle. When he plays good I am happy. When he plays bad I am sad.
Hahaha true he has shut down Siakam on a few occasions. Against someone stronger like Julius Randle or Giannis I feel like Tatum can handle them better though. Maybe I’m underrating Brown.
No Knicks fan with more than 3 brain cells thinks that Julius Randle is the best player on a championship team
yes but how far are you getting with Julius Randle as your best player i think is a more interesting question. Because this is a good team but not a championship core  i just feel like the knicks are getting ready to make a trade soon they have plenty of assets
Julius Randle may have been mentored by Kobe but he needs to realize- he’s not Kobe
"Julius Randle! Don't you regret coming to the Kniiiiiiiiiiiiiicks  Julius Randle's wallet: ""...nope."""
Julius Randle since he was on the lakers
It’s cause they both went to Kentucky so Rondo fucks with their alumni hard same with Boogie and Julius Randle
NO  KNICKS AREN'T ALLOWED NICE THINGS. JULIUS RANDLE WILL BE TRADED FOR SIMMONS
He's referring to Julius Erving...  Not Julius Randle LOL
"Not lockdown, but Julius randle. His defense improved a lot when thibs arrived"
"Wow, I didn't know Julius Randle was a doctor ..."
"Could very well be another Julius Randle situation. Randle was mostly unimpressive his first 4* seasons with the Lakers. Solid player but wasn’t the star he was projected to be. Lakers passed on bringing him back, takes a 1 year prove it on a bad Pelicans team &amp; gets a chance to show what he can do without high expectations. And that turned into an opportunity in New York where he’s found a home and success approaching age 27. Bagley is only 22. Still time for him to find his game &amp; a situation where he can thrive and be coached up. Not a bad kid at all, his dad is a hot head but Marvin can be a really good player if he puts the work in on his end."
"I think it's about the glamor associated with the franchise more than anything else.   Multiple players say New Orleans is their favorite city, but they would play for the Knicks before they would sign with the Pelicans, despite both having histories of recent mismanagement.   Players will often chose the Lakers over Clippers, with some notable exceptions, despite the Clippers being better run the past few years.   So the question becomes why are these glamor franchises? Why do the Knicks still have shine from championships in the 1960s, but the Bulls are relatively overlooked by big names.  I think it in part comes down to how NBA media acts, compared to other places like the NFL. There's no real call in other sports that players should head to franchise XYZ. Even if they say things like, ""the Jets ruin QBs,""  they don't follow it by saying ""Zach Wilson needs to demand a trade to the Saints or Patriots.""  There are some exceptions, like the Cowboys and Jets have a few loud fans in the media world, but it is not as common in NFL coverage and honestly makes the Jets less desirable becausr of how much ESPN hosts shit on their favorite team.  But that is commonNBA where big names in media call for young stars to demand trades to their favorite teams, which are often the Knicks and Lakers.  The teams players chose are, generally speaking, the ones closest to winning or the ones with the most fans in big NBA media jobs.   The pressure is higher on those franchises, but the rewards for success are much greater. Julius Randle got 8th in MVP votes last year, while Derrick Rose got 9th. They don't get that if they have the exact same season on Atlanta, a team with the exact same record.  If the NBA wants change they probably need to put pressure on their league partners in the media to stop covering the NBA so biasedly or as a soap opera, where more time is spent on potential player movement than on the actual games."
Yeah you’ve got franchise centerpiece Julius Randle after all
And get bounced in the first-second round.   You don't mortgage your future when it's finally looking promising to bounce Julius Randle and Dame off of a KD/James Harden duo year after year lmao.
Don’t forget Julius randle and Lamelo
"Yeah you beat me to it I was just going to say these stats show the fact that most teams are employing heliocentric offenses now.  The usage rates on teams “star” players are breaking records every year. I was looking at a stat the other day where the only person that had usage rates so high was Kobe, then after like 2014/2015 all these people rocketed past him.  It kind of sucks to see because it’s becoming much less of a team sport where teams are using their best players as primary ball handlers even when not necessary (and when they definitely aren’t the level of player that should be doing it).  One example that comes to mind immediately is Luka - who clearly should be doing it but still probably does it too much. Then you have someone like Julius Randle (no disrespect, I love the guy), do you really need him playing like LeBron? No, I don’t think so."
"&gt;KG and Ray Allen, Julius Randle, KD and James Harden. Hell, Kawhi.  One of these names is not like the other and I suspect that was the entire point of the post"
julius randle  he can’t always be exciting when he runs.
"Nah, he's definitely one of the people that's suffered the most from being overpaid. He went from a promising young center who'd be the centerpiece to OKC's defense for years to come to a guy making $25 million a year for 10/9. He's a good starting center but comparing salaries, he's in the same pay range as Vucevic, Jalen Brown, Demar, John Collins, Julius Randle and other players of that caliber.  If he were 12-16m a year he'd be a good piece on a good contract who can rebound, dunk and defend the rim."
"For those saying wiggins is a good contract, let's look at the contracts within 3 million of wiggins aav.   KAT  Klove   Brandon Ingram  Jamal murray  Cp3  Gordon Hayward  Wiggins  Embiid  Jokic  Dlo  Julius Randle  Kyle lowry  Demar derozan  Al horford  Jaylen brown  Of these players I think there's only kevin love and al horford that wiggins is definitely better than"
"Ye the guy who got the 2nd team forward spots next to lebron was Julius Randle iirc, who had a break out year but still it was a rough year for forwards. Meanwhile beal the 2nd leading scorer in the league makes the 3rd team next to irving. Just shows you how much more contentious the guards spots are."
Julius Randle confirmed as the second coming of Basketball JEsus
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
Julius Randle regresses after shooting the lights out for the last year or so (playoffs excluded) and RJ Barrett makes the leap to all star
"Be the change that you want to see and post scoring highlights.  Whether you like it or not, defense and smart plays get the people hype. Jalen Green catching a pass was a top highlight from yesterday.  Julius Randle had a hype scoring play. If the others don't, it's not bias. Seems you have your own internal biases to struggle against."
"Not really.  People think he can’t shoot because of his NBL stats but we should really disregard that now that we have a solid NBA sample size.  LaMelo made more threes his rookie season (92) than he took his entire season in the NBL (80). He shot 48% on 2s last season, putting him in the company of Trey Young, Kamba Walker, and Ja Morant. He shot better from 2 than Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Edwards, Russell Westbrook, Dennis Schroeder, Julius Randle, and D’Angelo Russell.  I’m too lazy to look up his stats before the injury, but if memory serves me correct he was shooting something like a 50/38/80 split. Post injury all his numbers really got dragged down and he couldn’t hit a three to save his life. Besides him constantly grabbing it every stoppage in play, it was obvious he needed more rehab time on that wrist to get his shooting form back.  But just from watching him, kid has a shooters touch. People hold his janky form against him but the ball goes in and his touch on 20 foot floaters is insane. Not to mention once he slowed down on his free throw routine he started shooting 85%.  Guy is a shooter, I think this next year really shows it."
"Kemba Walker never really adjusted to that role as a clear supporting option behind Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for Boston because he thrives as “the guy” who is most dominant with the ball in his hands, which is what his situation in NY can offer him, especially in pick and pop with Julius Randle"
This is the most Julius randle shit I have ever seen In my life

"Everyone saying Julius Randle was going to fall back to earth were fucking delusional. He clearly took his game to another level last season, showing new parts to his game he didn't have in LA. It was just a bad matchup against the Hawks in the playoffs, it happens."
Julius Randle is Magic Johnson compared to Oubre.
"So the Knicks took the whole offseason and eventually decided, ""Yeah, Julius Randle iso is the only play we're willing to run in crunchtime."""
Oubre's got that Julius Randle court vision
Fuck it I'm already drunk af.  Julius Randle will fuck your bitch respectfully.
"Houston wasn't nearly as good without CP3, in fact OKC wound up overachieving with CP3 and Harden was getting doubled/tripled at like half court with WB as his teammate.  Regarding the East, anybody can make it, Julius Randle looked like an MVP over there, just a role player in the West."
"I was in my room and I was just like staring at the wall thinking about Julius Randle But then again I was thinking about nothing And then my mom came in and I didn't even know she was there she called my name And I didn't even hear it, and then she started screaming: MIKE! MIKE! And I go: What, what's the matter? And she goes: What's the matter with you? I go: There's nothing wrong mom And she goes: Don't tell me that, you're on drugs! And I go: No mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, Why don't you get me a Julius Randle buzzer beater And she goes: No you're on drugs! I go: Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking She goes: No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way! I go: Mom just give me a Julius Randle buzzer beater, please All I want is a Julius Randle buzzer beater, and she wouldn't give it to me All I wanted was a Julius Randle buzzer beater, just one Julius Randle buzzer beater, and she wouldn't give it to me Just a Julius Randle buzzer beater"
“Why can’t I be MVP of the league? Why can’t I be the best player in the league?”  -Julius Randle(s teammate 11 years ago)
Give me Julius Randle with a hoagie addiction
"That draft had the coolest names in the lottery. Dante Exum, Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, etc etc. Any one of those names could have been a superstar's name. The next LeBron James or Kevin Durant. Hardest draft to pick in imo. Just high potential names all around."
"Ok Mr scoreless have you done the research? HAVE YOU DONE THE FUCKING RESEARCH?????? Julius Randle doesn't even exist, ffs do your own research next time bud."
we got durant with kyrie. thats why all of us didnt care. and from that we got harden. dont worry though yall got julius randle and rj barrett.
"Prior to last year, I think most people would've agreed that Zion was a better shooter and ball handler than Randle. Really speaks volumes as to how much Julius improved. All the credit in the world to him, he was an entirely different player. He didn't just improve across the board, he improve dramatically across the board in every measurable category. That doesn't typically happen   7 years into a career."
A is like Brandon Ingram or Julius Randle. Let me roll the dice with B.
"When the hops go he becomes Julius Randle. When the quickness goes, then he becomes Zach Randolph.   When his mind goes...then he becomes Big Baby."
"Yes, but what you said was that KG was never seen as the better player. You didn’t specify those years. Now you are trying to specify those specific years, when it wasn’t in the context of anything you or I said.   And All-NBA teams disregard team record?   So DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Julius Randle we’re all top 10 players? They didn’t get 2nd team All-NBA for being the beat players on playoff teams?    And I watched the series live too bro, I’m in my 30’s. Good speculation though!  I’ve proven you wrong with your All-NBA takes, and said Shaq being the best player prior to 2002 was pretty much a unanimous thing. However everyone knew he coasted during the regular season and turned it on for the playoffs."

Behind Russ and ahead of Julius Randle
Glock in the left hand   JULIUS RANDLE!!
"I’m sorry but Knicks fans haven’t realized they aren’t going anywhere with Julius Randle as their main guy?  Talk about delusional lol  He can put up 30 and 10 all season, he needs to show his worth in the playoffs"
Julius Randle is apparently still really good at basketball
Did Julius Randle come out of the blue? Ingram? Giannis? PG13? I mean the favorite rn is MPJ.
julius randle - day in a life with the randles
What PF/C do you think pairs best with Sabonis if you could pair him with anyone? Is there any forward/big combo you could make that meshes with his strengths/weaknesses? The only one I can think of is Anthony Davis. Pascal Siakam maybe? Maybe Julius Randle? I think that's about it.
Julius Randle
Julius Randle in the Whole Series vs ATL
"Julius Randle in the top 10 and only playing one game, what a GOAT"
Wiz are in the East where Julius Randle finished 8th in MVP voting...and they still had dudes like Beal-Bertans on the perimeter.
"So will Julius Randle, and every other player."
"Julius Randle led the Knicks to the 4th seed out East, it's not hard to do, meanwhile Kawhi, PG, Lebron, Doncic, Davis, Curry, etc. teams finish as the same (Clippers) seeding or worse in the West."
"They were 1st round and out last year, Schroeder wasn't that bad either and they gave up some of their best role players like Caruso, KCP and Kuz.   WB is incredibly overrated, he underachieved with PG in OKC and even got badly outplayed by him in the playoffs despite PG having like a torn rotator cuff and 2 bum shoulders that needed to be surgically repaired.  He hasnt played winning ball in a long time, even in the lowly east where Julius Randle looked like an MVP there."
"Lowry, Butler, Chauncey, Ben Wallace, Julius Randle, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap   Bunch more."
Jimmy Butler. He's got that chip. Julius randle (I know he's not close to retirement).
"You can argue that who actually wins the MVP award is circumstance driven, that's fine.  Which is why you should also bring up that Stockton was **never even close to the conversation**.  He peaked at one 7th place vote in his entire career.   *Seventh.*  Julius Randle just got 8th place for MVP last season if you want to think about the context of that.  And it's not like Malone was just siphoning off all his votes and that's why, because Russ finished over KD in voting their final season together.  If Stockton was really that guy like you guys are claiming, he'd be in the conversation too.  It's not using the hardware itself.  That can come down to narratives or voter fatigue or whatever.  It's using the fact that he wasn't even in the conversation of being in the conversation for an MVP award.  But somehow I'm supposed to believe he peaked over a guy who won it twice."
Last year’s MIP Julius Randle
Julius Randle.
I've read Julius Randle is really into Wilco and Final Fantasy IX Piano collections
"DRose, Julius Randle and Nerlens Noel are all currently injured and Kemba Walker and Mitchell Robinson have played an average of 48 games the last two years.   Barrett and Quickly were very reliable last year, but Topin and Knox were not. I don’t trust the rookies or Fournier, but maybe you do."
How do you define that? What is high usage? And do you only include players that have been in the playoffs every year? If not just off of the top of my head Julius Randle was worse.
Julius Randle&gt; Domantas Sabonis
i'm exagerating with top 5 but our fan base really seems to believe that he his a superstar player who had a bad season last year.   I have been downvoted to hell multiple times on our sub for saying that he his an all star and one of the best second option in the league... because apparently that's disrespecting him.  The average raptors fan seems to think he is closer to being Giannis than ... i don't know i guess Julius Randle is a good comp.
Julius Randle
"I’m kind of on the Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Zion Williamson train right now. They’re old school lefty power forwards who feast in the paint each in their own ways. It’s refreshing to see today."
"As a Lakers fan, I'll say this: I don't know what Julius Randle's role is on a championship caliber team, but I've seen exactly what Caruso's role is. I'd rather have Caruso on this year's Lakers than Randle."
"Yeah, Caruso has gained a shit ton of social media and general fan following that’s disproportional to his ability. I know he’s decent but dude has half a mil more followers than Julius randle, who played in both coastal mega markets and is way better (they look like they post roughly the same amount). Hard to feel bad that he has to endure meme status as he gets paid more than an all star for social media ads."
"Jimmy Butler: played like dogshit but has had multiple great playoff performances in 2019 and 2020, so is still given the benefit of the doubt  Julius Randle: played like dogshit but is excused because he's seen as a rising player who is still learning the ropes when it comes to playoff basketball  Porzingis: played like dogshit, because he's a stagnating player who's never had a good playoffs, and is letting down his generational superstar teammate, gets a lot more criticism  Ben Simmons: played like dogshit, serious lack of offensive development + multiple prior playoff disappointments = gets a huge amount of criticism"
i can see why people have an issue as to how he has retained top 15 player status especially when guys like julius randle is struggling to be top 45. im biased tho.
They got some explaining to do because why the fuck is Fred Vanvleet higher than Julius Randle

Julius Randle
Julius randle just fucking sucks I guess
"&gt; People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   You're apparently one of those people, pretending like this argument existed. This is such over the top hyperbole that I again feel like you're just doing satire here.   What happens is Laker fans get excited about their young players, just like fans of any team do with their young players (like you're doing with this post after one preseason game 😂), but the Lakers have so many haters that the pushback is overwhelming. As a result every young Laker just ends up getting memed to death, and dumb shit like ""Kuzma is better than Tatum"" which one idiot probably said once years ago becomes the narrative that all the haters cling to and run with as their justification for saying ""he's *sooo* overrated!"" and constantly trashing him.   But then literally the second these players are no longer on the Lakers, people stop just blindly hating on them due to being a Laker and realize ""hey, this player is actually pretty good, I think they've been underrated!"" when in truth the only people who were underrating him were the people who've spent his whole tenure with the Lakers mocking him endlessly just cause he was on the Lakers.   This exact same thing happened with D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram and now Kuzma. The prevailing consensus among all non Laker fans was these guys were overrated trash when they were still on the Lakers. It's just funny for Laker fans to see this happen over and over, where as soon as they take off that Laker uniform then suddenly everyone else is like ""this guy is really good, the Lakers fucked up by letting them go."" This shit is like clockwork 😂"
Am I being a homer or is Julius Randle pretty low a 38?

Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"dang. similar ratings but luka is such a diva though. my fellow Mavericks fans, let's trade luka to the New York knicks!   I'm ready for julius Randle!"
"Also, “Julius Randle is not all that as shown in the playoffs”  This guy had one bad series (5 games) and in this post about REGULAR SEASON standings (82 games) we just ignore the second team all-nba player.  Gimme a break. Julius gets deserved criticism for the playoff series but this man works his ass off and improved insanely last year over 72 games"
"It kinda does mean they are good... you want to rate someone higher than someone else when their skill sets doesn't make people around him better or equate to team success as much as the other   The same people he played with base of your statement James harden made use of. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson,  Austin rivers. Julius Randle left and became an all star as well.   Christian wood was close to winning mip before getting hurt. The warriors weren't even a thing when he was drafted in 2013... So for 7 years the warriors were the problem when he only made the playoffs twice..."
Julius randle
Julius Randle is older than Giannis. only a couple month but still.
"I will not take any Julius Randle slander.  Hawks just played some really good defense and exposed a flawed Knicks team that had no one that could create outside of him.  Kristaps Porzingis has been such a dramatic figure basically his entire career.  It's especially gotten pretty loud last season where he's been pretty vocal about his role on the team and possibly threatening to get out.  So far he's said he's buying in to this new thing but we'll see.  If it doesn't work out here on a second team which he has openly criticized, what really is next for him?"
Well do you believe that Julius Randle is a Kyrie level midrange shooter?
Julius Randle. You need a certain type of crazy to do that kind of stuff.
wonder where Julius Randle would be.
I'll put Julius Randle up there to prove last season wasnt just a fluke and the knicks didn't overachieve
Chris Bosh??? You mean that guy that isn’t as good as Julius Randle?
Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  These dudes are about to regress hard.
The last two winners were Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram. They were both drafted and played for the Lakers.  That means there are two candidates that can potentially win next year. They are both on new teams with roles that are a better for for them and could be ready to take a leap.  Lonzo Ball - Chicago Bulls  Kyle Kuzma - Washington Wizards  Jokes aside I think they are very solid possibilities and have shown flashes of legitimate potential. I’m excited to see how they do.
I would say the Pacers are the current most 'average' team. Not quite sure what they need. Maybe Julius Randle?
"Maybe not and he probably never will. But look at say Julius Randle. 2nd overall pick, well regarded prospect. Was basically a meme player for a few years until he turned it around in his 7th season.  Obviously it's not 1 to 1, and just because one player turned it around doesn't mean that Simmons will. But acting like his career is an utter failure and he won't ever change is a bit of an overreaction to his shit playoff performance."
1. Julius Randle  2. Bradley Beal  3. Kevin Porter Jr
"Aaron Mintz (agent) and the Lakers don't have a good working relationship historically.   &gt;Traded away: D'Angelo Russell, Josh Hart  &gt;Left in FA: Julius Randle, Trevor Ariza  He also represents Paul George who blue balled the Lakers in the past by saying 'do not trade for me' then saying he was disappointed that the Lakers didn't trade for him.   &gt;https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1013910550974222337?s=21  &gt;Eric Pincus: The Lakers' relationship with Aaron Mintz of CAA was not a fruitful one - poor mutual experience with D'Angelo Russell, Lakers' prioritized cap room over an extension for Randle, benched him, etc. - George didn't give Lakers a meeting. It's all connected and apparently over  &gt;"
"I thought about adjusting for that but I realized that it probably wouldn't penalize ""bad"" playoff runs enough because they tend to end early  If you adjust for FGA series like Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle this year are just a drop in the water, yet were clearly very harmful to their team"
Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.
Julius randle
Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram. Their game is perfect for 3v3
We need Julius Randle. We need a Kenneth Faried Type.
Julius Randle? He’s on a very team friendly $20mil and is the highest paid Knick currently   For context Joakim Noah is our 4th highest paid player lol
"&gt; For 20 years every April the stories start about how many stars Knicks can sign, this sub starts talking about who's going to the Knicks. And then the Knicks don't sign anyone. That's all there is. &gt;  &gt;   I don't recall saying the knicks would sign any big names? there aren't even any big names to be signed this offseason. maybe lowry but I think at most he'll politely hear us out.   &gt;Yeah the FO has changed but until they prove consistency and not just one season carried by Julius Randle nothing's fixed.  the 'biggest' moves that we've made since 2017-18 were trading away Melo, signing Julius to a reasonable contract, and then trading Porzingis, and none of them are really stupid, sitting here in 2020-21. I would have preferred a different return for Porzingis, but we'd be getting clowned 24/7 if we had paid him 5/158 to mostly sit around rehabbing.   so all I am saying is: there is no reason anymore to assume 'well, it's the knicks, they're gonna do some big stupid move, trade all their picks to get a big star, and pitch to all the max FAs.' I mean, first off, *every team with cap space* pitches to max FAs - like, obviously? and second off, when's the *last time* the Knicks traded all their picks to get a big star? it was something like three FOs ago. that's a lot of organizational shuffling around!   so I think an attitude of general optimism about the knicks' trajectory is perfectly justified, given what has transpired over the last few years. we have a coaching staff that everyone was trying to poach, we have a coach who, despite his real shortcomings, is at least able to get significant buy-in from a ragtag group of young fellows - some with much talent and some without - and veteran journeymen. We signed a guy to a cost-controlled contract who was elected MIP and made second team all-NBA. We got home court in the playoffs. These are all *good signs*. I think *we both agree*."
"For 20 years every April the stories start about how many stars Knicks can sign, this sub starts talking about who's going to the Knicks. And then the Knicks don't sign anyone. That's all there is.   Yeah the FO has changed but until they prove consistency and not just one season carried by Julius Randle nothing's fixed. Think of it this way - IT carried us HARD. After we traded him it turned out that our rebuild was all carried by him, almost none of it by anyone else. And it still took us years to get Jaylen and Jayson to carry this team, and we still don't have a pointguard after getting two separate All Star PGs. It was still all Isaiah, there was nothing built, no system, no infrastructure, just one player.   ---  Things look positive for the Knicks and for the first time in 2 decades they don't have an unlikable team. I've really liked Randle for a very long time."
I would swap Brandon Ingram with Russel Westbrook. Then I would move Ben Simmons down to tier 8 while moving up Pascal Siakam into tier 6 and SGA into tier 7. Finally I would swap Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry.
"Terrence Ross over Jonathan Isaac, Julius Randle over Derrick Rose and Pascal Siakam over Kyle Lowry. The other 27 I agree with."
"He’s also not better than Julius Randle, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Westbrook, AD, Lavine, Vucevic, Kemba, McCollum, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kawhi, Shai Gilgeous Alexander."
"That's a really good perspective. Our takes are a snapshot in time, it's based (hopefully) on relevant evidence up to that point and circumstances can always change. I held out on keeping my Julius Randle stock until last year, for me it was all I needed to see to say he can't be a productive, reliable, and efficient primary or even secondary option on a competitive team. But then he goes and has this season and I'm totally wrong, but my reasoning wasn't. Something changed, and his game just started to click."
"we havent seen another pure talent hall of famer like chuck, but julius randle does fit that role as a chuck-ultra light"
"I've gotten hate for this before, but I think Jrue is one of the most *overrated* (you heard me, Chuck) players in the league. His best year in NOLA was with an AD that didn't want to play, a Julius Randle that was still at best a beyblade, and a bunch of scrubs. I don't think he's as amazing as people think he is, especially with how inconsistent he seems to be."
At this point he’s kind of like Julius Randle lite (literally lol) with better handles + old head feel for the game
Julius randle?
Julius Randle is All-NBA but not a star?? Funniest shit I’ve heard all day.  Ever heard of players improving?
"Because it’s not hard to be the best player on the pistons, someone’s gotta score the points it’s kinda like people thinking that Julius Randle is actually a star.  Jerami Grant is a career 10/3/1 player…"
I would swap Julius Randle for Jimmy Butler. I dont see him having another career year.
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
i'd rather be in the lotto than think about maxing Julius Randle
"That's revisionist.   It wouldn't have been a Kuz + picks trade, it would have been a package like what we did for AD. We were clearly willing to lump in Brandon Ingram, Lonzo + picks and, at the time, Julius Randle was an RFA so he could have been included as well."
Julius Randle
"Sorry I meant at best he’s 5th, Bam is still ahead of him and proved it last year. Gobert is also probably better, Vuc is in the conversation (I think Ayton is probably better)  It wasn’t near record setting his rookie year LOL. Julius Randle that same year on the pelicans averaged 21 on the same TS%.  Again pseudo-role player. He’s a star level big playing as a role player. Ofc he’ll be efficient"
"Rookies?? BI, Clarkson and Julius Randle were far from rookies. What player has really developed into a better player while on the Lakers?"
"The Lakers development team sucks. Players leave the Lakers and always seem to get better. For example, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Deangelo Russel, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson…"
RJ AND JULIUS RANDLE  Fr tho Curry and Miami LeBron is a great shout.  I like KD and AD. Lineup destroyers. Two 7 footers with guard skills on both ends and who can also be very productive off-ball.
"Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 1996-97:   MJ 14.7, Terrell Brandon 11.1, Mitch Richmond 11.0, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 9.6, Karl Malone 9.5, Glenn Robinson 9.4  Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 2020-21:   Russ 6.1, Brandon Ingram 5.8, Julius Randle 5.8, Bradley Beal 5.6, Joel Embiid 5.6, CP3 5.5  That's a 45-50% drop, dude. And BTW, ALL of these dudes are noted standout offensive players."
Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle
Reggie Jackson and Julius Randle
Julius Randle.
"No, i’m sure Pop has absolutely no clue Randle exists  [here’s a link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportscasting.com/usa-basketball-ceo-julius-randle-didnt-make-olympic/%3famp) that explains the selection."
Did no one inform Pop that Julius Randle played minutes at the 5 this year and shot 41.1% from 3 this year? Has he heard of this thing called All-NBA Second Team?
If he continues this Julius Randle arc he’ll lead a team to the playoffs only to shit the bed once they get there
Feels nice to have two teams that haven’t won in ages for once. Hopefully next year Julius Randle and RJ Barrett lead us to the promised land
 Brook Lopez has had a surprisingly solid career. Good starter in the first half of his career and now a solid contributor in the latter half.   John Collin's ceiling might be higher but I'll be surprised if it is by much.  You  have to hope his upside is a better version of Julius Randle? Tobias Harris?  How many players make a leap after 4-5 years in the league? You kind of get what you get after years 2-3 especially when you start on a lottery team.. Only guy I recall making a leap from good player to superstar after year 4 is Kawhi. A large difference there is opportunity.   I dont have a horse in this race just looking at it objectively...I think lol.
So for perfection we basically need Julius Randle to make the HoF?
This man Uzi doing his best Julius Randle impression
Julius Randle 2019
"While he may not qualify as hes currently leaping, Julius Randle has the potential to improve EVEN MORE and become a true mvp caliber player.   As long as he doesnt shit the bed in the playoffs"
Julius Randle was not considered a star back then. Neither was Jrue.
Weird to bring up the Nuggets. This isn’t really a discussion on them but go off. Also “outside of the best draft pick EVER they aren’t a good drafting team” lmao   I don’t know if I would consider that drafting well since they had 3 #2 and a #7. Julius Randle was a hit but look at who’s drafted right after their #2s
"How about our league’s reigning Most Improved Player, Julius Randle.  Excelsior!"
"No he wasn't. A candidate means you have an actual realistic chance of winning it. Coming 10th while getting 4 third place votes doesn't make you an actual candidate. Saying Brook Lopez was a DPOY candidate last year is like saying Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle and Derrick Rose were MVP candidates this year (all of whom received votes)"
Julius Randle and Zach Randolph take the crown.
"Creating an environment that made Kyrie&amp;Co feel like they could win a title. If being in a major city was a guaranteed path to FA’s why were Amar'e Stoudemire and Julius Randle the biggest signings the Knicks have had during this century? Who are the best players to join Chicago, Toronto or Philadelphia in free agency in this century?"
"The Damian lillard rumors are the worst, why would the blazers trade a stud for 4 bums? No one wants any Knick not named Julius randle"
"It should be (41/48)*91 if you are calculating the number of possessions he was present for in 06 which would equate to 78 possessions. Bumping his mpg to 37.5 which Julius Randle averaged this season and Lillard last season would bring the number of hypothetical possessions he would have to today greater than that.   Dumpster fire offensive teams as exist now as well. He could very likely be on a team like he was on 06, which he dragged to an 8th ranked offense."
"James Harden isn't that young, even Julius Randle is pushing it"
PG Immanuel Quickley  SG RJ Barrett  SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Julius Randle   C Mitchell Robinson
The Hawks gotta thank Ben Simmons and Julius Randle for them to get this far into the playoffs
"he was never top 5 but i can see why he was voted 6th in mvp voting. remember, mvp is a regular season award. his value to his team was comparable to julius randle this year, but even better with a worse supporting cast somehow. he really fell off (not exactly his fault) once he went to the cavs. his numbers were ridiculous."
"this is the hawks peak. they won against the fucking julius randle/derrick rose knicks (lol) and the ben simmons 1 knee embiid 76ers. this hawks team is last years heat, expect no playoffs next year"
It’s pretty damn easy    22-Julius Randle  23-Kevin Knox  24-RJ Barrett   25-Zion(when he’s a knick)  26-Julius randle again   27-Obi Toppin  28-Immanuel Quickley  29-Quickley again   30-Kyden Randle
Damn Hawks aren’t good when Julius Randle and Ben Simmons don’t play.
"Zach LaVine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart, Christian Wood, Royce ONeale, Seth Curry"
"I don't think what the Knicks did this season is the desired result after being ""in the dirt."" The point is to set the team up for a championship. You're not gonna get that with Julius Randle as your best player."
"Because now more than ever we see guys push through the ceilings we try to put on them. Look at Giannis when he came into the league, borderline unplayable, now he’s a guaranteed 1st ballot HOFer and he’s only 26. Pascal Siakam went from raw gangly rebounder to 2nd option on a chip team and All-NBA 2nd team. Late bloomers like Lowry or Jimmy Butler went from role players to legitimate all-stars. Even 5 years into Julius Randle career, no one would’ve said he’d ever make all-star and all-nba 2nd team but look what he just did. It doesn’t make sense to put a ceiling on someone who’s going to be in the NBA for 15+ years and constantly developing their game."
NoLa didn't particularly play any better without Cousins.   That team had Mirotic dropping 20 a game and Julius Randle as well. So it isn't surprising that sitting their big-ass center could result in better spacing for Anthony fucking Davis lol
"Kobe was the most overrated Laker of all time. He isn’t even close to Caruso level greatness. Caruso carried old man LeBron and some dude with a unibrow through the COVID bubble to win a ring. Kobe couldn’t even carry DeAngelo Russell, Julius Randle, and Nick Young to 20 wins."
I have wondered this too.  Especially with the success the knicks had with Julius Randle this season. He put up comparable stats to kat but less efficiently. And The knicks don’t really have a better roster than the twolves.
I don’t really care about the Luka/Trae debate but bro...Clippers vs Knicks. I wish we could’ve played Julius Randle averaging 18 points on 35% eFG instead of Kawhi Leonard averaging 32 on 67% eFG lmao
Incoming: Sensitive Traestan who thinks playing the Kawhi/PG Clippers in the first round is even remotely comparable to playing the Julius Randle Knicks
I loved watching Julius Randle during the regular season.    Really wish he showed up to some of the playoffs games. Would have loved to see him!
"Kuzma’s game doesn’t fit well with Lebron and AD. His growth is also stunted on the Lakers. If he gets traded, he might be able to improve like Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball."
At this point Julius Randle and Sabonis rank over Zion much less Bosh
"I hate these stupid takes. If anything this season has shown it has shown that it’s very possible for once overlooked talent to show dramatic improvement at age 25 or 26. As a Warriors fan you should automatically agree to this after a year of Wiggins, but there’s also Julius Randle, Zach LaVine (he’s been balling for a while now but this year was undeniable), Christian Wood, Chris Boucher, Jerami Grant, etc."
"Lol, we believe that because we have a 60 yr track record of winning, why wouldnt players want to come to a competent winning organization? U act like our reputation isnt deaerved.  Look at our draft picks that we have up when lebron came....julius randle, dlo, brandon Ingram, lonzo ball, when we sucked we drafted incredibly well.   We traded for kobe draft pick, somehow its bad we are a better organization?   Your bucks team hasnt had anything close to that level of drafting.... and you have the expierience o being a lottery team. The lakers didnt and still was a top level team in terms of drafting.  Sorry r yall suck"
Julius Randle looks like he just walked off the set of Black Snake Moan.
So all-nba Julius Randle had a worse season? Or are you talking about someone else
"&gt;You want to be the pistons because they have the #1 pick and are going to build around Cade. If KAT wants out trade him for a #1 pick so you have another player to build around if you don’t think that’s Ant.  Yeah, I don't think the Pistons would trade Cade for KAT.   &gt;I understand your point, you’re saying trade a superstar for a bunch of role players and you’ll figure out who is the superstar is later.  No, I'm saying KAT isn't a superstar and the TWolves building around a star is only going to lead to mediocrity. That's what I've tried to make clear to you like 20 times.   The way you see the TWolves with Julius Randle and co is more or less how I see them now. Julius Randle's run taking the Knicks to the playoffs is more impressive than any run that KAT's had as the #1 his entire career. People continually conflate KAT's talent with his ability to elevate a team when they aren't comparable."
Dubious Handles/Human Beyblade (Julius Randle)
Lol Julius Randle literally wouldn't make the team.  Bench: PG - Rondo SG - Ron Artest SF - Lamar Odom PF - Pau Gasol C - Andrew Bynum
"Oh so only stars count?  Off the top of my head Jokic didn't miss a single game this year.  Julius Randle missed only 1 game and led the league in minutes played.  Takinf a deep look Book missed just 5 and CP3 missed just 2.  Jayson Tatum missed 8 games, most of which were because of covid.  What about them?  They were fine though.  Also you cannot point at contact injuries and say they're part of it.  Those are really just lightning in the bottle things because what if the ref was like a foot farther away?  What if Capela didn't go for the contest?  Again.  Shit happens in sports.  Part of a season is just being lucky.  Injuries is part of the luck factor."
Dubious Handle for Julius randle
"They would have Nash starting, but no depth whatsoever. I think its pretty much just Julius Randle."
"Julius Randle as he is now is probably of equal value, imo."
Julius randle won mip and then disappeared
Julius Randle 2022
"Fiz described his offense as ""eat what you kill"". What this looked like on the court was Julius Randle spinning into triple teams, Elfrid Payton only passing to Randle, and a rookie Kevin Knox playing 30 minutes a night chucking up the ugliest floaters you've ever seen. Zero accountability. Absolute shitshow."
"It wasn't an acquisition, but Julius Randle definitely fits this bill.  I don't think many people were lower on him from the day he signed, through his entire first season in NY than me.  This season he definitely made me delete my comment history (figuratively, not literally.  I really don't care enough to actually go back and delete all of that.  If people want to dig up things I said 2 years ago and throw them in my face, I'm happy to just own up to them and admit to being wrong)."
"Draymond, Giannis and Julius Randle. Strong bigs who are quick enough to switch and have some traditional guard skills (usually playmaking, sometimes shooting)"
"League should give All NBA teams by their rank rather than by positions.  This may be an unpopular opinion, but I didn't Julius Randall deserved 2nd Team ALL NBA.   Obviously, he had great stats and help the Knicks make the playoffs, and there arent many all star forwards/PFs in the league.   But the league should give 6th -10th best players in the league the 2nd team ALL NBA rather than by positions. I think players better than Julius Randle got snubbed hard. Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Westbrook, KD, Harden (obviously, some missed significant time but just my opinion)"
Round 1: Julius Randle    Round 2: Ben Simmons
I'm unfamiliar with this 'Julius Randle' fellow. Did he mean to say Dubious Handles?
It's really just the 4 all stars and maybe Clarkson depending on how you see him vs Wiggins. All 6 are also the 6 with the most career points scored in the draft.  Highest career scorers of the 2014 draft  Wiggins 10263 (525 games)  Nikola Jokic 8360 (453 games)  Jordan Clarkson 7950 (521 games)  Zach LaVine 7831 (411 games)  Julius Randle 7744 (446 games)  Joel Embiid 6456 (250 games)
"I mean Julius did shoot near 40% from three and he's better at everything else. If we are talking playoff Gulius then yeah obv I don't want him but that's a 2nd team all NBA player were talking about I think. Most countries aren't gonna have a John Collins Clint Capela DeAndre Hunter rotation guarding him, I think he would be better. I don't think it's a choice based on race I think it's based off of name recognition but either way I'd rather have Randle."
Yeah you mean Kentucky wildcat alum Julius Randle I had him first overall
"I think it is. There will never be A situation we say we need Julius Randle. But a lot of Euro teams will zone us and his shooting could be valuable there since Bam and Draymond are non threats there. Best case we won’t need him, but he fits the role of what you want in a 12th man/extra big"
Julius Randle replacing Draymond from the beginning and the warriors actually are better.
"It would take one article about his poor three point shooting today and he’d lose his mind over the summer and come back a way better shooter. Julius Randle shot 42% from deep on a ton of contested threes this year, MJ would have been more than fine."
jalen rose not that good anymore called kevin love tokenism ws wild. love fits way better for team usa than julius randle. pick and pop 3. juluis would need the ball more in his hands to be effective.if it was mason plumlee sure i would agree but kevin love was a quality player and still be serviceable in 10 minutes
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
"He was drafted and loved the same Lakers scouting department that drafted gems like Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Zubac, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and Larry Nance later in the draft. Or the fact that Frank Vogel who is one of the smartest coaches in league love him. Or he’s being developed by Phil Handy the best development coach in the league that has specifically worked with Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis. Or the fact that he rates in the 96th percentile according the Basketball Index in his getting to the rim rating. Or the fact he’s getting personally mentored by Lebron. There’s definitely a chance for the kid to succeed but have fun with your day."
Julius Randle needs the ball in his hand to be effective. Love doesn’t. Love is a better spot up shooter and passer. It’s really easy to see why Love got the spot over Randle.
Julius Randle can and he was mentioned as the guy whose place Love took.
"Regardless of all of this, isn’t Julius Randle way better than Kevin Love at this point lol?"
He was specifically chosen over Julius Randle
Kevin love making it over players like Julius Randle is blasphemy.
He’s not even the best player on his shitty team and can’t stay healthy. They passed up Julius Randle for him???
This reminds me of when Knicks fans said they were getting KD and Kyrie and ended up with Julius Randle and RJ barret
Julius Randle playing so poorly against the Hawks in the postseason really isn't as big a deal as many are making it out to be
"Me. It seemed like another year of no hope. Was sick of Julius Randle already, was unsure how RJ would develop, Austin Rivers was our starting pg. Figured if Knox and Frank were busts, that would be that. I was excited for the return of basketball after the bubble, but was really only excited to watch Mitchell Robinson and Obi Toppin. I thought I’d check out mid-season."
Julius Randle is better than Zion Williamson
Op is talking about Kevin Durant not Julius Randle
"Kupchak is a fantastic drafter. He’s gone Julius Randle, dangelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, miles bridges, Devonte Graham, pj Washington and Lamelo in consecutive drafts"
No Julius Randle is Zion with a shot
Who the hell said he was just Julius Randle with hops?  People thought Randle sucked while thinking Zion was the next all-time great.
Julius Randle is a Big Dad Energy version of Zion
If you have Julius Randle Zion’s athleticism he would be way better than Zion now
I’m happy for you guys but y’all gotta tone it down with that Julius Randle for MVP bullshit. 😂
"They got a handful of vets that were... meant to be locker room leaders...  J.J. Redick, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe...  And the guys like them but they didn't establish a culture the way Julius Randle has for the Knicks. Or Jimmy Butler for the Heat. Or Chris Paul/The Suns. Conley is that dude on the Jazz.  We just don't have that."
"iirc kanter called Zion ""julius randle with hops"""
"what? no. there is no shortage of superstars that have other priorities, ranging from money, winning, being in a big market, being on a team on the rise -- all of which the Knicks can now offer. saying no superstar is gonna wanna go there bc Julius Randle is a bad take and plainly false."
Him and Julius Randle are neck in neck rn
Julius Randle.  Plus most players take a huge leap from rookie to sophomore year.
"Well, his dad is Julius Randle."
I do! Good thing we have one in Julius Randle.
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
Show me Julius Randle doing this 10 months ago and New York would have gone insane.

"If you don't love Julius Randle, you don't love NBA basketball"
"We’ll donate Julius Randle to you for the Nets game if you let us hit 10 wins in a row, deal?"
 The real MVP this season is Jokic for sure. 40% on 3s and 9 assists per game. He's been really really good this season too bad Nuggets keep getting hurt. Honorary MVP is Julius Randle lolKnicks. My MVP is my boy Luka Donthicc
I think y'all work so well because Randle is the primary ball handler which he'd have to give up if you want to have DeMar there and be effective. If you are okay with him taking the ball away from RJ and Julius and accept he's a pretty bad defender (main reason I think Thibs wouldn't want him) them go for it
JULIUS RANDLE MVP
"Only if we can get future Spurs legend Julius Randle back in exchange  Edit: Seriously please don't sign him, he's an awful fit with Randle and co"
https://i0.wp.com/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Julius-Randle-3.jpg?ssl=1
Julius Randle in New Orleans: 21.4/9/3 in 30.6 minutes on 14.9 shots per game with 2.8 turnovers.  Julius Randle now: 23.9/11/6 in 37.5 minutes on 18.3 shots per game with 3.5 turnovers.  His volume scoring and rebounding is up a bit if you don't account for the fact he's playing nearly 15-20% more minutes per game. He's a bit less efficient scoring 2.5 more points per game but on 3.4 more FGA. Significantly better assisting though.
Julius Randle. Literally this season
But the question pertains: can Julius Randle be the best player on a championship contending team?
Julius Randle MVP
Julius randle is better shot creator and passer than klove on top of not being a pylon on defense. Also AD exists
"No it’s not. Those are just more terms that don’t actually describe the players impact. Randle literally changed his entire playstyle, attitude mindset, he went from a horoible shooter to an elite shooting big, he went from a ball hog to a legit primary playmaker. He’s taking a team that was projected to be in Cade Cunningham talks to a legit force in the East. He went from being the best player on the team to the actual leader of the team.   MPj was given more opportunities and a bigger role on his team and he stepped up to the occasion. Which is very impressive and deserves respect but is in no way on the Same level as what Julius Randles improvements."
Depends on the players around him. Prime KLove was arguably the best 4 in the league. Try telling someone that a team built around Julius Randle would be a top 4 seed in the East any year before this one.
"Remember the ""Zion is an athletic Julius Randle"" comments, hope Zion gets a 3 ball then."
So this Julius Randle thing is really happening eh? Next superstar?
Julius Randle for Mayor 2021
"Ive been saying this but he's gonna have a Julius Randle level transistion next season. Florida hasnt been good for him. The long break before the bubble fucked him up and the short offseason only allowed him to get to a decent level. He's been playing himself back into star level, but a good offseason and being back in Toronto will be huge. When he came into the league, he was a raw dude who relied on hustle plays and high motor to play well. Having that full crowd enviroment will unlock him."
Dang really miffed that he got traded for picks so we could sign Julius Randle with the CAP space what a shame.
Julius “1st Team All-NBA” Randle is his name
I made a lot of bad picks in this year’s fantasy draft but getting Julius Randle was the best decision I made and his play made up for the other bad picks I had. Grats on an amazing season Knicks bros! May this success carry on in the playoffs and attract free agents next season.
"It's long, but I HIGHLY reccomend reading the [article Julius did for Player's Tribune.](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/reputation-julius-randle-new-york-knicks-basketball-nba) He tells the story about high school gyms and Kobe in there, but it's also just top to bottom an amazing article."
"Nah, the beyblade shit came from next level dumb/forced spin moves that usually resulting in a turnover.   It's nowhere near as prevalent as it used to be. Julius ""lost my handle"" Randle is no more."
Real talk does Julius Randle make an All NBA team this year?
"Not really. Julius was fine. He was basically like Zion but with no right hand at all. His only flaw was his tendency to spin left and bully his way in. This was a huge part of his game but it was also his only problem. This is one of those situations where coaching actually matters. Now, you can see it with Randle. He's always been a good passer just when he does that move there's no one for the ball to go to. He's been coached out of it. Luke's trash."
Is Julius the best ex-Laker pre-Lebron era?   JC Randle Kuz Josh Ingram Lonzo DLo  Yes?
"Also yesterday KOC discussed how Julius Randle tries to find high schools to get up shots the night before games in visiting cities, a thing he learned from Kobe. He also mentioned that a bunch of players have started going with Randle to these gyms and unofficial practice sessions.   They're building a culture out there in NYC. I really want nothing but the best for y'all. If I wasn't such a die-hard Sixers fan I'd be supporting this team in every way. I don't recall ever a time having such a massive turnaround (esp. without acquiring a huge-star).   Randle for MIP, Thibs for COTY"
"I know but I’m only responding to your point that he’s “convincing himself” that Randle has played stellar defense this season. He isn’t. Randle has actually done that. Credit to Thibs, Kenny Payne (the real KP), Johnnie Bryant and the staff as well as Julius himself. Go Knicks."
"I vividly remember when Knicks didn’t get Zion in the draft, so people were taunting them that they got Julius Randle, a poor man’s version of Zion. And now we here."
Who the hell would've though Julius Randle would be getting MVP consideration this season?
Do people really expect Julius Randle to get MVP votes?
"Since people are just throwing names now, I'd say Julius Randle  is the MVP runner up behind Jokic"
i cant speak for all lakers fans but ive wanted the knicks to be good for almost my entire life (they were pretty good w/ carmelo for a minute there). and the fact that they're doing it with julius randle just makes it all the sweeter
I RESPECT YOUR SELF LOATHING AND WILL PRAY FOR FOX TO GET SOME BRAIDS SO HE CAN DOMINATE LIKE JULIUS BIG DICK ENERGY RANDLE  KINGS FANS AND KNICKS FANS SINGLE HANDEDLY KEEPING THERAPISTS IN BUSINESS WE WANT REPARATIONS
"Great to see. Such a strangely built squad but I'm enjoying seeing Julius Randle develop. If the Knicks can turn it around, does this means there is hope for the rockets?"
"I love the newfound love and respect between Knicks and Lakers fans. Idk if its being members of the Julius Randle Fan Club, or respect for forever being THE team in a city with two, but its fun"
Fuck it. I want full-on chaos. Give Julius Randle the FMVP too.
I knew Julius Randle was good when I saw a video of him beating this tiny skills coach 1v1
Julius Randle found his stride. Just who’s have thunk it’d be with the knicks lol
"yeah easily, if I was Miami or Boston I wouldn't even bother turning up just call the league office and forfeit early  Julius Randle will average 50/30/20 on 90% shooting and Biden will have to sign an executive order granting the Knicks the official title of best team ever to grace the sport of basketball  Put it in the books"
who is Julius Randle?  in math: my solution ➗  in history: my king 👑  in art: my muse 🎨  in science: my oxygen 💨  in geography: my world 🌎  in basketball: my mvp 🏆
"I love the newly rekindled friendship that Lakers and Knicks fans have over being THE team in a ""two team"" city. Plus we're Julius Randle bros, and who in the world could possibly not love Julius Randle?"
How could anyone not love Julius Randle?
"I hope he addresses his ""and we signed JULIUS RANDLE"" lol"
Julius Randle
I watched then lose what felt like 18 games in a row with Julius Randle at the power forward.   That's what makes this so insane.
Word. I thought I was the only one who noticed.  Benny The Butcher is the Julius Randle of hip-hop right now. Griselda.
"bro said julius randle was discarded from the lakers, he was traded for a top 10 player?!? not like they cut him mid season smh"
Theo P interrupted the interview said something like “Julius Randle All-star.. Kentucky University.. NCAA champion (Runner up)”..
Who ever pissed Julius Randle off fucked up my goodness
Julius Randle is fucking legit
You win in NY they will make you a legend.   Julius Randle right now is probably a top 3 Knick of all time if he retired today tru story!
Julius Randle gets MVP chants literally every time he goes to the line in MSG. He was getting them in the first quarter at 1:30 in the afternoon
Julius Randle is 6'10 255lbs of Beef and Sweat
"The best team for a long time this season, are the Utah Jazz.  And since we know previous MVP awards were greatly predicated upon how that respective winner's team had the best record for 'all of' or 'most of' the regular season then ... can you elaborate on why you were able to cancel out Randle, for those players you listed?*---while you left out Mitchell or Gobert. Please explain that interesting rationale.*  If you care not to explain, I can respect that. And please understand the premise under which I started this discussion. **In terms of how this year, the MVP Award voters and  media, seem to be very interested in players** *other than the ones* **who are leading their team to the best record in the league**. So when considering where the Knicks are today, versus last season and the seasons before that? I felt like it made Julius eligible for discussions about the MVP award."
Crazy that Julius Randle is getting mvp chants at MSG. The nba is so unpredictable
I can guarantee you Julius is getting some MVP votes.  Obi and Randle can theoretically work but Thibs likes having a shot blocker in at all times.
Julius Randle is playing better than Siakam ever has as the 1st option. I'm 100% sure he would've thrived on that Toronto team as the 2nd option behind Kawhi.
Julius Randle has never played in the playoffs lmao
Julius Randle is what Raptors fans tried to convince themselves Siakam is.
I believe its jerami grant not cuz I wanna be different but because he’s the best guy on his team all of the sudden whereas julius randle has been good already
Julius “Julius Randle” Randle
"Julius Randle is having a great year, but he is absolutely no MVP candidate.   He’s at the forefront of a bottom 10 offense, and his efficiency is mediocre.   The main reason the Knicks have a + .500 record is because of Thibs and his defense. If the Knicks did not have a top 4 defense, they wouldn’t have the record they have now, and that isn’t because of Julius Randle."
"Julius Randle is a plus defender but he isn't being talked about for DPOY because he isn't an elite defender. That being said, without Randle, the Knicks would probably be an average defensive team, even with Thibs' coaching. The next man up at the 4 is Obi Toppin, who is... not good defensively  The Knicks best defender this season has been rim protectir Nerlens Noel. He should make an All Defensive team for how terrific he's been"
Is Julius Randle at the forefront of the Knicks being an elite defensive team? Why isn’t he a candidate for DPOY?
 First: the jump for grant compared to randle was huge grant went from being a role player to the main guy and has a 10 point increase in ppg and an increase in almost every other stat.   Yes Julius has played very well and is the leader of the team but he’s been producing pretty similar numbers in the last few years outside of the assists.    Second: you’re a douche
This 30/11/5 on 60% TS is for you New York! -Julius Randle probably
“Julius Randle has won the 2020-2021 finals MVP award after the New York Knicks sweep a healthy and well rested Los Angeles Lakers team.”
Absolute elite defender and awesome when he is aggressive but he is passive in 80% of the games and it can't be an option next season. We just signed this dude to the Max this season which if we waited until next season gave us more flexibility cap wise. So keeping this dude happy was obviously a priority and he hasn't proved why he deserves that money. I understand he is an absolute stud on defence but he hinders our offence so much at times. Look at fucking Julius randle! That is exactly who bam should be aiming to be on the offensive end. Idk this whole season sucks but I'm happy for you guys doing well. I really like trae and Collins so I'm rooting for success Ur way
"except he drives a LOT more than he used to. He's at the rim pretty frequently these days and you would expect a more favourable whistles for arguably the second most popular player in the NBA. Curry ranks 16th for FTA per ESPN below guys like Jerami Grant, Julius Randle and Shai-Gilderous Alexander. It's most definitely an aberration"
MVP - Joel Embiid  MIP - Julius Randle  COTY - Quinn Snyder  6MAN - Jordan Clarkson  ROTY - LaMelo Ball
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
You forgot Julius Randle
What if the Knicks trade back for Porzingis to form a ‘big ball’ lineup? This would be beneficial because Porzingis could play with other 3’s and wouldn’t have to bump down low with the other big men.   Their next year lineup would be:   PG: Immanuel Quickley   SG: RJ Barrett   SF: Kristaps Porzingis   PF: Julius Randle   C: Mitchell Robinson
"In 2 years they will be dating, and the supermarket tabloids will be filled with cover stories about ""Lion,"" as they'll call them for short.  The distraction will be too much. Both will have prolonged slumps until they break up, while Ben Simmons will be widely regarded as the best player in the league after working out with Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball in the off-season and becoming a 40% three point shooter overnight."
MVP: Julius Randle   DPOY: Nerlens Noel  MIP: Julius Randle  COTY: Thibs   ROY: Quickley  6MOY: Derrick Rose
Julius Randle
Julius Randle
"Rj Barrett and his son, the pacers Organization.  Along with Julius Randle with his son, the Hawks organization"
Julius Randle or Jerami Grant.
Julius Randle is clear IMO
They need Julius Randle
Julius Randle?
JULIUS RANDLE ALL STAR
Julius Randle fan for life
Lol Julius Randle mvp amirite
[Zion Williamson guarding Julius Randle](https://i.imgur.com/C87xx6T.jpg)
Julius Randle is who we thought RJ Barrett would be
Because Julius Randle got in this year lmao
"Pacers finished about 20 games above .500 last year while the Knicks finished about 20 games below.  Julius Randle has lead the Knicks turnaround this year (and of course with some help from improved play from others). But without Randle improving his game this much, the Knicks would be pretty much where they were last year. So if the Knicks hold this pace, it'll be about a 20 game turnaround, mostly because of Randle.  Not to say Sabonis isn't doing great, he is, but I think comparing records actually works to Randle's favor here."
fuck yeah  all-star (reserve) Julius Randle :D  man we had some *dudes* come through the organization over the past 7 drafts
JULIUS RANDLE ❤️
Nice to see vucci mane and julius randle making it this year
Lakers legend Julius Randle
So happy for him and Julius Randle.
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
Love we got a couple first time All Stars with Julius Randle and Zach LaVine.
"Love Julius Randle man, so happy for him after all his hard work. I doubt anyone believe he could really work this hard to be this good of a player, but he's worked his ass off into being an actual star in this league"
"If someone told me in April that Julius Randle would get MVP chants at the first game back at the Garden, I would have yelled at them from a safe distance of 6' away."
Idk if I’ve ever seen a player have such a turnaround over one off season as Julius randle. It’s very hard to become a more efficient player and better defender as you get older and as the focal point of a team
[Julius Randle is named an All Star the same day Bobby Shmurda gets released from prison.](https://i.imgflip.com/2y446x.png)
Julius Randle 🥺🥺🥺
Julius Randle is in! Well deserved
Julius “about the bag” Randle
Wtf are zach lavine and julius randle doin here. And nikola every god damn year.
"Imagine telling Knicks fans last season that we'd be fighting for the playoffs this season and that Julius Randle | Dubious Handle would be an all star leading our team in the playoff race, we'd laugh at you. Nobody expected this, and well done to Randle for improving as much as he has. He's well deserved of an all star selection this season."
"Did Julius Randle make it? I didn’t check...  Just kidding, I checked. Eat it."
"I never used that verbiage. But as of this season, that’s just not true. I’m assuming if that Knicks fan has encountered several adamant Heat fans, he may have encountered some passionate arguments.  Bam is younger, better defensively, and has a lot of potential to be an elite player. But he’s just not better than Julius Randle right now."
"and the Knicks have been a ""pleasant surprise"" along with Randle. Bam is old news. Heat fans cant handle that but Julius is having a new fresh great season, its his spot."
Julius Randle! Holy crap lol
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
BIG JULIUS RANDLE
JULIUS FUCKING RANDLE DAMN RIGHT  WE COMING FOR THAT ALL STAR MVP
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
Great game for **All-Star** Julius Randle to suit up for with the crowd back in.
"When I think about rough and rugged, I envision Julius Randle sorta game. Westbrook can be a bit herky jerky at times, but his freakish athleticism makes him do things that should be impossible for a player his size to do on the court. His game is not free flowing and elegant, but can def be aesthetically pleasing when he is on form."
This phrase is so over-used. People want AD over Julius Randle even if AD only plays 40 games.
I like Julius Randle
"Probably could add CJ Mccollum, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker. Julius Randle is having a hell of a year."
Within the season - The selfish James Harden narrative  From before this season - Knicks having a defensive identity/Julius Randle
Julius Randle is already better than KP in every regard lmfao
"I don’t know if I’d really consider sabonis a 4, and in modern nba I’d just say a big. Sabonis is up there for passing bigs, obviously jokic is on another level from anyone. Bam, Julius randle has been a great passer this year, Ben Simmons, lebron obviously."
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
The Julius Randle Special
Cap space they used on Julius Randle who is putting up an all star season. That cap space they used on Marcus Morris was traded for Immanuel Quickley.
"All star Julius Randle, have you heard of him?"
"Harden Sabonis Siakam Tatum Brown Lavine Young  Lets be real, is Julius Randle even a top 40 player? Miami doesn't deserve a representative. Tatum &amp; Brown are better than anyone not on this list. Simmons &amp; Middleton are not having a better season than anyone on this list."
Porzingis has missed more games this season than Julius Randle has the past 3 years
Could have had Dallas native Julius Randle
Add Julius Randle and D-Lo too
"Part of that is just how wildly inexperienced the team is.  A dude who averages 30 minutes a game and plays all 82 games would total 2460 minutes in an NBA season. Two such seasons would amount to 4920 minutes. In yesterday’s game, 7 of the Wolves top 9 minutes-getters have fewer minutes than that number. They consistently do not execute down the stretch. Turnovers, mixed up defensive coverages, silly fouls, etc. And it’s been that way for most of the season. Just compare who the Wolves had on the floor at the end of the game to the Knicks: Derrick Rose/Alec Burks — Reggie Bullock — RJ Barrett — Julius Randle — Taj Gibson. All but Barrett have eclipsed 5000 NBA minutes (most have doubled or tripled it). That experience really helps, especially when the game tightens up and execution errors are killers."
I hope Julius Randle makes it he has ballin this year
"Okay, let's go through them:  Definitely better: LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Giannis, AD (games played is iffy), Taytum. That's when you get into the Julius Randle, Zion, Jaylen Brown, Hayward, Jeremi Grant, sort of area where I can see Pascal finishing the season in that same category - and then it comes down to how much you value team success, if guys get injured, how much guys regress to the mean, how much have guys rested, etc."

"There’s gonna be riots in the streets of Toronto when they find out Chris Boucher is older than Andre Drummond, Pascal is older than Wiggins and Julius Randle. There’s gonna be real carnage when they find out Malachi flynn is the same age as Jayson Tatum"
Carlisle is the head of the Coaches organization. He has to stand up for them. Let’s not act like bringing on Leon Rose didn’t change the trajectory of the Knicks. They were about to trade Julius Randle for Terry Rozier.
Because according to raptors fans logic. They are 1 game above the Knicks and Celtics so they should automatically take Julius Randle and Jaylen browns spot
"Ingram had 3 seasons. When it was just D'Angelo Russell/Julius Randle, I might have been inclined to agree with you. But considering all of the hits, you think one of them would have developed earlier in their rookie contract."
"""Julius Randle with hops"""
Kemba brown and Tatum for Julius randle and obi toppin
It doesn't help that our fanbase is fickle as fuck. Go to the game threads and sort by new in r/warriors on the nights that we lose; it's a cesspool of doomers claiming that we have to blow up everything for win now moves. Someone was unironically suggesting that we package Wiseman and the Minny pick for Julius Randle lol.
Mike Conley and Julius Randle seem to and they look to miss out this year
If Julius Randle isn't in the mix then there's truly no justice in the NBA...
"This is how I remember it as well.   It wasn't necessarily Randle, it was ""Do you need Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, and Mitchell Robinson on one team? Where are all the minutes going to come from when they're all healthy?""  In retrospect it makes a lot more sense if you know that you're going to trade Morris and/or Bobby Portis.  Yeah they overpaid for both, but in doing so, the knicks put themselves in a position where there was no long term implications.  Overall it was a pretty low-risk move."
"Irving is already a starter  So already locked was Embiid, Giannis, KD, Kyrie and Beal  Yet to be called out but very likely would be Tatum and Brown, Simmons or Tobias Harris, Bam Adebayo, Gordon Hayward, Trae Young, Vucevic, Middleton, Sabonis, Randle, Vanvleet/Lowry/Siakam, oh and of course James Harden has gotta be a lock.   Of that full list the guys that probably won't make it would be Randle, maybe Vuc or Bam so there is a ton of competition still and I didn't even throw LaVine into the list.   But basically of that list the following teams will have to have an all star just because of their standings and success and those would be Boston, Indiana, Charlotte, Toronto. So that's 4 spots completely locked up with Boston likely being 2 all stars so really 5 spots. Then Harden will very likely get a spot. That leaves 1 spot left now which will be fought for between Middleton, LaVine, Bam, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Vucevic, Julius Randle. I can see LaVine making it over all those guys just cause of the season he is having but then again the way Beal didn't make the roster last year and Beal was clearly a better player than Trae Young but still Trae got the spotlight at the time. But still LaVine is on a better team and is having a more efficient season from a numbers perspective than Beal was at the time."
Yeah because the Lakers had a PERFECT bill of health before LeBron came. Julius Randle didn’t break his leg in his first career game or nothing. Anthony Davis isn’t sitting on a dangerously hurt Achilles or nothing huh bruh?? Sit’cho dumbass down somewhere before you ever try and talk to da god
"I think the East Reserves are way harder to pick. Harden and Tatum are probably the only ones I consider to be locks.. there’s so many guys that deserve to make it. Lavine (should be a lock imo), Brown, Julius Randle, Bam, Sabonis, Simmons, Vuc are all playing at all star level."
Ya that’s totally legal. Not nearly what a moving screen is.  Watch a Julius Randle pick for an illegal screen.
"I mean these guys do literally say that I think.   I’ve heard the argument before that they will occasionally try and view it like this, when we look back at this season a year or two down the line, will we say “man it was really stupid that Julius Randle was an all-star over Jimmy Butler”   If the answer is yes they will select the other player"
IQ looks very good 90% of the time. Dudes going to be a lights out shooter in the league. He still needs to work on his finishing and playmaking but his floater is straight 💲💲💲  Obi is one that's hard to guage since he's playing behind Julius Randle who's having an All Star year. He hustles a lot and isn't as bad of a defender as advertised. Some if his struggled are because he doesn't have a PG who looks for him. Rose has done it a bit since he's been here but that's only 3 games.
"Tbf, what are u turning on a Knicks game to see exactly? JT Barrett and Julius Randle? That's not drawing anything."
"True but tbf Jokic, gobert, AD (fuck him he's not a PF) are all really, really good, and guys like Bam, Julius Randle, Nurkic when healthy, all damn good in their own right too."
Reminds me of when he went for 46 against Julius Randle a couple years back. All you can do is put your head down as soon as you see the entry pass
my god never has a fanbase done a quicker 180 than Knicks fans on Julius Randle and it's been so fun to be along for the ride. Sorry I doubted you Julius. You deserve this
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
Julius Randle!
Julius Randle is coming for that asg mvp
Unfair raptors Got two beyblades out there. Even Julius randle can’t compete with that.
davis been carrying lebron all along  julius randle for mvp
If AD's a starter than Julius Randle is good enough to be starter in the wes
This is why I root for Julius Randle
Bam and Butler are not better than Julius Randle this year.
"Harden and Jayson Tatum look like locks for reserves. Zach LaVine has been playing his way into the ASG as of late. Jimmy Butler, though he's missed a lot of games, should be in due to his value to the Heat. Sabonis putting up good enough numbers to be in. Jaylen Brown will probably join Tatum. As a Knicks fan, I'll go with Julius Randle for the last spot."
Going for the deepest team cuz I’m building the team on 2k with no injuries and gonna see how it goes!  Starters: PG: John Wall ($15) SG: Klay Thompson ($16) SF: Demar Derozan ($13) PF: Christian Wood ($13) C: Nikola Vucevic ($17  Bench: PG: Terry Rozier ($6) SG: Collin Sexton ($14) SF: Andrew Wiggins ($9) PF: Julius Randle ($6) C: Clint Capela ($9)  Roster Fillers: Kevin Knox: ($1) Isaiah Thomas: ($1)
We got the same top 5. Except I think you forgot Julius Randle

Julius Randle
"Yes, Julius Randle is doing well, but this isn’t even a sample size problem - it’s completely cherry-picked and relies on the fact that Randle plays a shitload of minutes on a .500 team in the East.  AD has been injured and is the 2nd guy on an actual championship team in the West while Randle is sharing the ball on a .500 team in the East with RJ Barrett and Elfrid Payton.   Per 36: AD 24.7 Randle 22.6  Joel Embiid is playing 32 mpg.   Per 36: Embiid 12 Randle 10.8  Lillard attempts 2.4x more 3’s a game on a team where he basically goes down in a hail of gunfire every night.  Is it more valuable when someone plays more minutes?   Absolutely.  Will AD and Embiid play Randle’s minutes in the playoffs?  Yes."
CJ for Julius Randle and D Rose?
He's Julius Randle with flea bounce
"This is simply not true, Ingram improved every year but Lebron joined the team that stunted his growth.   Lonzo Ball improved as well yearly.  Julius Randle improved a lot his last year with lakers.   Larry Nance was developed nicely   Jordan Clarkson was solid   Etc."
"Gg sir Julius Randle, daddy’s back."
"I'll probably get some downvotes for this but I think we're seeing one of these seasons from Julius Randle right now. I don't watch a ton of knicks games so take what I say with a grain of salt but I feel like this is more of a career season for him rather than him turning a corner. Hes not a bad player by any means, but I'll be shocked of he keeps up this level of play next season or beyond"
"Lakers fall to 7th seed, and lose the 1st play in to the Warriors.  Barely scrap by the Grizz after Caruso strips Ja when he's pulling up for the winning three after LeBron misses an easy floater that would've put the lead to four.  Be 8th seed lose first two games to Jazz. TheyJustAren'tThatGoodAnymore.jpg. Jazz get obliterated games 3-6 as LeBron channels his ultimate form  the fusion from the 2012 Celtics series and 2016  finals to unlock LeExodia.   Roll and Smoke the Nuggs in Denver. LeBron says ""Goodbye Old Friend"" to Chris Paul enroute to his match-up agaisnt the Knicks.   A grueling 7 game series occurs and the score is 91-90 Lakers with 5 seconds to go as Julius Randle sets the pick to free up a drive for the resurgent Rose. Lebron breaks free from the pick to block the layup but sage mode Rose knows LeBron is hot on his tail and adjusts but so does LeBron. The ball gets out of Rose's hands in time but will it be blocked or will it kiss the twine and finally break the Knicks 37 year championship drought? Find out next this July"
Why would you use your cap space on a Julius Randle backup
Julius randle by far
"Randle, all day everyday. Main reasons: 1) Clutch  2) Has a much more consistent 3pt shot 3) better facilitator and leader 4) left handed 5) less injury prone   Julius is having a MVP caliber year. He’s definitely not the MVP of the season but he has some argument there on why he could be considered at the very least.   Note: I am a Raptors fan and I have been a Randle fan since his RY with Lakers."
yeah or maybe julius randle joining the team and playing like one of the best players in the league helped a lot as well.
“Old enough to be his dad”  Boogie Cousins: 30  Julius Randle: 26
Julius Randle is doing better this season than Julius Randle with hops

I almost choke when i saw ppl ranking Julius randle higher than lillard in the top 25 list..
"Coaching change as well lol  Julius randle also took a huge step forward in development, while handling being the teams star very well. He went from being hated by the fans last year to absolutely beloved and will never be forgotten as a Knick. We love and appreciate hard work so much"
"I'd rather have Randle than AD, but that's just because his ascension this season has made him an important Knicks symbol, and he's the centerpiece of the current roster. If I was a fan of any other team and got to choose one of them it's obviously AD every time. (Sorry King Julius)"

Unironically get out of every basketball related discussion in your life if you ever for a moment thought Julius Randle was better.
*Knicks have home court advantage with Julius Randle as their best player and a potential ALL-NBA guy.  The Randle part is just as crazy.
Dude we all know that Julius Randle is better than the both of them.
Multiple people in that thread unironically were saying they would rather have Julius Randle than Anthony Davis.   It feels like a significant portion of this sub doesn't watch basketball.
But would y’all rather have him or Julius Randle? 🤓🤓🤓
r/nba acting like Julius Randle is a better player was the last straw
I remember when calling Zion 'Julius Randle with hops' last season was a dig at Randle.  Funny how things pan out
He’s passed Julius Randle for sure
Max FMVP Julius Randle too
We coulda kept Julius Randle and Clarkson and Ingram. Sigh
Randle = Orange Julius
Julius Randle going HAM.   Mad respect he changed his physique so he can be a more fluid scorer.  Some of the games he's closed and shots he's hit under pressure have been damn near superstar level plays lately.
"It's just cheap circlejerking and actually the same shit that fans here get irate about that Lakers players get a lot of press. Then this nephew using the Lakers for the same shit. Lakers season has been bad, all our fans know that and title hopes are still there but it's very slim. But the Knicks arent our rival, they arent a team we play 4 times a year and besides Julius Randle, there is really no connection between the two at all."
"We are the most valuable team in the nba and one of the most valuable teams in sports period but we’ve been the laughing stock of the nba for years. Consistently making bad moves, bad draft picks and just being bad. We were the go to team when making a joke. In 2019 we drafted RJ Barrett with the 3rd pick in the draft and we signed Julius Randle who was never considered that good of a player. Recently, Julius Randle has made an insane jump and he’s become an allstar this season. Our team isn’t as good as others but we play hard defense and hustle harder than every other team and we’ve surpassed expectations. We have a few young players with potential, rj barrett, Immanuel Quickley we drafted with the 25th pick, Mitchell Robinson, Obi toppin he’s a high flyer dunker. And we have good vets, Derrick Rose was one of the best young players in the nba and would probably be an all time great but injuries ruined his career. This year he has been really good but in his prime before the injuries he was a top 10 player in the nba. Julius Randle is our teams leader. New York has two teams, us and the nets. The nets are one of the best teams in the league but most New Yorkers don’t really like them. We also play in Madison square garden.   Here are some videos about us currently   https://youtu.be/CDPJ2hlboAM  https://youtu.be/KvODVmmraZU   Here’s one of our best games this season   https://youtu.be/qRNZ7qaIwu8    Here’s a video about why we have been so bad throughout the years    https://youtu.be/TjmtQ-oee9E"
Whatever you gotta keeep telling yourself bruh. That other basketball team getting all the stars while you’re gonna max Julius randle lmao
"""We out.""  \~ Julius Randle, after drilling the clutch shot against PG, giving the Knicks an 8-point lead with under 40 seconds left."
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
Jordan was too SCARED to ever play in the Big Apple! Along with that COWARD LeBron James!! Guys like JULIUS RANDLE are just built different!!!
"Are you freaking kidding me!? Jordan arguably one of the greatest NBA players to ever live, the man changed sports, he is just no Julius Randle and there is no shame in that."
Julius Randle is a family man with a loving wife and kid and mj is a gambling addict. Randle all day
"1. Julius Randle.  He’s risen to a whole new level this season that I didn’t think he had in him going into the year. When we signed him I hoped we were getting an all star and he’s proven to be even more after a rough first year.  2. RJ Barrett.  He quietly improved on both sides of the ball significantly, and after today he raised his season 3P% to 40%. Still a teenager as well 3. Mitchell Robinson.  Even though he’s been hurt the majority of this season, he’s so important for us. If we had him this year, we’d be even scarier. Noel is locking his position down for us and he’s the 5th most important Knick imo.   The other honorable mention in 4th is D Rose, he just proved how clutch he is and how good he is at his role. I think that he will be a legit 6MOTY contender next year if we resign him. He should be a Knick for life imo.   Also, I think Westbrook is definitely 2 or 3 on the wizards despite his age and contract because I think his play is what’s carried the wizards down the stretch here. Plus if you look at it the other way, he could end up in a future trade if his play continues to bring wins, as teams will take the contract."
I fucking love Julius Randle
Julius Randle is great and I’m still confused as to how.
Dražen Petrović was really stinky according to Reggie Miller. Julius Randle looks like he smells

"Julius Randle and Derrick Rose presents: “The 2021 NBA Champions, The New York Knicks”"
"Everytime I've seen him play, that mid-range step-back that Julius Randle has is just completely unguardable. He'll just hit that shit over absolutely any defender in the league, even when you know it's coming."
Rooting for the clippers but I've been loving Julius Randle
Julius Randle and curry
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"Yeah, the grizzlies suck too. At least they have a future that isn’t dependent on one season of Julius Randle 😂"
I think Julius randle going god mode is to thank for that
The funny part is it can be argued that he’s still no better than Julius Randle
"My only problem with it is the knock on effect of manipulating it to put both of them on 1st team when the rest of the league isn't getting the same benefit. There's already like 10 guys competing for the 6 F spots giving one of those to Embiid or Jokic means one of those guys that deserve it won't make an all-NBA team while someone who probably shouldn't like Capella or Bam will make 3rd team center.  To me, the 'injustice' of having Embiid 2nd team is a lot less than someone like Julius Randle (or whoever) missing out on all-NBA altogether."
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
Both in the case of Julius Randle. Jury is out on KPJ. Does the usage make him better in the long run in terms of making himself a starter/fringe all star guy or does it stunt his growth as a basketball player not knowing how to play without the ball in his hands all the time?
"You had me until you said Bam is better than Randle, clearly you are a big heat fan😂 if Jimmy Buckets and Bam are so good why are they 6th in the EAST... Julius Randle is leading the Knicks with little to no help. Bam looked fucking lost out there when Jimmy and Dragìć were hurt. Speaking on this season only Randle &gt;&gt;&gt; Butler and Bam. You need to watch some more NBA buddy"

"Agreed - Julius Randle? Hmph, damn he’s put in the work like a champ"
"Yeah, I tend to do that as well. However, I cast that aside when the person I responded to said that Julius Randle is better than Russ. Which literally cannot even be a discussion unless we talk about the current season."
Julius Randle literally this year?
"He’s still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he’s a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can’t do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to “they want to speed up the pace.” That’s true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
"You just can't jump him in with people LeBron, Luka, and Giannis, as he is tier or more lower in his overall scoring package.  Yes you can build a team around him.  I could also build one around like Siakam or CJ McCollum with the right role players.  The Knicks are having a damn good season with Julius Randle as their best player who is probably outside the top 25 himself.  Roster optimization can do a lot.  The question is why would you want to do that and how many other players would you rather have without knowing any of the rest of your roster.   Like I said, I think that number is around 40.  I also think you're handwaving three importance of shooting because it's convenient.  First, there is a major difference between decent but unremarkable shooters like Shake and high-gravity shooters like Seth.  If there weren't then it would be so expensive to get extremely one dimensional players like Bertans.  It's never going to be a reasonable thing to say ""eh you can always get shooting"".  You can always get replacement level shooters like Garrett Temple but that's not really enough especially when you have a centerpiece like Simmons.  Which is why the 76ers arguably downgraded in overall talent to upgrade their shooters.  They want to need to cover his weaknesses in order to make him somewhat close in performance to what they've invested in him."
"I think Zach Lowe has touched on this multiple times on podcasts, including recently with David Thorpe and Howard Beck, but I do think it's interesting to define what really is the *most improved.*   G-league/bench player to NBA starter? Ex: someone like Donovan Graham last year  Negative player to All-Star? Ex: maybe Trae Young rookie to sophomore year, or Julius Randle/Zach LaVine this year  All-Star to best player on a championship team? Jokic this year"
"I hate the 'best player on the best team' idea. It's BS that completely dismisses the huge contributions that team mates and coaches have made to a players season.  It's literally called the most VALUABLE player award not the most successful player award. So I'm looking at guys that have had the most impact raising the level of their team. I want to see wins, but I'm weighing up wins that the player made happen. Not necessarily in terms of 'scored the winning bucket' but in terms of the team would be 30 wins worse without this guy. They should be putting up impressive counting stats and elite advanced stats. Historically good, record breaking seasons should count for something, but I don't think that should be the most important part.   So the main criteria I'd look at include:  This guy single handedly changed the fortune of his team. (See: Steph Curry, Julius Randle)  This guy elevated the guys around him. (See: Chris Paul, Lebron)  This guy was a nightmare for the opposition to deal with. (See: Giannis, Embiid)  I think the guy is Jokic. He might not be unequivically first in any one of those metrics, but he's near the top of all them. He's putting up jaw dropping stats and the advanced metrics are more impressive. The teams success shows that they're not hollow. He sets the table for his team, but also sets the tone and is their leader when it matters."
"Oh so me thinking that Julius Randle is not better than KAT is a controversial subject? The guy who average more points,rebounds and on better efficiency has to be worse because he has a shit team? Otherwise I only commented on Randle's minutes but keep projecting your own insecurities on me."
No I think that nobody in a random thread in 2021 about Julius Randle or something fucking cares about what wrongs Butler and Thibs committed in Minnesota.
"No, it should be Julius Randle"
Because the MIP is given to a player who goes from a nobody to a near all star.  Like Julius Randle this season.
Hopefully he keeps up with his fitness with the long off season.  Well maybe not so long with the Olympics and him presumably playing in it.  Julius Randle may be second in that stat because hes only missed one game this year.
"The difference is the whole circumstances, Cp3 is only being considered because of injuries to all the other candidates for mvp meanwhile the race last season was already decided like 2 months into the season since bron and Giannis never got hurt and harden was playing out of his mind. If kawhi, Embiid, kd, harden, etc didn’t get hurt we wouldn’t be talking about Cp3 as an mvp candidate at all. I mean look at the jazz who had the number one record in the league this season, who had any of their players in mvp consideration?? If Cp3 went down today the media would be creating a Julius Randle for mvp narrative next"
Lord knows I love Julius Randle… but the gap between him and Jokic was ultra clear tonight. There’s no way he shouldn’t get it.

Me too! Drafting Julius Randle in the 8th round and Jaylen Brown in the 4th really put me on top this year.
"I agree, as a pels fan I saw this in Julius Randle already. Matter of fact he even had Elfrid Payton on that pels team too. Randle was putting up All NBA numbers the 2nd half of that season, just imagine had the Pels kept him and it was Zion and Randle playing down low with Ingram at SF. That would've been a dangerous team."
He wanted to send a message to Knicks fans who were chanting MVP for Julius Randle
"Knicks swept the series in the regular season. Julius Randle has been going on a tear lately and they currently as of the last 10 games have the #1 defense in the league. They’ve been top 10 defensively for a majority of the season. It would be a good series, but to say that the Hawks have it easily is a gross underestimation of the knicks. Either way tho whoever makes it out of that series is not making it past the 2nd round (barring any major upsets in the 1st)."
Idk but Julius Randle scares me
Hawks over Knicks in 5???? We 3-0 them and Julius Randle averages like 37/12 against them this year bro
We also wanted Julius Randle traded at the start of the season 🤡
Julius randle is the greatest shooter of all time
Julius Randle  Derrick Rose  Russell Westbrook  Steph Curry  Carmelo Anthony (forever)
Julius randle
"What, you think AD has regressed over the last couple of years while still in his 20s?  Or are you just attaching all of the weight in your comparison to their current scoring averages?  Like seriously dude there is so much more to basketball then the number of points a guy scores and the percent of the time it goes in. It’s just such a casual way of analyzing the game. And comparing him to AD in an injury riddled and incomplete season when we fully know what AD is capable of at full strength and in the playoffs is intentionally disingenuous.   Zion is not “so much better” on offense than Davis, and he certainly isn’t leagues ahead of him as an all around player. Zion shoots an unheard of amount of layups. I’m not saying that detracts from his game, it’s incredible how he’s able to score at the rim with such consistency, but it explains his higher efficiency. ADs ability to score from outside hurts his efficiency but is also very valuable for the offense and the teams spacing.   Why do you think the lakers are the best defensive team in the league while the Pel’s are one of the worst? ADs defensive ability really plays no factor for you? It’s silly.   Calling Zion the primary focus on defense to try and imply that AD is just a “second option” is also hilarious. Teams game plan for Lebron and AD. Not Lebron and then that guy who scores less often.   Zion is having the better season. He is not the better player. Julius randle is also having a better season than AD, but no he’s not better than him."
"You definitely can use different periods of time to debate talking points, especially with something as subjective on who is a better player in a specific sport. For example, Julius Randle is having a better season statistically than Kawhi but that doesn’t mean he is a better basketball player."
And the answer is Julius Randle. Are people not understanding this award?
"wasnt hard, just had to randomly scroll down and there was already a bad take  julius randle got MIP locked up even if he died today. sorry bud. get fucked"
Julius Randle said hi
Would Julius Randle beat Andrew yang for NYC mayor?
I hope their past those days of giving players big deals who don't deserve it. The only max that should come is to julius Randle
Julius Randle is Buddy Hield confirmed
"I dunno about that.  LeBron, Harden, Embiid, Giannis, Curry, Kawhi, AD, KD, I think there is zero argument those 8 are above him.  And then Dame, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Doncic, those 5 it's kind of a longshot argument, but at least I can say you're not crazy I guess.   That's 13 guys total I just don't think you can honestly argue against being better.   Now here's a thing, at this point you can argue the group, you COULD say he slots in 14 or 15, but you could also argue he doesn't: PG, Booker, CP3, Tatum, Brown, Mitchell, Zion, Lavine, Julius Randle, Ja Morant, John Wall. Again, I'm not saying these guys are all above him at all, I'm saying you can pick 2 of these guys above Beal, and it's reasonable. Personally, I'd say PG and Booker, and honestly the Boston Jays, are probably better. A lot of people still believe in CP3, I think he's a fine player but I would have Beal over him, and I don't trust Wall healthy or not above him either. I'd be truly surprised if within 2 years Randle, Ja and Zion aren't better than him too.   But nobody seems to think Morant is good this year so maybe I'm crazy on that at least, I never see anyone mention him on here."
JULIUS RANDLE: Second team All NBA
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
"“If I’m Julius Randle, I’m gonna try to break that record”"
The straight up disrespect Julius Randle is getting is insane
"I'd also pick PG over Randle, mainly due to team record but when I looked at the stats they're much closer than I realised.      If you look at their totals this season, Julius has more points, rebounds, assists, only 2 fewer blocks and only 4 fewer steals."

If the Knicks make the playoffs Julius Randle should make All NBA 3rd team too  ^ducksandruns
Julius Randle
"When the Sixers play the Knicks, I just want Embiid to go, ""my name is Joel Embiid, and Julius Randle is the ------------- truth. Don't take nothing out. Julius Randle is the truth."""
Julius Randle is closer to an MVP than Jimmy
"Yup, I also floated the idea of a CJ McCollum for Julius Randle trade one time and a bunch of knicks fans came at me saying Randle is ""far better than CJ"" and acting like I just suggested that they trade us their best player for a bench warmer.  It's almost impossible to get any unbiased analysis here"
"Julius Randle has played 39 games (all games) and y’alls record is 20-19, Jimmy had played 24 games and his record is 16-8. It’s obvious that when Jimmy plays 39 games he’s going to have a way better record than Randle. That’s the whole premise, Jimmy’s pushes this team to contention, without him they’re a clear cut lottery team without picks."
By your logic Julius Randle is a frontrunner for MVP then so I'll take it
"You named a bunch of Julius Randle level ""stars"""
"&gt;	The big 3 of the Knicks RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Immanuel Quickley  Might be my favorite title here ever."
THE OFFENSE IS BETTER WITHOUT PAYTON. RJ IS AN ELITE FINISHER. LEBRON IS THE JULIUS RANDLE OF THE WEST. QUICKLEY IS THE BEST POINT GUARD WE’VE DRAFTED SINCE CLYDE.
Honestly idk what’s more surprising: this is only the 2nd player with multiple triple doubles in a season since 1988 or that Julius Randle only has 2 triple doubles this season
"With all due respect, Julius Randle is the truth. Mama, there goes that man."
Julius ‘triple double’ Randle
The modern era waters everything down.  Julius Randle is averaging almost 23 11 and 5 lol.  It’s too much.
Randle retires as the all time scoring leader for the Detroit Pistons at age 45.  Lebron james takes multiple years off with league permission at the end of this current contract. But it’s made clear he’ll come back and sign with whatever team draft’s his son. Ends up retiring at 47 but bronny jr never could beat Julius.    Kawhi Leonard doesn’t retire but instead just sorta will show up randomly on random teams for the next 50 years.   Durant? Durant got really into the 60s and no one ever saw him again.
Media gonna do their absolute best to shaft him - euro white guy in a small market? ESPN gonna have Stephen A Smith do three weeks on Julius Randle MVP to block it
Julius Randle. No questions.
"Teams can't get away with having two slow bigs on the floor on defense because they get abused on switches, and on offense it's hard to play with two non-shooters.   ""Traditional"" power forwards can succeed at the 4 if these weaknesses are accounted for. Giannis is great at defending perimeter players, and on offense they have Brook Lopez to space the floor. Sabonis has spacing around him for days. Dudes like Julius Randle, Lauri Markkanen, and Dario Saric are knockdown shooters and good enough ball handlers so they fit well into modern offenses.  The PF position isn't dead, but those who can't shoot and/or defend the perimeter just get run off the court in the playoffs."
"Ad should qualify as a Pf imo. We also have Julius Randle , Domantas Sabonis , Christian Wood is rising , if Jerami Grant plays Pf then he is also a rising star but yeah still not as much power in it."
Tatum? Jerami Grant? Julius Randle? Zion? Siakam?
Exactly 🙃 we're literally immune to shit talk. What damage can y'all do with words that the Knicks haven't already done with ACTIONS my guy. 😭 Okay PTSD is kicking in give me a moment to breathe.. gotta count to 5 and say Julius Randle in between each number.
I get called an N word all the time in 2k lobbies despite not being black. Or if I make a player that isn’t white they say some nasty things too. Like damn dude I just wanted to make a Julius randle build or a Shaq build.
Using DWS as a measure of defense pretty much says you don’t know what you’re talking about. Julius Randle is 4th in the NBA in DWS. Jokic is 6th.

Julius Randle is the greatest player of all time
"On a broadcast, his name was put as Jason Hart, so that’s where Jason comes from. Barkley comes from Julius Randle saying he’s “their own Charles Barkley” because he was such a good rebounder for a guard"
"I’d be absolutely shocked if he was ever nearly that level as a defender. I could see him becoming a slightly better version of Julius Randle on that end, but I don’t think he’s got the length or lateral quickness to really make an impact defensively. If he can end up not being a net negative on that side of the ball, I figure that’s a good improvement."
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
"Julius randle was booed by the fans too. Did he request a trade? No he worked his ass off in the off season to make sure he wasn’t booed again. Also it’s not like he was a superstar that has given his all for this franchise. If he was James harden wanting out of Houston that’s different. He didn’t even give us a chance really to build a great team around him. Every time we tried and looked like we might be decent and make the playoffs, he would get injured and we’d end up with a mid lottery pick."
Then he would be Julius Randle!
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
I was more so thinking Aldridge for Julius Randle
E-M-B-I-I-D?????   that's a funny fucking way to spell Julius Randle AKA Orange Julius AKA Beyblade
"&gt;Julius has carried his team to a winning record so far  To 1 game over .500 in the weaker conference. They aren't an elite team or anything.   Besides the Knicks are winning because of defence, not as much to do with offence. So while Randle is the big driver of that offence, the offence isn't actually very good (23rd). On the other hand, he's no longer a negative on defence, but he isn't the driver of that success on that end (2nd), which in turn is the driver of their win total   If the Knicks defence was instead 10th, a level more befitting Randles actual output, then the team would be 10th and we wouldn't be having this conversation"
Yeah that one is for Julius Randle
Julius Randle. Big slashing playmaker.
Julius Randle with hops
"God, I’m terrified that Julius Randle is going to drop 30/20/10 on our heads when we play. Y’all need to just leave us alone haha"
"Bam is criminally high on this list. Above Brandon Ingram, Vuc, Julius Randle, Ja and SGA? Cmon"
"That's also because of pace, 3's, spread floor, and teams playing more offence through fewer players  I think the league has a heap of talent right now, but I don't think Julius Randle would be the 6th best player in the league in 1995"
"I replied to another guy with my take on Vuc and Sabonis - they're pretty similar but I'd give Vuc a small advantage as the Magic team around him is ass.   Zion I think is the better player and having a better season, Randle is a great player but a healthy Zion seems unstoppable. Their numbers this year aren't that far apart besides Rebounds and Assists.  With the two heat players - Randle has better statistics than them but the impace Bam and Butler have outshine Randles better numbers in my eyes. Health is a factor that goes sides with Randle but also an explanation for the heats worse than expected record.  Again, Statistically Julius is better in some areas than Tatum, Brown and Mitchell but I'd say those three are a level or two above Randle quite comfortably."
"I would also prob put him over CJ.  CJ was nuts when he was healthy, but that was such a small sample size and it's a big outlier in terms of his career numbers. If CJ is actually that good, he's better than Randle.   That said, I still think I'd take Randle right now for the rest of the season. Both Julius and CJ are way over performing their career numbers, but I'd put more faith in Julius maintaining his level because he's healthy and CJ isn't."
"I agree Vuc, Sabonis and Randle are all pretty similar, I'd put Vuc a bit above the others though. The Magic are absolute trash already but without Vucevic i'd say they'd have about 5 wins.  In regards to Zion, Julius does put up better numbers in some areas but Zion looks unstoppable when he plays and still has very nice numbers to go with it.  I know you're not OP but that's only two with a strong case and one that we disagree on which is not even half of 7"
"When Julius Randle is putting up stats only comparable to Larry Bird's, you know the league has changed."
These knicks fans need to relax on the Julius Randle hype.
Hit me up when Julius Randle has 11 all-star selections and 2 rings and we can talk about who is better.
"Still remember some guy said Julius Randle is playing better than any season Bosh ever had, pure disrespect."
"I wonder what the average improvements of stats are on the MIP winner per year  Julius Randle is at +3.7 points +1.4 rebounds and +2.4 assists.  Jerami Grant is at +11.4 points, +1.8 rebounds and +1.7 assists.  To me, MIP is the least of all the awards to have team record weighed in."
Julius Randle. I would never want him on my team but his balling out this year.
"&gt;He pleaded for Rose to offer long-term deals to free agents such as Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris and Bogdan Bogdanovic. He wanted to trade for Derrick Rose, a longtime favorite of his.  Ok not that bad but I can see the reasoning  &gt;He thought RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson could potentially be flipped for seasoned veterans. Initially, he was hardly sold on Julius Randle, according to a colleague.  Alright Thibs relax..."
Julius Randle showing once again that you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain lol.
That’s the dude that didn’t vote Julius Randle for most improved player on his ballot.

*Julius Randle enters the chat*
They need to blame LeBron for it. He’s playing like Julius Randle rn
"Lol I’m old enough to understand that you don’t understand what whataboutism is.   &gt; Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position **by charging them with hypocrisy** without directly refuting or disproving their argument.  My comment lacked an assertion of hypocrisy and I wasn’t avoiding the point. The objective was to illustrate that this wasn’t an isolated incident.   With respect to your “explanation” not being a justification, that’s a bullshit cop out. Your “explanation” is literally [a copy/paste of the excuse Randle gave to justify his foul on Gallo in his postgame presser](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2021/05/julius-randle-flagrant-danilo-gallinari-hawks-reggie-bullock-knicks-game-4/amp).  [Gallo barely shoved Bullock in the paint](https://twitter.com/MikeVorkunov/status/1399117123516088327?s=20). That shit was soft as fuck and literally happens every possession."
"#DAILY REMINDER THAT CHRIS HAYNES WAS THE ONLY PERSON NOT TO HAVE JULIUS RANDLE ON ANY OF HIS PLACES FOR MOST IMPROVED PLAYERR THIS SEASON   actually, seeing how randle has played this offseason, he may have been on to something"
cant wait for the Knicks to max Julius Randle
Anyone seen Julius Randle? That’s how I feel.
"When your young ass team led by your 22 superstar pg is 1 win away from winning there first series you have a right to be cocky. Especially after NY was talking all that shit about Julius Randle this Julius Randle that, Traes gonna get clapped. Take that 27 &amp; 10 and L tomorrow and shove it up the a**"
But Bullock ran to the other teams bench when everyone knew he wasn't going to do anything. Julius Randle was getting high-fives from all his teammates for getting at Gallo even though they were down big. And Randle *did* say Gallo was dirty so thats something you should take note of.   In the end you have Clint calling them dirty and Randle saying Gallo was dirty. Seems even to me.
Yea I realized how good he was when Minnesota went to the playoffs and remembered how hard it was to score on him and now years later he's doing the same to Julius Randle
Nobody is intimated by freaking Julius 'trashass' randle man. Most overrated player in the league foh.
"It's because they were 35-47 the year before with similar young core minus a mediocre Julius Randle, and everyone thought Lebron would have a record better than 28-27 on his 55 games, which is btw far from an 8th seed in the West. Steph has a 37-26 record with the Warriors this season."

"As a nuggets fan it’s been mpj, unfortunately. Then also definitely julius randle."
"agreed man, the pelicans only gave AD the best two-way guard in the game, the best centre in the league at the time that was one of the few perfect fits next to AD at the 4, then only Julius Randle and Nikola Mirotic fuck those guys and the Pels for deciding to surround AD with idiots."
"The NBA almost certainly restricts those rights, though - like “by agreeing to host NBA games you agree not to bar players from entering the arena.” Otherwise you’d have MSG ‘exercising its legal right’ to ban Trae from playing there since he was dominant in his two games there, or State Farm ‘exercising its legal right’ to prevent Julius Randle fro- oh wait bad example"
Julius Randle
whats a post-game beer to the face when you are dodging bricks from Julius Randle for 42 minutes?
I don’t think so at all. People are just seeing them play a playoff team led by Derrick rose and Julius Randle. I think you’re going to absolutely manhandle them.
"I honestly don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with making literally anything about Julius Randle into a statement about fucking Pascal Siakam. No one's talking about your guy, relax. This is the pettiest, most cringe response possible"
If Julius Randle was going against a proven veteran team it'd he different.  He would get slack but it's another young team with even less experience than the Knicks because Rose and Taj been their.  Outside of Clint no one on ATL has gone far.
"I really think this team needs to see what it has in RJ by giving him the keys next season. He shows flashes of ability at being the primary ball handler but Randle has taken that role (rightfully) this season. I'm eternally grateful for what Julius has done for this franchise this season but I'd be fine letting him get the bag somewhere else and starting RJ, IQ and Obi next season. Even if it meant we'd take a step back in the standings initially."
"Unless prime rose makes Reggie Bullock and Julius Randle shoot better than 14/57 on open shots, I will still take the Hawks."
"Lol I still like our team and we just have a different energy when our team does well wtf is wrong with that?! Hawks haven’t exposed shit lol they’ve just been playing as a more complete team. If Julius Randle wakes up, this is a completely different series."
"On one hand, you gotta fight back for your teammate after Gallo elbowed him hard in the back (especially after Bullock has had back issues and surgeries before!!! — Could’ve possibly been a targeted thing honestly which would be unreal bs).   On the other hand this is the immaturity we’ve seen in the past from Julius Randle and it damn well didn’t help our cause; especially for this game.   In all, maybe it can help give us an edge at least but just not great to see after he’s played so poorly.  Knicks in 7"

Instead, they somehow get to play a team led by Derrick Rose and Julius Randle as the 5 seed"

Julius Randle was the key to shutting down Julius Randle
"***All-NBA 1st Team***      C: Nikola Jokic      F: Joel Embiid      F: Giannis Antetokounmpo      G: Luka Doncic      G: Steph Curry      ***All-NBA 2nd Team***      C: Rudy Gobert      F: Julius Randle      F: Zion Williamson      G: Damian Lillard      G: Chris Paul      ***All-NBA 3rd Team***      C: Bam Adebayo      F: Kawhi Leonard      F: LeBron James      G: Jimmy Butler      G: Paul George"
Julius Randle
"I definitely agree that this isn't the same team, and saying ""this team"" probably was poor wording. Even so though, Julius was playing at a level that warranted an All-Star nod all season. Julius was playing at a level that warrants 2nd/3rd team All-NBA attention. He's been a good enough player this year that the Knicks shouldn't be getting this harshly outclassed in a 4/5 matchup. Collins was still the primary defender on Randle in the first 2 games where he went for 28 and 44, and Trae getting hurt in the 3rd game doesn't really affect Randle getting 40.   I think McMillan has you guys playing at a very high level and I'm totally comfortable saying the Hawks have been better than the Knicks for probably the last month and a half and definitely in this series. I think he's the number 1 reason behind Julius struggling. Of the 10 best players in the series, Hawks have had probably 8 (I think Rose and Taj make that list)."
&gt;fringe all star.  If only he was as good as Julius Randle
Siakam is a multi position defender. Julius Randle is being targeted on defense
I think you need to be more concerned on your team giving Julius Randle a max.
"I was hoping the 13-2 mash fest the Mets gave the Braves would motivate the Knicks, mostly Julius Randle, a little bit.  But nope.  The Knicks are playing the worst they played all year... Trae Young is a beast and killing us."
"Would be a great story line tbh. Especially if Julius Randle plays well, he won't be clowned for next season."
Lloyd Pierce donating his Julius Randle jersey to goodwill rn
Trae young is much better than Julius Randle. Trae showed up in the playoffs but Julius Randle who played poorly in the playoffs.
Trae Young and Julius Randle aren't the players we thought they were.
Julius Randle playoff special means they will end up down 20 instead of 10
lakers would have won this if AD didnt get hurt he was on pace for a julius randle playoff special
People really act like the Knicks aren't new to the playoffs in this past decade. To say Julius is a fraud after one series seems pretty extreme. The fact of the matter is without Randle we don't even sniff the playoffs. It's a learning experience and the more experience the team gets in the post season the better they will get.
Julius Randle is who we thought he was
Julius randle should be charged as a war criminal for how he’s playing.
"Great, having a third option that’s also an allstar opens up the floor for you immensely lol. He was on a team with 2 allstars with no expectations where he could just let them lead the way.   Again, you would’ve never said this 4 games ago, so chances are you shouldn’t let 4 games completely change your opinion. That’s why people say this sub is so reactionary, you would’ve been laughed at before the playoffs if you said Siakam was better than Randle.   That championship run is wholly irrelevant in the conversation. Put Julius Randle on a team with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry, they’d be just as good lol"
Julius Randle and RJ Barett are new Trash Bros
"There is no evidence julius randle is a good playoff performer based off of how shit he has been this year lol. At least Siakam had the bubble + he couldn’t practice in the 3 months due to strict canada restrictions. Randle has no excuse to not perform and no reason to believe he’d suddenly be great as a second option*(Siakam was the second scoring option to Kawhi, took more fga and averaged more points than Lowry). There’s plenty of stars that have underperformed as a second option(PG, Middleton, Westbrook), a star being shit as a first option still means they can be shit as a second option, difference is Siakam is really good as a second option."
Remember the threads saying that Julius Randle should be considered for MVP?
How does Julius Randle get ejected for an elbow but Gasol gets away with that. Lmao
Yeah man. I'm just paying homage to former Laker Julius Randle who has somewhat reverted back to his Beyblade ways
"His PPG dropped by 1/3.   It doesn’t matter anyway, Julius Randle this season averaged more points, rebounds, assists, a better FG%, a better 3PT%, better FT%, better TS%, like what more do you need."
"I doubt Julius Randle is going to get the same amount of hatred as Siakam did, considering he was a large part of this amazing Knicks season, regardless of how it ends in the playoffs.  I hope that Randle maintains this (regular season) form and that he continues to grow, the league is fun as hell when the Knicks are good."
Our 1st option is Julius Randle. You tell me which coach is going to make a deep run in the playoffs this way
Fr. It’s like when I see knicks flairs say “I can’t believe Julius was in the mvp conversation and he’s playing this bad smh…” like when the fuck was randle ever in the mvp discussion?
"Players didn’t magically regress, this is thibs not giving a single shit about offense all season and relying on Julius Randle ISO’s  and Rose floaters to get enough offense to win games in the regular season. That predictable offense will never fly in the playoffs, especially with the talent level of the Knicks. NY needs a good PG and wing scorer to handle the offense because thibs isn’t ever going to come up with anything creative on that end himself."
Someone needs to put this in the Julius Randle comment sections lol.
"Defense. Julius Randle is missing his shots because he wants to drive, but Hawks are doubling as soon as he touches the ball, and Clint Capela's interior D is killing the whole team's flow. Also, our 3 point shooters have fallen off a cliff, even with the limited shots they do take."
"We don’t have a lot of talent. It’s true. On paper our team is not great. Julius Randle is our most talented player, then it’s Derrick Rose. He’s good, but most teams that have D Rose as their second best player isn’t going as far as the Knicks have this year.   It’s not easy to keep up with a team like Atlanta that has offensive talent like they half do"
"Plus Julius ""Missing In Playoffs"" Randle cant shoot nor defend. Total embarrassment."
The Knicks are just offensively challenged. If Julius Randle is struggling then they don’t really have anyone else who can go and get their own bucket.
Julius Randle and KP on the same wavelength rn lmao
"the knicks were 23rd on offense with no spacing and this is despite julius randle seemingly making every shot he took. If he isn't playing well, their offense is just not gonna let them compete"
"You right, I edited my comment, he did come back in this game. Julius Randle though was just bad again"
"Julius Randle? Strange, I thought he changed his name to Randle Missfires 🤔"
Good thing those awards are on regular season and not post season. This isn’t some new thing being done just to protect Julius Randle lmao.

"Yup, Trae beat Julius Randle before Luka beat Kawhi"
he makes julius randle look like Jokic
"By Steph? Sure. Steph will cook anybody. However, Rudy is one of the best iso defenders against guards in the league.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/  “For the 2020-21 season, opponent possessions featuring an isolation with Gobert as the primary defender have yielded 0.779 points per chance. That’s fourth-lowest in the NBA among 66 players who have defended at least 125 isolations, per Second Spectrum data, trailing only Draymond Green, Richaun Holmes and Julius Randle — and a big improvement from earlier in Gobert’s career.   A half-decade-old viral clip of Steph Curry turning a younger Gobert around off the dribble has shown remarkable staying power; once or twice a game, some unsuspecting young guard gets Gobert on a switch and assumes it’s easy pickings, only to be rudely awakened to the reality.  Smarter offenses eschew the iso against Gobert, generally in favor of attempting to stretch him out utilizing modern spacing and shooting themes. A ball-handler who can pull up for three, a stretch big man or even both simultaneously can force contortions away from the Jazz’s preferred drop-big defense.  He’s improved here too, though, both in terms of effectiveness and willingness. Today’s Gobert will often play up higher in pick and rolls against known pullup aficionados like Damian Lillard or Devin Booker — but he also has the mobility to recover all the way back to the rim and put out any fires this increased floor space creates.”  Your narrative is way outdated."
Julius Randle is not a superstar holy shit pump the brakes
"Sometimes star players get shut down because the defense is game planning for them specifically. Like julius randle this year. Siakam in prior years. Embiid against Toronto. This happens every year and while concerning, it's understandable that a team game planning for a specific player can cause trouble.    Whats crazy about this series is the clippers didnt gameplan against KP. He was a complete afterthought in their defensive scheme treated no different then Dorian Finney smith. And he still couldn't score and looked completely lost.       Hes just not good"
Kawhi and PG vs Julius Randle and Drose
Trae Young turned into Julius Randle at the end of this game
the knicks best player is Julius Randle. Clippers have Kawhi
lol you really think the hawks can take the Clippers to 7 games in the first round? New York has fucking Julius Randle as their first option ffs
"Luka is an all-world player, but this summer should be about working on his endurance and conditioning. He looks like he slows down in second halves, a lot of players have transformed by adding muscle. Just look at Nikola Jokic and Julius Randle."
"Trae had to go against the Knicks, whose best player is Julius Randle  Luka had to go up against Kawhi Leonard. Now that is quite the obstacle"
you're talking like we didnt just see Julius Randle stink it up for 5 games straight   anything can happen
Ask postseason Julius Randle
Julius Randle gonna come in at the end of the series to cash in the Money in the Bank.
"I never compared Trae to LeBron, your reading comprehension is shit lmfao.  Regular season means nothing. The likes of KD, Giannis, Curry, Harden, Westbrook &amp; eventually Jokic won MVPs. However, LeBron was always considered top 1 player in NBA **only because of his playoff performances.**  Or Paul George. He treated as a meme player (Pandemic P &amp; Playoff P) due to his underwhelming playoff. performances. Julius Randle look good in regular season, but is viewed negatively after playing badly against Hawks.  A player's legacy &amp; his status in the ranking is based on that player's performances."
Wouldn’t be surprised if he does struggle. He’s had some of his best games against Philly in the past though and Simmons in general.  Playoffs are different. Julius Randle was prime MJ against us and you the world saw what we did to him so we can’t be sure Trae does well either based off regular season.
[KD banishes Julius Randle to the shadow realm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcEC5dHKTl4)
"Bron just lost to the fuckin Suns. Lue was the best assistant coach in basketball for years. He’s still a top X and Os coach. He makes great in bounds plays. What fucking world do we live in where his assistant gets credit for that series?   Thibs just led the Knicks to the playoffs for the first time in years. He did it with Julius Randle who the league forgot about, RJ Barrett, old ass D Rose who he got for a second and a bunch of toys everyone threw away.    That team lost in the playoffs. No shit. The Hawks were well coached and talented. Thibs put together an incredible coaching performance all year to pull that together as a 4 seed. At what point does winning more than losing matter? Just never? Only when a new flashy coach does it so we can shit on the old guard? So stupid"
Middleton and Julius Randle gonna meet up for some cocktails after the game
They said that about Julius Randle too
Yeah tell me how it worked out for him.  It doesn’t fly for Julius randle is my point. Based on the most recent evidence we have
I legitimately wouldn’t take Julius randle over any starting player on the hawks or the sixers. I do not care if he had a good year of hitting contested off balance fade away jumpers. Shit doesn’t fly in the playoffs
"And playoffs is the only time it matters. Can your player create that separation or make plays to score efficiently?   We saw Julius Randle who was great during the reg season take a step back in the playoffs, maybe it's experience but he might just be a mid level guy.   Unless you have great chemistry and real great superstar backups. I've seen two teams that I recall doing this and winning a championship, Spurs and Detroit."
"Please.. Trae has played in 5 playoff games and beat a Knicks team that struggled to score 100 points a game. Trae wasn’t the one locking up Julius Randle and forcing him to shoot below 30%. Luka is averaging 34/8/10 against the Clippers and is possibly also heading to the second round.   They’re both playing great in the playoffs, but it’s a small sample size thus far and Luka blows him out of the water in their first three regular seasons.  5 games of Trae doesn’t automatically jump him up to Luka’s level just because Luka had 1 bad game this series.  Trae is going to go from being guarded by Derrick Rose to being guarded by Ben Simmons this next series."
The knicks got fleeced because they lost hardaway jr and are now going to max julius randle.
So did julius randle. Randle made it over tatum I believe. I feel like it's not the best judge of overall talent.
Knicks were only 8 games away from winning the East with Julius Randle as their best player.  Anything can sound impressive if you word it correctly.
Cj for Julius randle- pretty equal players . Maybe Julius edges cj by just being a bit younger
"When your benchmark is Julius Randle, yeah it's fucking stellar."

Julius Randle as your best player will always be a 1st round exit.
"Yes, and we all know how regular season performance always perfectly correlates with playoff performance. Julius Randle just proved it after all."
Picks arent beholden to stuff like Julius Randle being unable to hit the broad side of a barn.
Why? He's incredible on offense and has an entire year under his belt of carrying a garbage team. I figured he would do great with the better defense in the playoffs because of that experience.  Julius Randle played great in the regular season but that was mainly because the knicks as a whole started hitting outside shots way better and he was hitting tons of tough shots. I didn't think he would play as horribly as he did but I thought the odds of him playing below his regular season level was much higher than Trae.
"Hey Chris. You’ve been to the highest pressure situations in your career, Specifically the rebound that you kicked out to Allen for the three to send Game 6 into overtime. How much of a factor is pressure to playoff performance? And how can a guy like Julius Randle learn to adapt to pressure?"
Trae shot less free throws than Julius Randle but go off I guess.
MVP for the hawks was Julius Randle
"did he though? i don't see nba champion julius randle anywhere.   he left cus he was looking to get paid.  so again, you don't think randle doesn't leave if the lakers signed paul george?"
Guys like Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry are the exception (and there's still a bit of a question mark on Randle after that series vs the Hawks imo)
"i mean he's 25, a lot of people thought Julius Randle was no good at 25 and then at 26 he became an All Star and won MIP. You can't make these statements about guys until they're heavy into their prime years, age 28+"
This but in all honesty what teams right now can offer trailblazers something better than Julius Randle + 4 1sts+ anyone else on the roster not named IQ or RJ while still doing right by Dame and sending him somewhere he’d conceivably want to go?  If Knicks got Dame and then somehow improbably get Kawhi in FA a lineup of Dame/RJ/Kawhi/Toppin/Mitch with Drose/IQ/Burks/Taj/Nerlens thats a top 3 team in the East
"Lakers got rid of Jordan Clarkson, Brandon ingram, Julius randle, Josh hart. Kept Kyle kuzma"
Hear me out maybe Kuzma pulls a Julius Randle and turns it around
"I mean statistically Julius Randle was better in the regular season by both WS and VORP.   But also AS is voted by position, Trae would’ve made it if it was positionless"
"That is not really true. Outside of Derrick Rose, who Lillard would replace, the Knicks team was pretty bad in the playoffs. In a vacuum Julius Randle is better than any of the Blazers players individually, but that's not really an ideal supporting cast. Also are we even sure that Randle is going to keep up his anomalous scoring rate?"
"that's not necessarily fair, all those guys were on a trajectory when they left. Randle and Ingram were both balling out in 2018 before LeBron came. Maybe not as much attention because of our losing record. Both of them, and Kuzma, averaged 16ppg. Randle went to New Orleans and stayed improving to 20ppg and now he's an All-Star. Ingram played with LeBron, averaged 18, got traded and became the #1 option and became an All-Star. We only had DLo for 2 seasons, he showed flashes but was still immature, he's an All-Star now. There's no reason to think these guys had they stayed together wouldn't have continued to grow.  Kuzma has struggled with his role. The 2018 Lakers never had a clear leader or alpha, that's why him, BI and Julius all played off each other. Then LeBron and the expectations come, not to mention Luke fucking playing him at center to start the season. Last year we trade all the young guys to get AD and suddenly Kuz was supposed to be the ""third guy."" I do admit though he has been disappointing. We do know he is kinda consumed with the lifestyle. A trade might actually be good for him if he goes somewhere where he has to actually focus 100% on basketball and less on IG hotties and what not"
Lmao you know we drafted Jordan clarkson and Julius randle right? Casual
"they beat the Knicks, theres no way Lebron is losing to Julius Randle and DRose"
Kuzma makes Julius Randle look like Jokic  Even he at least got to double digits!
"Quick reminder that this team had Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, and DeAngelo Russell and kept Kuzma 💀"
"Lol, worry about Julius Randle"
"He had a good first few years but all star is an absolute stretch, let alone a superstar. Julius Randle was the #7 (or was it 6?) pick and we were all SHOCKED at his all star play. Imagine if Kuz became a Lebron, Curry, KD, Harden, Kawhi type of player. It’s just an insane thought."
sure let's just look at media awards to rank players. sure wish trae was as good as julius randle but one player was an all star and the other wasn't
"Yeah. If you replace him with Julius Randle. I think with Embiid out, this is an even series."
Lebron out here looking like Julius Randle
Is anyone here acting like Julius Randle deserves better?
"i see a few people trashing CJ for 8-20...it’s actually not that bad, 40% from the field is not good but at least he’s not julius randle 29%"
"Ya’ll lost to the grizzlies and had prime Curry on your team 😂 Knicks won more games than the Warriors this playoffs and their best player was Julius Randle LOL   Warriors have one of the worst fanbases in the league. Full of bandwagoners and fair weather fans who only started watching basketball 4 years ago. Truly trash, casual fans"
stephen A was all of us this season  stage 1: fuck julius randle trade that bum ass wtf is this contract  stage 2: omg julius randle is the greatest player on earth  stage 3: cmon julius you gotta show up in the playoffs
"Randle regressed in the playoffs in more ways than one. Sure, his shooting touch was off but he seemed disconnected in many ways while DRose was putting up some amazing performances. He looked like the Julius Randle that was basically given up on by many. Maybe he gassed himself during the second half of the season putting up those great numbers that had Knicks fans hopeful for this postseason."
I'm gonna force you to watch Julius Randle highlights from the Hawks series as psychological torture.
If Nuggs lose I would trade Jokic for Julius Randle.
"we won 0, yall won 1, you need 4 to advance. we’re both home now. at least i have vivid memories or the heat making finals runs. now you gotta spend the offseason watching julius randle highlights or watch the nets takeover new york lmao"
"I mean we spent a lot of time trying to tell all yall that Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, D’Lo, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo were all great pieces to trade for but yall aint listen"
aight well in that case reggie bullock got thicc squat logs on his head. julius randle is neckless. *checks your team* heat got a team full of nickalodeon rejects and trae young is handsome
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
Id give up Julius Randle
S/O to whomever on here came up with Dubious Handle for Julius Randle
"Yeah you are rigth man, there isn't another player named Julius Randle that played for the Knicks in the 20/21 season and was a one year wonder.  So he should be ok next season and PO cause there is no precedent that can be compared.  Is that what you wanted to hear?"
Michael Jordan did it against Ewing and Starks. Trae Young did it against Julius Randle and Reggie Bullock lmao
Either way he would’ve been wrong because they didn’t call a flagrant on Julius Randle who threw a more egregious elbow literally hours before lol
"Everyone saying Randle wasn't that good when the guy was taking and making CJ McCollum type shots all year. If the Knicks are truly back, they're back because of Julius Randle and Derrick Rose."
"TBH the knicks overperformed all year, and reverted to expectations in the playoffs. The hawks underperformed all year, and reverted to expectations in the playoffs.   None of this is really surprising. The knicks are a young team minus a true superstar. Randle could get there if he keeps playing like he did all season, and develops his mental toughness and works his weaknesses during offseasons like he did last season, plus of course picks up his playoff production in future years. That may be a long time to wait though, so bringing in top talent now would definitely be helpful. RJ can't even drink legally, so give the boy some time.   Well you might say ""hey the hawks are just as inexperienced as the knicks, and they crushed you guys."" Sure. They also have a bona-fide superstar in Trae Young and that honestly makes all the difference for the whole team. Trae came out in game 1 and crushed it, plus a game winner. That kind of confidence *cannot* be understated and is contagious in the locker room. It was the opposite for the Knicks, with Randle's struggles being the contagion there.   Mike Breen said it best at the top of the MSG telecast last night, paraphrased: ""Some players come out in their first playoff experience and shine, some players take a little time to find their postseason extra gear, and some players never find it."" I just hope Julius Randle falls into category 2, while Trae is already category 1 there.   I honestly believe if the Knicks had somehow stolen game 1, this series would be headed to game 6 and it's a coin toss who would be up 3-2."
Julius Randle 8 turnovers 😭

When your best player is julius randle that's not a recipe for post season success
Trae Young rose to the occasion while Julius Randle got frustrated and didn't play at his best.
What a motherfucking fraud. He was most improved. Finally someone to look up to.  Now?  Julius Randle...I hope you get an anal fissure.
"Makes me think, did julius Randle hug anyone on the hawks?"
i mean good luck to julius randle but i dont see him ever averaging 30 in the playoffs
Julius Randle :(
" &gt;when literally you could’ve put Julius Randle on that team and it’d be the same result lol.   Except there's a thing called defense and it's important to winning a championship. Guess we didn't need to trade for Gasol either, since JV was scoring more. The drop off on the defensive end is fairly steep from Pascal to Randle."
Oh are we piling onto Julius Randle now?
"Yes because Randal wasn’t good until this year, obviously.  This whole discussion was on the ridiculousness of using Pascals ring as a reason why he’s better than Randal, when literally you could’ve put Julius Randle on that team and it’d be the same result lol. He was the third option and didn’t have the attention of the defense Because he was playing with a mega star and an allstar.   You’re a victim of recency bias. Pascal Siakam on the Knicks and they miss the playoffs or just make the play in"
RIP Beyblade Julius Randle
"Home Court Advantage is truly a ‘regular-season’ phenomena, like Julius Randle"
"They tried to make Julius ""better than Chris Bosh"" Randle a thing too"
Well we didn’t know Julius Randle was going toy run into the he worst player in the nav
How has KP only taken 5 shots? I was expecting to see some Julius Randle level efficiency but its hard to reach that level of bad when you've only had 5 shots
Kawhi just Julius Randle with big hands
"For all 5 games, I watched Julius Randle catch the ball at the elbow, face up and see a soft double from Capela, and then drive right into it anyways and turn the ball over. Holy shit.      Or instead, he'll catch a kick-out, and instead of taking the 1st option, the open shot, he pump fakes, drives into the clogged paint, and then turns it over again. Shades of 2019-2020 Julius Randle all series long.      I understand that McMilian schemed well for him, but Randle was in his own head all series long. He was so unwilling to take the easy shot, and every time wanted to create more unnecessarily. Part of being a star is knowing when to force shots and knowing when to take what the defense gives you. Randle spent the entire series forcing bad shots and horrible kick-outs, when he could've just caught it and shot it. Or swing the easy pass to the closest teammate; Not drive into a clogged paint to try and create a corner shot, and then turn it over again."
Ahhh. The true Julius Randle we've always known. I couldn't count on his lucky antics in the post season. Regular season is a whole different story.
Julius Randle talks a lot of shit for being ass.
"Utah's pretty good anytime they're picking outside the top 10. Stockton, Malone, Mark Eaton, Gobert, Mitchell, Millsap, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, CJ Miles, Mo Williams and the GOAT Andrei Kirilenko are all late first or second rounders.  But inside the top 10 they have a hard time. Dominique Wilkins was the third pick but didn't want to be in Utah. Thurl Bailey was good at seven. Deron Williams was really good but they could have had CP3. Hayward was a good pick at 9 but they could have had PG13. Kanter was picked ahead of like 3 or 4 potential HOF players, and Exum was a gamble that made some sense but in retrospect was a waste of an opportunity when Marcus Smart and Julius Randle were the next two picks, and Jordan Clarkson - who the Jazz traded Exum for last season - was picked in the second round."
Don't disrespect Julius Randle by comparing him to LeBron
His numbers are just a shade better than Julius Randle right now.
"I’m a very casual Knicks fan, the Knicks need to lose games this year to get a better draft pick.    Sneaking into the playoffs being lead by Julius Randle does absolutely nothing for the franchise long term.   If this team was in Utah or Arizona, yeah that might fly. It’s not though"
"I don't blame Austin, he's supposed to be confident in his team.  The real idiots are the people here on r/nba talkin about ""are the Knicks legit?"" when they were 5-3 with a team built around Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton."
What? Julius Randle for sure carrying the Knicks out of the East
"So by luck you mean they made all the right moves, drafted very good players due to scouting and managed to put a competitive roster with no picks, which led to KD and Kyrie choosing the Nets over the obvious dumpster fire in the Knicks, which have been connected to every single free agent since the beginning of time and all they've gotten to show for it is Julius Randle?"
That was some Julius randle beyblade stuff
Julius Randle
Julius Randle has some of the most clunkiest 3 misses ever.
Julius randle looks like dollar general lebron.  Definitely some dope flashes
He resembles Julius Randle
"Nets really got KD, Kyrie and Harden just to stop Julius Randle"
"Julius ""KD"" Randle"
"Nah, now they can't stop the gawd julius randle in the paint gg no re"
Hes also better than Julius Randle.
"I hope this happens for 2 reasons.  1: KD Kyrie and Harden need to win. That's too good of a big 3 not to. After the next off season they may end up better than KD warriors.   2: The Nets were the laughing stock of the league after that Boston trade and they've done this. Knicks have Julius Randle, RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin. Everyone in the Knicks front office should just fire themselves."
Levert is older than Julius Randle.
Levert is older than Julius Randle.
Knicks getting cap filler to trade Julius Randle for harden?
"I feel like New York is still a team that would take a chance on Kyrie. What about something like this?:  * HOU receives: Caris LeVert, Julius Randle, Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, Brazdeikis, BKN 2021 1st Rounder, BKN 2023 1st Rounder, BKN 2025 1st Rounder, 2022 Pick Swap with BKN, 2024 Pick Swap with BKN, NYK 2021 1st Rounder  * BKN receives: James Harden, PJ Tucker  * NYK receives: Kyrie Irving  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y4ye7wuc  Brooklyn doesn't completely gut their roster and retains depth but they have no draft picks to trade for 5 years. New York gets a top 8 PG (when he plays) without giving up a core piece like RJ or Robinson. Houston gets younger good upside players who can contribute immediately or can be flipped for more picks.   Thoughts?"
"I think we should flip him too. John's role is starting to become limited here in Atlanta, Capela has sorta replaced him in the P&amp;R and Hunter and him basically have the same pull now. John isn't really agressive enough to get stats unless he's spoon fed or it's a Julius Randle type situation where you just pass him the ball and let him go to work. Onyeka will probably determine John's future in Atlanta. Onyeka projects to do a lot of the stuff Collins does (while on a smaller sample size) and to be a better defender and when you consider the fact that he isn't up for the max and chances are we won't have to give him one down the line if John's fit in Atlanta doesn't start to get better John will very quickly become and expandable piece in our rebuild, especially with hunter stepping up offensively. I'd love if we could get John for a two way star to put next to Trae though, a guy like Siakam makes this team really dangerous even if we'd have to overpay to get him, but it's unlikely."
He would be our best player. To trade for Tobias Harris I am pretty sure we would have to send out Julius Randle in order to fit his salary. Flipping Randle  for Harris would help with the spacing but right now Randle is our best passer and our offense goes through him. We would rely more on Payton to set players up.
And its julius randle
"Same bro last year took me wayyy back mentally but we gotta bounce back lets not let these times take away our happinees find the joy in the little things, like julius randle perfecting the beyblade"
"a knicks fan that gets it. Julius randle/elfrid payton/austin rivers arent gonna do shit for your franchise long term. them overachieving and leading you to the 8 seed hurts you. Making the 8 seed is only good if its your young guys leading the way with some vets, not flawed players like randle and payton overachieving."
"Most of the unexpected big play at the moment and the changes we'll see going forward likely won't be because of fans coming back, but simply having more games and less variation  I'm sorry Julius Randle I just don't think you're good enough to average 22/11/7 no matter if the fans are in or not"
Julius Randle definitely the front runner right now.   Chris Boucher also making a case.
"Play Julius Randle against the Hornets, he has the worst game of the year 😎"
Brandon Ingram 2020  Julius Randle 2021   Lonzo Ball 2022   It’s been written.

Julius Randle?
Shoutout to anorexic Julius Randle for letting us win
Everyone is Julius Randle.
I’m down. We are so devoid of talent I would rather have the worst record in the league than be in the playoff tournament with fucking Julius randle and Austin rivers
I dont think they have been wrong.  Clarkson a second round pick is a decent starter. Larry Nance a second round pick is a decent starter. Russell turned into an all star. Julius Randle has been ok but this season he has been doing good. Caruso was great and probably the 4th or 5th most important piece to the championship.  Kuzma a late first round pick played great for his contract of only 2 million a year.
"Zion was ""Julius Randle with hops"" and now Julius Randle is ""Zion without the hops"""
"Obviously its not fun no matter what, but it's better than another year of complete apathy towards your team knowing that you won't be competitive this year and have no path to contention in the immediate future- all the while watching your fan base get excited by simply doing nothing, irrationally attaching themselves to no name rookies, and getting their hopes up by mediocrity only to eventually be let down.  Seriously, if you love basketball there is nothing worse than hour team not only sucking, but having no future and having to just get fake excited about guys like Landry Fields, hold out hope that Frank Ntilikina is going to one day turn into an actual basketball player, and look at Julius Randle memes because he had a hot start."
"i know an exciting young core of players he could do well with, wouldn't even have to move.   although i'm not sure if he would be okay playing sidekick to julius randle"
"Well because of that roster he should shine. There are other players like LaVine or Beal who had had awful teams around them but at least their stats were good. Not tryna compare, but taking into consideration that he’s playing in the knicks with him being their second best offensive player behind Julius Randle, his stats and the way he’s playing is a bit underwhelming"
Chanelling his inner Julius Randle
\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle

Dude.. no. I have Julius Randle in fantasy. Why didn't you mention the 4.6 turnovers he averages each game?
"Its a kids toy/tv series that dates back to 1999. It basically revolves around (pun intended) spinning tops used to battle other tops. Similar to Pokemon.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyblade  Basically ""beyblade move"" or referring to Julius Randle as ""the beyblade"" is just memeing how much they spin and use the spin move. So they are a human beyblade since all they do is spin."
Slide everyone up one spot and don't forget Dame.  Dame/Mitchell/Luka/Zion/Randle  Julius goes from the teams allstar to the worst player on the starting line.
"yeah, if julius randle isn't the focus of the defense maybe he'd do pretty well...?"
"I know Julius Randle already won Most Improved Player and deservedly so, but Kemba’s improvement in the last 24 hours according so the doomers in this sub is pretty remarkable."
"I know Julius Randle already won Most Improved Player and deservedly so, but Kemba’s improvement in the last 24 hours according so the doomers in this sub is pretty remarkable."
"That's actually a very good team, Jrue + Simmons + Gobert would be a historically good defense.   People always underestimate teams like this because the there's no star player, but if Julius Randle is your 5th best player you're in good shape.   52-30, they make the conference finals."
Jimmy and bam went out LIKE straight suckas and Julius randle
Yeah I’m telling you that Ben is literally not even worth as much as Julius randle. Homie is straight booty cheeks
"Bro, you know what would be hilarious. He goes to Kings and ends up as their Julius Randle 🤣"
"It's not just the shooting, it's the scoring. How do you have 4 points in an elimination game. Even Julius Randle had more points despite shitting the playoff bed."
"julius randle played 14min total in his rookie year, so ignore that, then he (as a starter... on the lakers) was shooting 27.8%, 27.0%, and 22.2% on less than 1 3PA per game, then he got shipped to NOP and was shooting similarly unimpressive percentages but on something approaching actual attempts, ditto first year NYK, and then this year he was 2.3/5.5 41.1%.  that whole time before he was also low 70s FT%, and this season he was 81.1%.  even with his shooting regressing in his first ever playoff series, in front of an actual crowd, he was still 23/27 85.2% on free throws, so he probably really did improve his shooting."
julius randle just happened... although he fell apart in the playoffs so i guess we'll have to see if his improved shooting holds up in non-empty stadiums next season.
Knicks fans don't want him. Julius Randle is a BONAFIDE SUPERSTAR and deserves a 250M+ deal. Zion would just clog the lane for him.
"He already does a lot well for a 21-year-old, plus he is 7'2.   Celtics were not going to compete for anything with 6'6-6'8 guys playing at Center. Not in a division that has KD, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam, Kyrie Irving, &amp; Ben Simmons.   I get that small ball is the trend right now, but the Celtics need a guy who will make elite players like those guys that think twice about driving to the hoop.   Tacko is tall, but got into basketball really late and it shows because he's still very green.   They needed some true bigs that could come in &amp; play right away. And Stevens should sign Brown to a contract that's more in line with a late first round pick to keep him around."
“He’s overhyped. He’s ~~Julius Randle~~ Alex Len with hops.”
Julius randle lost out on a max contract b/c of the playoffs  Butler was really bad too
CJ McCollum for Julius Randle
Do you consider Julius Randle a star? But he was injured during his first game.
"r/nba being inconsistent with who they shit on for wilting in the playoffs again, what a shock.  Ain't no fucking way that Pascal is somehow worse than Miles fucking Turner, let alone Julius Randle or even Ben Simmons at this point. It's hardly his fault we had the seventh-worst record  this year."
"That the salary cap exists is why you couldn't keep two stars.   There are only 15 ish bona fide stars in the NBA, which even if spread evenly leaves 15 teams bidding on the fringe stars.  Right now guys like Julius Randle and Westbrook are probably in the top 30 players in the league but they're not going to get those enormous offers because they don't have room to grow really.  Instead everyone will throw tons of money at the good young players who are plausible as future superstars.  Small markets would pay almost as much for these guys like Brown and Ayton, as the big markets are paying for the actual superstars.  They don't have a choice.  It's not like football where if you don't have a great QB you could conceivably still win a championship through great line play and whatnot.  You're dead in the water until you have a top 15 player, maybe top 7 realistically.  And also we'll be saying goodbye to the ""middle class"" of player contracts, much like the NFL has.  Everyone will be enormous contracts, rookie deals, and minimums.  So the best role players will gravitate towards the big markets as well because everyone is paying the same for veteran role players.  The minimum."
nobody predicted Julius Randle turning into John Randle.
why they would love it. Julius was trash in the playoffs. Porzingis was a negative too but wasn't as bad as Randle
Julius Randle can’t build a super team?
"Julius Randle is too fun, sorry bud"
Ask go left. Zach Randolph and Julius Randle.
Porzingis for Julius Randle straight up
"I just don't get this narrative anymore. It's 2021, you can take pictures and make commercials anywhere. It's not like Julius Randle is raking in the ad money. Dame is in commercials all over the place and he's from Portland.  Cream rises to the top no matter what, start winning and people will pay attention."
"And Julius Randle was 2nd team all NBA. And Ben Simmons and Thybulle were 1st and 2nd team all-NBA defense.   Awards are voted based on reputation, it's not an objective measure of anything. History is being written now. The debate will continue for a long time and Trae will definitely make All-NBA teams in the near future."
Zion with* julius randle &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
zion for julius randle
Julius Randle and Reggie Jackson
I never thought it was bad. 3 of those 4 losses were very close and that's with Julius Randle being absolutely awful.
"Trae Young already was a superstar, he was already an All Star starter. Him not making the All Star team was a snub. The standings were too volatile this year. For whatever reason All Star selections were made to guys on some pretty bad teams (Vucevic, Sabonis, LaVine). I really think that either Sabonis or Vuc should've not made it over Trae. LaVine was basically doing what Trae did last year when he made it so he had to get on. Julius Randle was 100% deserved. It sucks that Brooklyn big 3 had to squeeze everybody else but you can't have the all star game without those 3 really. Kyrie didn't get on last year but this year he was/is undeniable."
"He needs to pull a Julius Randle in the off-season and shoot 10,000 balls a day every day for months"
Julius Randle was in his first postseason.  This is Ben's 4th
"Absolutely loving Thibs. The improved defense is of course worth mentioning, but the players on our team aren’t just “dawgs” anymore who do whatever the fuck they want. Dude brought discipline, and rigid standards. He turned “Dubious Handle,” a ball-dominant 4 who averaged insane turnover numbers and missed teammates constantly into Julius Randle, who’s averaging stats on par w LeBron rn lmao. Dude’s a vetted coach; there’s a reason he’s got lots of wins to his career. Hype to see the rest of the season play out."

Might be a little biased but Julius Randle and his dubious handles keep this form up I would argue for an All-NBA spot imo

"right now it’s looking like Wood, Sexton, Jaylen Brown, and Julius Randle"
He didn't regress. He just got exposed by being put in a position he was never fit for in the 1st place. He's a 2nd option that's asked to be the 1st option.   He was always just a well-utilized Julius Randle (inferior bit-beast tho) who plays good defense and less worse 3%
"Julius Randle: ""And I took that personally."""
#JULIUS RANDLE IS A POINT GUARD
Mitchell Robinson's defense is insane. Julius Randle with a coach that uses him correctly and keeps him disciplined is a borderline all-star. Payton is.....a point guard? What is happening here?
Julius “walking double double” Randle
Mitchell Robinson's defense is insane. Julius Randle with a coach that uses him correctly and keeps him disciplined is a borderline all-star. Payton is.....a point guard? What is happening here?
lol our sub is ready to throw away RJ and Mitch and sign Julius Randle to a lifetime contract on these 5 games.
Julius Randle winning MVP would be the biggest wtf moment in my 26 years of watching basketball.
Shaq 100% thinks Julius Randle is better than Rudy Gobert.
Julius Randle is putting up Lebron-like numbers with great efficiency  23-10-7 on 53% from the field and 53% from 3
ain’t nothing wrong unless you laugh at other’s 2nd option when your best player’s Julius Randle. Lol. You’d take Collins as your first option right now. Jokester.
Knicks announce the team has cloned Julius Randle and he will play every position in the 12 man rotation
no love for Julius Randle ?
"Maybe, Hakeem really relied on his sweet turnaround jumper when spun away from his hook, I'd like to think he was ambidextrous but its been 20 years since I watched one of his games &amp; Im not going to speculate based off highlights. Thats a not an easy move, even though Hakeem makes it look that way. Youre right that there were other counters for Bagley here besides a spin &amp; off hand lay up (turn around jumper, up &amp; under, maybe even drop step &amp; two hand dunk), but its definitely seemingly one of the easiest for a very raw player to pick up, but he wouldn't be the first guy who struggled at it cough...Julius Randle...cough."
"Honestly Julius randle, I know he put up good counting stats before, but his production so far this season has been that of a high end all star. A huge leap in both production and “winning basketball”."
Julius Randle &gt; Scottie Pippen
"Knicks winning behind Alec Burke, Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton feels...uninspiring? Don't get me wrong, I'm hyped to see the NY Kazoos playing some good ball. I just don't see the vision for the future when all the ""talent"" is riding the pine."
Austin Rivers: “ok guys let’s work together and do team stuff and win!”  Julius Randle: /pounds the ball against the hardwood 17x  “Sup?”

"Julius ""Crash Bandicoot"" Randle"
"We don't have any young guys with All-NBA ceilings. The hope is that you sign guys who are 22, 23 who have really shown something in hopes that you can help them keep improving until you have a Lavine or Julius Randle situation. You don't sign guys who will be 30 before the all star game."
He reminds me of a young Julius Randle. Doesnt matter where he gets the ball he is putting his head down and taking it to the cup and throwing up junk.
"Copy/pasting from my other reply:  &gt;Collins allowed 61.3% shooting inside of 5 feet, Ayton allowed 61.9%.  &gt;Collins allowed 40.9% shooting from 5-9 feet, Ayton allowed 45.6%.  &gt;Collins allowed 44.7% shooting from 10-14 feet, Ayton allowed 42.5%.  &gt;Collins allowed 47.2% shooting from 15-19 feet, Ayton allowed 40.6%.  &gt;Collins allowed 36.3% shooting from 20-24 feet, Ayton allowed 41.7%.  &gt;Collins allowed 34.9% shooting from 25-29 feet, Ayton allowed 35%.  Collins isn't a center, so it's not really expected of him to go against guys like Embiid or Jokic. Collins went against Tobias Harris and Julius Randle and was just fine.  The gap between their defense is not even close to 40+ million, and definitely not once you factor in Collins being the better offensive player."
He’s not terrible but I’d rather have someone like Derozan with all that cap space they have. They’d  still need shooters but it would probably make Julius Randle that much better since he wouldn’t have to focus on playmaking as much.
"I'm sure your not biased as a Heat fan.   This year, Gobert contest 7.7 shots per game at the rim and allowed 50.1%. [Poeltl also contested 7.7 per game, and allowed 50.3%.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=GP*GE*36:DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*3&amp;PlayerPosition=C).  Bam contested 7 per game and allowed 59.4%, which actually puts him between notable rim protectors Lauri Markannen and Julius Randle.   Real basketball fans know about Poeltl."
Julius Randle because he isn’t a star and I expect the Knicks to add some guys that will lower his stats.
Its good but not elite due to his volume   Davis Bertans also shoots 40% from 3 but he does so on more attempts per game. 7.5 for Lauris 5.8  I don't think anyone would call Julius Randle an elite 3 point shooter but he has about the same volume and accuracy as Lauri and his shots are much harder. They aren't open 3s
"If your core is Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, you're staying right where you're at lmao"
that great Julius Randle is hot garbage and your team got dad dicked by a lollipop that fell on the floor
Tell me how Julius randle was better than Butler this year plz
"Manu Ginobli, Giannis, Julius Randle, &amp; Steph"
"Sports fans are so delusional. Randle put together the best season a Knick had since Melo, while being even better because he brought more than just scoring. And people would be totally okay with him walking lol.   And who is going to replace him? I forgot how easy it’s been for the Knicks to bring in talent or develop talent that competes at a high level. All these stars just lining up for NY every offseason.   Julius Randle is a major reason why you guys feel so confident moving forward. He opens the possibility for another star to be intrigued enough to join the Knicks moving forward. While proving he can play team ball.   You don’t just let that walk because he had a bad post season while being asked to carry the entire load of a 15 man roster. Maybe he won’t be here forever but it’s ridiculous not to want him to come back."
"What I think most folks don’t completely understand yet is the importance of what the team does after drafting such guys.  The Lakers and their batch of young guys in the last few years are an excellent example.  The following guys were all on the Lakers roster: Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, DeAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball  The Lakers, when they had them, weren’t really about player development. So these guys faltered and were considered bench/role players at best. Now they’re all bonafide starters in the league.  The Spurs spent years developing Kawhi into the beast he is. Raptors have slowly but surely developed the non-lottery likes of OG, VanVleet, Siakam. Denver got an injured Michael Porter Jr falling to them, and, that’s a multiple time All-Star in the making.  Some teams are just better at player development than others. So yea, Jokic’s amazing in Denver, but had he been drafted by the Kings or Detroit, maybe he’d never have reached this point.  All this to say, the Kings suck, and should be relocated to Seattle. Thanks for reading."
Not quite living in the past when our title was 40 years more recent and we have a generational talent with a new FO to build around him. I can understand you living in the past tho since y’all don’t have much to look forward to with fucking Julius “can’t play playoff basketball” Randle as your centerpiece lmao
"really it was the other way around where people were calling zion ""julius randle with rockets strapped to his legs"" as a pretty common player comp"
Julius Randle
"A lot of ex-Lakers have flourished the past few years beyond their Laker days.  Julius Randle Jordan Clarkson D'Angelo Russell Brandon Ingram Brook Lopez Ivica Zubac Lou Williams  This is just from memory, could be more."
"The problem is ""combo guard"" is sometimes used as a pejorative (you'd want a bigger wing, you'd want a more reliable point guard), but if it semantically means just ""good primary handler, gives up no ground to wings,"" it's a clear compliment.   &gt;We’re seeing more taller ball handlers than ever (I’m aware of Magic’s existence) in players like Ben Simmons, LaMelo, giddy, even players like Julius randle, Kd, and LeBron all handle much more than forward and wings of the past.  NBA teams should see the utility in replacing their defensive liability point guards with guys who don't give up ground to power forwards, because that's obvious utility.   The question is whether anything fundamentally has changed about basketball (do 6'0"" guys no longer have a significant advantage when handling the ball?) or if taller human beings are just getting better at basketball."
"To me that is that modern SG. Being able to take the ball up court and set up players with passes along with the scoring and shooting you’d expect from a sg. In the NBA, all players in all positions have become more versatile than ever in their skill sets such as shooting and ball handling. We’re seeing more taller ball handlers than ever (I’m aware of Magic’s existence) in players like Ben Simmons, LaMelo, giddy, even players like Julius randle, Kd, and LeBron all handle much more than forward and wings of the past."
You mean when we signed Julius Randle on a great contract and got a free first round pick for 40 games of Marcus Morris?
he played fantastically for the rockets until the bubble where he first injured his leg that carried over to last season and was also coming off covid which we've already seen hamper players short and long term and things in OKC were clearly falling apart his last year there. again i'm not saying he's top 1 or even top 3 PG in the league but to act like he stinks and this makes the lakers worse is indicative of someone who doesn't really watch his games outside of maybe when he plays their team and the playoffs.   its a lot easier to gameplan for 1 guy when theres no other real options on the team we saw that this playoffs with randle. i don't think anyone here would say julius was undeserving of his all nba spot or that he sucks because he got shit on in the playoffs.
"lmao I still can't believe they chose to keep Kuz over Julius Randle, Lonzo, Ingram, Larry Nance, and Jordan Clarkson"
They don't want to get any help for Julius Randle?
I’m honestly really surprised the Knicks didn’t try and move Julius Randle.   I would’ve for sure sold high.
"Embiid being exactly 1 spot above Wiggins assumes no predraft injury... which would be too low imo, alot of weird picks in here like Julius Randle was not a top 30 all decade prospect"
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
"still probably the most gettable allstar, maybe julius randle too  most of the guys on the all star list are pretty untouchable no matter how much you offer"
"Booker and Mitchell have now proven themselves in the playoffs. Lavine has not. Whether or not that's his fault, its always a question whether a player will perform well continuing into the playoffs (see Julius Randle this year)"
"From one bias fan to another. These medicore laker players we laker fans  just love to hype up such as jordan clarkson, larry nance, bradon ingram, josh hart, lonzo ball, julius randle and dlo actually do shockingly well on other teams."
"&gt;rarely does a player take a leap after 25.  I know you said rarely, but I'm a Julius Randle stan, so I have to bring him up."
You assume the guy you responded to actually watched many Julius Randle games lol
"I think he is saying that Julius Randle is great and all, but a *good* backup plan is hard to find. Especially one that is okay with being that second option. You need to keep that."
Julius randle is not better than Russ
"I’m assuming your talking about Julius Randle? I’m not even gonna bother comparing the two. Randle made all nba, won MIP and led his squad to their first playoff series in years. Kp has made 0 improvements as a player at all, is constantly injured, can’t post up, doesn’t get along with Luka and played like a glorified Meyers Leonard against the clippers. On top of that his contract is literally weighing down your franchises ability to improve at all. I mean at least y’all got Luka tho 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"In no specific order LBJ Giannis KD AD Steph Klay Harden Kyrie Zion Ja Kawhi PG Dame Luka Trae KAT Embiid Joker Mitchell Gobert For Extra Credit, Bam, Gobert and this year Julius Randle."
Literally the only player on this list that i'd rather have Simmons over is Julius Randle.
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"Yeah and if Paxton/kerr/Robert Horry don’t hit big shots for bulls/lakers many iconic titles/playoff runs don’t happen. You can’t call it choking when he dominates the game and leads a 16 point comeback in the clutch and hits a shot with 20 seconds left to cut it to 2? What Julius Randle did for my team in the playoffs is called choking, what lebron did in 2011 is choking, doing all that shit I just described is not choking you literally sound like a skip bayless burner 😂"
i think julius randle has done enough to warrant a top 25 ranking at least coming in to next season
And then trading Julius Randle for Kevin Love!
"The expectations really aren't the problem, it's the fact that his role constantly keeps changing:  * His rookie year the Lakers had Brook Lopez, Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr, and Brandon Ingram in the front court, so they asked Kuzma to fill in mostly as a backup 3, with a little 4.  * His second year they only had Javale at center, no longer had Randle or Nance and now had LeBron to go with Ingram, so Kuzma was asked to mostly play 4 with some backup 5.  * His third year the Lakers had Dwight and Javale at center, AD at center and PF and LeBron at SF, so Kuzma was in a vastly reduced role trying to fill in wherever he could, even sometimes at 2.  * It would have been more of the same this year, just with Gasol, Drummond and Trez at center, but LeBron and AD were hurt, and the Lakers had Markieff Morris and Wesley Matthews as well, so Kuzma's role again was all over the place.  I think if Kuzma was on a team where he could play more consistent 3/4 minutes (where he wasn't backing up All NBA guys at those positions), then he'd really blossom. I honestly don't think the spotlight or expectations bother him, I just think it has to be tough to know what the team needs him to do when whatever that role is is constantly changing."
"Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivaca Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Alex Caruso 🔥"
"Agreed, but we'd still have cap space to attract a 3rd star to pair with Lillard and Randle (assuming it's RJ that your FO wants as the centerpiece and not Julius).   So it's really not really similar to the Melo trade because we still would have flexibility left to make additional moves. Plus, we can't pretend we know exactly what the return is. Obviously you would be getting young players + picks, but which ones we'd have left to use is still TBD.  The whole point of acquiring cap space + picks is to try to use it on someone like Lillard. It's stupid to just say ""welp it didn't work out with Melo last time"" to never acquire another star, and it also doesn't mean it's the exact same scenario this time just because it didn't work out last time."
I mean we tried to. Cousins.. Julius Randle. It just didn’t work or there were severe injuries. Plus neither AD nor Jrue are #1 guys on a contending type team.
"Randle is 100% getting a max. This trade is a fucking joke. The celtics are not trading their 2nd (near 25 PPG on almost 50% shooting) best player, their 3rd best player and arguably their 4th best player.  For Julius Randle and Myles Turner.  Pritchard is a very good player off the bench but he is NOT a fucking starting point guard and that would force him to be."
&gt;Julius Randle is 26 on his last year looking to cash in he is a rim-protecting big man...   Rim protecting? seriously? 0.3 blk per?
World renowned shot blocker Julius Randle.
"Joe Johnson was a free agent if I recall correctly. Or was planning to decline his player option to get paid. So anything they could get for Joe was worth it. Diaw was a solid pickup for them.  Kurt Thomas was also a very underrated player, and always very productive on low touches. Like a poor man's Julius Randle. And Quentin Richardson's value would never be higher.   They should have made a move for another shooter though, like Michael Redd or Ray Allen, instead of trading for Shaq.   Either way,  that Suns team was good enough to win a championship as built and just got unlucky."
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, and a good handful of others have achieved mediocrity at best on the Lakers(with maybe the exception being Brandon Ingram), only to flourish and improve once they left the Lakers.  The Lakers have done some pretty solid drafting the past six years or so, but they have done a terrible job at actually developing the players they draft."
"Julius Randle is the last thing they need, the team already has so many ball dominant players."
it's not his fault julius randle decided to do his best kwame brown impression
Was he not part of the player selection process? Was trea young invited? Was Julius Randle? Those two alone help with the two issues you listed(non traditional playmaking lead guard and rebounding from your forward). Nah instead he is throwing bones to his guys on SA.
"Holy shit, my bracket is practically identical to yours except I had Knicks beating the Hawks in 7 and then losing to the Sixers in 6 in the next round. But I don’t think anyone saw Julius Randle completely wetting the bed the way he did"
"Julius Randle averaged 37/12/7 against them in 3 regular season games. People overrated Randle’s impact going into the series and people underrated Trae Young’s impact (thinking he was going to get abused on defence, wilting under the NY defence)"
I would  love Kuzma to actually do really well and basicay be next year's Julius Randle
"who would you have picked that didn't already reject a position? Other than Trae and Julius Randle I can't think of better American players who aren't either already on the team, Injured, or rejected the offer.     Trae is incredible but it's not like the team needs more scoring. They just aren't going to win with KD/Dame playing like shit."
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
The sweet Karma of denying Lord Julius Randle the right to play in Tokyo… kevin love smdh
"Shut up bro you dont know what you are talking about.  Pop constructed this shit show of a roster himself, he hand selected players himself.  Inviting Love over any other big man was a huge joke then when he left the team he asks McGee and Keldon fucking Johnson.  What about Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Turner, or Julius Randle?  What about Ja Morant?  He made his bed and this loss will be a huge stain on his coaching record and may finally open people's eyes to the fact that Pop is no where near Phil Jackson or any of the other great coaches.  His managerial moves are overrated as well. He directly played a hand in getting DeRozan instead of Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart which would have set the Spurs up nicely instead of watching DeRozan (thus Kawhi) walk away with nothing.  He has no idea how to manage superstars or egos in the modern NBA and was a horrible choice to coach this team. Just dumb."
"Maybe Pop shouldn't have taken Derozan and Poeltl instead of some combination of Lonzo/Ingram/Hart/pick plus picks plus a potential Julius Randle sign and trade.  Pop was a legitimate idiot for taking the package he did. What was the motivation behind taking the Raptors offer instead of the clearly better Lakers offer? Spite? He wanted to hurt the Lakers more than he wanted to help the Spurs.   Idiotic decision making process. No way the rejection of the Lakers ""godfather"" offer came from Buford. That was either Popovich or ownership, and all the rumors have said Popovich"
"He’s the one who tells them what to do and he’s the one that picked this garbage roster.   Jermari Grant, Zach LaVine, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee, and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant, Trae Young, Julius Randle, Russell Westbrook, and Zion Williamson??? Oh yeah, big brain time for sure."
And Julius Randle too lol. Zion is definitely All NBA caliber
"Julius randle was snubbed for Kevin love. When love was out, he snubbed miles turner for Javale fucken McGee. How do you explain that?  Did pop not make those decisions?"
"Draymond Green being on this squad but not Julius Randle is mind boggling. Green is just not olympic quality. The dude is a great role-player on a super-team in the NBA, but not in the olympics when there's so many better players. In fact, Green had the same PER as old Melo this year. Why not just take a better Point Forward in Randle, or Melo who has years of olympic experience and leadership?"
Neither was Julius Randle
"Seriously why aren't they considering guys like LaMelo (Carmelo is probably sick of it at this point so understandable) Julius Randle, Trae. What the hell is this roster? They literally had Kevin love in there originally."
"If you think I think Julius Randle will be top 20, you didn’t read anything and just saw the words “Julius Randle” and got mad  Sorry friend. It’s rough being unable to read. Enjoy your day."
"I mean he did average [24](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/julius-randle-vs-jazz-this-year) against the Jazz this year, it’s not implausible."
yes... do you guys even know who Julius Randle is lol
Did you really just group Ja Morant and Julius Randle together as being the same type of player? You just threw out a bunch of names of good players who aren't on the team.
"Blame Colangelo too. When the initial roster came out, it was obvious the team was poorly constructed despite the talent. Like, Julius Randle couldn’t even get an invite? Multiple iso heavy players that basically take up the same role? No real playmaking point guards?"
Is it me or does France's back up center looks like Julius Randle?
Would be such a lol Knicks move to pay big money to reunite the trash bros along with Julius randle
"Kinda late to the thread but you could easily tell me Julius Randle was in his 30s and I’d believe you no question. Just does not look 26 to me  Also, jesus that’s a bold username OP"
Julius Randle did
I guess maybe if the all star is Julius Randle or something.
"Ok. Julius Randle will be an all time top 5 player by the end of his career, too."
"Raised: Terance Mann, Trae Young, Deandre Ayton, (bonus: Cam Johnson)  Dropped: Ben Simmons, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
It is some good work but think bam is too low. Kyrie is too high. Khris Middleton is too low.  Julius Randle is too high.
"WTH, he's earned twice as much as Julius Randle, who's been in the league three more years than Batum"
"Idk, but some or all of the following will happen:  * Someone will have a solid season and get some MVP votes (e.g. Julius Randle) * LeBron will have a great season for 37 and not win MVP * Another team like the Jazz will be #1 in the league with no players in the top 5 voting for MVP"
Kevin Knox for Damian lillard Julius randle for fuckin korkmaz Ben Simmons for Elfrid payton
"He called it like the same day (or a day before) actual NBA media people were writing tweets/articles saying Philly was a possible destination.  That same off-season, I fucked around in 2K and started moving players around rosters to where I thought they'd end up.  I remember getting Julius Randle right (I figured the Knicks would end up missing out on the top targets, and Randle seemed like exactly the kind of second-tier FA they'd end up getting) and Isaiah Thomas ending up on the Wizards (because they needed PG depth with Wall's injury), among others.  If only I had just posted them on here/Twitter with ""My sources are telling me.....,"" I could have been internet famous for a couple weeks with predictions pulled out of my ass too!"
julius randle and elfrid payton are gonna hang a championship banner in the garden
"&gt;She tends to excessively go off about plays that weren't that impressive (if it's a player she particularly likes)  This was her to a ""T"" when she was covering the Knicks vs Hawks series.  Anything Julius Randle did she was slobbing all over.  Even when he was particularly ass during certain games in the series."
"Ahead of Malone, KG, Dirk. Behind Tim Duncan and Julius Randle"
Similar to what rj Barrett and Julius Randle are gonna be doing when they hold up that Larry O’Brien trophy next season
Gonna pale in comparison to when Julius Randle does it in 2 years after next season
"Define recent. Teague, Jrue, and Lopez have each only been selected once. Teague was the most recently selected of those 3 (2015, half a decade ago) and frankly he's by far the worst player in the Bucks rotation. Middleton did make it in 2019 and 2020, but didn't make it this year   The recent all-star thing doesn't make a ton of sense anyway. Is a team of Isaiah Thomas, Gordon Hayward, DeAndre Jordan, Julius Randle, and D'Angelo Russell a superteam?"
And when you look at that draft it was pretty spotty that high:  1. Wiggins  2. Jabari Parker  3. Embiid  4. Aaron Gordon  5. Exum  6. Marcus Smart  7. Julius Randle  8. Stauskas  9. Vonleh  10. Elfrid Payton  Obviously Embiid is the best choice but I don't fault anybody for not wanting to gamble on him. After that Randle and Smart are the only other two guys really worth a damn and it took Randle awhile. Maybe Gordon with a full training camp and season with Denver. But the rest of it is pretty fucking yikes.  So ending up with Kevin Love and a title was a pretty good return.
Willis Reed -&gt; Bob Boozer -&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -&gt; Byron Scott -&gt; Kobe Bryant -&gt; Julius Randle  This is pretty star-studded.
Julius Randle? Cmon bro
Julius randle
"Never will be, not marketable &amp; not game changing, i bet Julius Randle sells more jerseys than either player, that goes to show how much the media cares about Utah"
"If knicks are proof of anything it is that no quagmire is eternal. But I agree Lebron made us what we are. But I watched the baby lakers and seeing what they have all developed into you can't say they wouldnt at least be a competitive playoff team this year even without lebron. We would have Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle Lonzo Ball Kyle Kuzma as well as out other pieces currently on the roster. Maybe Randle needed to leave to become what he is but even if he was close to it on the lakers that is a tough team that I think could be a finals threat in the coming years."
"I wanna see if John Collins gets destroyed by Julius randle. if he defends well, the Spurs probably throw him a bag and make the Hawks match."
Knicks the 2nd best team in the leauge. Julius Randle runs New York and once they get to the A he gonna that shit too. Trust and believe.
Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
"Agreed. Second tier team in their own city. 3 all-stars, but the 4 seed Knicks led by Julius Randle are a way bigger story."
Oh so Ja gets a documentary but Julius Randle doesn’t????????????
All I know is Julius Randle better be on an all nba team
I don't know but [Julius Randle did](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbaww/comments/mxwoj5/julius_randle_blows_a_kiss_to_his_son_kyden/)
Gary Washburn is going to vote for Julius Randle
is julius randle the first player youve watched improve lol
"The only one who is erect for a player is you my guy. Westbrook is not a great as everyone proclaims.   Triple doubles as a whole is an invaluable stat. It’s nowhere near as common because it is no needed in the sport of basketball, it is simply a MILESTONE.   Truthfully, anyone can get a triple double. Literally anyone.   Though, If you look at the numbers through the years, triple doubles are rarely a thing. Only 45-55 a season. UNLESS you have Westbrook, Robertson, and Magic. Those three players single handily boost the triple doubles per season in their respective era.   Like Julius randle was practically a nobody and then all of a sudden he shits triple doubles this season. Sometimes it’s by play design but it’s really not that special   Magic Johnson is the ONLY notable one with championships."
"you could say that about julius randle last year. in fact, i did"
Julius Randle is better than Zach Lavine and Zion Williamson. And u forgot some people that I’m sure u probably just forgot about but otherwise it’s a pretty good list imo. Great job
Jerami Grant only played in 54 games while Julius Randle played 71 games. I think availability should definitely be considered for MIP and other awards.
Time for the Knicks to trade him for some future draft picks! Those picks could be anything! They could even be Julius Randle!
"It’s a *little* bit sad, but its also kind of exciting at the same time, bc if/when the Knicks ever get a top 3 player in his prime (*especially* if it’s someone they draft) millions and millions of people will go totally fucking nuts and lose their minds on some citywide uncut gems vibe—win *or* lose. I’m figuratively so here for it.   I’m a Sixers fan, but I lived in New York for a while, through Linsanity and some middling/decent Melo years during which basically no Knicks fans I met harbored any illusions about actually winning a title. But they did mostly gave a shit about the team and the league in general. They were all over the city, knicks fans, and there’s something stupidly charming about a city where you can have a conversation with somebody from pretty much any walk of life about, like, whether or not Steve Novak or Iman Shumpert are top 50 players in the league or not. I feel like those fans deserve maybe just some little sliver of hope ever now and then.  I *mostly* don’t believe in karma… for the most part… exceeept for maybe, justhearmeout, that of fucking course the guy who sells overpriced cable internet service while he pays 0 property taxes on Madison square garden and tours as JD and the Straight Shot won’t ever ever win a title. It wouldn’t be *fair,* goddammit. And fairness is one of the deepest fantasies of sports — A world in which things are, at least occasionally, decided through some weird abstracted form of meritocracy.   But anyways, it *would* be super fun if, like RJ Barrett and Julius Randle somehow become the second coming of Westbrook and Durant or something similarly insane.That way the emotional stakes will be extra juiced when Embiid and Sixers knock em out of the playoffs en route to their multiple consecutive titles, heyooooo.   But seriously, that would create enough global pathos to wake the Cthulhu.   Hard not to root for that on some level."
"I disagree about the Knicks. Its s huge deal they even made the playoffs, let getting the 4th seed lead by julius randle. No one expected his break out season becoming a star. The Knicks have gotten tons of attention on tv, reddit and other social media platforms."
"Luke's never had a stretch as bad as Fizdale at the Knicks though.   Fizdale went 21-83 with the Knicks and had the worst spacing in the league despite having Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Reggie Bullock who would all go on to shoot over 40% from deep the year after he left. He's not only a shit coach but he makes players significantly worse"
Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
"The Vincent Vegas, colors black and white, uniform would look like a suit and either my Vincent Vega Dancers from the other comment for entertainment or a Vincent Vega as a mascot.  Edit: and Julius Randle would obviously be the franchise player"
"I’d say that’s about the same effect as having Julius Randle just explode out of nowhere. He was always a good scorer, and he’d have little streaks where he’d consistently drop 30 pt games but he never sustained it. Dude made the jump from good volume scorer to all star this season"
"Exactly. Thibs will win the actual award bc he miraculously turned Julius randle into a human washing machine spitting dimes instead of turnovers. The Knicks defense is playing at a level they haven't achieved for over 20 years. And their offense is manageable, outside the top 20, but winning games despite not having elite guard play."
1. Nikola Jokić 2. Joel Embiid 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Steph Curry  5. Cp3/Julius Randle
I never expected to love Julius Randle yet here i am.
"There were a loooot of “empty calories” posts made about Julius Randle before this season, too."
"Does the title say ""Julius Randle just had **the best** season in Knick history?"""
Maybe a Kings fan can correct me but I don't think Bagley is even remotely like Julius Randle as a player
"It was more that what was Bagley's max as a player? Julius Randle, right? With Luka sitting there it just seemed crazy to take Julius Randle 2.0 at 2nd overall."
Give the Suns Julius Randle instead of Frank Kaminsky and they go undefeated. Wow hypotheticals are fun!
"&gt;I think there's also an element of (very) poor player development. Guys like Bender or Chriss were extremely raw, but had a couple of potentially interesting skills.  If that was truly the case, why didn't any of these draft busts switch teams and other teams unlock their unlocked potential? How old was Chriss, Dragan Bender, and Josh Jackson when they got cut/released/traded? Early 20's? Surely they were still extremely young. The amount of times that a player gets cut that was deemed a true bust, switches teams, and comes anywhere near their predraft hype is pretty much zero. Last time I can think of that sorta happening was with Julius Randle and that was because the Lakers wanted the cap space to sign Lebron James. Last time it kinda happened with the Bucks was with Tobias Harris in 2013 but it wasn't like he was a top 5 draft pick and just didn't get a lot of minutes. If Bender turns into anything remotely like Porzingis and Josh Jackson turns into an all NBA defender like everyone thought he could then I would blame the player development more but this just happens so rarely in the NBA."
I personally think it’s crazy that gobert is not in the mvp discussion. It’s ass backwards to me that people are talking about Julius randle or CP3 but not Gobert.
RJ Barrett is overrated and so is Julius Randle. I apologize to Knicks fans everywhere for another 10 years of mediocrity.
"I mean, if anyone wins it this year other than Julius Randle they should can the award entirely."
"Zach Lowe's a fucking hater man. Dude has enjoyed a lot of revenue shitting on the Knicks over the years.  And quite frankly, the only necessary argument for Thibs over Monty is so simple to me, a fucking casual could conclude the same logic;  - Phoenix Suns projected win total, and seeding: ~35 wins, top 8 (lower half) West team  - NY Knicks projected win total, and seeding: ~22 wins, bottom 5 team *league-wide*  CP3, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges?  Before the season, nobody would have dared to compare Julius Randle to *any* of them, let alone anyone else on our squad. Look at our talent comparison on paper? Lmfao please dude, what a joke.  Fuck Zach Lowe, and fuck anyone that seriously considers Monty Williams over Thibs for COTY (excepts Suns fans, cause bias, can't blame em lol)"
"Thibs has Julius Randle taking a huge leap in 3pt shooting efficiency (which can't possibly be attributed to thibs). Hes obviously done a great job with the defense tho. Its similar with Monty , the offense looks awesome with CP3 and okay otherwise, the defense just looks great in general. But The Suns are the (much) better team in the harder conference so it should probably go to Monty."
"Tbf, this basically applies to the Hawks (we were a bit higher on the power rankings in most places) and the only person who has mentioned us in mainstream media is Perkins.  Also, I guarantee you a defensive-minded team like the Knicks with the star being Julius Randle, if our teams were to switch locations there is no doubt that the media situations would be even more exacerbated.  Tl;dr: Media bias definitely exists, and when a team deserves it like the Knicks, they capitalize on it tremendously by making it a major focal point."
"I mean it's still Julius Randle...  Consider the fact that Thibs is maximizing every single one of his players. Randle, DRose, RJ, Nerlens Noel, Bullock, Burks have all taken these enormous jumps from last year."
"And he's still only 26 years old. He could still take another step forward. Julius Randle transformed himself into an All-Star during his age 26 season, for example. We give up on players far too easily if they aren't amazing immediately."
"For COTY, I feel like Thibs is more clearly a sign of the coaching than any of the other candidates (besides maybe Macmillan, but he showed up late).  The Suns ran through the bubble and then they got Chris Paul, so how much is coaching on that?  Up for debate (not saying Monty wouldn't deserve it though).  The Jazz have two top 3 6MOY guys and the DPOY, so is that on the coaching or was there core just already getting better?  We were garbage.  Most of this roster is the same as last year.  Thibs came in and we're the 4th seed and turned Julius ""bull in a china shop"" Randle into an All-NBA player.  He turned RJ Barrett into a sniper from deep.  I feel like Thibs' fingerprints are just more clearly on this resurgence than the other guys, but there are plenty of deserving coaches."
Yeah but you can also see Julius Randle which is pretty cool too
February 6th in a win against the Trailblazers. He matched Randle for leading scorer with 22.    That was tied with a January 6th performance against the Jazz for Elf’s 2nd highest point total on the season; his highest was 27 in our December 27th win against the Bucks (when Julius had 29 to lead the Knicks).
"Thanks for this. I appreciate you emphasizing the meme while giving these players the credit they deserve. Julius Randle and RJ (along with a lot of other players on our team) came into the season with top tier conditioning, and really deserve praise for this."
Some exaggeration on the 45+ part but -  Julius Randle : 17 games with 40+ minutes  RJ Barret : 16 games with 40+ minutes  That seems fairly regular to me. The only other player of the handful I've spot checked that even comes close is Westbrook.
Julius Randle sat out one game because of a bruise.  Should've been there as well and wouldve topped in MPG.
"I was not trying to bash Thibs, more so emphasizing the meme, and to compliment RJ’s and Julius’ conditioning come this season. All credit has to go to Randle and whatever he did in the off season. His hard work and effort has been contagious to all of the Knicks"
Goddamn Julius Randle missed only one game.
Man Julius Randle came so close but he definitely had to take a game off for his quad

Julius Randle missed a game? Damn I actually have no recollection of that lol
"Shout out to Julius Randle too, leading the nba in minutes this year along with RJ Barrett."
He always had a shot that looked fixable though. The foundation was definitely there. I would say it was more likely Barrett hit for 40% 3 this year than Julius randle became a top 15 player in the nba
Julius randle is a value Lebron
julius randle
Julius Randle is a top 5 player of all time
Did Julius Randle also achieve this? Or am I trippin
"That's an incredibly stupid take. Patrick Ewing was a center, and didn't play the role of a passing threat.   The Knicks ran point guards out there and had the likes of Anthony Mason who was basically a point forward.   Julius Randle runs the offense because our starting point guard is Elfrid Payton.  You might as well look at Joel Embiid and say he's overrated because he doesn't pass as much as Julius."
If Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle didn't exist I think JP is in the talks. From being the statistically worse player to a potential 6moty type of guy if he can get his game up one more level.
Julius Randle
Julius Randle?
"As far as Randle goes, I’m pretty sure he put in a ton of work with Tyler Relph, they’re really close and all this summer he was posting about workouts with Julius"
Julius Randle should be an All NBA lock
Julius Randle right? He was an inefficient ballhog last year and this year he’s running the offense on extremely improved shooting iirc

this is really some crazy shit.   that was a hilarious offseason though.   nyk had every chance to signe big names and instead they only got julius randle.
"He's so bad he's ranked right behind Donovan Mitchell, buddy hield, and Julius randle. Bunch of scrubs."
"Imagine going back in time and explaining to someone that   The 76ers would be the number 1 seed in the east in 2021.   A 2nd round pick would potentially win the MVP.   The Lakers would draft Clarkson and Randle. Julius would go on be the savior for the Knicks and Clarkson would be 6moty for Utah. They were moved to make room for LeBron and AD on the Lakers  Capella would learn how to shoot.   Wiggins would join the Warriors with Klay, Steph, and Draymond in 2020. They would be in a play in game and 8th in the West."
"I think that Julius Randle has a great shot at winning it this season, and his numbers haven’t jumped that significantly either. At least compared to previous winners like Pascal Siakam or CJ McCollum."
"Dude called Julius Randle Zach Randolph. Shaq is out of touch and everyone fucking knows it. Even players like Spida and Christian Wood have called him out. At least Kenny and Chuck still keep up, Shaq is straight garbage."
Julius Randle is first team All NBA to me
YOU CANT HANDLE. JULIUS RANDLE.
Julius randle kinda weird looking
"I know this is old but the pelicans did get talent around ad but just had bad luck with injuries it wasn't Timberwolves KG  Dude had rondo, boogie, jrue holiday, eric gordon, julius randle (who had a good season there), nikola mirotic. It didn't work out for the most part because of injuries I'm tired of people saying the pelicans never tried to surround talent around him cause that's false"
"NO WAY! I refuse to believe this. Jimmy Butler was straight playing 48 minute games under Thibs... you mean to tell me he didn’t average over 40?  The old Tom Thibs coaching tactic: play him until he becomes a superstar is back in fully display with Randle. “You’ll get a rest when you hear MVP chants, Julius. Get your jump-passing ass back in the game.”"
Julius Randle and De’Aaron Fox do this shit ALLLLLLL DAAAAAY.
Julius Randle have Eastern Conference player of the month &amp; getting a J. Cole Reference in the same day is awesome
Julius Randle's played 480 minutes more than Trae. That's ~22% more minutes than Trae. Is Trae 22% better than Randle?
I'm not sure Julius is a lock at all but knicks are dogshit beyond Randle and forward has less depth right now with AD+KD missing like half the season
"Every team would rather play the Knicks than the Heat or Hawks. Sorry but Julius Randle and RJ Barrett are not scaring anyone. I'll get downvoted because of the Knicks circlejerk in here, but in 2 weeks when the Knicks get swept in round 1 ya'll will see what I meant."
I trust Jimmy Butler in the playoffs way more than Julius Randle tho. Would love to see Randle prove me wrong
"Julius ""Siakam 2.0"" Randle"
Not sure I’ve ever seen a player more shook by the playoffs than I have in the increasingly poor decisions of Julius Randle
Julius Randle looks completely out of his element.   Why force a baseline drive on top of a posted up Taj Gibson?
"Not saying KD made a mistake joining the Nets, but man, imagine if he was on the Knicks. Feels like Julius Randle is the most important person in NYC right now"
Don’t hunt fouls trae Julius randle young
Julius randle drawing fouls
 I told you guys. Julius Randle he’s a good player but he overachieved. He’s not THAT dude
Julius Randle channeling his inner Josh Smith
Randle looking like New Orleans pelican Julius Randle
His Airness — Julius Randle
Best=Julius Randle. Young exciting=RJ Barrett. Vet Beast= Derrick Rose. MVP=Frank Ntilikina.
I just started a Fuck Julius Randle chant at Publix. Everyone around me looked confused asking “who is that” and one lady was wondering if that was the purple lizard guy from Monster’s Inc. Security told me I needed to leave.
Arent Julius Randle and Rj Barrett like top in minutes per game?
"Hawks fans need to make a chant saying ""Fuck Julius Randle"". Scream at him in the streets when they see him. Call him ugly all over social media. Just to even up the smack talk.  Won't happen though."
"Yet when I say ""fuck Julius Randle"" people get mad and say I'm wrong for that."
he'd have to share it with future All-NBA selection Julius Randle!!
I was sad when the Lakers let him go. I’d be lying if I said I knew he would have turned out this great though. Really enjoying this Julius Randle arc. Hope the Knicks have a good run.

"as a nets fan in NYC area, it definitely is annoying.  nets could very well be on their way to a championship and sports radio talks more about the knicks who are possibly on the way to a 1st round exit if not sweep.  nets have all time great players and callers want to talk about Julius Randle.  there was even a discussion for 40 minutes one day of whether Randle deserves MVP consideration.  Julius fucking randle?!?!  knicks fans are idiots anyway obviously"
I would sacrifice my own life for Julius Randle.

"Luka, cp3, jokic, Lillard, curry, embiid, giannis, Westbrook, zion, julius Randle. That's 10 right there. I could name a few more that for this season was better. Once again saying for this particular season. And that's not even including LeBron, AD, and the Nets big 3 due to games missed this season"
"So happy to see Julius randle grow as a Lakers fan. I knew he can be a great player, just he played too fast for his own good. He needed pieces and coach to help him grow. Hopefully he can continue this success."
"Man I'm so happy for Julius Randle. I'll admit I was hard on him when he was a Laker with his tunnel vision and left hand dominance, so I wish I could say I always saw this in him, but I'll eat whatever words I said. He's turned into a straight baller."
Never knew how big Luka was until I saw him play live against the Lakers a few years back and looked to be the same height and width of Julius Randle and I was like woah.
And this year's not playing for Luke Walton award goes to... Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson!  Lonzo Ball is winning MIP next year confirmed.
If you’ve watched the NBA back to the tape delay days and college since Magic/Larry plus play for 40 years you see it pretty obviously with watching a game or two focused on that player relative to the competition then projecting that to other levels.   Then again I thought Harold Miner was going to be a big NBA star.  Then again I fully expected this year from Julius Randle.
"For sure. To be honest the ""Fuck Trae Young"" chants didn't even really bother me. It's playoff basketball in the garden. A certain level of toxicity while maintaining an undercurrent of sincere cordiality (as you noted in your experience) is just part of it. I've said my fair share of rude shit to Knicks fans over the last few days. It's just part of it.   But legitimately, the NBA is better when the Knicks are good. And how could anyone possibly hate Julius Randle? Dude is great. I don't hate the Knicks or Knick fans. Its all love from me (even when I'm being an ass)."
"A friend of mine said he think Zion will be a better Julius Randle, I just don’t think he anticipated them both being this good."
I remember when yall called him Dubious Handles instead of Julius Randle lol. The growth has been awesome.
"Randle asked to be renounced the day after LeBron signed. The Lakers signed Rondo with the cap space. Ended up working out for both parties, though. Wish Julius the best."
Fuck Julius Randle
Julius Randle is the only player in NBA history to **AVG 20-10-5** for a single season while shooting **at least 40%** from 3 point land...  ...besides Larry Bird  That absolutely blows my fucking mind.
"I don’t the Lakers make moves for a single ring, and D Lo, Jordan Clarkson, and Julius Randle weren’t traded for Davis, so what the fuck are you talking about.   Stop it 5"
I can't imagine the ceiling of Julius Randle with hops though lol. MVP?
"Julius Caesar Randle, consul of the knickerboxers"
"The turnaround from ""I fucking hate this dude, trade him for 2 second rounders, whatever gives his minutes to someone useful"" to ""Julius Randle is going to inherent all of my wealth if I die until further notice"""
"This is too adorable. To think, this sub was completely clowning Julius Randle last year (and his spin moves). Really happy that he took this jump and happy he’s getting the respect for it"
Julius Randle is New York Buroughs MVP not just an improved hooper.
"Julius Randle has been incredible all season  &amp;#x200B;  Who are some other notable MIPs who've made a huge turnaround? Also, where does Randle's season rank among all other MIP candidates from previous years?"
"Stephen A needs to apologize to Julius Randle publicly, Knick fans ain’t forget"
[From breaking his foot in his rookie season to MIP. ](https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/11783195/julius-randle-los-angeles-lakers-suffers-serious-right-leg-injury-opener)  [to Pepe](https://i.imgur.com/ZL519PX_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)  [Randles got heart….and balls](https://pa1.narvii.com/6482/88f37f5abe641b15ca69424accaf68c98fb13081_hq.gif)
D'Lo was a MIP finalist two season ago. Ingram last szn.  JC wins 6th man this szn and now Julius Randle wins MIP.  Those baby Lakers had some game!!!!!!!!  Does this mean Lonzo is breaking out next szn?!?!?
"I mean... our FO cleared 76 million in cap space, to sign julius fucking Randle. It's not really a dig at randle, as much as it was on perry/mills. even if they lucked out, you cant objectively look at that, and say it was a good FO move. mostly because they didn't need to clear a single dollar to sign randle."
"Well obviously SAS is gonna give that reaction, SAS can't predict the future thinking Julius Randle was gonna be the guy to turn the Knicks around. Obviously he can only react to the present and that was his rival team got 2 of the best players in the current NBA and his Knicks got Julius Randle who at the point of his career was still a developing player. Now that JR is doing well, of course he's gonna be hyped about it."
I would sacrifice my own life for Julius Randle
LP last seen leaving City Hall in a Julius Randle jersey.
"My point is, if the Hawks win this series can you really say in totality that Julius Randle had a better season? Their stats were awfully close anyways, their teams finished with the same record. Take that into account as well as past years, and there's a good argument to be made that Trae is clearly a better player. If the Hawks win this series, Trae really *should* be considered the better player, no ifs ands or buts."
Julius randle has all the attention on him as a first option. But to each their own  (Have a great day)
"Siakam had 11 more minutes and played with Kawhi the year he won MIP.  Julius plays 37 minutes per game and takes all the shots lol.   ( I don't think I want to respond much more. If you honestly believe that Randle couldn't face the same hilarious failure and clowning, you're mistaken...)"
*looks at Julius Randle*
It’d be funny if Julius Randle went back to his former self
"Any answer that isn’t Julius Randle is blasphemous. He is averaging career numbers, gonna win most improved. Playing great defense on a playoff team. Has become a sensational playmaker. On the other hand Siakam (who I am a fan of) has not been able to develop his bag and I would argue hasn’t gotten any better from when he was the third option on a championship Raptors team. I hate the bey blade jokes but it has become obviously apparent to everyone that the only move he seems comfortably doing is a spin move. I’d argue their opponents at the end of the game are in the huddle like “which way do you think he will spin”"
Everyone is gonna pick Julius Randle and you know it
"yyaaaaaa, I'm not sure. if you asked me last year, I'd say duh Trae is better than Randle.   but this year... Trae only averaged 1ppg game more than Randle on similar efficiency (Trae actually had a really bad year from 3PT only shooting 34%, while Randle had a career year at 41%. but Trae got to the line more so their TS% are both close)  Julius also made a huge leap as a playmaker and averaged 6 assists per game, to Trae's 9.5, and Randle also hauled in 10 boards while also playing much much better defense than Trae (Knicks were 3rd in the league in defensive rating to the Hawks 21st)  I actually think it's close given Trae's regression in overall scoring and efficiency from last year. I think we will learn a lot from this series, and we'll see how both guys step up in the playoffs, but tbh I think it's a coinflip between the two right now"
Why would anyone give a fuck about that? I don't give one goddamn fuck about Julius Randle playing well in NY even though he came up in LA. If your not on the team who the hell cares.
"Julius Randle, no floppers on the Knicks."
"No.   I hate Trae Young.   Julius Randle has put in a lot of work and seems like a great guy, his son is the best fan in sports."
"I mean, thats just a fact tho lmao... I doubt anybody would rather play the Heat than those 2.. Maybe the Hawks are better, but Knicks are clearly a regular season team. You aint scaring anybody if Julius Randle is your best player"
"So 1 year of playoffs with Julius Randle as the number 1 option and Dolan is in everyone’s good graces as an owner enough to say “you know what, it could be worse”????   That’s not how it works, Tillman bought a team with a closing window and fucked up but there were a lot of things that didn’t help the situation that was there before he got here. These next couple years is where he really becomes the worse owner, but Sarver, Dolan, Gilbert still the worse to me mostly because who the fuck knows owner names except if they’re your teams owner, exceptionally good or exceptionally bad."
LeBron has consistently carried his teams to winning seasons though? I've never seen a player carry his teams to the playoffs and then get the empty stats label.   Julius Randle last year vs this year wouldve been a better comparison.
Ingram broke out on the Lakers before his season ending blood clot.  Julius Randle sucked after he left LA too.
"No they didn't 😂. D'Angelo Russell sucked in LA, Jordan Clarkson got traded for scraps and Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram did NOT live up to expectations."
"No because the Lakers are an incompetent organization that can't develop jack shit. Literally the second D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle left they became all-stars. Jordan Clarkson became the 6th man of the year, Lonzo Ball became a good point gaurd and even guys like Ivica Zubac are thriving."
Julius Randle hol ma diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
"Oh shit Julius Randle, one of the most hardest hitting PFs in the league. BUT I put the team on my back though, fuck it you can't stop me."
Blazers have best chance it would seem on paper. Without Murray they're really just as good if not better than the Nuggets. Maybe they don't shoot the 3 quite as well as they did in Game 1 but the Nuggets just don't have the guards to contend with them.   With the Jazz likely getting Mitchell back for Game 2 it'd be hard to imagine Utah shooting the 3 as poorly as they did in Game 1 even though the Grizz always play hard and are up for the fight.   Hawks/Knicks seems like an even series where the teams swap wins and it's hard to imagine Julius Randle having as terrible as Game 2 as he did Game 1. Hawks could win again but just feels like a 1-1 split is right for that series.   Clippers are the biggest wildcard given their postseason history and if they'll fold again or rise to the challenge. Need to throw PG or Kawhi on Luka earlier in the game or he'll keep torching them. Also hard to see the Mavs shooting 17-36 from deep or whatever they shot twice in a row. Luka might end up doing Luka things though which is why this Game 2 feels the hardest to call.
"Lmao, Hawks win one game and their fans lose their collective shit. Atlanta had the fourth easiest schedule in the league and still won one fewer game than the Mavs. Let’s see how you even handle the Knicks with Julius Randle actually showing up to play. You needed a buzzer beater to win when he sucked. Meanwhile Dallas won comfortably with KP doing all he could to mess it up. Which result seems more likely to be replicated?..."
*Julius Randle goes 5/23 in Game #2*
"Idk the Knicks are the ultimate house money team they literally have like 50m to spend this offseason. For me I see how much Atlanta spent this last year and how much they’re postured to owe JC and Trae and I wouldn’t blame the Hawks front office for being a little iffy on them if Trae doesn’t look like the best player in this series. And I didn’t forget, before you point at Julius Randle I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect his 3P% to regress in the playoffs a little bit and for him to look a lot more mortal."
"With all due respect fuck the regular season. That has to be the mentality if your Atlanta. That has to be how you look at close matched serieses like these as an outside fan. The Knicks are a feel good story this year, but a lot of their contributors are on rookie deals and it’s not a hot take to say their roster is a work in progress with all their cap space. I’ve heard Hawks fans for close to 2 years now talking about Trae being an all star level maestro of offense and if you’re trying to sell me that they should be content by losing in the first round to the Julius Randle experience that’s a crock of shit.   This is where you prove you’re actually class in the guard conversation. Trae’s been numbers since his rookie year. Game 1 was cool. I love that for him. My point was and is ***keep fucking going*** this is where Trae has to just go and handle this series if he’s a top 10 guard in the league. There’s no one in this series that produces his volume of offense, despite his limitations Atlanta’s defense is okay to kinda good. It’s hard to believe in this thing they’re building if they lose to this Knicks team. No one’s asking them to beat Philly in round 2. But to me this isn’t a success if they just lose in round 1 imho"
&gt;Julius Randle was a pleasant surprise  Odd that I literally name the MVP candidate you elude to and I still “ignored him” lmfao.   https://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/odds/win-totals/  https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaneyoung/2020/12/11/nba-win-projections-for-the-2020-21-season/?sh=1998ed0d7cb0  https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/30427736/2020-21-nba-preview-wins-standings-projected-all-30-nba-teams?platform=amp  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-win-total-predictions-for-2020-21-season-lakers-heat-hit-the-over-nets-warriors-fall-short-of-mark/amp/  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-predictions/  Odd how no one reputable that was reporting the nba at the beginning of the season supports your “expectations were the same” claim.   Odd odd odd odd odd.
Yeah I’m sure it’s not targeted at all and we’ll soon see you post about how Julius Randle shot 6/24 when Deandre Hunter is playing so he’s not the franchise star NY needs since we’re going off of one game lmao
"&gt;When he does... please lets me remember that he's still an overachiever, and let's not hate on him.  ""Let me preemptively shit on Julius Randle"""
Which team traded out of Luka Doncic for their starting point guard and spent the most money in the league in free agency last off-season?  Expectations were significantly higher for Atlanta than for New York heading into opening night. Julius Randle has been a pleasant surprise but Trae will always be held under a microscope while he wears an Atlanta jersey. That’s just facts
"A young player being better now than when he was younger isn't exactly the rarest of situations. Every good player who ever played had to have to a year when they first started being great.  The point isn't that I think Julius Randle is great - I haven't watched a single knocks game all year, I have no idea how good he is or will be. The point is that your logic doesn't make any sense."
This is insane. Kobe in 2010 vs Phoenix is a peak that Julius Randle couldn’t come close to even if he could literally fly.
And Julius Randle was more efficient with his shooting this season than Kobe ever was.  Just because a shot is a bad shot for most players doesn't mean its a bad shot for every player.
"Julius Randle has been a huge story the entire season. For me, it's pretty disappointing if the Knicks lose in the first round to the hawks. Furthermore, it's pretty easy to see the narrative turn on him if this happens too.  Pascal Siakam went from leading the #2 seed Raptors, getting his first all star appearance and all nba second team last season to being a joke. The tide can turn really quickly."
Yeah and Kobe lost you as many series as you won. Pau carried the Lakers for the 2010 series when Kobe wouldn't stop shooting.  And that was Kobe. This is Julius Randle.
"Living in Southern California, there's just a big mix of legit Lakers fans who know what they're talking about and another giant population of Lakers fans who are obnoxious bandwagoners.  I saw a *lot* of people with Warriors merch popping up around the area during peak Curry/Thompson/Green/KD era and way fewer Lakers jerseys than usual. But the moment LeBron signed, it was like a sea of purple and gold overnight. I can't blame everyone for that, but so many act as if they stayed Lakers fans the whole time. Then you ask them who Brandon Ingram or Julius Randle or Jordan Clarkson or Timofey Mozgov were and they're clueless lol  I guess you can't knock them for wanting to represent, and at least there's real fans of the team who actually did keep with the team when they struggled. But it's a headache sometimes"

I was genuinely confused when they gave Julius the ball with 0.9 left instead of Rose  Randle had been ice cold all game and D Rose and Burks were hitting massive shots
"I'm not buying the ugly excuse, Julius Randle is ugly as fuck but everyone loves him. I'll probably get downvoted but I still think it's cuz he's seen as Luka's rival. This sub and a lot of white fans considers Luka as the Great White Hope so they need Trae to fail no matter how good Luka is."
Julius Randle
"There's nothing wrong with AD leaving the Pelicans, but he blatantly quit on them in the middle of the season. We've already reached the point where stars can demand a trade, to a specific team, with 2+ years left on their contract. Above all that, AD publicly asked out halfway through the season because he thought he was entitled to join LeBron at the deadline. When the trade fell through, he just stopped playing (It could've been the Pels' choice, but he forced their hand). That team had Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle. They weren't contenders, but AD could've tried to make a run and then just demanded a trade afterwards. He quit on them. And ""That's All, Folks"" was a giant middle finger to the fan base that he just quit on. And then he lied about the intentions behind the shirt!  I don't even care if Pelicans fans have beef with AD. I have beef with him on their behalf."
I mean he was just playing against Grayson Allen lol. Julius Randle? Patrick Beverly...
"particularly considering trae is a point guard and julius randle is a power forward lol. yes, in that case, playmaking is a lot more important than defense  and trae is a game changing playmaker. top 3-5 in the world so. yep."
"I thinks empty and inflated are synonymous, one just sounds a bit more harsh. At the end of the day dude is scoring at a rate comparable to guys like Jaylen Brown, Julius Randle Paul George. He’s not an all star caliber player though, and his PPG misrepresent his actual impact on the game."
"You'd be surprised how many would've thought Julius Randle was better before tonight, some might even still think so."
"If you told anybody 5 years ago Knicks would be the 4th seed one day with Julius Randle as their best player and Derrick Rose coming off the bench, you would’ve been clowned into oblivion.    KD made the sharpest criticism that was on point, nobody wants to come here if there isn’t a winning culture.  The fact we got this far with this team shows somebody took the criticism seriously and we are now effectively working on making a winning culture."
neither is julius randle shooting 6-23 get ya money up not ya funny up
Anybody would’ve been better than Julius Randle shooting a slow motion fade away
"Julius ""Jimmy Butler"" Randle"
"Ya , its why the league sucks.  Lebron, Trae young, harden , Julius Randle,  KD , etc... all get that call.  If that was Dante exum driving on lebron it's not a foul.   Hell it wasn't a foul this entire game.  And the contact was initiated by Youngs arm .  The rules changed the last 4 minutes of that game"
why were they even say F you 1 minute in the game? Knicks fans think thought they were gonna beat the Hawks with Julius Randle as their best player lol
I don't think you can win a title with Julius Randle as your best player.
Like Julius Randle doesn’t run people over like prime Jerome Bettis when he goes to the rim
"Ernie: ""Idk what Spike said to Julius Randle but it didn't really work"""
"Sixers and Knicks. Knicks had cap space, picks, a young core, and good role players, but they didn't anything with it besides Julius Randle"
Really bad player comparisons don't go away and it's annoying. Someone out there is probably comparing Julius Randle to Zach Randolph right now. Or Brandon Ingram to KD. People were calling Schroder the German Rondo when he was drafted. Even the so-called experts will regurgitate this stuff.
"Yea looks like Yao did have 5th metatarsal break, but it was navicular break that ended up being final straw. And after googling looks like a bunch of guys have had them and been fine. So idk where we got the idea that they ruined a bunch of careers. Based on the guys below, it seems like it is definitely not something extreme that always ends careers.  KD and Ben Simmons both had them. Then found this info in an article. Rasheed only one career ending, but he was probably at the end by then.  [More from an old Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/55akho/list_of_nba_players_w_5th_metatarsal_fractures)  Blazers guard C.J. McCollum needed surgery to repair a Jones fracture before the 2013-14 season even began. He didn't make his debut with Portland until Jan. 8, although it's worth pointing out that a similar injury sidelined McCollum during his senior season at Lehigh.  Nets big man Brook Lopez underwent a pair of season-ending surgeries back on Jan. 4, including a procedure to repair a Jones fracture. The other procedure was a ""first metatarsal osteotomy, in which another bone was repositioned in his foot to 'unload and protect the injured area.'"" He missed the final four months of the 2013-14 season. Lopez also suffered a similar injury back in 2011.  Lakers rookie Julius Randle has dealt with a Jones fracture, and had a screw inserted into his foot during his senior year of high school. The injury didn't require surgery over the summer despite frequent speculation, but it's going to be something to watch for the young forward as he starts his career in L.A.  Warriors guard Nemanja Nedovic missed most of the summer, including the 2014 FIBA World Cup, while recovering from a Jones fracture. He's expected to be ready for the start of the 2014-15 season.  Rasheed Wallace's career was essentially ended by a Jones fracture, as he missed four months during the 2012-13 season with the injury before making one final appearance in Knicks uniform in mid-April."
"Celtics   2011 - Norris Cole (Jajuan Johnson)   2012 - Fab Melo, John Jenkins (Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo)   2013 - Shabazz Muhammed (Kelly Olynyk)   2014 - Julius Randle, Tyler Ennis (Marcus Smart, James Young)   2015 - Rashad Vaugh, Chris McCullough ( Terry Rozier, RJ Hunter)   This is a very bad team. Makes Ainge look really good if you look at who was drafted immediately after."
"Weight is def an issue that's going to a lower body concern for him, Jones fracture or no. But big guys had had them and recovered fine. KD, Brook Lopez, and Julius Randle, for example. He's def gotta lose weight if he wants to recover like those guys, though."
"Explains why Julius Randle, DLo and Ingram were better when they left the Lakers. Like Kobe and LeBron are not going to just hand over the reins that easily"
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
"Maybe I'm a boomer but I think Kyrie Irving should be above Trae.   Also it's weird because Kyrie is a point and Harden is a shooting guard, but on the Nets they play reversed.  I also take John Collins over Julius Randle, but again maybe I'm just stupid."
Kemba Walker: Tim Hardaway  Evan Fournier: Marco Belinelli  RJ Barrett:  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle: David Lee  Nerlens Noel: Dikembe Mutombo
"I love how you use 7th in MVP voting as some kind of justification to be considered the best player in the league. You realize LeBron was 9th in MVP voting as a rookie too right? And he was younger and on a worse team. I’m not even going to use that, since it’s pointless to look at backend MVP voting.   7th or 9th in MVP voting doesn’t put you in the conversation for the best player in the league. Dame, Julius Randle, and Derrick Rose were 7-9th last year. You literally get like 10 voters voting for you and that’s how you get 7th. Look at the difference between 1st and 7th and their total points.  Anyways anytime MJ is in his prime, there was no discussion who the best player in the league was."
The first one cuz you want us to choose Julius randle
"Julius Randle would never…! But he is not wrong though, Philadelphia Sports fans are the worst in general."
Nah him and Julius Randle will have to box. One is from Louisville and the other is from Kentucky.
I thought Colangelo said he got the spot over Julius Randle?
"Honestly the only real reason I saw for having Kevin Love in the team was to be a ""center"" with a 3-point threat, but Julius Randle played a few minutes at the 5, with better defense, with great 3PT% as a first option while also not being a whiner the entire season."
"Prejudice and racism aren't the same. What Jalen said was prejudice but not quite racism. I think what he is saying is ""true"" but not the best way to say it. If he would have said nepotism then the quote would have sounded better.  He equated someone no longer being qualified for a job but being selected anyway to how he would view himself in that position. Let's face it, both men and women Team USA basketball is a political choice rather than selecting the best players that want to play for that year. K Love has quit on Cleveland more than once, why should he get selected over another younger American big man? Myles Turner, John Collins, or Julius Randle would have been a much better choice."
I mean randle went to the knicks because they gave him the biggest deal he could get and it’d be an opportunity for him to grow with more chances as the lead guy. Porzingis was getting a max likely anywhere. Don’t blame you for hating zinger of course but acting like Julius came to the knicks for that reason is kinda crazy
"Here’s a better way to ask this; how much better does Julius Randle make the Pelicans vs having Zion? Probably not much and they’re a dumpster fire.   Even in a perfect world where the injury prone guys like Lonzo, Dlo (and to an extent Hart and Nance) one ball amongst these guys will not work."
Julius Randle built different
Can't handle the Randle.  Can't foolius the Julius.
"He was a hell of a defender when he was with us. Luke actually got him to commit on that end. He was our best defender. He’s one of the few guys in the league who can legitimately take time guarding 1-5.   The biggest thing about randle was always consistency. He always showed flashes of brilliance, but he wasn’t focused enough to string it together. He’s doing it now and it’s incredible to see.   Calipari said something about Julius that’s always stuck with me. He said he’s only seen two players triple teamed in college: Shaq and Julius. It took Julius some time, but he’s arrived."
Came to say this! I dunno what the ceiling on that team but it would be really fun to watch a lineup of  Lonzo HartClarkson Ingram Randle with Julius at point center surrounded by some decent shooters go to work
Julius Randle is better at basketball than Luka Doncic!
How did Julius Randle become so good?? I watched last night. Fucker is nasty.
Disappointed that Julius Randle and rj Barrett aren't number one.

Julius Randle is a far better basketball player than Luka Doncic
Yeah you're right this was in no way Jalen Brunson fault for being bad at defense and not scoring any points. He played 17 minutes and had a -20 on his plus-minus  I watched Julius Randle put damn near every single Maverick on the court on his hip and then score so I don't think this was in particular kp's fault
I don't think there was a soul alive who thought Julius Randle would be the Knicks savior until this season and yet here we are.
I've learned that people ask questions like this just to get attention. Honestly Julius Randle himself would probably cringe at that question
"Tyle Herro got a song named after him and has 2.4M followers on Instagram. Bam Adebayo has 748k.  My friends who are not into basketball at all know Kelly Oubre Jr and follow him on socials, but they probably have no idea who Julius Randle is. Oubre has 2M on Instagram, Randle hasn't even hit 900k."
"Fully agreed, I’m glad Grant made it to a team where he can truly shine but Julius Randle just elevated every aspect of his game out of nowhere."
"I thought it was pretty funny that the promotional graphic for this game said ""Randle vs Luka"".  Like, is there another ""Julius"" we might confuse him with at this point?  There are two other Lukas."
"I just love the development of Julius, at UK I was so high on him and thought he’d be a great pro, no questions asked.   I was watching the draft with my college roommates, and at that point it was pretty damn close to a sure thing that Wiggins was the first pick and the Bucks were taking Jabari.   I wanted Embiid so badly over Jabari. I was so adamant that Jabari was not going to be the player he was billed up to be. He was a great scorer in college because of his size and shooting ability for that size. College players that are 6’9” with any semblance of shooting and handling naturally dominate at that level, but I saw that Jabari was slow(er compared to NBA wings) and didn’t have the strength or defensive chops to play the 4.   They all thought Jabari was going to be the god that saved our franchise, and they basically laughed me out of the room because I said if they pass on Embiid, I’d much rather have Julius Randle than Jabari, because he at least has the strength and post scoring to make an impact, and I saw Jabari as Derrick Williams 2.0 (which, I was extremely wrong on that one and thought Williams was going to be better than Kyrie, so this story isn’t to make it seem like I’m NBA Todd McShay).   But anyways; they basically called me stupid because I thought Embiid and Randle would be better than Jabari.  Randle broke his leg his rookie year, and then averaged 11 ppg on 43% shooting in his 2nd year, while Jabari averaged 14 ppg on 50% shooting, the next year Jabari averaged 20ppg (top option on shit team) near the same splits, while Randle was at 13ppg.  They gave me shit after shit after shit like backed up sewers about how dumb I was that I still thought Randle was better. Admittedly, though I still believed in him, I’m stubborn as fuck and wouldn’t change my view that Parker was better.   Even though he just had his 1st 20 point season in what they thought was one of many, and lowly Julius was better at beyblades than basketball.  However, slowly but surely Randle developed while Jabari got hurt, stagnated, and ultimately regressed.   Who knows how Jabari’s career would’ve gone had he not gotten hurt. I, for one, (maybe due to my irrationality and stubbornness of thinking Julius was always better) don’t think Jabari would’ve even been an all-star. He was okay at mid-range, which has now been phased out, and every other aspect of his game was “meh” at best (his finishing ability) to ultimate dog shit tier (his defense).   He would’ve never been strong or quick enough to be a starting 4, even though offensively he wasn’t horrible in that role, but on defense he was worse than syphillis before antibiotics.  Randle on the other hand, is such a graceful spinner that they show his video to teach washing machines how to operate. The rest of his game did a 180° spin and caught up with his spin cycle.  Anyways long story short, fuck you Chris, Wyatt, and Keane. Julius is now an NBA GOD and Jabari got cut by the fucking Sacramento Kings, which Randle would never.  Also moral of the story 2.0 besides sticking it to my roommates, any player that seems like Derrick Williams 2.0 who scores because he’s 6’9” with good but not elite tier athleticism for his height and not many other skills will probably be NBA bench fodder, because he’s no longer the most athletic player on the court, he’s now 10th in that category. Those players just don’t translate.  I know I’m high and wrote a ton for a draft day anecdote, but it’s worth it because now I can proudly yell in my Captain Holt voice “VINDICATION!!!”"
Julius Randle gonna make it imo. Tatum a killer but Randle stats better in almost every category but points while also being a huge part of a top 3 defense.
What a week for Randle.  The Julius revenge tour  34/10/4 against the Lakers the team that drafted him  32/8/5 against the Pelicans his former team   44/10/7 against his hometown team and former All Star forward he replaced on the Knicks  All wins
"You should be, y'all have a good young core, potential franchise players in RJ and Randle (how tf did Julius Randle become an All-NBA level talent overnight), and are peaking at the right time. It looks like you'll be going to the playoffs, and you're a tough out for anyone you face."
"""I've seen things you nephews you wouldn't believe.  RJ on fire off the shoulder on the right.  I watched Julius Randle glitter in the dark near the right elbow.  All those moments will be lost in time, like Mavs tears in rain.  Time to YERRRRR."""
Has to be the frontrunner. Respect to Jerami Grant but the step up Julius Randle has made this season is staggering.
what a game by All-NBA player Julius Randle!
"Julius revenge tour continues.  34/10/ against the team that drafted him  32/8/5 against the team that let him go in favor of ""Julius Randle with hops""  44/10/7 against his hometown team (and essentially the person he replaced as THE guy in NY)   I really love this man so much. Extend him, I want to root for him and RJ for as long as I can."
Okay I don’t watch a LOT of Knicks game but is Julius Randle for MIP a thing people are talking about because like holy shit.
All hail King Julius Randle.  Give praise.
Julius Randle becoming this dominant of a player in his 7th season is an underrated storyline of this season
Julius Randle is who Kristaps Porzingis thinks he is
julius randle
Was that Julius Randle or Erving wearing 30 for the Knicks? That man was a cheat code from start to finish
can you fucking imagine your two best players not being Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
"as a fan of a fellow struggle franchise i’ve been really pleased to see how well the knicks have done this year. glad y’all have a real leader now, it’s insane to see how julius randle has improved this season"
"I can already hear Stephen A talking about it: ""I don't know this for a fact, I haven't spoken to anyone yet, but Max, imagine if Zach Lavine in the New York Knicks jersey, playing in the Madison Square Garden, with a rising star in Julius Randle, under Tom Thibodeau. Oh my lord can you imagine that!?!?"""
"Lol 5 3s for Julius Randle, basically confirms Talen Horton Tucker is shooting 41% from 3 when he leaves the Lakers on his next team btw"
"julius randle playing well warms my cold dead heart, the man has been memed on for too long and is a very hard worker"
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015.

At this point this should just be a main post."
Julius Randle
Julius Randle on some shit
"That 2014 draft has been quite the roller coaster.  A lot of hype early on, and then injuries and bad situations kind of tamped down expectations. But, now, a lot of those players have carved out really solid careers.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2014.html  Embiid, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Marcus Smart, and Aaron Gordon are the top 5 players from that lottery, and the 2nd round had Jokic, Jerami Grant, &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie...  So, potentially, the top 2 MVP candidates, and 4 all stars total from that draft this season. Pretty impressive. Just not who we expected them to be coming out...  Just goes to show you have to wait several years before truly judging a draft. But, we’ll still judge anyway... 😒"
If only they had known that all they needed was Julius Randle.
Zach Lavine and Julius Randle were also in that draft class but it took them some time to become the players they are now.
Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson.
The only broken records here are the all-time worst franchise win percentages for the Knicks over the last few years   I'm sure RJ Barrett and Julius Randle will lead you to 50 wins again someday LMFAO
"The Knicks on defense matchup well against everyone. What Thibs has done is incredibly impressive. They’re near the top of the league in defending the rim and defending the 3 pt line, most of the elite defenses outside of like the clippers and I think off the top of my head Miami? Are either going all in on defending one or the other. I haven’t really watched them much but they have a few guys I’m very familiar with like Nerlens. I think they’re gonna be dogs in the playoffs. They might not advance but they’ll compete against anyone in a series. Julius Randle is a legitimate star talent and he’s a maniac, nobody wants to play them, I can promise you that."
“Julius Randle is the 2020-2021 Kia MVP” is a discussion we’re not ready to have yet

In New York we call that a Julius Randle.
Zion Williamson is just Julius Randle without jumper

He's julius randle with a jumpshot
Julius Randle against former teams &gt; The rest of the league
Julius Randle &gt; Julius Randle with hops
Julius Randle is just Zion Williamson with jumpers
I really liked when Julius Randle played for us.
Julius Randle with hops MEET Julius Randle.
Chris Bosh will forever be the most underrated big man in NBA history. People were really comparing Julius Randle to this guy. Bosh played for 13 years and was an 11 time all star and a 2 time champ.
Julius Randle. Obviously he is because he’s the second best player on the team behind Taj “the Goat” Gibson
"Yes because a 37 year old Andre Igudola is just as good and necessary to his team as a prime Julius Randle. A guy who averages 5-3-3 sitting out for a trade to a contender is definitely as bad as a star skipping games for birthday parties.   A role player like that is irrelevant for a teams success. A star shouldn’t be, but in the age of super teams that coast by on talent alone, it’s where we’re at"
Imagine what you’d say if Julius Randle decided to miss the next two weeks to attend his sisters birthday.   It just shows how super teams decrease competition and drive to win in the league. Imagine Kobe taking two weeks off to attend a birthday party.
"I think it’s more where he got drafted to  Different team he may be utilized more. Thibs doesn’t strike me as a guy to play his rookies much, then when you got Julius Randle at PF Toppin isn’t gonna be used to his strengths too often."
"Julius Randle. Wood has missed too much time, Grant started hot but has faded, Boucher has certainly had an improvement but Randle's growth, especially on his three point shot, means he should take it"
Julius Randle and it shouldnt be close
Knicks vs Lakers. Julius Randle averages 40-7-7 in the final and beats Lakers in 7.
"I've never been a big NBA fan, just liked certain players that overcame adversity or shit like that. I've always been a Julius Randle fan, so I guess ima hop on the Knicks train before it leaves the station."
Julius Randle.
"as a fellow knicks fan, stfu and be happy julius randle decided to be good this year"
"I think it should go to Julius Randle but thats just me, Ill stick to r/NYKnicks."
he's not even better than julius randle wtf
Who's gonna perform better in the 'yoffs? Tingus Pingus or Dr. Julius Randle Park
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
"Your comment read to me as completely sensible yet somehow it spawned one of the most inane discussions I've ever read on this sub, whether or not Julius Randle is ""untradable,"" just hyperbole without any context and only wild scenarios."
"This may sound crazy but there is probably an argument to be made that if Steph is on the knicks instead of Randle our record isn't any better. Talent wise I think if you take Randle/Steph off their teams, most people would probably agreed that before the season they had more talent on their team than the Knicks did.  The argument here is how bad can a team for a player to be still considered a candidate for MVP... which to me shouldn't be considered but it has been in the past.  Steph is obviously the better player overall, but there is at least a discussion on which player is more valuable to their team, which as a knicks fan talking about Julius Randle is cool."
"Fuck the process baby. Results are all that matter. Reality is that trades are always graded with hindsight. Go look at the reaction to the Nets getting Garnett/Pierce/Terry. People thought that was a good trade for them at the time and it is now considered the worst trade in NBA history.   The Knicks signed Randle, Bullock, and Marcus Morris with the cap space created by trading KP + THJ and Courtney Lee. Morris was flipped for the Clippers pick  which turned into Quickely who will make 1st team all rookie if the voters have a clue. Knicks also got Detroit’s 2nd rounder this year in that trade which will be a very early 2nd rounder. DSJ and Charlotte’s 2nd rounder (which will be in the mid 40s) was flipped for Derrick Rose who has improved the team substantially.  Gave up: KP + THJ contract + Courtney Lee contract + Trey Burke + 2021 2nd via Charlotte   Received: Julius Randle + Reggie Bullock + Immanuel Quickley + Derrick Rose + unprotected 2021 Dallas 1st + top 10 protected 2023 Dallas 1st + 2021 2nd via Detroit.  That’s what the trade ended up being for the Knicks. Massive, massive, W.  Fuck KP and more importantly fuck Mavs fans. Luka deserves better than KP but those shitheads don’t. Getting exactly what they deserved after how absurdly arrogant, condescending, and obnoxious they were about that trade."
"I can understand you disagreeing with Sabonis, but DeRozan? You really think Julius Randle is better then DeMar DeRozan? 😬"
Who in their right mind would trade Randle for bam adebayo???  Bam has 3 30 point games in his career... Julius Randle has 31 lol   Like why would you think they are comparable???  Julius is winning MIP player this year and will likely end up 5-6 on the mvp voting list.
Julius Randle has made more 3s this year than Trae Young.   On 35 fewer attempts.
Give it to Julius Randle you cowards
“Ridiculous to compare apples to oranges” says the guy who thinks Julius Randle is in the same league as maybe the most offensively gifted big man in the history of the league  Randle is just starting to scratch the surface of a skill set that Jokic has already perfected
You get All Star Julius Randle back!
"Tom Thibodeau has played Julius Randle and RJ Barrett even more minutes than Jokic.  I hope they all stay healthy, this year and throughout their careers.    Thibodeau has been criticized for playing his guys too much and burning them out over the years.  But playing every game used to be standard, and, as we see in Denver, Thibodeau isn't the only coach who allows it."
The only MVP I recognize is Julius Randle
Julius Randle is the greatest Knick. I love this man.
&gt;julius randle
"Julius Randle is having his best season, he has really good he has shots, he will close this season as a MIP."
"Zion is great but doesn’t contribute to winning yet. There’s a huge difference between good stats and good leadership. Which is why KD isn’t respected they way he’s want to be. Zion is useless beyond the ark currently because he’s stat padding under/ near the hoop and he’s not a center..  similar problem Ben Simmons has. If Ben could hit at all from behind the line we’d be talking about him too lmfao. Julius Randle has always had a pretty complete game. But he hasn’t proved himself in the playoffs yet. So many have great regular seasons then get completely exposed in the playoffs. Dame literally won a single game this past year. Still a great player but durability is a major factor people forget.    To answer your question. I’d trade Mitchell, Luka and Tatum for Jamal. If Olidipo comes back to form he’s a similar player."
Julius Randle&lt;Zion Williamson
The moment people started arguing for Julius randle was the moment Jokic secured it
"then what would you trade a 24 year old Jamal Murray for? Maybe Mitchell but I doubt Utah would do that.  And same goes for Julius Randle, for Zion? Hell nah."
This dude thinks Julius Randle and Jamal Murray are untradable
"six?  Try the Big 3 in Nets, Tatum and Brown (at least Tatum), Lebron and AD, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Randle now, Lilliard, Curry, Booker, Luka, Giannis, Embiid. Murray and Jokic.    That's 16 for ya.  Maybe minus Murray and make that 15"
he's just Julius Randle with hops
Julius Randle Era
"Who's ready for some hardcore analysis to dispel this myth? For purposes of this exercise, I'm going to define the Knicks ""winning"" as reaching the second round of the playoffs. Seems like a fair benchmark that I'm sure Chris Paul would agree with.  From 1946 to 1953 the Knicks were fire! Six at least second round appearances (which were the conference finals in those days), and three finals losses to those pesky Rochester Royals and two against the Minneapolis Lakers (where there were actually lakes), led by ARGUABLY (as in, you are free to argue it) the best big man in Lakers history, George Mikan!  Were the 1940s and early 50s they glory days of the NBA? Probably not! But I'm sure it was great returning after kicking the Krauts' asses in WW2!  The Knicks then suck through most of the 50s and 60s, likely because they don't have Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt, Russell, Oscar, or like the three other guys that mattered or knew how to dribble a basketball at that point in history.  Then in 68-69, those Knickerbockers blow up and start kicking some ass, behind Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, and Dave DeBusschere! Even Phil Jackson was on the bench reading On the Road. Over the next six years, they go to the conference finals every year, and go 2-1 in the finals. The true golden era of Knicks basketball, but how about the rest of the NBA? Kareem got here, the 60s guys were old and broken, but still chugging along, and then everyone did cocaine and no one cared about basketball until Magic and Bird arrived. What are the defining moments of this era? The Lakers winning 33 in a row? Willis Reed or Clyde Frazier (I don't even remember which one!) hobbling out to participate in a final's game? Someone on the Celtics driving a cab? I think the general U.S. populace was either fighting in the jungle or too stoned to give a shit about this era of NBA ball.  Then the Knicks suck or are sporadically (sup Ty) decent over the next 13 years. They're swept in the second round in 78 and 83 and they go 7 with Boston in 84.  So from 1974 to 1988 the highlight of Knicks basketball was one good 47-win season when 1980s Melo (Bernard King) scored a bunch of points. Seriously though, Bernard King BALLED in that Celtics series, averaging 29 on 54.5% from the field. This also happened to coincide with the era of the Showtime Lakers, Celtics, Bad Boy Pistons, and fo-fo-fo 76ers, so actually this great era of ball was in a world when no one cared about the Knicks.  Literally, we still have to endure everyone giving a shit about the Knicks because some guy hobbled out on a bum leg in 1973 and Bernard King gave Bird the business in one series.  88 until 2000 was the second most memorable time in Knicks history, when Ewing came to prominence, Riley came over, they brought in Oak and Mason, and they had a Heisman trophy winner for a point guard. Over the next 12 years, the Knicks make the second round 11 times, the conference finals 4 times, and lose in the finals during an MJ-sabbatical and in the lockout year when the rest of the east was old Reggie Miller and Alonzo Mourning. The NBA in the 90s was great for one reason - Michael fucking Jordan. Sorry if I don't pine for Ewing hitting 12-footers with bad knees and Oak and Mason beating the shit out of Rik Smits and Rony Seikaly en route to a 72-67 win.  And.... the Knicks have sucked since, except for one year when they lost to baby Paul George and Roy Hibbert in the second round. Melo had like 1.5 fun seasons in New York, Amare's knees lasted about 18 games, and Jeremy Lin was good for two weeks.  And the NBA has fucking ruled since basically the 2008 finals, so no, no one gives a shit when the Knicks are good. I hope Julius Randle goes to Phoenix or something."
"Randle has better stats, sure. Porzingis is the better player.  It’s a lot of stuff they got but none of it is good. Headed for a Julius Randle max and the treadmill of mediocrity.  Also most of those assets weren’t from the KP trade. Y’all just roll up subsequent transactions into that one to look less bad lol."
"Listening to the Hardwood Knocks Podcast when they went into why Julius Randle was better than KP last year really hit the point home.  Randle won't be all-nba this year, but he would be a perfect hit in Dallas with Luka as a second ball handler and floor spacer. Obviously the ideal KP would also fit really well, but I don't think he overcomes his injuries and/or his value financially does not equate to his value on the court"
"Julius ""Caesar"" Randle, Uncrowned King of New York City"
"Knicks will be a lottery team (everyone else)  Julius Randle should be traded for a second round pick (Knicks fans, including me, because NOBODY could've seen him committing to improving over one offseason this much)  Timberwolves will contend (lol)"
"That should be added to his nicknames. Julius ""Caesar"" Randle. Amazing."
The only challenger to jokic for mvp is Julius Randle... that’s right.
It's basically the scene from step brothers but Julius Randle instead of Will Ferrell
"I get what you're saying, but Julius Randle also showed much more prior to even this season than Kwame ever did."
How tf did Julius Randle go from blackhole tank commander to arguably a top 10 player in the league (at least in value for his team) in 1 season? Insane
Julius Randle
"A truly healthy Atlanta Hawks team is like, the El Dorado of the NBA this season. Literally at no point in the season has the intended 9-man rotation been available.  I still think we can go toe-to-toe with anyone in the East with... I dunno... 6 out of that 9 available? Assuming two are Trae and Capela.  Also, I can't believe what Julius Randle has become. The man is a problem."

Bout to be Julius Randle
*I want to live in*  *A log cabin with*  *Julius Randle*
Hype for the Knicks bros who have a solid team to root for. But damn if this isn’t the type of quote you see on the top of r/NBA in a few weeks with the title “The Knicks have lost 8 straight since Julius Randle said “New York. We here””.
Im seriously happy for NY fans.  Long time coming.  Who would have fucking thought:  Thibs and Julius Randle.  Dear Lord!
There's no jinxing when you work as hard as Julius Randle does
Remember we used to roast the knicks mercilessly. They were literally off-season shit posts that roped you in to end with LOLKnicks if they make the Eastern conference Julius randle might have well just sprout angle wings because they will treat him like the second coming.   Also before Julius becomes anointed this could have been any free agent. Yeah you won rings yeah you played with your buddy. But you could a been a legend in the garden for years to come.
to me it’s Julius Randle
I may have to buy this mans jersey! Julius Randle has me proud to be a Knicks fan again
"Luke Voit, Julius Randle, Me, and a Log Cabin.  What could be better"
"Oh no, this is the sort of thing where in a week there’s a thread saying “the New York Knicks have gone 0-8 since Julius Randle claimed WE HERE”"
"Idk man I've seen some crazy julius randle 3s, fading corner 3s, stepbacks and lots of games where he's 6/10ish from 3"
Julius Randle &gt; Patrick Ewing easily /s
"Like I told the other person who posted this but deleted for some reason, I will be having hot steamy sex with Julius Randle in that damn log cabin."
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Julius Randle. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Julius. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"Dude. Stop.   9 hours ago, [NBA on ESPN: Julius Randle and the Knicks have the NBA’s longest winning streak](https://youtu.be/cDUnM6iMtyc)  An ESPN vidéo about the [Knicks vs Mavs](https://youtu.be/30BpHdGII8A)  There’s a segment about the Knicks practically everyday."
Who would’ve thought that Julius Randle and the university of Kentucky was going to save the Knicks
Julius Fucking Randle
who tf is going to try and guard Julius Randle i feel bad for them.
Is Julius Randle a legit MVP candidate? Knicks fans say yes and that's more than anything you can say about a Knick in almost a decade.
"Stephen Curry, best player on a below .500 team is considered a lock for an all-nba team and is for some reason being thought of as an MVP candidate.   Julius Randle, best player on a team 6 games above .500 and the 4th seed in the East is apparently not a lock for an all-nba team because fuck logic.  Seems about a right."
So far the only person who I have heard put 'Julius Randle' and 'MVP' in the same sentence was Stephen A.
"I might get downvoted because it will seem like I'm slandering him but I think right now, the New York Knicks should trade Julius Randle at the peak of his value. I love his godlike performances the past few weeks but I feel like it ain't gonna last long (I'm talking about his efficiency coz I predict its gonna plummet hard after COVID is over). I'm willing to take the L if I'm wrong on this one. Peace out."
I think you mean Julius Randle dynasty
"He hits all the checkboxes you want in a player, he's good both on- and off-ball defensively, his help defense is decent, he sets strong screens, and he gets timely stops down the stretch when it matters most. Since Giannis is usually called a 3, I honestly think Julius might be having the best season of any PF in the league right now. Obviously Zion is having a historic season, but Randle is far better defensively atm and is winning more. If you count Giannis as a 4, he's second."
"Remember when everyone meme’d the Knicks for picking up Julius Randle?   Mind you it was not Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irvin, but seeing this feel good story is such an amazing thing for the franchise finally."
"Knicks fans aren't gonna stop talking about this season for decades. ""Remember the Julius Randle year?"""
"Name me one player more deserving of MVP than Julius Randle. Go ahead, i'll wait."
the Julius Randle arc has been an awesome watch
"I 👥 too, ejaculate 😩💀💦 without 🚫 stimulation 💡 when 🍑 i 👥 see 👀 julius randle 👑 , he is a BAD 😡 BAD 😡 man 😎😎"
This is the MVP ladder and it’s undebatable:  1. Brad Wanamaker  2. Julius Randle  3. Alex Caruso  4. Michael Jordan  5. Joe Ingles
"MVP conversation to me suggests a serious candidate, not Julius Randle."
&gt; want to live in a log cabin with Julius Randle  Some weirdo bout to make a fan fic outta this one.
Julius Randle is the greatest basketball player of all time and nothing can change my mind.
I know Randle won't get the nod but is there anyone on the nba rn as valuable to their team as Julius Randle is to the knicks?
I don’t ever want to see Julius Randle again. He’s the fucking terminator.
"At least Steph is having a legendary year but, Julius f'ing Randle is just insulting."
Haven’t paid any attention to the East and the Knicks tbh. This is wild and I’m happy for D. Rose. Also didn’t realize how much of a beast Julius Randle is.
"I like to meme a lot about how good Randle is but this time fuck the memes brobro getting them MVP chants and they don't sound ridiculous  WHAT A GAME BY 2021 MVP CANDIDATE JULIUS RANDLE  \[AND BY ROTY CANDIDATE, THE QUICKS\]"
"I would shit your pants if Julius Randle asked me to, too"
Yo shoutout to Julius Randle and the Knicks! Y'all are fun as hell to watch and Randle is really a man possessed this season
I would shit my pants if Julius Randle asked me too
who is Julius Randle?  in math: my solution ➗  in history: my king 👑  in art: my muse 🎨  in science: my oxygen 💨  in geography: my world 🌎
I'm going to see Julius Randle casually draining threes like he's fucking Steph Curry in my nightmares.
"Funny, I don't want to face Julius Randle anymore"
I want to live in a log cabin with Julius Randle
"Julius Deion Randle (born November 29, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
Julius Randle is my religion.  And I do not want to face Clint Capela anymore.
I want to hear the case for julius motherfucking randle over jokic
"Julius ""stat-padder"" Randle padding his stats again missing the game winner so he could rack rebs in ot smh"
Julius Randle for MVP
That was a very Julius Randle move
Yeah the comparison doesn't really work tbh because Z-Bo was an inside beast while Julius plays more around the floor. Athletic Z-Bo is what you get when you combine Z-Bo with current Randle
"I'm sold, Julius Randle for MVP"
It’s a joke because Enes said that Zion was just Julius Randle with hops
Julius Randle plays like a fat Kobe at times
Julius Randle with hops would be much better than Zion
Not really. Julius Randle is.
"He is putting up great stats and playing well.  With that said, I'm sure I'll be downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but I've watched quite a bit of the Pels this year and Zion is like a more athletic Julius Randle. He basically just bullies his way inside for a layup like he's a smaller, mobile Shaq.  I'm curious to see how he'll look in the playoffs. My guess is that he can be forced out of the paint by certain teams with the right personnell and basically shut down and game planned against."
Are they changing teams no. They aren’t calling up other players asking for a trade and to swap jerseys no. I don’t think there should be anything wrong with Julius Randle making it known he’s not happy in New York and wants to be traded.    If this was a normal job and you mentioned to a co-worker you had applied for other jobs that’s normal. But even stating you were thinking of applying in the NBA is considered taboo.
"To be fair, trading a 26 year old Julius Randle entering his prime who’s absolutely killing it right now, for a 25 year old Kuzma who’s shown no promise of a good future would be a very Knicks thing to do."
Bro if Julius Randle took this team to a championship I'd be on here claiming Jordan got carried and Kareem was paying off officials.

If you include players that have done it within the first 29 games these are the only other players  - Larry bird  - Kevin Garnett  - Julius Randle  My point still stands
"Greatly appreciate what? Do you not look at the box scores? Is it not the same conversation every single day? It's not like a Jordan Clarkson or Julius Randle who do not routinely drop 40 points, that deserves a thread because there's new discussion to be had. It happens MAYBE once a year. But what purpose does it serve posting Steph's box score literally every game?"

Parden me but Julius Randle plays so much better than Zion this season. Its more like Zion is Randle with less skill.
"Thanks to this sub, no matter how well Julius Randle is playing, I'll know him as Dubious Handles."
Julius randle may be one of the Knicks players ever
The Lakers once had all these players together: Julius Randle/Jordan Clarkson/Brandon Ingram/D'Angelo Russell. Possibly three all-stars and one 6th man of the year.
"Mediocre teams lower in the standings deserve 2 All Stars while NY somehow gets none? Nah, Julius Randle is an All-Star."
I'm so happy I get to watch Julius Randle become the good player I knew he would be and get to shit talk my Laker fans friends who thought he was trash.
Were we wrong this whole time? Maybe Julius Randle is just Zion without hops and not the other way around.  Damn.
I love that the Knicks are doing so good this year. And I love Julius Randle
"He (Julius Randle) is (the state of being/doing) playing (participating in an activity, in this case basketball) like (in a manner similar to) the (preposition) PF (power forward, basketball position) builds (characteristics chosen to obtain a specific skill set for a video game character) in (as a part of) MyCareer (NBA 2k video game mode) lol (laugh out loud)"
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"
"You’re not wrong with anything you said and I definitely get your argument. I do think you also have to consider that Bam has had a much larger percent of his shots assisted compared to Randle, which I think makes it easier at time (it’s about 40% for Randle and 63% per BBRF for 2pt shots, didn’t use 3pts since Bam rarely shoots those but for reference Julius is at 86.7% on those). Porzingis doesn’t create as much as Randle on his shots either, at about 73 for 2pt shots and 100% of 3s.  Also Bam dunks substantially more than Randle. I don’t think Bam is a bad offensive player and he’s a sure fire All-Star, I just don’t think he’s had as great an offensive season this year compared to Randle. Part of offense is being able to create your own shot, and Randle is better at that than Bam"

yes and he's gonna be getting it especially after this game. I look forward to seeing 12 Julius Randle posts before I go to sleep tomorrow morning. lol
"I genuinely didn't think Julius Randle with hops was an insult in the first place lol he had bad shot selection but he's always been ridiculous downhill and as a finisher with defensive questions. its a fitting comparison. lol I'm happy for Julius that all the bad shots he used to take are going in now, dudes a monster this year lmao"
Former Lakers great Julius Randle
Give him a couple years and he will be this version of julius randle with hops
julius randle with hops is my 6'7 pf on 2k
Julius Randle is Zion with a 3
Julius Randle is now averaging 22.58 PPG vs the Hawks. That is the most with the Lakers being second at 21.3  Drummond is averaging 16.3 PPG and 14.7 RPG.
Julius Randle is Zion with confidence
Who tf is Julius Randle and what have you done with Julius Randle?
Julius Randle has now made as many threes in a game as Kevin Durant.

Joe Ingles after hitting the game winning 3 pointer in the game 7 of the 2021 finals over Julius Randle
Julius Randle also has the same 3-point percentage as Steph Curry this season. He doesn’t shoot at the same clip but he has really diversified his game this year.
Julius Randle 3rd team?
"Warriors just lost to Steph Curry with 40inch vertical, more athletic Julius Randle and a likeable KD."
? Uh I guess if you want to assume key players like 20 year old RJ Barrett and 26 year old Julius Randle have hit their ceiling then sure that might be a reasonable take. But here on earth we don’t make those wack assumptions
"What? Miamis core clearly is stronger and Boston clearly also. I would take every day in the week Tatum, Brown over R.J and Julius Randle and quickley still has to prove that he is more valuable than Kemba and Marcus Smart. He has a long way to go to do this!"
Crazy to think that just last season I watch a 6 minute compilation on youtube of just Julius Randle turning the ball over in the post. Oh how far we’ve come
julius randle has ruined the game
Lmao someone could do this same shit for Julius Randle. Guarantee someone could cherry pick a bad sequence for him and say “tHiS iS eVeRyThInG wRoNg WiTh RaNdLe”
"Yeah that's why Julius Randle has gotten more hype the last 3 weeks than anything your team has done in the last 3 months.   You clearly know what you're talking about. Just a hint though, a cover of a magazine like the New Yorker is not a good measure of the pulse of NY basketball. Try and make it a little less obvious next time you have no clue what you're talking about."

"Hey AD who do you liked playing with, Julius Randle or Kyle Kuzma?"
"Hey AD, who is your role model in NBA and why is it Julius Randle?"
Bro Julius Randle on the Pelicans was a beast. He would single handily carry those dogshit teams when AD was posted up on the bench. One of my favorite players to bet on back in the day. Not surprised at all that he's ascended.
The fact that Julius Randle will probably finish in the top ten in MVP voting this year is pure insanity. Like wtf?
"You're smiling because of Julius Randle.  You're not breaking things because you are content with competent, exciting basketball.  You're not yelling at your wife because she already left you."
"Hard pass. Obviously KAT is a great player, but I don't think him at 5 with this Knicks team around him (in this scenario without Julius Randle) would put up more than 27 wins this year."
"Yeah this list is super weird in that I can’t tell what it’s supposed to represent. On one hand, someone like Julius Randle has been amazing this year, and definitely top 25 for 2020-21. And then on the other hand you’ve got a guy like AD where, if you look at his current season, does not belong anywhere near the top 10 spot, but if you’re looking at full career there’s an argument to be made. It’s the same with Jokic/Lebron at 1/2, Zion being included and ranked over guys like Butler and Tatum, Harden at 8, etc. I know it’s designed to get clicks inherently, but I have absolutely no idea what they’re evaluating, and that’s why it’s a confusing and bad list.  All that aside I think from a holistic names only standpoint across careers, I think that this is a good grouping of the top 25. Not that it’s in the correct order, and I’d probably drop Randle for Westbrook in a heartbeat, but if you gave me all of these names and told me that they were the unranked top 25 players in the NBA, I’d tend to agree with you."
"no, julius randle still made JC his bitch that time lmao.  but yeah pretty confident we woulda won if trae didnt get hurt"
"As a Queens kid who grew up a Laker fan because of Kobe (and stayed a Laker fan) I hope the Knicks continue to be great like they've been all season. Also I have a HUGE soft spot for Julius Randle, he was one of the OG Laker kids along with DLo, JC, and Lonzo. I loved all those guys and I really wanted a homegrown Laker team to get the chip. Them all finding success on other teams is awesome to watch."
"How is Jrue Holiday on this list when Russ isn't? I mean yes all the statheads (including the Ringer) have shat on him for years, but he's having a monstrous season at age 32, and hell, the Wizards are better for it.   Besides that it just felt weird seing Julius Randle on a list like this lol"
"We had a good discussion about this over in our sub. The game has changed since the early 2010s, and I think the conversation about Thibs' minutes should change with it.     Thibs still plays a short rotation that gives guys like Julius Randle 37mpg averages. However, the knicks also play at the slowest pace in the league. What is worse: playing 37 minutes at the slowest pace in the league, or playing 34 minutes at your new nba quick pace standard where you just fly around at top speed, flying at the hoop since no one can hand check you?    It doesn't really change the conversation about thibs during the Chicago days, but I think there is an argument for saying he is one of the safest coaches to play for due to his preferred pacing"
"I remember the day knicks signed randle, and 17 other power forwards and being so angry, then the following season was complete garbage with julius randle being a literal human beyblade, what a plot twist that this specific knicks team became good loool I would never have guessed in a million years"
Imagine telling someone before the season started that Julius Randle would be compared to Larry Bird
"If MVP truly meant ""most valuable"" it would go to LeBron every single year. This is coming from the biggest Lakers hater ever so I hope that carries some weight.  but fr, you legitimately think Julius Randle is the most valuable commodity in the league right now? tripping"
Is Julius Randle actually better than Jimmy Butler or Kawhi this season though? Like I just dont see it at all
Just came here to ask if anyone else knew Julius Randle is in his second season with the Knicks
"Derrick Rose, Quickley, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and I guess I’d go Embiid over Jokic. But close"

Bruh Julius Randle is 12-1 without Murray
on paper it makes way more sense that with our current mostly healthy roster we'd do better agains the knicks  but.. julius randle has made john collins his bitch every meeting this year and uh that could continue
Julius Randle hands down is an all NBA lock. I say he’s 1st team worthy and has had much more of an impact to his team than Kawhi has. One of the best single breakout seasons since Isaiah Thomas.. let’s hope he keeps this momentum for years to come
"Ehh, Deandre Ayton #1 tier talent, Devin Booker and CP3?   vs. Julius Randle?   It's close, but if the Knicks get end like 8-1 or something I'm voting Thibs."
"Realistically, can Julius randle surpass what Melo did as a knickerbocker?"
Julius Randle
Led by notorious snipers RJ Barrett and Julius Randle haha  Jk Reggie Bullock is the greatest shooter who ever lived
Wowie Julius Randle dropped 34 against the Lakers without AD and LeBron. Hang the banner.
Knicks and Lakers had the same record coming into tonight lmao sorry we can't play in the weak East like ya'll do. Julius Randle is not scaring anybody in the playoffs. Hawks in 5.

julius randle MIP
Julius Randle is MIP solely because he now leads the league in smiling   Source: Mike Breen
julius randle or luka?
Idk but I feel like Zion 2.0 is weird to say like Julius is older and broke his foot his rookie year so that might had set him back a lot all I know is Julius randle are BOTH phenomenal and I’ll take anyone of them on my team 😤🔥
You can't stop Julius Randle you can only hope to slow him down
You cannot stop Julius Randle you can only hope to slow him down
"What about Anthony Davis and KAT?? Also Zion, maybe Bam, Vucevic, Julius Randle? Seems like you may have cherry picked these big men a little bit. The point probably remains though. Just thought it was random you included Bagley and JJJ."
Who's the greatest player of all time and why is it Julius Randle?
"Can't pay attention to you sorry bb, Julius Randle is too busy doling out labor vouchers to the masses who followed him in solidarity."
JULIUS RANDLE ROBBED
"What in the world has gotten into Julius Randle? He looks like prime Kobe Bryant, and I'm not joking. Half of his points last night seemed to come from insane contested fadeaways, turnaround jumpers, stepback falling away mid range shots....and they all touched nothing but net. His growth has been absurd."
Just wrap it up and trade Lebron for Julius Randle so the Lakers can get a real superstar
Julius Randle braids  Russell Westbrook vs Kevin Durant
So what you are saying is...  Anthony Davis or Julius Randle?
"With FMVP Julius Randle, anything is possible"
"Honestly even if you weren't playing as well as you were, Julius Randle is a guy who seems like he takes revenge games very seriously"
Julius Randle took the hardest road by having 14 other superstars on his team smh
"Oh you want to play this game ok. Let’s start off with Julius Randle, he’s averaging 24/10/6 on 46/42/80 splits and 57 TS% leading the knicks to the 4th seed currently.   D’Angelo Russell is averaging 19/2/5 on 42/38/78 splits and 55 TS%. He’s been unhealthy this year but he’s been a good secondary star to KAT.   Brandon Ingram is averaging 24/5/5 on 46/38/87 splits and 58 TS%. He’s not a good defender but he’s a great offensive player on a young pelicans team.   Lonzo Ball is averaging 14/4/5 on 42/37/78 splits and 55 TS%. He’s been playing like an elite role player this year and last year. He’s been getting better every year so there’s no reason to doubt he won’t get better.   Kuzma is averaging 12/6/1 on 43/46/68 splits and  54 TS%. He’s clearly taking. Complimentary role since AD arrived and I love that he’s accepted his role. He went from a good scorer to a role player who tries to do a little of everything. He’s a good team player.   Jordan Clarkson is averaging 17/4/2 on 41/34/92 splits and 54 TS% and is a main part of one of the best teams in the league  Larry Nance and Jason Hart and really good role players as well.   This sub said Russell, Lonzo and Ingram were bust but they’ve all turned out to be good players. Randle has even exceeded expectations and is playing phenomenal. Maybe we as fans of the team watch them play more and therefore we have a better understanding of how good a player can get.   You say Laker fans over value their young guys but show me a fan base who doesn’t."
Plus future MVP Julius Randle
It would’ve...but Brodie and THIS Julius Randle would be fun to watch

***Null and void this thread***. Julius Randle not found in this conversation???????
Imagine telling us 2 years ago that Julius randle will be mvp candidate
"Dude, you can't be serious. I get that you are proud of your guy, and trust me, that guy got me to watch the Knicks with same love I had for them since Melo days. But don't be delusional and say shit like ""Julius Randle will likely surpass Jokic next year, if he has a leap like this year"".   Jokic has leapt every season since he came into the league, and is still heavily discussed who is vetter, him or Embiid, since the common sense in the league that those guys are the best centers in the league. And you can't ignore KAT, who is going through a lot of shit lately, and still putting more than decent numbers. AD is PF in my mind, but If he's considered as center, do you really believe that Randle can leap above all those guys? Don't make yourself a fool because of recency bias.   Once again, I would love to see Knicks shine... But Randle doesn't have more potential than Jokic. No matter how you are bias, you should realize that."
Untill Julius Randle gets traded for a second rounder to create cap space to sign Oladipo to a max deal
There is no MiP candidates. There’s the far and away winner Julius Randle and people who got kind of better
Julius Randle does not have an MVP candidacy lol at best he gets one or two 5th place votes
Julius Randle is better than Zion williamson
"Not Julius Randle, he had 9 months to practice"
"Literally doing what nobody on this planet ever expected him too. And has lead and propelled our nearly identical from last season team into the East top 4.  I am not smoking crack when I say Julius Randle is ARGUABLY Top 5 MVP candidate.  I feel like I should, cause I still can't believe this shit lmfao."
"Jokic averages 26/11/8 compared to Randle who averages 24/10/6. Jokic obviously has the efficiency gap, but Randle is the better defender.  Look, I’m not saying Julius is better right now. He isn’t. What I’m saying is he has the potential to be better than Jokic in the future. If he makes another leap like this year, it could be as soon as next season"
Are y'all ready to make Julius Randle a 35 million per year player?
Here's a fun fact for you: Julius Randle has a better case for MVP this year than Lebron James
Julius Randle just got MVP chants in Houston when he was introduced  Knicks fans are everywhere
"Oh of course.  Glad to see certain guys carry the torch in a sense.  Felt the same way about Julius Randle taking the whole team to do impromptu shoot arounds in high school gyms when they land in a new city like Kobe did for him.   I've just never been comfortable with people constantly bringing up ""Vanessa said..."" because they saw one redditor say something and it blew up so now they think Vanessa doesn't ever want to see a Kobe highlight again.  1000s of people who never tried to find a source or anything.  Its just been a pet peeve of mine since that post came out."
"So I used to hoop... a lot. Even won the hoop it up.(These young bois dont know!) So I know what it takes for development (developing a left hand ain't easy).  Anyway,  Seeing Julius Randle develop a jumpshot literally pisses me off about Ben Simmons(Similar to Lebron earlier in his career... idk why I keep using parentheses). Imagine Ben with Randles jumpshot. Ben dont wanna put in the work and it's maddening.   Like bro, be better."
My boi Julius Randle. Even New Yorkers still haven't bought his jersey. They owe this man their playoff run but nope I see no fan wearing Randle Jerseys
"He shouldn't it's Magic's name when people say Magic nobody thinks Luka Doncic they think Magic Johnson. 2 years that's a long time, Magic Johnson has been Magic for 47 years. Luka deserves his own nickname because he is his own player. What's next are we going to call Zion King Z? Ja The Answer Morant? LaMelo The Truth Ball? Pistol Trey Young? Julius Dr. J Randle? The legends of the game deserve to be respected."
"&gt; he's improved the suns by 11 wins compared to last year, so far  The Suns are on a 59 win pace, compared to last year's 38 win pace.   The Knicks are on a 56 win pace, compared to last year's 32 win pace.  So I feel your comment is disingenuous, implying that the Knicks had a much better improvement. The Suns improved more overall and reached higher heights, while the East teams just got so much worse. The Suns are doing it in an insanely tough conference top to bottom, while the Knicks are improved in a historically top heavy conference.  Look at what teams they've overtaken in their conference seedings to see that the 2 teams don't belong in the same sentence.  &gt; randle is averaging 24/10/6. and nobody thinks randle should be 2nd in MVP voting  , while improved, was also here last year when the Knicks were bad. The Knicks' improvement far far transcends Randle's improvement.  Meanwhile, CP3's addition is clearly the biggest improvement for the Suns, and his impact is obviously elite, backed by the eye test and every advanced stat.  &gt; might not even be the best player on their own team  That's only arguable if by ""player"" you mean pure scorer, and you never actually watch the games instead look at the box stats  I'm not even arguing CP3 for MVP, but don't you dare mention his name in the same breath as Julius fucking Randle"
Next is probably whoever is playing well for the knicks at the current moment so Julius Randle lol
"Cause fans like to watch good players play NBA games? Julius Randle missed 1 game this year, RJ missed 0. Our guys play hard every night and no one complains about having to play. Our guys get hurt during games and come back later if they can. Fans love to see grit and hustle. Losing teams having mediocre players take games off? Lame as hell man"
"Tatum and Mitchell will win 2 'ships with the Knicks with Julius Randle, all three will go into the Hall."
"CMV: Julius Randle will win MIP, DPOY, MVP, FMVP, 2021 NYC mayoral election, 2024 presidential election, and eventually become supreme imperial leader of the NWO after the 2032 Great Fall."
"He is still 21, could turn it into like a long career if he gets more efficient.  Christian Wood was garbage until like two years ago, Julius Randle was not stater quality for a while. Kevin Knox won't be those two, but dramatic improvement at age like 24 or 25 is still possible if he works at it"
Andrew Wiggins is shooting 38% from 3 this year. Julius Randle is shooting 42%. Joel Embiid is shooting 37%. Stop it.
Could you have said that last year.  This year is such an anomaly for him defensively I’m only going to assume it’s a scheme thing.  Guys like Julius Randle who have been poor defenders in the past have played great defense this.  Can you say with confidence that if Thibs weren’t your coach these guys would defend at this level.  To me a great or even good defender is somebody who you can drop on a random team and they produce the same results regardless of the coach or surrounding teammates.  Berlin’s is an excellent defender we’ve seen it in other situations.  Rose is a good defender we’ve seen it elsewhere.  I’m not ready to anoint someone based off of one good season of playing great defense that we’ve never seen from them before.
"He's -.51 on D-Lebron too. Yeah. I guess what we can say is that he's not garbage. Tbh the few times i watched him, his offensive upside far outweighs his defensive woes. Against the Knicks he had OK D on some possessions against Randle but Julius was just too fast. He's a step behind right now  I wouldn't worry, he's a generational talent on offense, and his defense has a LOT of time to improve"
"What’s he supposed to say? “Yeah we suck, we’ll send you to NY to get carried by Julius Randle.”  That wasn’t a even a situation on people’s radar."
Julius Randle flashbacks
Lakers have Lebron and AD. Knicks have Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson.
I think it's neck and neck with Cp3 and Julius Randle for MVP.   Hopefully Jokic can win Most improved player.
"Lmao, on NBAtv they legitimately asked Channing Frye who is higher on the mvp ladder CP3 or Julius Randle"
They are not a 2nd round East team lol.  They make the Playoffs though.  I know Julius Randle killing it on the East inspired you to make this post but you’re underestimating how good the Knicks are defensively.  DAngelo &amp; Ingram are god awful defensively. This team is worse than this years Knicks imo.
Paul George and Julius Randle.
"Yeah if someone doesn’t make the playoffs of course they shouldn’t win. But you have to wait until the season is over to say the warriors won’t and the way Steph is playing right now I think they will. But I don’t even think Steph is mvp, definitely more valuable than Julius Randle though"
I compared pre-Max Wiggins with last season Julius Randle before Randle took the step from high volume low quality offense to offensive star. The potential was there but I didn't really believed that he would get make it.  I am usually skeptical about players taking that step. Most players with the potential to take that step don't take it.  Deandre Ayton is useful for a contender as a role player center.   Other players that should have been better than they were: Jeff Green  and Monta Ellis.
"yeah. Kyrie and Durant have the total scoring package. While monsters like LeBron or Kawhi or Steph might have either the 3 point shot, the rim or the midrange or a  mastered duo of those, there is not a lot of players whom I'd trust from all 3 places and still consider them great scorers. Harden might be there, but he shoots too few midranges. Same with Steph. Kawhi isn't as unconscious from 3, even though he has the percentages (this may be because of reputation, he IS a decent shooter) but is excellent in the midrange and at the rim. Durant and Kyrie are just pick your poison guys. While you can stop Kyrie by playing super physical (good luck lol), how do you stop KD? If you clamp him up he'll just shoot over your head. You can reach his shot, he'll blow by you. The guy was playing on one leg and still sank 11 points in the 1st quarter against the raptors in game 5. He was shooting over Siakam, Ibaka and Kawhi (Kawhi had blocked a 3 point shot from Klay at some point). I still think of what he did to rookie Julius Randle (sauced him with incredible moves [link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcEC5dHKTl4) ), how is that even possible at this height ? KD is surely one of the players I'll give a standing O after he hangs the boots."
"Curry is probably the best player in the league at this moment, but he damn sure should not be ahead of julius randle. They are the tenth seed and 1 game under .500. how is their value with that?"
Julius Randle does deserve All-NBA...third team
It’s hard to say because the narrative has swung the other way so hard with the recency bias but I think a healthy Lamelo would have been a lock in the same way that Randle is a lock for MIP. There are other players who have improved but not on the same level as Julius  Lamelo is the better player on the better team. Obviously the missed time throws a wrench in to that though. It’ll be interesting to see what form he comes back in when he’s healthy
A week ago people in our sub were saying they would much rather have Julius Randle. Bunch of nephews
"julius randle (all star) is literaly having a worse series right now.  klay’s entire 2017, Mitchell vs the rockets, westbrook last season against the lakers.  I know butler wasnt great but this isnt the worst in a while, a couple stars have terrible series every season"
"Shit, that's Julius Randle numbers"
"Take a swinging bow from a 6’8 250 pound Julius Randle and see if you don’t react or even stay on your feet, tough guy."
"whats with the excuses? Trae is in the exact same boat, but hasn't shrunk for even a second in this series. Nah, Julius Randle just doesn't have it"
Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle  Who has been more disappointing?
you the last guy to be talking. julius randle is shooting 24% against the hawks lmao
Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle.  Who is the LVP of the playoffs so far.
"Again, most rational people are taking joy from his struggles. OP is not taking major stances on Julius Randle. He is just saying he doesn't like the excuse of first playoff series. Your opinion of the sample size will not change after win playoff series if they lose in five games. It's going to take multiple playoff series for him to get the stigma of him coming up short in the Big Moments.  And I don't know what you're talking about but there was a huge fight for him coming into the playoffs. He averaged almost 40 points against the Hawks during the regular season. The talk was that no one could guard him on the Hawks. I don't know what world you live in where the best player on the team doesn't get the blame if they lose a playoff series especially if they struggle."
Lol let's see what happens if Julius Randle punches you in the face dipshit
Julius  “do a 180” Randle
"Potentially, don’t see how that’s related to your point that Julius Randle is a bad basketball player, but ok."
Kevin huerter doesn’t guard Julius randle tho
"You're still downplaying the defense that's being played on them. Shutting down Randle so far, a guy who avg 37 against us when all we heard b4 the series is who is stopping Julius. And ppl keep saying we've been doubling, we're not doubling, we're guiding him into help defense (basically just Capela), which is completely normal. Gallo is literally staying in front of him alot of the times, bodying up so he can't just drive past. The Hawks team in total had 12 blocks in game 2. I was still always shocked when Julius was making all the stepbacks that he did this yr, couldn't believe that it was sustainable. Every shot means so much more in the playoffs and those are tough for him. As much as he is stopping himself, the hawks have a HUGE part in that. We've been contesting every shot greatly that isn't wide open. D Rose is just fucking amazing.   Let's just face it. Julius and RJ are just not that great. And I don't think they will be (unless RJ develops a great turnaround in the future or something). Both don't have enough natural basketball touch, they're both force players. Julius is trying to be a dribble god, and trying to be a finesse playmaker right now and it's just plainly NOT him. And It's hard to watch. But that's what's making this all so satisfying, we were spit on (figuratively and literally) by fans and the ""experts"" and now I'm hearing excuses. But thats what good stand up defense will do to you when ur jumpshot isn't falling. He isn't a natural shooter or playmaker (he has always been able to pass, yes, but he's not a playmaker). The Knicks are VERY limited on offense, player wise and scheme, but i wasn't hearing any of that b4 the series. So I think the Hawks just need some credit right now"
For some reason Julius Randle playing poorly in the postseason has led to them crying
Randle made the most shots from the baseline out of anyone in the nba this season. https://www.thestrick.land/strick/how-kawhi-leonard-dna-is-all-over-julius-randle-2021-emergence-knicks
"&gt;Have you ever played basketball before? Getting an elbow happens.  So that means you could easily find a similar clip of a Hawks player throwing an elbow into the face of a Knicks player from this series then right?  I mean, if it's common then there *must* be other footage of cheap elbows that aren't just Julius Randle being a dirty player.  Now's your chance to prove it."
Julius Randle lookin like Bubble Siakam out there.
julius randle has been incredibly disappointing
Theres an APB out for Julius Randle
"Except for Julius Randle, he’s so scared by having fans back"
Tell that to Julius Randle and Paul George
"Julius Randle is shooting 5/27 on open shots this series, there's nobody else to blame."
"He is half assing though.  So many easy pick and rolls for the hawks because Julius has his hands by his side walking around like he owns the place.  His body language sucks right now. I'd have more sympathy if he looked like he was trying, but it's all low effort bullshit reverting to last season Randle at the worst time."

"For what it's worth, Bogdan just got a new fan today. He took that hit like a champ! No complaining or nothing, just a quick confused reaction and then back to slay mode. Julius Randle is not nearly strong enough, to put a dent in that serbian iron-jaw, even if he really tried."
"Julius ""Julian Newman"" Randle"
"If D rose is going to be their best player, there's no way they're winning. I'm a D rose fan but he's not in his prime anymore and has suffered too many injuries, he's still a great player. Just not the one to lead a team anymore, he's a supporting role now. The other players need to step up.. cough cough(Julius bum randle)."
The Knicks are not a good offensive team...they don’t have offensive threats...Julius Randle got hot during the reg season...but be realistic is he that style of play was not sustainable and Clint is not letting him get anything at the rim..outside of rose who’s an actual bucket getter on the team? No one and the playoffs exposing that...also Julius isn’t gonna turn around...he’s showing everybody what typa playoff player he is
Julius Randle looking like a G-League player out there
Julius Randle &gt; Trashzingis
"Siakam has shown that he can be good in the playoffs before and at his worst he's still a great defender.    I feel like Julius Randle is one of those ""bubble"" all-stars but I mean, we'll see how he improves next season. But he was shooting 40% from 3 this year and that seems wild."
Thems Julius Randle numbers
Hawks Legend Julius Randle
"Julius Randle, you better start taking notes on what Jayson Tatum just did today. This is how you should be playing after 2 previous terrible games if you want people to respect you as a 'star' player"
Julius Randle looking Pascal Siakam like in these playoffs
Julius Randle ain’t a playoff player apparently
I can assure you I’ve watched Julius Randle more than you have. You don’t know what you’re talking about
"I think Tatum and Booker are the two players that remind me the most of Kobe's scoring game  EDIT: Oh and also Julius ""The Beyblade"" Randle as well"
"Knicks fans chant ""F- Trae Young"", Trae Young lights them up.  Hawks fans chant ""Overrated"", Julius Randle can't respond."
The Hawks have turned Julius Randle into a complete non factor. If we even had the Julius from last year show up to these games we would be better off
"That is... literally what fans do. How is putting shit on social media anywhere near ""bananas"". You really think it's beneath the *poor, scrupulous Hawks fans* to do the same about Julius Randle playing like ass.   Nobody has gone bananas. This is how the playoff works. You seriously sound like someone who's new this whole sports thing. So, let me tell you this. It gets worse."
Julius Randle is just trying to win Most Improved Player next season too after his performance in the playoffs so far cause holy fuck he’s been awful
Julius Randle is shitting the bed this series. D. Rose with the carry job.

"Julius Randle, more like Julius Blandle amirite"
"Julius Randle ain’t it, chief."
Some people on Twitter really think Julius Randle had a better year than Zion: https://twitter.com/jjmaples55_mst/status/1396620479591436290?s=21
*Coach Thibs' message in the locker room:*  I'm gonna call out your name and call you trash  Rj Barrett... YOU'RE TRASH  Elfrid Payton... YOU'RE TRASH  Frankie boy... YOU'RE TRASH  Julius Randle... oh my gosh I better not see your name on any All-NBA list. YOU'RE TRASH! If I see your name on an all NBA list I might have to kill somebody.
Julius Randle had 8 FTAs and Nerlens Noel had 12 FTAs (randle went 8/8 and Noel went 10/12)... the entire team in total had 30 FTAs (making 27 of them)  the Hawks has a TEAM had 8 FTAs...  How did the Knicks lose by 11 points???????
Julius Randle turned back into a pumpkin after the regular season ended.
Julius Randle playing scared definitely not helping either.

julius randle is a mental midget. fitting to be the leader for this soft ass knicks team and fanbase 😂
Some players are just built for it  Trae Young is  Julius Randle is NOT
It is so sad that Julius is struggling. Rose would have been his wingman even if RJ had struggled. But RJ's struggles clearly stem from Randle not creating more space with his offense.
And Julius Randle is on pace to shoot 30% for the series 😮‍💨
Lmaooo Julius Randle is a role player on the road

"Julius Randle is 12/48 from the field in the playoffs with the Knicks. Even for 3 pointers that is beyond dreadful, from the field it is just unspeakably bad"
"Nate McMillan, there is a way to beat the Knicks. Please watch any Knicks game. You need to stop RJ Barrett and Julius Randle by having the guard defend Derrick Rose and the big man drop to intimidate Randle. If he or RJ takes a shot, that is a win."

Whoever wins this series will lose to Philadelphia but damn Julius Randle ruined this series 😭😭😭
Obis been playing better than Julius randle low key
someone locate Julius Randle please
"Hawks have some weapons yo.   This series does highlight 2 things for me though.  1) As great as Julius Randle was this year, he's not a star/superstar. He's a guy who is all-star/fringe all-star depending on year, which is great, but he has limitations.  2) The Knicks overachieved (which was obvious), but their lack of firepower has been glaring and it only made the spotlight on Julius to carry them larger. ATL is not allowing him to beat them and are fine doubling to shut him down. There's not enough left between everyone else to make up for it."
[Julius Randle when there are fans in the building 🔥🔥🔥](https://i.gyazo.com/353819a6ab3ac7437157c2c8970aeea4.png)
"Thibs has gotta be creative and make some adjustments. Call a screen and roll play where D Rose dumps it off to the rolling Julius Randle, who collapses the defense towards the rim as he kicks it out to a wide open Derek Jeter for the corner 3"

"Wait, so you're telling me Julius Randle isn't actually a superstar??? Knicks fans told me he was!!!"
"They were one of the hottest teams in the NBA towards the end of the season, they were shutting teams down on defense and Julius Randle was playing extremely well. His play right now is basically the reason the knicks have been looking so bad and Trae Young smoking us lol"
Julius “Jimmy Butler” Randle
Please be on the lookout for Julius Randle. He was last seen during the regular season.  [Missing poster](https://imgur.com/a/1Jf2aSb)
Second elbow from Julius Randle to a Hawk's players face this series
Only a moronic bandwagon Nets fans would be stupid enough to actually think that Julius Randle shot 57% from the field this season. Googling “Julius Randle stats” is pretty difficult to do though so I can’t really blame you here.
Julius Randle an all-time fraud god
its called choking  look at how all-star julius randle is playing right now when the pressure is on
Julius Randle tricked the whole league
Hahaha imagine trying to build your team around Julius Randle
Julius “stupidly locked in” Randle
Lol I thought Julius Randle would have a good series based of their regular season head to heads. I was way off!
It’s funny to think sometimes that the Knicks are built around Julius Randle

Julius Randle looks like some random 3rd stringer getting minutes. He's actively destroying his team.
The only thing worse than Trae Young’s hair is watching Julius Randle play basketball
Julius randle really trick y’all man
Julius Randle needs to cut the shit and stop settling for 3's when he's ice cold. Get your ass down low and build back your confidence man

He can join Julius randle if he keeps playing as bad as he is right now
Julius Randle is playing how I would expect high volume Julius Randle to play having not watched him in a couple years. What made him good this regular season?
"Julius Randle isn’t a 7 footer, good one tho.  He’s also easily better than Tingus Pingus, do you wanna remind him that he’s allowed to cross the 3pt line?"
Analogy: TNT’s halftime show is regular season Julius Randle; ESPN’s halftime show is post season Julius Randle
Thanks Julius Randle for forcing me to watch Jimmy Butler in back2back days
Julius Randle is a meme stock

What’s a bigger transformation: Julius Randle from Most Improved to a garbage player? or Antwaan Randle El from QB to WR in the NFL?
"Guys, I think Hawks fans may think Julius Randle is rated higher than he should be."
Fucking Julius ‘Foul Hunter’ Randle getting SO MANY weak fouls it’s ridiculous
"First Knicks game I watched I knew they were garbage. I don’t blame you for it. Believe me, I’ve rooted for a lot of overachieving teams who’s weaknesses I refused to acknowledge. Knicks are definitely that type of team. Julius had a great season, but overachieved, which js relatively common. Playoff Randle is who he actually is"
Julius Foul Merchant Randle
Maybe Julius Randle is just another Russell Westbrook. The Peyton Manning of the NBA. A regular season guy.
"Julius ""Harden"" Randle"
Julius Randle murdering the knicks - one of the worst playoff vs regular season performance differentials ever
Julius Randle is fucking awful. Its a miracle that he played well enough this year to get so much media hype
Julius Randle aint built for this holy shit
Julius Randle makes the game 10x harder than it needs to be. Start inside then go outside or something before you start flinging up Kobe Bryant esque shots.... just a thought lol
I’d rather have Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs than Julius Randle
If Julius Randle doesn’t shoulder his way to the bucket and stop taking that midrange
"Siakam was better against us than Butler, people hate on him too much. The only answers I can come up with are 2019 Kyrie vs. Milwaukee, 2011 finals LeBron (considering his status at the time), and some of DeRozan' Toronto showings. Julius Randle is giving him a run for his money though but I wouldn't put him in that top 15 player tier like people have placed Butler"
Porzingis and Julius Randle both bounce back with big games.
Julius Randle is hardly a star and I love JR. Before this season he was never though of as more than a mid-tier player at best with flashes.
Julius Randle has been worse during his current series
Julius Randle is probably neck and neck with him. He's been brutal this postseason.
Julius Randle?
Julius Randle rn
"&gt;Seeing everyone lose their minds over Julius Randle and the 2021 Knicks getting home court in the playoffs proved me wrong.  People tend to become fans when they're young and stick with that team for life. The Nets just moved to Brooklyn as far as that time scale goes. Even with one of if not the best team in the NBA, it's going to take a while before they build a fanbase there."
"PG has just had enough big moments where he has done outstandingly bad to deserve the nickname.  With that said, we need to not be so biased with who we make fun of. We all hate PG so we all make fun of him. We all love Julius Randle so we just ""hope he figures it out"". We need to shit on anybody who just disappears in the playoffs. It's part of being a fan."
He should be. The convo will go like “damn Jokic is gonna be MVP.. hey Julius Randle is doing good himself huh”
"I think he deserves to be in the conversation.  ""Julius Randle is not the MVP""  .  There you go"
Julius Randle is giving him a run for his money.
Julius Randle is pretty damn happy Butler shat the bed like this. Taking some attention off him.
Julius Randle is looking worse
The Knicks had Julius Randle who is perfect to hunt the switch but they couldn’t due to the Hawks scheme...
"Sorry, Dubious Handle is the nickname for Julius Randle, the guy who absolutely shat the bed just now in the playoffs. Should've been clearer"
"Gonna rub the salt in the wound for my man, Coach of the Year snub Nate McMillian:  Pacers fans, are you convinced you made a mistake now? I'm sure there's some excuse, like you don't think the Knicks are good or something, but it should be clear now Nate McMillian was not the real reason the Pacers couldn't make it out of the 1st round all those years.   Nate McMillian's scheme and mid-series adjustments were superb, big reason they won the series so dominantly. After game 2, he switched up the rotation (something Pacers fans said he wouldn't do) to keep either Bogi or Trae always on the floor and it worked wonders. His gameplan for Julius Randle and D. Rose worked wonders."
Julius Randle is a regular season player. Knicks still have a lot of work to do.
I guarantee Julius Randle is a one season wonder and will regress back to his shitty beyblade play next season. Knicks will be clowned once again as they give this guy a max.
"[Here's](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/julius-randle-knicks-plan-to-discuss-contract-extension-this-offseason-per-report/amp/) a good read about the contract situation. Based on the weird rules, they can't give him a huge contract, only extend him. If he accepted the extension, he'd be like the 40th highest paid player. That's a great deal for the Knicks. He'd be better off betting on himself and getting a bigger deal next offseason."
"Julius Randle is just like Kawhi, except in every single detail."
"Julius Randle has a bright future and will bounce back, but holy shit how often does he just stumble into the paint and chuck the ball over a teammates head or at their feet?  Even the passes that didn’t end in turnovers were situations that could have been a wide open shot that turned into a shooter having to save the ball or completely readjust allowing the defender to close out better. The pass doesn’t have to PERFECT but just any accuracy at all and he has 4 less turnovers and 4 more assists."
"When that Julius Randle vs. Bosh conversation started, I was befuddled"
Yo I could've sworn Julius Randle was 7-19 when the score was like 80ish-70ish Hawks in the 2nd or 3rd period. Did this man really only make 1 more bucket in a half/period??? Damn!
"Orange Julius  No handle Randle  Remdesivir Randle  Johnson and Johnson Julius  Julius Boozler, The U  Still love you my guy"
Great question. I have to say Jimmy Butler and that’s because Julius Randle does not have as much talent as Butler. Randall played to the best of his abilities but was shut down by the Hawks defense whereas Jimmy Butler showed out last season and we know he’s capable of doing it.
"Don’t care, still had another veteran all star to take the load off of him, along with Fred Vanvleet, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka. Compare that team in talent to this years Knicks lmfao, Julius Randle has to be the #1 guy every night and is the guy the defense game plans around.   You can’t compare that to a guy who’s playing with two allstar teammates, one who’s a mega-star that carries the load every game. Julius is getting game planned for, Pascal wasn’t.   Also, what time does Pascals team play today?"
Julius Randle imo
So he shot worse than Westbrook from the field? Where are the grand declarations saying that Julius Randle can’t win a championship unless he comes off the bench then?
"Yea Julius Randle got clamped by the hawks, that's his point lol"
Yes I’m sure Julius Randle would play terribly as the third option behind Kawhi and Lowry lmfao. This is literally like saying Derrick Fisher is better than X point guard because he has 5 rings
Julius Randle King of NY ladies and gentlemen.
"Julius ""All-NBA, All-Star, MIP, MVP candidate"" Randle versus Trae ""that's not basketball"" Young."
"Yes I’m sure Julius Randle would play terrible if he was the third option behind Kawhi and Lowry lmfao, that ring is meaningless in this discussion"
"It’s the East, they played a team led by Julius randle lol."
Julius Randle tricked y’all.
Julius “better than Trae Young” Randle
Trae Young and Julius Randle? Yeah thats cool.  Lets talk about DeAndre Hunter and Clint Capela!
At least the Knicks know what they need in the offseason and it ain’t Julius Randle
"Julius Randle went from averaging 37, 12, and 6.3 on the Hawks to averaging 37/12/63   He burned 160 million in his future in less than 2 weeks of game time there's governments out in the world that can't burn through money that efficiently like that"
Julius Randle put up 20 upvote party
Is Julius Randle the new pandemic P?
Julius Randle thought his MIP award stood for Missing In Playoffs
"Julius Randle  can't handle the ball, can't post up, can't do anything. Can't play defense. The man cannot play the game of basketball, he has small hands, he can't catch the ball. He's got bad feet, he can't really move, eventhough he's mobile, doesn't really know what he's doing. Doesn't have a post move that he remembers or puts to memory that he can do twice in a row"
Ok but how are the Hawks going to handle Julius Randle
Julius Randle before the series start: I'm stupidly locked in
Nobody has ever called Julius Randle a superstar.
Faces of the Knicks franchise:   1. The fan who spit on Trae Young   2. Julius Randle   3. Tracy Jordan's wife doing a bump of coke courtside.
Lmao imagine giving Julius Randle a Max contract hahahah
TBH former Knicks legend David Lee is better than Julius playoff fraud Randle.
Things this series will be remembered for: 1. A Knicks fan representing his fanbase by spitting on Trae Young 2. Julius Randle shitting the bed.
Julius Randle playing like this makes me really wonder what the Knicks front office does with him...   Because you can’t just ignore the regular season he had. BUT.... come on man he’s been terrible
WHY IS JULIUS RANDLE IN THE GAME
Man get Julius Randle out
RJ Barrett has always been inefficient so I’m not surprised but I’m shocked at this Julius Randle meltdown
The actual fuck man Julius Randle with the 7 TOs
Yeah that problem’s name is Julius Randle. Guy just choked this whole series
They’re getting clamped by Hunter and Collins with Capela waiting in the paint. With no offensive strategy to get better looks or even target Trae Young. They’ve been game planned against because their strengths are few and very obvious.  Julius Randle had Young guarding him 1v1 on the perimeter and he passed the ball because he didn’t even notice.
Maybe you guys could sign someone like Julius Randle in 2022
Someone said Julius Randle playing basketball is like when a football player tries to play basketball and I can’t stop laughing
"Last year, Julius Randle was given the nickname Beyblade. He would drive, spin and take a bad shot or turn the ball over. He looked much better this year, but has seemed to regress to his old form during these playoffs."
Like Julius Randle effort.
Dear lord Julius Randle thinks he’s Trae Young TAKE IT TO THE HOOP BRUH
Julius Randle is a fucking clown
Randle shoots. Clank.  Julius Clanking Randle.
My pizza slipped out of my hand paying tribute to Julius Randle.
"Thibs pull Randle please. Get Obi out there, let the ball move. Every possession is just give to Julius-&gt;bad shot/turnover"
What’s going on? What is Julius Randle problem.
Julius Randle losing tens of millions of dollars this series Jesus
I was surprised they didn’t arrest Julius Randle for this. That basketball could have injured him.
The way Julius Randle played this year is what I think a 42 year old Lebron James will play like.
Who has a better jumper? Limu Emu or Julius Randle?
I’m not a knick fan but these refs sure do shit on Julius Randle non stop. It’s fucking crazy haha
Fuck Julius Randle
The stuff Julius Randle does annoys me the most. Guy is trash so he tries to stay relevant as you say by doing dirty shit acting tough. And bullock because he seems fake as hell lol
"i didnt watch julius randle at all this past season but heard about him all year. All I can say is nothing about him shows me he would be a teams #1 lol, he'd be a solid #3 on a team  and he's been a bitch this series"
"Julius Randle drops the ball on Trae wow, and Noel starts the whole fucking thing. Disrespectful as fuck"
Trae and Bogi with their best Julius Randle imitation. 0-8 from 3
Julius Randle is fruity asl   He fits NY culture pretty well tbh
its really amusing watching Knicks fans who have never gotten into a fight before assure me that Julius Randle is a legitimate tough guy.
The fact the Julius Randle nearly won MIP in a near uncontested fashion is just more proof that the medias boner for LA or NY based teams will never go away     Playing this poorly and being dominated 1-4 by a team that isn't overwhelmingly better screams overrated
Uhhh. Julius Randle is straight dog juice.
"How is that a flagrant, but Julius Randle throwing bows wasn’t?"
Julius Randle is average at best
Imagine how good Julius Randle would be if he was good
Have you seen Julius randle drive?
Haven’t watched much of either team this year. Is Trae Young considered better than Julius Randle?
"Did he call Julius ""Yulius Randle"" at some point in the 1st quarter?"
Julius Randle starting out hot with 10 points and 4 TO on 3-8 shooting. Can he keep this up?
"Julius Randle with the ugliest stat-filled quarter ever... 10pts, 8 reb, 4 TO, 2 fouls"

Julius Randle has awful shot selection
"I just think the NY media gets too hyped about itself.  If Julius Randle were playing in OKC or Charlotte, he'd be a nice story.  But because he's in New York, you have some people seriously suggesting he'll be discussed in the MVP race."
"Are we calling him Jullllius Randle, Julius Randlllle, or Jullllius Randlllle?"
"I do not know if you have watched any of Hawks-Knicks games but if you have, you should clearly see that Atlanta is a much better basketball team than New York. Trae young is playing better than Julius Randle and Derrick Rose.  The Knicks have poor offence but good defence. The hawks have good offence and good defence.  However, The New York Knicks might win today at home if Randle and RJ Barrett show up. In that case, Atlanta Hawks can win game 6 in Atlanta."
Julius Randle
"Exactly.  Yes I'm super salty the Knicks got spanked this series but taking a step back and seeing how this team performed, it's an overwhelming success.  Knicks weren't even supposed to be here.  If you told me at the beginning of the season that this team will make the playoffs off of a Julius Randle All Star season followed by Barrett being a solid #2 I'd laugh at your face but here we are."
Julius Randle
was Tyson Chandler a Free agent? Amare Stoudemire? Felton? Julius Randle? Derrick Rose?

Julius Randle with hops
I am just of the feeling that you can’t get farther than second round w/ Julius Randle as your best player. I just don’t see it…no hate tho….
Julius Randle is going to get absolutely obliterated on here if he has to ride in Derrick Rose’s backpack again
"JR is just not suitable for Julius Randle, and it never will be"
He is worse than Julius Randle at this point
"You can say that about any player, you can surround Julius Randle with NBA caliber players and he's doing way better than AD.   AD should be dominant no matter who is on the floor. When Jordan had trash players he averaged 37 a game and took them into the playoffs. When LeBron had trash players he took them to the Finals. When Kobe was alone, he averaged 35 a game. Harden averaged 36 a game. There is no reason why AD shouldn't be able to dominate a random game and drop 50 if he has to."
Julius Randle
"Kemba, Julius randle, 4 future firsts, and Rj Barrett"
"It's really true. Guys who can't space the floor or guard on the perimeter eventually get played off the floor against certain teams. Most guys like that are really large, and can offer some post scoring or defense to compensate for that, but Trez really doesn't. Trez in a lot of ways resembles Julius Randle before he got a good outside shot."
Is Julius Randle the best player in the NBA? Half joking.
"Yes and he was MVP caliber in the East, lottery in the West just as Julius Randle."

"Embiid has the 1st seed.  Butler-Lowry the 2nd seed.  Caruso, Ball, Lavine the 3rd seed.  KD on one of his worst teams (bc Harden has been neutured) 4th seed.  Julius Randle the 5th seed.  Beal, Harrell, Kuz the 6th seed.   Sexton the 7th seed.   The East is still weaker than the West.    Lebron, AD, Luka, Jokic, Mitchell, PG, CP3, Curry, still ain't close."
"Certain Knicks fans can put the noose down now, he's still Julius Randle lol"
"This is what separates Julius Randle as an all-star compared to just a good player. Very low shot clock and he doesn't settle, spectacular finish!"
He kind of plays like Julius Randle but craftier.
"You rank SGA over...Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Gobert, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Booker...even Julius Randle should be pretty firmly above SGA right now.    Like I'm sorry man, that just makes zero sense at all based on any metric at all."
"There's been some speculation on the Lakers sub that agent Aaron Mintz hates our front office for how we treated D'Angelo Russell and Julius Randle and that was a factor in another one of his clients, Paul George, not even speaking with us during his free agency."

"Christian Wood didn’t wanna be there. He didn’t want to play for a spot in summer league so they let him walk. As for Julius Randle, why would we pay him when we just got Zion?"
He traded away Christian Wood for a 2nd rounder that off season and let Julius Randle walk as a free agent.  What a series of events.
"Have fun with the formatting:  LAMELO BALL HAS has already seen the future.  Two seconds earlier, he watched [Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers) center [Jarrett Allen](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen) vault over [Mason Plumlee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee) to tomahawk a ferocious slam to give the Cavaliers a nine-point lead three minutes into the second quarter. He saw the Cleveland reserves on the bench rise in exaltation, scream hysterically, flicking their white towels. He heard the Quicken Loans Arena crowd roar its approval.  ADVERTISEMENT  Still, optimism flows from the eyes of Ball. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees it: [Miles Bridges](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066383/miles-bridges) sprinting down the middle of the floor.  Before the Cavs' reserves can even sit down, Ball [hurls the ball 80 feet down the court](https://youtu.be/a1Fjk_s52Sc?t=171) over all five Cavaliers and directly into the hands of Bridges. It's a Sunday afternoon pass on a Friday night, one that's thrown in what seems like a different time and space.  Less than four seconds after Allen picks himself up off the floor following his throwdown, Bridges drops the ball through the opposite hoop with a reverse dunk.  ""He really is a basketball savant,"" says [Charlotte Hornets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets)' teammate and 12-year veteran point guard [Ish Smith](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4305/ish-smith). ""You watch him make these calculated-risk passes, and I'm like, 'How did he even think about throwing it like that?'""  Sheer chutzpah.  A 20-year-old with nothing more than an abbreviated NBA season on his résumé has the audacity to stunt the opponent's momentum with a pass that couldn't possibly have a success rate leaguewide of greater than 10%. Tracking platforms with probability scores -- eat your heart out. For the second consecutive game to start the season, the Hornets are behind early to a middling opponent. And for the second consecutive game, Ball is poised to drag the Hornets by the scruff of their necks back into the contest.

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward [Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and [P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington) could make jumps and add to production provided by [Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from [Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics) a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ￼Through the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3. Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like [Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks), [Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons) and [Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic) all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Some NBA point guards might extend a middle schooler their mercy, especially if the kid is the boss' son. But Ball doesn't temper his competitiveness. As he sizes up his teenage combatant, Ball delivers the trash with a smile.  A crossover to the hole elicits a shimmy from Ball, one returned when his teenage competitor drains a shot. Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity. Something that those who delight in amusement when they hear about the pro baller not pulling punches in the sweetest exhibitions against the most adoring minors can never understand: There's no such thing as turning it off.  Once the afternoon Carolina heat thickened to a stew, LaMelo, his brother LiAngelo -- Gelo to everyone present that afternoon -- and a friend jumped into the Borregos' pool, where they continued hooping with the Borrego kids under rules modified for water.  On the surface, there's nothing odd about the scene -- a confident LaMelo and his brother playing backyard camp counselor. But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
Build around RJ for sure Ive been saying Julius Randle was a bubble merchant and once the crowds were back hes been trash. RJ is the best player on this team.  Honestly If we can trade julius and stuff for paul george id be ecstatic. RJ and Mitch are the two clearcut best players on the team in two way impact.
Julius Randle body language has been fuckin terrible
Julius Randle shoots when she shouldn’t and doesn’t shoot when he should lmao
"they didn't fail AD, they paired him with demarcus cousins who had maybe the best season of his career before having a career-derailing achilles injury.  then they signed julius randle which was a pretty forward thinking move considering he won MIP and was all-nba 2 seasons later.  just it was overshadowed by AD's drama about wanting to go to LA  you have literally no idea what you're talking about"
Hell no.   In the worst case scenario the Celtics can trade Tatum &amp; Brown for a LARGE haul of picks and restart with their rebuild. The Knicks have to pay Julius Randle a max contract this offseason and RJ a huge contract the season after.
"**Knicks**  **Immanuel Quickly:** IQ, Jesus’ Son  **Derrick Rose:** D Rose, Windy City D, Pooh, Every Rose has it thorn  **Julius Randle:** Beyblade, Big Julius, Don Julio, Orange (&amp;Blue) Julius, Randle wit da Handle,   **Taj Gibson:** Hard Hat, Lunch Pail, Taj Gibson  **Kemba Walker:** K Walk, MJs Son  **RJ Barrett:** Baby Face Barrett, Hesi-Step-back-pull-up-Maple, StarJ,   **Alec Burks:** Alec Tre-Bruk,   **Obi Toppin:** Obi Wan,   **Evan Fournier:** French Phenom, French Toasty,"
"The Good:  -  This team is definitely much better than last year with upgrades in shooting and other ball handlers to take pressure off Randle.  -  RJ Barrett.  The Bad:  -  This team can't close a game for shit right now.  Horrible turnovers along with just turning into a dead paced, all iso, offense that's too easy to defend.  -  Julius Randle is looking pretty rough.  Shooting hasn't been too good and he's making a lot of bad turnovers.  Still making great passes to open shooters but gets pretty careless.  This team needs him to find a rhythm to really get going.  Overall I definitely like this team way more than last.  They definitely made the improvements they needed from last year.  Now it's all about everyone finding their role and locking in.  This team is just too damn likeable and fun."
The same Julius Randle that went from the Pels to leading his team to the 4th seed right behind Giannis &amp; receiving MVP votes.
The same Julius Randle whose career high in PPG only increased by 2.6 points when he came to the east?
Julius Randle lol.
"It's only more even now that KD/Harden are there &amp; with Kawhis injury, although Harden got screwed with the rule change, &amp; I'm referring to dudes like Julius Randle being able to go from the Pels to the Knicks and getting the 4th seed with MVP votes.  Btw Embiid got locked up just 2 years ago by Gasol while Giannis struggled mightily to barely beat one of the worst teams KD has been on in his career."
"So far this year the Bulls have used Derozan a lot with the 2nd team, where he kind of plays the 4, sort of, except that DJJ or Troy Brown covers the better of the forwards, leaving Derozan to do what he does. In crunch time, yes, absolutely, he plays the ""4"" and they do some really big-time positionless basketball out there. I've seen Lonzo Ball covering a team's top forward in that situation - he was lined up on Julius Randle down the stretch vs. the Knicks, for instance. Zach Lavine has also kind of lowkey started playing good solid defense himself and so, again, Derozan gets to cover the least effective player 2-4 there (Caruso handles the 1 / point of attack although even there the Bulls have not been afraid of doing some ""blue"" coverage of him on bigs, by which I mean putting him in between the ballhandler and the big man when the big is in the post to deny him the ball).  I will say that part of positionless ball is that very often it's the guy who plays the ""4"" who is the less effective of a team's 2 forwards offensively because the other guy is a wing. So in that respect, sure, if you were to log his defensive matchups you'd probably see like 50% of those going to whoever is considered the 4 on the court. And of course, this is mostly what he did last year with the Spurs as well: basketball-reference lists him as 69% ""PF"" last year, though the same positionless caveats apply."
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there’s still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who’ll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."

i swear to god i’m gonna lose it next time i see someone say we can make some noise in the playoffs. a team with julius randle as its number one option will never go anywhere.
very much solid. He's had to matchup with 3's and 4's and has held his own. I especially liked his matchup with Julius Randle at NY. He really held his own when Julius opted to play bully ball.
Lol no team with Julius Randle as its best player is ever getting out of the second round let’s be real.
BING BONG     *Julius Randle has left the game*  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  seriously he did fuck all after the first quarter....
Julius Randle after the first quarter: 18 points  Julius Randle the final 3 quarters: 4 points  That's horrible and just very difficult to do for someone who is the focal point of their offense.
I BETTER NOT CATCH JULIUS RANDLE IN REXDALE
#IS JULIUS RANDLE VALID???
"#JULIUS RANDLE LOOKS LIKE MY DAD'S DICK. I NEVER SAW MY DAD'S DICK, BUT HE LOOKS LIKE SHIT"
"i'd prefer that than Julius ""shoot 30% in playoffs"" Randle"
"Julius Randle at the line, looking like he's seen some shit."
Julius Randle is just that dude that no matter what he gona score on u or bound over u he just got the ideal all around game and the slight edge over his opponent
Julius Randle would be their best player and funnily enough I'd put them on the same level as the team he's currently the best player for(like the 5th seed)
"It's futile but I also really like trying to predict MIP, because despite often the winner being completely out of the blue there's a set of guidelines that *feel* very intuitive;  * The player will be in at least their third season (second-years rarely win) though likely fourth or later * The player will be in a position where they have a new, or bigger, role (just moved teams, a significant teammate has left, a new coach has come in, etc) * The player will not be older than 30 * The player will already have some ability to score * The player will not have been averaging more than 20ppg  And, to me at least, all of those seem about right and if you follow those steps you tend to come up with a surprisingly small list of names who usually appear high on the betting odds and show up in the MIP candidates throughout the season - see Jerami Grant last season, for example. And I do all that and feel really smart when Jerami Grant is in the conversation, but it's always a case of Julius Randle being like 'Hey I shoot the three really good now', or Miles Bridges is now suddenly taking twice as many shots as he did last season despite the roster being largely unchanged except actually they *added* a lottery pick and their nominal star player returned from injury."
"Nah, he's a hoss. He's better than Julius Randle."
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I’m not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It’a a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he’s been with the Hornets he’s drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte’ Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
Julius Randle the scrappy MIP from Dallas Texas
[We got Julius Randle as Buzz](https://i.imgur.com/L9K4MtT.jpg)
We gotta start treating Julius Randle like the superstar he is
"At the very least, can I convince anyone that Gobert had a top 10 regular season last year? I'd have personally put his season in the #6-8 range. A number of the league's best players missed 15+ games in an already shortened season, including Harden, KD, LeBron, AD, Embiid, and Kawhi.  It's pretty safe to say that Jokic, Curry, and Giannis had incredible seasons. Embiid finished second in MVP voting despite missing 21 games, but he was tremendous when he was active so I can understand it. Then MVP voting had Doncic, Lillard, and CP3, followed by Julius Randle, Derrick Rose, then finally Gobert in tenth.  Most all-in-one metrics last year had Gobert as a top 10 player, and in numerous cases, as the #2 player behind Jokic. WS, LEBRON, EPM, RAPTOR all suggest he was one of the best in the league, thanks in part to a league-leading +/-."
"We got cap space and without that cap space we don’t sign Julius Randle. We won it, but we still should have gotten a lot more for Kp"
"Yeah but what about the fact that RJ was better at every step of his career. People take things without looking at context as well. Scottie is definitely having a better start to his NBA career and just to be clear I’m not trying to shit on him. However, let’s take a look at some context around RJ’s NBA career thus far. Most top picks come into the NBA on a lottery team where they are given the keys as soon as they put the jersey on however the year RJ was drafted the Knicks had signed Julius Randle and gave him the keys instead. The Knicks head coach was a clown named David Fizdale who not only was a incompetent coach but a damaging player development coach. Fizdale and Co broke DSJ jumper and forced RJ to change his jumpshot (which he reverted back to last year and shot 40% from 3). The 2019 Knicks had some of the worse spacing of all time and for a rookie slasher you can see how this would cause some problems. So people look at his rookie season a bust but ignore the incompetence in the FO and coaching staff and the horrible roster construction filled with selfish veterans. Last year was great for NY but once again RJ faced similar issues with Elfrid Payton as the starting PG and a non offense factor big in Nerlans. The paint is packed again for a slasher but RJ made up for it by becoming an elite spot up shooter. Finally, we come to this year. This is the first time in RJ’s career that he has legitimate spacing in his career. He has started out slow and YET he is shooting 77% at the RIM! Meaning that for the first time a slasher has the ability to slash without multiple bodys in the paint and he is thriving. Yesterday was the fully fleshed out version of RJ. A elite scoring 2 way wing with the ability to play make at a high level. Literally the most valuable player you can have in the NBA. So all that to say I’m taking RJ."
Just like Julius Randle lmao
Giannis averaged &gt; 6FTAs that arent from drives.  Julius randle averaged 4.8 FTAs that arent from drives  Zion averaged 5.7 FTAs that arent from drives
"Dwight Howard is simply too goofy to be taken seriously as NBA's resident political maverick. The guy who said Zion is ""Julius Randle with hops"" on the other hand..."
"That's where Julius Randle comes in... I'm with that guy, Knicks look goooood this year and I'm happy for them."
Need I remind you of Julius randle
It's still an NBA experience.   Julius Randle played in one game and got injured and that was considered his rookie year. Do you think he got to put his knowledge into use and take advantage of that training?
idk i we said that about Julius Randle too
I understand why and I know it's happened in the past like with Blake Griffin. I just think it's dumb that they can be on an NBA team sitting on the sidelines for a year and still be considered a rookie.   Especially since Julius Randle only played like 20 mins and got injued his first game of the season and that was considered his rookie year.
"This is why it's hilarious when the Mavs have bad nights against AAU superstars like LaMelo, Trae, and Julius Randle."
Reggie Bullock was arguably your best shooter. Kemba Walker is currently shooting over 58% from  3. D Rose us currently shooting over 54% from 3.    I’m not sure I’m ready to expect the 40%+ 3 point shooting from last season of Julius Randle and Barrett as an expectation. Seemed flukey to me—especially Randle
"&gt;And why don't you put a little respect on Julius Randle, he averaged 24/10/6, and that's in 1,100 more minutes played than Embiid. If that's not a ""real star"" idk what is.  Show his playoff stats bro 18 points and more turnovers than assists and he could not even reach 30% from the field lmao"
"Let's see if he plays a full season first buddy, but hey at least you can fall back on Ben Sim - oh wait. And why don't you put a little respect on Julius Randle, he averaged 24/10/6, and that's in 1,100 more minutes played than Embiid. If that's not a ""real star"" idk what is.  🧂🧂 Here, take your salt back you must've dropped it."
Our next best Power Forward is either Derrick Jones Jr. or Javonte Green. How do you think they could handle defending Julius Randle?
"It is because Julius Randle playing selfishly and forcing things at the end.  He didn't like Lonzo guarding him, thought he could take him every time.  So he demanded the ball.  Then when he had gotten his 9th assist he was triple double hunting and the offense boiled down to JR kicking it to three pt shooters instead of just find the open man."
No Julius Randle ofc

The Warriors have won three championships in those seven years. Julius Randle could turn the ball over 20 times a game by himself for all I care if it would somehow get the Knicks even one championship.
"Haven't seen any Lakers fan on this thread yet, so Julius Randle or Caruso"
"I don't think it is with KCP but it can be both an expanded role and playing better for players.  There are players who get a shot to have an expanded roll and they come up big. Julius Randle,  Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler come to mind"
Julius Randle is absolutely gassed at the end of every game. The massive minutes Thibs demands from him surely take a toll and contribute to his late-game struggles.
"Come on, man...did you actually watch the game?     We GAVE the Bulls that comeback because we're fucking dumb when it comes to crunch time.     Julius was shooting like shit the entire game and then ISO'd the entire 4th quarter, meanwhile, RJ Barrett only got like one shot off despite balling his ass off in prior quarters.     I guarantee if Randle didn't have a shit game and we actually passed the ball to RJ, the deficit would NOT have closed the way it did."
Julius WTF??? Giving me Lakers Randle flashbacks holy
"Yeah, he's starting the season like it's his turn to be Julius Randle. Sigh."
"God Randle pisses me the fuck off when he screens. Dude rolls one step after kemba gets a screen from him, and then Julius just stands at the top of the key. His off ball movement is horrible."
Excuse me I’d like to file a missing person report- his name is Julius Randle
Julius Randle
Julius Randle will finish top 3 in MVP Voting
Hit take: Julius Randle 2022 MVP
"Maybe if Julius Randle wanted to win this game as much as the TNT crew wanted them to, they might’ve won"
"Nah Julius Randle being hot garbage decided it.  He’s their star, gotta step it up"
I think we can say that this is the Julius Randle we were expecting coming into the season. But he has shown too huge of an improvement to regress back to his old self. Hopefully he bounces back next game
Julius Randle is the Knicks best player along with D Rose. It's a success nomatter what
Call me a homer but I'm never giving Julius Randle a big shot over Derrick Rose
"Julius Randle played just as well in Game 1 as Jimmy Butler and Anthony Davis, Knicks fans must be ecstatic!"
If Julius Randle shoots better than 27% we win this game. GG Hawks
" Knicks are trash as always, Julius Randle showing he isn’t made for the playoffs. Hawks in 6"
"Julius ""Anthony 'Jimmy Butler' Davis"" Randle  Damn...we're getting a lot of poor shooting performances by superstars so early 😅  Anyway, great game by both teams. I think they are evenly matched up and the series could easily go to seven games. I love it when ""new"" teams qualify for the playoffs, so it's nice that either of them will go to the second round after missing the playoffs last year.    And yeah...Burks is CLUTCH af! I was surprised that jumper didn't go in at the end."
If Julius randle DIDNT go 5-21 the knicks woudkve won
JuLiUs RaNdLe MvP
Julius randle had a bad night
Julius Randle channeled his inner Wiggins with that brick
"Julius ""Andrew Wiggins"" Randle"
julius randle wtf
"Does Julius Randle ever go below the 3 point line? Haven't watched any knick games this year but I always thought of him as an inside type player. But this whole 4th qtr he's rarely stepped past the 3 point line, not even to go for a rebound?"
"Who would have guessed that Knicks would be carried back to relevance by Julius Randle, post injury DRose, and Alec Burks"
ALEC BURKS &gt; JULIUS RANDLE
"I hope the Hawks win, Julius Randle doesn't deserve to see this win"
JULIUS LAZARUS RANDLE
Is Julius Randle a playoff choker?
Broke: Julius Randle  Woke: Alex Burkes
Julius Randle doing his best Playoff DeRozan impression
Lebron is just a glorified Julius Randle
julius randle needs to chill
"Hey KD  You hear that crowd during that Knicks run?  That was Knicks fans cheering for Derrick Rose and Julius Randle. How do you think it would have sounded if you were the object of their affection? How many times a game would that have been you triggering that roar, helping prove to your easily-triggered self just how great you are?  Hope you’re enjoying Brooklyn, tho."
Julius Randle just casually dribbling in a double team two possessions in a row lol
lmfao  The Lakers deserve to get so much more ridicule as a franchise. They can get away with so many shitty moves that other teams can't. Look at how their former players (eg Julius Randle) are doing. The idea of developing players is apparently off-putting to them (unless they're attractive like Kuzma I guess)
julius randle been sleeping on both sides of the court....
julius randle
"I didn’t say it was drop dead hilarious, it’s amusing. If Hawks fans chant ‘fuck Julius Randle’ in game 3, that’ll be amusing as well"
Why doesn't Obi play with Randle at the 5.  Just maximize the spacing for Julius.
julius needs to calm the fuck down. hes the only one not clicking right now. the iq 3 to the rose block to the randle to to the noel interception to the randle to. its a 1 pt game but those possessions count
ive said this before the series so its not a hot take. Knicks overachieved in the regular season. Thibs played his star playoff level minutes and they played with playoff level defense all year intensity wise. They dont have another gear in the playoffs.   Now im sure i will be proven wrong but i think that is my concern with them. A lot of their offense relied on julius randle hitting really tough jumpers all year long. if those dry up this team is horrific on offense. And teams can figure out how to attack their defense in a series.
Julius Randle
"Man, if we get out of the first round of the playoffs I’ll write in Julius Randle when voting for mayor of NYC"
"Im fucking here to see Texas native Julius Randle and bayou Jesus Elfrid Payton, body tf out the weak ass Hawks."
"Stars get more calls but refs also sometimes ignore when stars commit fouls while in foul trouble late in games.   There were those memes about Giannis having 7 fouls during the bubble.   Are the refs even going to call a 6th foul against Julius Randle late in the 4th quarter, especially if it's in New York with an excited crowd, especially if there is a chance at a Nets-Knicks series? I don't know. Are they going to give Giannis some defensive leeway, especially if they stay harsh (and in their minds fair) on other that keep him in the game like the 10 second rule or traveling?   I am in no way trying to say the 76ers won because of the refs. I never liked when the Rockets won a game within the margin of a free throw difference either. It's just concerning since any advantage can go away against a team like the Warriors when they were battling it out with the Rockets."
"Its pretty simple - Any team that doesn't have championship aspirations will have players who take it seriously, it might be their only chance to gain a national spotlight that season and engage their fanbase. The games will sell more tickets than a normal regular season game with 0 stakes.  Dame wouldn't rest. Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal would not rest. Zach Lavine wouldn't, Julius Randle wouldn't. Zion, Lamelo etc all these dudes on non-contenders will go out and hoop with that spotlight on them. It might help some of these guys with All-Star voting too if it takes place before February"
I noticed something funny on the ESPN page.  When you open up LeBron's [individual stats page](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james) they removed the position where these stats rank among all NBA players.  Below any other player page like for example [Julius Randle's](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064514/julius-randle) they tell you exactly his 19.73 PER ranks 42nd for the season.
TALK ABOUT JULIUS RANDLE MORE.
"To be perfectly honest, I'll go weeks without remembering that the Nets are in my home TV market and I can just...watch all of their games without them being nationally broadcast. For the last 30 years I've just never really considered randomly watching a Nets game. They don't feel like a hometown team at all.  And the truth is, if this murderer's row doesn't change that, nothing will. They have the best three-man combo in league history and the home city would watch Julius Randle face a team with a losing record before they flipped on a Nets game."
2021 Julius Randle too.
Should have chased Julius Randle instead. Ironic isn't it?
Life is weird. To think that the Mavs could've saved more money and gotten a better player in Julius Randle
Just about every rigorous scientific study done on the topic shows that celebrity endorsements don’t have much effect on vaccine uptake rates. Celebrity endorsements can also even have a negative effect. Case in point Bill Gates being the anti-vaxxer’s bogeyman.  The people you know are outliers. If someone gets infected with Covid because they would rather listen to LeBron over trusted health professionals then that’s completely on them and they deserved it.  Why are you assuming an ulterior motive with LeBron refusing to talk about his vaccine status? Pretty much every other superstar also hasn’t come out explicitly saying they have got the vaccine. Why don’t you assume ulterior motives with them? Has Julius Randle come out and explicitly said he’s vaccinated?
&gt;Julius Randle isn't the most exciting player either.  EXCUSE ME
It comes with being a bruiser. Especially earlier in Bron's career. Julius Randle isn't the most exciting player either.  LeCoast James actually has some of my favorite highlights. His assists are some of my personal favorites of his. Along with any time he's above the rim.
"They drafted julius Randle, dlo Russell, brandon Ingram. All three have been all stars. Plus Jordan Clarkson who is going to win 6th man of the year. Why are we acting like their rebuild/tanking was unsuccessful?? Obv lebron and ad won them a chip but they were set up for the future"
"You think that, but you forget he's an NBA player. I mean unless you think he's worse than Brian Scalabrine.   The 13th man on the smallest small market team will absolutely smoke your best local hooper or local D1 recruit.   Jlaw has a video of Julius Randle beating him doing nothing but step back 3s lmao. NBA players are the best of the best, but they're also playing against the best of the best so it looks worse than it is."
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion’s? Fit is one thing, but he’s playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
"How neither Julius Randle or Trae Young makes this list when both are leading new teams to the playoffs for the first time is baffling to me.  A great playoff performance by either of them could spell something huge for the East but no it’s super interesting how Lebron James, a known factor performs?"
Id go with JA big guys get hurt more and have more room to grow less. Zion could be a better Julius randle though
"I'm scared of Julius Randle, but not so much anyone else."
He's scared of Julius Randle.
"Not sure if we're getting Cam back, but even if his shooting is still off, he's a valuable wing defender and any defensive help is great for us.  I think Hunter's health may decide the series, though. There's talk of him covering Julius Randle this series."
I make playoffs with Julius Randle who cares YeYe
"why did you say max contract then? You clearly didn't know.  And way to cherry pick a contract. Everyone knows Julius Randle is playing better than anyone expected and is now underpaid. He's obviously worth more than 17m. Also why do you even mention defense when Draymond is 3x better on defense than Julius? Fail at arguing. Draymond is literally 3rd in DPOY votes this year. 3rd in steals, 3rd in assists. Just give up, there is a lot more to basketball than points"
Orange Julius randle
What you said about Sabonis in your post is exactly what Julius Randle did lol and Randle led his team from lottery to a 4th seed. That's the biggest improvement yet
"Let's just do this the easy way, Julius Randle for these reasons: Playoffs berth as a #4 seed, ending an 8-year drought. Not just a team, but the whole city was reborn."
"No, it would go to Julius Randle"
It’s Julius Randle. Stop trying to outthink the room. It’s the most obvious it’s been in years.
"Yeah, Julius Randle."
"Bro have some faith you are going against the Knicks. You guys are both about the same level of teams and I have more faith in your players playing the same level or better in the playoffs while I expect Julius Randle and RJ, Rose to fall off a cliff with their shooting."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Abbreviating Julius Randle as JR may be really confusing for some
Yeah.. dray gets paid 25m/yr.. to score 7ppg. Julius randle gets paid 17m to score 25pts and defend.. dray is very much overpaid..
Top 10 (This Season):  1. Nikola Jokić - 11 2. Russell Westbrook - 9 3. Luka Dončić - 5 4. Domantas Sabonis  - 5 5. Ben Simmons - 3 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo- 3 7. LeBron James - 2 8. Draymond Green - 2 9. Kevin Durant - 2 10. Jimmy Butler - 2 10. Julius Randle - 2 10. Malcolm Brogdon - 2
Only 3 between Julius Irving and Julius Randle
Cries in Julius Randle
"Boucher being on the ballot isn't thaaat bad, but how tf do you leave Julius Randle off..."
Julius Randle is in like his 7th season...
"Phil Jackson to Julius Randle has 3 great links - Bob McAdoo, Byron Scott, Kobe"
"He's much better now, but when he was struggling last season with turnover problems, a forum that I frequent had the nickname ""Dubious Handles"" for Julius Randle lol."
If Julius Randle doesn't win it I'll eat a bowl of cooked rice.
"its should be julius randle. got the knicks to the playoffs, mvp for life."
Julius Randle is obviously the MOST improved player
"Shaq said teams don't gameplan for Rudy Gobert's defense. They do.  Shaq spoke (I think) Russian to Serbian Nikola Jokic.  Shaq called Julius Randle Zach Randolph.  Shaq said that the Utah Jazz aren't playoff contenders.   At the very least, I'm convinced Shaq doesn't watch."
&gt;The Knicks’ best player is a poor man’s Zion Williamson  “Tell me you’ve never watched Julius Randle without telling me you’ve never watched Julius Randle”  &gt;The Hawks’ best player is a dollar tree version of Steph Curry  “Tell me you’ve never watched Trae Young without saying you’ve never watched Trae Young.”
Julius Randle wasn't a 2x All-Star before his first All Star appearance
"Monty Williams did a hell of a job . But it's gotta be thibs. Shame the man only won it once in Chicago. Dude whipped the Knicks into shape . That's what he does , they weren't open to it in Minnesota , that's their loss. He's a great fucking coach , culture changer , talent developer. I love what he did with that roster. I'm fan of the man since he was running the Celtics defense . RJ Barrett looking like he's gonna be legit two way star , like Jimmy Butler turned out to be . Julius Randle looking like the new Mr knick . Thibs is the man . I never forgave the bulls for firing him , it was always them and the Celtics for me , now I find it hard to root for the bulls , I even find the new regimes moves stupid. Still sour about that one. One more beer and I'm going to bed."
All my homies love Julius Randle
Can’t believe Julius randle is the king of NY
"As a Knicks fan it's been bizarre but nice to be getting all this love from the other big franchises. Seems like we've got fans from the Bulls (Thibs, D-Rose, I know some of you love Taj Gibson) and the Lakers (Julius Randle, and always being THE team in a 2 team city)"
"Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Solomon Hill, Julius Randle, Anthony Morrow, Daunte Cunningham"
Julius Randle might steal some MVP votes at this rate. Absolut tear the second half of the season
"Sure, the fans are enjoying it but from the perspective of long term success, it's not great. Barrett probably won't be good enough to be the centerpiece of a great team and none of their other players are gonna be stars, either. If they were in a position like Phoenix with a really good core of young players it'd make sense to win and be as good as possible because you know that you have something special and can build on or at least maintain a high level of play for the foreseeable future. The Knicks are a Julius Randle career best year away from having the worst offense in the league."
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
Low key it’s Julius Randle
Zion. Then Julius Randle.
Zion is Julius randle without the sauce
The Knicks said this last year with Julius Randle.
"Yeah but Randle was on two teams who didn't want him and obviously had no interest in winning. The Lakers front office was pretty much on fire the entire time Julius played there and the Pels were very much tanking for Zion. The Knicks are winning with Julius and he seems to love it in New York. I think you're right in the sense that Zion is either better right now (which I believe) or if not he SHOULD project to be better than Randle. But I'm a Blazers fan and the other guy is also right. I don't care how objectively better Steph or Harden or whoever is ""better"" than Dame. Dame is Portland and nobody could replace his impact like that. But Dame has also been here since I was like 15 so it's a little bit different."
If Julius Randle wins a title and FMVP with the Knicks does he become Top 30 All-Time?
Zion is Julius Randle with hops
Julius randle
"Um excuse me, he is Julius Randle with a shot."
"I love Jerami Grant as a player and firmly believe that he has all star potential but Julius Randle has improved in nearly all aspects of the game: multiple levels of scoring, passing, playmaking, defense, leadership and so many other areas."
Giannis LeBron Kawhi Paul George Zion Williamson. Pick Jimmy Butler or Jayson Tatum for the final spot   Those should be the forwards. Sorry Julius Randle and whomever else misses the cut.
Why would they need Julius Randle with hops when they already have Julius Randle without hops
Julius Randle 🤝 Josh Allen

A lot of people on r/nba don’t seem to think so. The argument I’ve seen is that Julius had a good season in NOLA putting up similar shooting stats. Team impact/success doesn’t seem to factor much in MIP and some people seem to think Wood or Grant will get MIP. Maybe that’s been changing lately but it’s all I’ve seen anytime Randle for MIP gets brought up
"I always rolled my eyes when people said ""The league is better when the Knicks are good."" But after this year, I 100% understand. It's been a joy to watch Julius Randle and company ball out and hopefully lead New York to a few playoff wins"
"Hottest take on earth: If we're going by most valuable player to their team, it should be Julius Randle. Knicks would be the worst team in the league without him  Less hot take: If we go by your criteria, Curry still loses, because Curry isn't the best player in the league right now."
I love Julius Randle.  Fuck all the haters and doubters from before.  EAT EAT EAT  lol
"When they got left out of the bubble he bought a house in Dallas, where his longtime (since HS) trainer lives, and doubled down on his training. From [this NYP (sorry) article](https://nypost.com/2021/01/07/julius-randles-relentless-offseason-workouts-led-to-breakout/)  *“Randle would open his old high school gym at 5 a.m. to fire up jumpers on his own, the first bundle of 1,200 he would shoot every day, every week, every month, for nine months.”*"
Another blessed game by 2021 Finals MVP Julius Randle
For me to poop on   - triumph the insult comic dog   - Michael Scott      - Julius Randle
This conversation is funny to me just because a year ago hardly anybody would have said that Randle is a winning player. In fact I had arguments with people on the Knicks sub and said to give Julius some time to adjust to being the main guy. One dude (who has curiously disappeared this season) said Julius would never be a winning player and he was adamant about it.
imagine thinking Julius Randle is an average bench all star LOL please watch some Knicks games
I love to gas up the hawks but tomorrow is an L. Hawks don't have the same fight as Knicks do night to night especially on a b2b.  Also Julius Randle obliterates us.  Knicks have always had our number even when we both sucked.
Is ESPN making a mess in their shorts over Julius Randle?
Nah babe the Julius Randle jersey stays ON during sex
"No to all of the above.  Imo the real question is do you take Ingram over Julius Randle, John Collins, Gordon Hayward..."
"In all honesty this is one of the better all nba team predictions ive seen in the last month or so, but I have a few comments.   1) Although producing like an mvp candidate when he plays I dont even think KD is illegible for All NBA because hes played so little games (24 of 57 possible games) but i could be wrong on this bc of the season only being 72 games. It really depends on how he finishes the season in terms of games played.   2) With that \^ being said who would be his replacement? When it comes to the forwards in the NBA this year its a tight race and I think it's going to come down to an even split of games won (standings) and personal stats. I agree that zion should make one of the teams (not necessarily saying hes KD's replacement on the second team). If Jimmy Butler keeps the same stats and wins 70% of the remaining games I can see him making the third team but I have to admit that I would personally put Julius Randle and PG ahead of him. Julius Randle is putting up 23, 11, 6 on great shooting and his team is a couple games above .500. PG is puting up 23 6 and 5 as the second best player on a team that has twice as many wins as losses. After that the forward position isn't that competitive.   3) All your center selections are right on the money, its a shame that embiid is going to be on second team. the NBA really needs to modernize all nba selection to 2 BC and 3 FC like the all star game.  4) LeBron is an x-factor in all of this. If he plays the remaining games he can lock the first team over Kawhi but I can see some media voters choose kawhi over Lebron if he doesnt play any of the remaining games (Lebron would have played 41 of 72 games).   5) With the streak that Curry is on I can absolutely see him making the first team \*edit: in all fareness his streak wasn't this long at the time you wrote this\* I know that some may disagree bc his team currently sits 9th in western standings but Anthony Davis has made All NBA first team once or twice without making playoffs in the same season before. Regardless though I agree with all 6 of your guards. If bradley Beal wins scoring title this year it might be the first time EVER that the scoring champ doesnt make one of the all nba teams in the same season."
No Julius Randle?
People think Julius Randle is better just because this season so this shouldn't be asked tbh
"&gt; After all it doesn’t have Julius Randle in god tier above LBJ.  Thank you, I was wondering we were just supposed to assume Randle was in Tier 0"
"Ragebait. Luka is great but &gt;Harden?  This list is crap, designed to piss people off. After all it doesn’t have Julius Randle in god tier above LBJ."
Julius Randle has entered the chat.
"But for current day:  Starters: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Randle, Nikola Jokic"
&gt;MVP should consider team expectations and not team seading  so it should go to Julius Randle.  The Knicks currently look to have the highest jump from pre-season expectations.
Julius randle special
"Um, Julius Randle is averaging 7 less points per game on significantly lower shot efficiency though. Despite Curry being at a major size disadvantage against most of the league, on [Basketball-reference.com](https://Basketball-reference.com) he is 6th in player efficiency rating and first among guards (Randle is 43rd overall and 12th among forwards), 9th in win-shares/2nd guard (Randle 17th overall/ 5th forward), 4th in Box Plus-Minus/1st guard (Randle 21st overall/ 8th forward), and 2nd in Value over Replacement Player (Randle 12th overall/ 5th forward). The advanced metrics favor Curry as by far the best guard in the league, where Randle isn't quite a top-5 all-around forward. The eye test favors Curry with his constant highlights. The storyline massively favors Curry.  Randle is damn good and the Knicks would lose a lot without him but no team in the league is as dependent on one player for their success other than maybe Denver with Joker (aka the current MVP leader, who also leads the league in all of the above advanced stats other than PER, where he's second)."
"Julius Randle has this award locked up, assuming he doesn't kill anyone between now and the end of the season."
"If the Warriors get to a top 6 seed and Jokic and Embiid struggle towards the end, that'll do it (to have a moderate chance). It'll just be one of those seasons where there isn't a consensus one because of so many missed games by the front runners.   I think after those two, Giannis, Paul, and Curry would be considered, along with some attention for Lillard, Doncic, and Julius Randle, depending on if any of them move towards a top 4 seed."
All my homies doubted Julius Randle
The argument is he's MPJ right now but he could be Julius Randle in 4 years
"You know what... I HATE THE KNICKS. Nets fan for 25+ years. I HATE THE KNICKS. Probably more than anything. But it's been so bad the last 2 decades Knicks fans have been checked out for years. They destroyed Randle last year. I credit that dude bigtime for stepping up and resurrecting that franchise from the depths of Hell. Yes, Julius Randle single-handedly resurrected the Knicks. Who would've thunk?"
"He's going to need to play more than 30 games for that distinction, skill wise it'll probably be him. Legacy wise probably not, he's on a superteam with Kyrie and Harden rn yet Julius Randle is the talk of NY atm"
Julius Randle has entered the chat
This is Julius fkn Randle season 😤😤  Lets wait until the playoffs to see because it may be Harden 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Lonzo Ball is a good roster player. The only All-Star is Julius Randle. Ingram is a star, but below average playing defense. LeBron couldn't win quickly enough with the group previously mentioned by the OP."
Add Bam to list above Julius Randle
i love julius randle he is better than domantas sabonis
"Dwane wade, Kevin love, isiah thomas, tristan thompson, bosh, illgeskias, snow, jr smith, kyle korver, AD, Brandon Ingram, Julius randle, mike miller, ray allen,   Every player I named has an NBA career achievement award, weather that be an all start, 3 point contest, 6 man, etc... Lebron has had all of these, and keep in mind he picks his team.  KD never picked his team, he was recruited.  Lebitch still picks all these players, and still can't win.  There is a lot more I forgot too"
Put Julius Randle in the MVP race you cowards
"I enjoy watching Julius Randle play basketball. He is my favorite player. When he scores a basket, I think to myself “yes.” When he misses a free throw only 16% of the time, I think to myself “no.”"
To think that a couple of years ago the PF Nation Knicks and Julius Randle were clowned to all hell. Now THIS is prime character development
Julius Randle might be the best pick-up the Knicks had maybe since Stoudemire or maybe Allan Houston before his knees gave out
"He’s a high draft pick who was touted as a generational talent from the jump and basically lived up to the hype from say 1.  Randle was a lottery pick but given that he’s having his breakout on his third team, it’s typically seen as more of a surprise/comeback story, you know?  If Randle had never left the Lakers and was doing this there? He would be more marketable. And infinitely more so if he had been doing this basically from day 1.  NBA builds hype based on who they think they can get casuals to watch. A guy like Randle is “damaged goods” because some of the casuals have already written him off as “that dude who busted in LA” so his narrative arc has to be that of like a comeback instead of just, you know, Lakers having traditionally shitty player development/utilization - lonzo, Ingram, deangelo Russell, zubac all from that era got massively better after leaving the Lakers.  A guy like Luka has never been *bad* in the NBA. He came in with a ton of hype and immediately delivered. That’s exactly what the NBA wants for marketing guys. It’s why the push top picks (like Zion) so hard. Zion was an internet sensation even in high school. He lives up to the hype at duke. So then He’s maybe not a household name among casuals but he’s getting close - he’s a guy that people are starting to hear about AND if someone says “who is that?” their buddy with a smart phone quickly pulls up a YouTube montage of his crazy athletic dunks and stuff. Now that he’s the #1 pick? Household name. Keep pushing him. Keep getting casuals to tune in to the national games to see the superstars play.  Julius Randle having a MIP season on his third team doesn’t draw like that, you know?"
Julius Randle with hops playing with Julius Randle confirmed
"he absolutely won't win, even if the Knicks are 4th seed or somehow higher. the reason is that it would be weird for Julius Randle to be MVP"
Lmao just as I posted Julius Randle for MVP
"I just don’t really get the point of stuff like this. Like what are knicks fans supposed to see from this when their “best” 5 man lineup doesn’t have Julius Randle in it, who plays 38 mpg."
You mean a Julius Randle with hops flair
"&gt;There is no way they are going to give it to Giannis 3 times in row  And there's no way they are going to give it to Julius Randle so why is that relevant? Giannis is better than randle, having a better season, and on a better team. I get that Randle is a fun story but come on"
The Knicks are good and Julius Randle is actually Jesus Christ
Julius randle is playing out of his mind but it’s been luka this and Zion that even when we’re the one winning the games
"Okay maybe that's a bit much. His ceiling is Julius Randle with hops  And just because I'm a grammar nazi, it's Samanic"

I read that as you saying that julius randle had a higher ceiling than Giannis. Makes sense now tho lol
Zion’s floor coming in was Julius Randle before he took a leap this year   Both Randle and zion have exceeded that
"Also drafted Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Julius Randle, Kyle Kuzma in that time. I think Lakers fans just confuse normal rebuilding struggles with questionable moves because they arent used to losing for that long"
Here is the full list updated on the season:  Julius Randle: 7/22  Kyrie Irving: 4/14  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5/13  Devin Booker: 3/11  Steph Curry: 1/5  LeBron James: 2/8  Bradley Beal: 1/7  Domantas Sabonis: 2/6  Jayson Tatum: 2/6  Jaylen Brown: 2/6  John Collins: 1/7  DeAaron Fox: 1/6
"Julius Randle, Bobby Portis"
Randle is Julius but it was Thibs who led the Knicks across the Rubicon
Julius Randle with hops couldn't block that huh?
"Start: De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle, Bam Adebayo  Cut: The rest of em  Shooting guard is definitely the most difficult to decide. Close race between all of them."
"Holy shit, I haven't watched Julius Randle play since he was on Lakers. That man moves so nicely."
"As a Celtics fan, I’m worried about Thibs, the way he’s able to adjust in a playoff experience, his experience and his ability to coach an elite defense. I would not want to play the Knicks in round 1 for these reasons.   Would I be scared of Julius Randle? No. He’s the easiest guy to deal with of all the teams we could play. I’d rather deal with Randle than Trae Young, or Jimmy/Bam.   I would rather wake up to the news that Thibs has food poisoning and can’t coach the Knicks, than say Randle missing a game due to injury.   Not sure if you know this, but since the trade deadline, the Celtics have moved from 22nd or so to 15th in defensive rating. We’ve had a top 5 defense over the past few weeks. Not as much feasting will go on as you believe sir."
"True. Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball for Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, who says no?"
"It's not the debate, it's about that being a reply for every single tweet that isn't even relevant to the post. It could be a post about La Liga or Julius Randle and it somehow correlates to 18 trolls talking about Lebron and Michael."
I mean he did so by playing his top 6 like 40 MPG and playing his cast of vets rather than developing a core that could play around Towns for the long haul. IMO not worth that approach just to get a first round exit but he looks to be taking a more sustainable path in NY. Julius Randle is still leading the league in MPG but he has done a nice job of building up their younger players too
Why would NY need Julius Randle with hops when they already have him
I can't believe the transformation Julius Randle has made. He's my MIP and should garner an All-NBA selection. Just unbelievable! He honestly inspires me.
Also [held Devin Booker to 1/7 FGA with 2 TOs last week](https://twitter.com/HeatNationCom/status/1382427197542109187). And [held Julius Randle to 7/22 in 3 games against the Knicks this season](https://twitter.com/SimonSperling/status/1376864139117649921). 🤔
"Bam guards 1-5 too and did it the entire playoffs last year.   Bam this szn against teams best players:  Lebron: 2/8 25%  Jaylen brown: 4-14 28%  Julius randle: 7-18 39%  Brad beal: 1-7 14%  Giannis: 5-13 38%  Sabonis: 1-5 20%  John collins: 1-7 14%  He has multiple game winning blocks this year as well, and hes now 3 or 4 in dpoy ranking. Idk why only now is he getting put into the conversation"
"Just like “Julius Randle with hops” is no longer an insult, neither is Knicks stacking PFs"
"Everyone trashing Thibs made zero sense to me and this is why. Julius Randle is unreal, but as a Clipper fan it makes me sad thinking what they could have accomplished had they hired Thibs instead of Doc. What he’s done here and with the Wolves made all the criticism of him seem totally bizarre to me."
Zion is just Julius Randle ~~with hops~~ starting at the other forward spot
"you are looking at the worst moments of his game and ignoring the absolute ridiculous stat line he put up and how well he played.  he also played really good D on julius randle who shot 11 of 28 from the field  he wasn't going for 34 points, 9 boards, 5 assists, 2 steals, on 2 turnovers and nearly 60% shooting in the first half of the season bruh"
So proud of Julius Randle for leading us against to another win even with such a tough matchup as Julius Randle with hops. All jokes aside this team has such a proud feeling to it that I'm not sure I've felt before as a Knicks fan
DOES ZION HAVE A CHANCE TO BE THE NEXT JULIUS RANDLE?
Is Julius randle nba 3rd team caliber this year?
Zion is just a Julius Randle who can't shoot cmv
MIP ALL STAR ALL NBA  JULIUS FUCKING RANDLE
"""Julius Randle with hops"""
Julius Randle looks at James Johnson and sees the 'drawing a foul on' version of bbq chicken
I want Julius Randle with hops. Hopefully both keep getting better so the league gets more interesting.

Love how team NYC is just the nets plus Julius Randle lol
"Anthony Bennet the draft bust is from Canada. Julius Randle is from Dallas, Texas. Randle and Wiggins were in the same recruiting class and 2 of the biggest prizes pf that year."
How about Julius Randle? He's been comparable to those guys this season.
"Random thought: imo Julius Randle is a big reason why Canadian Hooper's are making noise in the NBA. When he was in HS, Wiggins was already thought of as the best HS baller in North America, but it wasn't until Julius Randle Vs Wiggins became a thing that Canadians started being scouted properly.   Even after that guys like Jamal Murray still had to go off in the U-17 Olympics just to get drafted. But before that, players had to basically be Wiggins just to get a chance."
I thought Julius Randle was the worst player in the league and would have glad driven him to the airport last year. I’ve never seen an already established player completely change his game for the better seemingly overnight.
"I know this is a very Knicks’y thing to write, but I was disappointed that they barely mentioned Julius Randle. 22.4 pts and 11.1 rebounds per game on a team that is still a top 3 defense in the league. They just waived it off as “anyone can score 20 on a bad team”."
"I think they're gonna be streaky until they iron out their personnel but it's tough. I think they'd be better without Bagley in the rotation but he played pretty well against the sixers when I watched that game. Tough to give up on him, look at Julius Randle. I think one thing they could do is play Haliburton more, I just think that kids a winner, doesn't have a single hole in his game. He's leading rookies in mins but he's coming off the bench. They should have Haliburton attached to Bagley. I just think Haliburton can make anything work. I don't say this lightly but I think Haliburton is basically 6'6 Chris Paul."
Theres 4 guard spots and 2 WC but I think there are more deserving forwards such as Gordon Hayward and Julius Randle who are leading their teams to playoff spots.
"because people (including me) thought he'll be more fun  instead of ""next lebron"" hes looking  like more athlethic julius randle"
Julius Chad Randle &gt; Kristaps Glass Cannon Porzingis
"Di Angelo was a one time all star two years ago, and has sucked since. Julius Randle will not be an all star this year. A team with Bradley Beal and Russel Westbrook is better yes, especially considering you got two guys career bench guys playing starter minutes."
Julius Randle
Julius Randle
"We know, we just don’t care as much.  Nets have KD, Kyrie and harden, 3 of the most polarizing players since...ever. And they are contending right now  Knicks have....Derrick rose? Julius randle? Austin rivers?? And they are just trying to make the playoffs.   Clearly people will care more about a contender with superstars than a rebuilding/lower seed even if it is the Knicks.

"Julius ""Reliable 20/10"" Randle"
AS YOU SHOULD. Julius Randle all-star!
I’m pretty happy over here bro. Enjoy your first round exit and then regression next year when it turns out Julius randle isn’t a top 10 player and you guys end up maxing him. Hopefully thibs doesn’t run him into the ground after they
Julius Randle has entered the chat
if I went into a thread about DRose or Julius Randle and started shittalking them and the KP trade for no reason you would also have the right to call me insecure
"Julius Randle. Dude has been killing it and if any fan base deserves it , it's the knicks fans."
Nephews will tell you Julius Randle is more deserving of All-NBA though 💀
"AD can play 5 games and I’d keep him up there. He’s just that much better. Also, a better season ≠ a better player this season. you judge the latter based on how they’ve performed in the time they’ve played, unless it’s like 1 game. I really don’t care though, I’m not gonna discuss if julius fucking randle is a top 15 player"
"You mean Kristaps ""Worse than Julius Randle"" Porzingis?"
"This season he is. Only Larry Bird, Julius Randle, and Jokic have had a 20-10-5 season while shooting 40% from 3."
"i mean i would've never bet on julius randle leading us to a playoff berth and a potential 4 seed, but here we are (and boy have i never been happier to be wrong)"
The Pelicans get worse by adding Julius Randle? Y'all are something else lol
julius randle is not a top 15 player I’m sorry to break it to you
Zion is the most overrated Player since a long time. He is basically Julius Randle...
"It was the long ass off season, Kobe's passing, and his underwhelming first Knicks season that motivated him to get better.  I highly recommend this read: https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/reputation-julius-randle-new-york-knicks-basketball-nba"
Nah Reddit just told me Julius Randle should be an MVP candidate
Chris Paul should split the MVP with Julius Randle
"**PICK A TEAM FOR ME** (You can read this whole thing or scan the bold points.)   I've faded into and out of the NBA throughout my life. Since 2019, I've gotten back into the league. I'm still looking for a team to back though.  First off, I don't go in for supporting the big dogs. I support the **Pirates, the White Sox, and West Ham United.** I will usually try to support the home team, but I don't have an NBA home team. **I was born in a non-NBA town. I grew up in a non-NBA town. I live in a town where the closest NBA team is five hours away,** so there's no natural, regional connection. (Where I live currently I'm blacked out of Denver, OKC, and Minnesota. That's some bullshit there.)  As a young kid in the 80s, I supported the **Pistons. Liked Charles Barkley and Joe Dumars.**  As a teen in the 90s, I moved with Chuck Daly to the **Nets. Loved Petrovic, Coleman, and Kenny.** When Petrovic died, the Nets fell apart, and I moved on in life I stopped watching the NBA for about a decade.    In the late-00s I lived in Denver and followed the **Nuggets for a bit. They had some really lovable players like Chucky Atkins, Billups, and Camby. The short-lived Iverson experience** happened too. When I moved away I stopped watching NBA until early 2019.  Players I like right now: **Julius Randle, Bradley Beal, Sabonis, Giannis.**    **Give me your advice, especially with the playoffs coming, though it doesn't have to be a playoff team.**"
"That's how I feel with the Lakers.   If not them, then chaos. Julius Randle FMVP."
"Lol so MPJ’s jump has been typical? A 14th pick playing like a 1st overall his sophomore year is typical? Bruh I’m not taking anything away from Randle but you can’t just reduce MPJ’s improvement as just a “typical” 2nd year. How was Julius Randle’s improvement in his 2nd year? Okay that’s what I thought. Im pretty sure most sophomores don’t go from averaging 9 their first year, to 16 the first half of the next year, to 22 the second half of the year with much better defense. And now 25ppg the last 10 games"
"&gt;  MPJ not only got better over the summer but is also making huge leaps  throughout this season. He averaged 16-17 the first half of the year and  is averaging over 22 since February. He averaged 24 in April and 25 the  last 10 games.   So using your criteria  Pre-February: Julius Randle averaged 22 ppg  Since February: Randle is averaging 25 ppg  The Month of April: Randle is averaging 27 ppg  The last 10 games: Randle is averaging 30 ppg  Has Randle not made huge leaps throughout the season too?  &gt; Nothing against Randle but it’s more of a leap in my eyes to go from a  defensive liability role player into a bonafide star, than it is going  from a 22ppg player (last year) into a 24ppg player   Randle went from 19 ppg, defensive liability, turnover machine to All Star, damn near All NBA with a bigger offensive load than MPJ. Thats a bigger leap than what MPJ is doing"

That’s what I’m saying. 🤝Then we make another thread about Julius Randle.
"You know a lot of us would have taken a 2nd for Jules before the season and rolled with Obi, right? Wrap you're mind around that. Last season, he couldn't hit 3's and was a bad fit next to Big Meech, a non shooter.  And now he's morphed into a superstar capable of creating offense all the way out to 3 point land.  Raise your hand if you had Julius Randle improving his 3pt percentage from 29 to 40+? Raise your hand if you had him averaging 6 assists per game?  Or if you had him 2nd in defensive win shares?  He should win the award going away."
This is the extremely casual take. MPJ was the 3rd best player on a nuggets team behind an mvp candidate who gets doubled every play. It is going to be very easy for him to score the basketball if jokic could remotely pass. (P.S. Hes an amazing passer). Julius Randle scores off of isolation mainly and is carrying the knicks who were projected to finish 14th in the east and are now 4th. There is a major difference and it is why Randle will win.
I disagree. MPJ Jr has had a great stretch of games but Julius Randle had been spectacular all season. He's brought the Knicks back to life.
Nah dude Julius Randle ECF boutta hit different
"&gt;Don’t think he’s a top tier #1 option but he had absolutely no help from the NO front office/injury’s.  Such a dumb take now considering the way Julius Randle has been playing.   that Pels FO although very flawed, was also super aggressive in surrounding AD with talent."
"Scoring is important, but its not a huge gap. Kyrie averages 3 more points on slightly better efficiency. In every other aspect of the game, Randle is better. And of course Julius isn't better than Steph, Kyrie isn't close to as good as Steph"
Rj barrett   Julius Randle   Mitchell Robinson   Immanuel Quickley
Hell yeah Julius Randle
Hell yeah Julius Randle
When he doesn’t have Julius randle in front of him
"Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Nerlens Noel, Steve Novak (hey he shot pretty well don’t be shocked by this one)"
You're saying 2019/20 Julius Randle would do the same things AD did last year for the Lakers?
&gt; It's really hard to carry a team as a non ballhandler   Yep not everyone can be Julius Randle
Was a back and forth physical game until the 4th. But Julius Randle.   God I miss Lavine.
This has to be one of the most unexpected improvements in recent memory right? How did Julius Randle get this good in one off season?
Julius Randle this year is better than 2013-2014 “peak” Kevin Love
"Julius Randle, he's good enough that i could see it happening but not so good that youd see it coming"
"According to coaches and other players, that is how Melo lives his life. I don't think he made wieght lifting/conditioning a huge part of his regimen until recently, but most of it was spent on actual footwork/shot mechanics, etc. I also think you're downplaying the level of respect he commands in the league. Julius Randle sought him out to train with him"
"I mean I think it’s fair to say BI is better but he’s also older so that isn’t really a hot take imo. Reminds me of the 26 yr old Julius Randle is better than 20 yr old Zion take lol, like no shit, but they’re both doing really well.   Hard to say who out of BI and MPJ has a higher ceiling tho. Think both can realistically be too forwards in the league. No need to turn them against each other."
"If LeBron had chosen to he Knicks, they might never have gotten Julius Goatius Randle.  Bullet dodged."
Ok so Julius Randle &gt; Zion
"Looks good, although I think I'd swap Russ out for maybe a player like De'Aaron Fox and Julius Randle or a player on the rise up. Don't get me wrong I think you're right with Russ being underrated but he's already going to be a HoF candidate."
"oh yeah, he was playing great this season and looked to be back in form, he might have a late bloomer break out season like Julius Randle."
"Noel's best years have been with the Sixers, unfortunately.  He was a dodged bullet. Imagine if he's being paid just a couple of million less than Julius Randle right now (that's what that 4-year, $70m contract offer from the Mavericks a few years ago constitutes, which he declined)...even with his renaissance as of late that would still be too much."
The guy calling Zion Julius Randle 2.0 lmao a double bad prediction
"Lmfao no, it’s because you don’t know shit about the Lakers and just hate from a distance. They literally drafted Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball in consecutive years.   They weren’t a dumpster fire because they missed out on overpaying Aldridge or Melo. They were young. They built a war chest of assets and cashed in on them to win a damn championship. If they were a dumpster fire they’d waste all their high picks like Sacramento, Minnesota, Orlando, etc. They attract stars because players know the organization treats players amazingly and will move heaven and earth to field a championship contender. Dumpster fire lmfao you sound like those morons who “protested” outside the Staples Center 😂"

"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I’ll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  So I said... eh, was it drafting assets? Or were they just bad for a long time and had some shit they were able to package with a shit load of future picks? You come back at me explaining how they really were drafting well this whole time, but what.. they suck at asset management? I'm confused.  &gt;Julius Randle was the Lakers best player in his last season there, averaging 16/8. They let him walk in free agency as he was in a redundant position with LeBron  Huh, so they drafted a great player, he turned into the best player on their team, and they let him for nothing? That sounds like bad asset management. Maybe you're on to something.  &gt;D'Angelo Russell was a good player for the Lakers (15/4/5 at age 20). He allowed them to get out from under Mozgov's contract which was killing them. For better or for worse his weird Snapchat snitching thing with Nick Young made the rest of the locker room turn on him  So DLo was another good player for the Lakers. They did a great job drafting him 2nd overall in your opinion, and he was playing great for them. They new he was a great player, but he offended Swaggy fucking P. So they traded him after two years in a salary dump move. Clearly another example of excellent asset management.   &gt;Nance and Clarkson were definitely salary dumps but they also created the cap space that allowed for LeBron to get signed. Both were decent with loads of potential. They also got a FRP  So another two young players, loads of poential. Traded in salary dump to clear future cap space. They got the 29th draft pick out of it. Another excellent example of drafting and asset management.  &gt;Zubac I have no idea why they traded him, that was a terrible move he was really good for them  Fair  &gt;Ingram was definitely not disappointing. He had a potential career-ending injury his last season with the Lakers but was their second best player his last year there. He got better every year and his potential was obvious  &gt;Lonzo like Ingram couldn't stay healthy. Can't say he was worth the #2 pick but I think most teams would have taken him there  Here's the thing. I personally cannot square the notion that BI and Lonzo were good 2nd overall picks if they had to be packaged with a #4 overall, 2 more FRPs, a FRP swap, and Josh Hart. Look at the value of other top picks *when they actually hit.* Look at how much value young tatum had. Or how much value Ben Simmons had. Or so many other young stars. When guys actually hit, you don't need to have such a massive haul in a trade for a disgruntled star. Cavs were able to trade Wiggins and fucking Anthony Bennett for Kevin Love. And that still doesn't erase all their other fuck ups."
Julius Randle averages 50 and they rename the finals mvp after him
Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Jordan Clarkson -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -traded for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Excellent drafting. How could anyone question your asset acquisition skills.
"Speaking of Julius, Bill Simmons just said he has Julius Randle over Kawhi, LeBron and PG for all-NBA 1st team lol"
Bucks had a much better defense last season and the Heat blew them out...  You think Julius Randle and Mitch Rob are gonna stop LeBron and AD?
Update this Julius Randle for MIP and we’ll discuss
"Julius Randle is balling out under the biggest lights in the NBA... Madison Square Garden. Now the issue I have with Randle is that, from my private sources, he has issues in the locker room and that is holding him back from being the league MVP this year"
Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram are better than any player Cleveland has drafted since Kyrie.  Shut up dude.
"Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -dumped for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Talen Horton Tucker  Jesus, Midas touch over here."
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
julius randle brought playoff basketball back to the mecca
"It wasn't for tanking purposes, and I always found it amusing when people thought the Lakers were sitting Deng and Mozgov to tank, like those guys were helping the Lakers win too many games or something 😂  The truth was that the Lakers signed Deng cause they needed a small forward (rookie Brandon Ingram was the only other 3 on the roster), but the Lakers failed to realize that Deng was no longer quick enough to play SF, nor was he a good enough shooter to do so in the new pace and space NBA. Deng was exclusively a small ball 4, but the Lakers already had two good, young 4s in Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr, so there weren't any minutes for Deng there. The Lakers sat Deng cause they were losing anyway, cause him at SF was a disaster, and because they wanted to give Ingram more minutes in the second half of the year.   Then the following year the Lakers added Kyle Kuzma, who was looking very impressive for a rookie, and he just pushed Deng further down the rotation, and effectively out of it. The Lakers had Ingram, Kuzma, Randle and Nance at forward, so all they could do with Deng was offer him garbage time minutes, which would have been insulting for a vet, so instead they agreed he just wouldn't dress at all. But supposedly he stayed ready in case there were injuries.   He did that for a full year and then the Lakers bought him out and stretched him. If they'd bought him out a year earlier his remaining $35 million would have been stretched over 7 seasons, so by waiting that year, instead it was only $15 million stretched over 3 years ($5 million per year)."
"Clearly, this year's Heat are the Knicks.    They've got King Julius ""The Engine"" Randle."
"And also, yknow, this was his contract year and he was looking for 40mil...  so no way were we re-signing him.  lol, these pels casuals. ""Just keep jrue"". Yeah, and why didnt we also just keep AD, Christian Wood, and Julius Randle. Piece of cake."
No one is beating Julius Randle lmao
"And Julius Randle is on pace to be the 2nd person ever to average 20/10/5 while shooting 40% from 3, only he and Larry Bird  If you want to play the ""who's having a more historic season"" I promise you won't win lol"
I would have agreed at the beginning of the year but he has really slowed down. Julius Randle is gonna win it.

"Imagine if the Cavs used that money to sign someone like Julius Randle. Sign a motivated player who just hadn't quite put everything together yet. Add a fresh coaching staff interested in growing with a young team. Then invest heavily is scouting for overlooked draft prospects, especially in the second round where picks are less coveted in trades. Take swings on undrafted players with potential and good personalities. It would take a while, but there are lots of ways to build a decent team from nothing with patience and planning.  Or, you know, just give KLove a max and put him in millionaire purgatory while the franchise stalls out in midair."
He saw julius randle cook og and thought he could do it to
Definitely not the NBA-ready player most people labeled him as. Also doesn’t help he’s playing behind Julius Randle and his stardom ascension.
Now do Julius randle. I know he was not good last year I wanna see though
"It was a great game, it took the 2nd best team in the west to take down the streak, I’ll take it. I thought Julius Randle would’ve matched up better against them, but I guess not. We could’ve had Bridges man... dude was killer today too. The Knicks did such a great job stopping Booker in the 4th, but CP3 showed us why he’s an all time great Point God. That motherfucker was on a mission in the 4th..."
"Julius Randle has had three good months and now he gets superstar treatment from the officials.   I don't usually watch the Knicks, so how often is he allowed to just run over defenders as he pleases?"
Julius Randle looked to be all over him... He does look slow he was just throwing some killer difficult shots there
Julius Randle is my Daddy.     Sheeesh

i love MVP candidate Julius Randle and the New York Knickerbockers. Yerrr or whatever it is
"I swear I just saw one of these in another post and I see these posted frequently. But as I said in that post, Julius Randle should be 2nd team All-NBA right now. Not only due to his splits, but the fact he’s played 60 games and a ton of minutes, meaning he’s pretty much contributed to the entirety of the Knicks 4th place in the East record right now, which no one predicted. And the Knicks team record is significantly better than the Pelicans record, he should be ahead of Zion. There’s a legit case to be made he should actually receive more votes than LeBron even (but it won’t happen). LeBron is the #1 player in the NBA still, but when you’ve played like 20 fewer games than Randle and your team records are almost the same (with comparable splits), Randle deserves more recognition *this season*. Now since LeBron is LeBron, it won’t happen, but if you a blind side by side without names, I think a lot choose Randle this season."
"This won’t happen because LBJ is too popular. But there’s a legit argument to be made Julius Randle should be on at least the same All-NBA team as LBJ. Just look at their stats, team record, and the fact Randle has played like 20 more games and 1000 more mins (which is very relevant/impactful due to where the Knicks currently are seeded). But again, it won’t happen because LeBron is LeBron, and he’s still the best player in the world, even if this season, due to his injuries, has really not been that much more impactful than Julius Randle. You do a blind side by side of those 2 and you can see there is a legit case if LeBron was named someone else."
Inb4 bagley follows the Julius Randle timeline and actually ends up being good af  If he can get through this injury bs
How does it feel to know Julius Randle owns you?? 🤔🤔
This is only a debate if Julius Randle can confirm this level of performance for another season.  Otherwise it's easily Trae.
"&gt;*Charles Oakley to SiriusXM on Julius Randle: ""I think he's a better version of Zion Williamson to me. Because he can do more. Zion Williamson. … I said last year, (the Knicks) didn’t have a superstar. And now they got a superstar.""*  Other than a sort of jokey comment from Enes, why are they being compared like this?  Zion is 20 years old and has played 79 games.  Julius is 26 years old and has played 435 games."
"Yes, because I presume that Team USA is just sending Julius Randle to represent them at this point."
"ah yes, let's ignore the top 5 pick from the 2018 draft and the #10 pick from this past year because Julius Randle, who is definitely in no way having an outlier season, is now the #1 guy.  I think you've stumbled onto the Knicksiest scenario ever: they get an itchy trigger finger and trade RJ Barrett to the Suns for CP3 because ""it's about Randle's timeline now"""
"People throw around the term superstar way too much, like a player isn’t a superstar unless they can be the best on a championship contender and Julius Randle isn’t that lmao"
Julius Randle!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Julius Randle was the butt of a lot of the “lol Knicks are trash jokes” based on his play last season  Proved my dumb ass wrong

Through 10 quarters of playoff bball Julius Randle is shooting 12/48 (25%) from the field and 5/16 (31%) from three  Big bruh moment. Rough stuff to watch from him thus far
Does Julius randle think he's playing in the rec?
The Julius Randle career start and end in the same year. Amazing

Julius Randle is who Skip Bayless thinks lebron is like in the playoffs
Julius Randle has been awful this series.
julius randle has by far been the worst star so far these playoffs
Julius the foul merchant Randle with another flop attempt
Does anybody else think Julius Randle should just retire in shame before this gets any worse? Solomon Hill is better than him.
Why are y'all half court sets so bad? Plagued y'all in game 2 as well. Thought Julius Randle took a step up in playmaking this year.
Julius Randle trick yall
Julius Randle what the fuck
Was Julius Randle the worst all star selection in the last twenty years
Couldn’t be Julius randle :(
Ikr what a stupid post by him... Watching Mychal Mulder brick 3s all season was not fun at all. Personally I am having a lot more fun watching Julius Randle shoot 3-15 and helping the Knicks get absolutely dicked by Ice Trae in their first playoff appearance in nearly a decade.
This. He's averaged 36 points but most of them have come at the ft line. When he geta no calls he turns into Julius Randle. Fuck Jokic and his flopping ass
Julius Randle somehow played worse lmao
"He never even had bad games outside of 1 or maybe 2 if we are pushing it, yall acting like he was 2020 siakam or Julius Randle"
"Imagine wanting to create a narrative so badly that you switch Lonzo Ball for Julius Randle in the Pel's deal and act as if LeBron forced Rob Pelinka to let Randle walk for nothing.   Umm did you forget that they were able to add the two leading 6th men of the year? That in itself is proof that you don't have to surround two stars with ""has-beens, journeyman, &amp; D-leaguers"" ... it was just the complete wrong pieces.   You must have been paying 0 attention to what style of roster LeBron has thrived on for the past decade if you think he would handpick a shoot-first point guard (demanding starter role) and two lane clogging bigs."
Lol that Cali team is tough to beat. Did you really just pit the top players in the Western Conference against our team + Julius Randle lol...
Julius randle.   But that’s not how mvp works need a high seed and the stats
Julius Randle is the best Knick since Ewing
His point is that the Timberwolves are the worst team in basketball while the Knicks are by far the most overachieving team in the league and the only thing you can do to discredit to the great Tom Thibodeau is nitpick that he’s playing 26 year old Julius Randle 37.2 mpg (a whopping .1 minutes more than James Harden lol) on a team that plays at the slowest pace in the league.  Thibs for COY.
&gt; Can't handle the Randle.  Too obvious  &gt; Can't foolius the Julius.  Now that one's good
Julius Randle wanted to and Fred could’ve been his teammate. Now he has to deal with Paskal Siakam and all his fuckery instead. Lmaooooo.
I miss watching Larry nance jr and julius randle outhustle everyone on the floor together while they were on the lakers
Hey man 2013 wasn't that long ag- *remembers Julius Randle was drafted in 2014*  God damn it
Please explain why the fuck Julius Randle is higher than CP3 and Luka
Everyone on the team played bad defense and Julius Randle did most of the damage and kristaps wasn't the man guarding him most possessions.
"Dude has shades of what julius randle is doing this season hope he keeps developing, hornets could be dangerous!"
"Julius ""The Big Ju"" Randle"
