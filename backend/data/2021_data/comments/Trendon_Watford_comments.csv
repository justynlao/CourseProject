People in this thread are severely misinterpreting the word “hyped”.  Lamelo Ball may not have been #1. But he was definitely more hyped then say a someone like Trendon Watford who people here probably don’t even know who he is because he’s not as hyped but ranked higher.

"Trendon Watford, Javonte Smart, and Darius Days were all legit players and Smart/Watford were both Cam Thomas' superiors as creators for other players. Yes, Cam Thomas created a whole bunch of shots for himself at LSU, but it is largely because he iso-d into a large number of contested jumpers. He was clearly the best player on LSU last year, but it's not like the team had 0 offense without him and nobody could get a shot without him. Hell, they had 2 guys who averaged 16 points (Smart and Watford) and that was more in spite of Thomas than it was because of him. I like the player, but that's not an accurate depiction of his college team."
"If you're talking about LSU you're just wrong, Javonte Smart, Trendon Watford, and Darius Days could all create and score for that team."
"Agreed. I've seen him in that range for most of the year.  Plus towards the end of the year when Wade stopped playing Days as much LSU and Thomas' defence looked a lot better. They were still bad, but when they play Trendon Watford, a 3, at the 5 it's hard to be that good defensively."
