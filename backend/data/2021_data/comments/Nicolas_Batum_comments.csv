Yeah he's a HOFer... I think he'll have a couple more good seasons after he's off the Pistons.  There's really no point in him trying right now.  He just needs to keep his health.  Very similar to a Nicolas Batum situation.

Minimum contract nicolas batum
Nicolas Batum going 4-4 3PM with great passing and defense early on after being with his wife giving birth and making the gametime decision to play with the team only like half an hour before the game starts.... He's something special.
"If my life depended on a Nicolas Batum corner 3, I'd sleep easy knowing that mf'er going in every time, baby"
Kevin Knox and Nicolas Batum are automatic from the corner. What a time to be alive.

"Nicolas Batum has made more money to do less work than Terry Rozier. Now you tell me again, who actually is living the American Dream?"
"This season?   Nicolas Batum. Dude always sinks open threes when i take a quick look at Clippers games.   Julius Randle. He was doing LeBron stuff when i tuned into the last Bulls-Knicks game.  Edit:  Also Dame. Everytime i watch Dame, he does ridiculous Frobe stuff + Curry stuff."
"Nicolas ""fuk Charlotte lul"" Batum should be top 5 for Most Improved Player"
Holy shit Nicolas Batum is still in the league?
Nicolas Batum so far this season.
"It's 538's new all-in-one stat. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  It spits out some weird shit, like Fred VanVleet #5, Mike Conley #6, Jakob Poetl #14, , Nicolas Batum #15 etc., but it's interesting to have another stat that prioritizes different things than the other more traditional advanced metrics. From what I can tell, it looks like it favours defensive big men with good on/off numbers, and penalizes bad defense players more heavily than other metrics."
Heat couldn’t beat the Clippers without their best player Nicolas Batum.
5 of the top 20 (qualified) 3 point clips belong to Clippers players:  Marcus Morris - 48.4  Paul George - 47.8  Nicolas Batum - 45.6  Luke Kennard - 44.4  Patrick Beverley - 43.6
"Our games have been too late for me :(  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-17) | [](/LAC)Clippers (19-8) ---|---   D.

Obviously not the best metric.    Sabonis is 212th.  Nicolas Batum is 20th.    Keldon Johnson (who has been great for SA) is 231ist.  Mike Muscala is tied with Dejounte Murray.  Sexton and Siakam are 80 spots behind Cameron Johnson.  Etc.

How you gon talk about Vets and not mention the high and mighty Nicolas Batum? Smh
"Historically, Nicolas Batum. That fucker always went off on us."
"The +/-'s of our big 3, Reggie Jackson, Patrick Patterson, and Nicolas Batum."
"Surprised: Nicolas Batum being a heavy rotation player.           Favorite: chemistry and the learning process.                Disappointing: inconsistency, blowing leads, health problems.            Hoping for: healthy squad, consistency, wins."

"Bro Damian Lilliard, Wes Matthews, and Nicolas Batum were all also on that team, and were all better players than anybody Bosh had in Toronto during his stint as their best player."
"Here's a better D-centric squad with a little spacing for the Nets:  * PG: Derrick Rose (Bulls), Lonzo Ball (Lakers), Raymond Felton (Thunder)  * SG: DeMar Derozan (Spurs), Pat Beverly (Clippers), Tony Allen (Grizzlies),  * SF: Bruce Bowen (Spurs), Andre Roberson (Thunder), Kyle Korver (Bucks)  * PF: Dennis Rodman (Pistons), Shawn Marion (Mavericks), Nicolas Batum (Hornets)  * C: Joakim Noah (Bulls), Kevon Looney (Warriors), Larry Sanders (Bucks)  Outside of Derozan the above team is utterly lockdown on defense."
"This is what makes it so infuriating to see the Clippers lose so many close games (only partially, since it helped the Suns move up the standings). When the Clips staved off a 31-point comeback by the Suns earlier in the season, they did so by ball movement and finding the open man -- which was Serge Ibaka and Nicolas Batum in the clutch. They didn't go to Kawhi, who was having an abysmal game, or PG, who was going nuclear -- they swung and got a high percentage shot multiple times. So seeing them not execute against other teams is numbing"

"Yeah, duck Nicolas Batum"
imagine having nicolas batum on your team and not figuring out how to use him effectively
"They're having a historical shooting season. I couldn't believe it until I looked it up. [As a team they're shooting **41.7%** and on pace to outshoot the 2015-16 73-9 Warriors in 3 pt %.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/team_fg3_pct.html) They have **6** 40%+ three point shooters (regular contributors)+ Kawhi who's just as good.  - Marcus Morris - 47.5%  - Luke Kennard - 46.1%  - Reggie Jackson - 43.8%  - PatBev - 42.3%  - PG - 42.1%  - Nicolas Batum - 40.2%  - Kawhi - 39.6%   (To put that into perspective, the Warriors only had Curry (45.4%), Klay (42.5%) and Brandon Rush (41.4%) over 40% that season.)  They're also on pace to shoot the [highest team free throw percentage in NBA history](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/team_ft_pct.html)  [Every one of the Clippers I listed is attempting more than 3 shots a game.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2021.html)  Morris (5.2), Kennard (3.5), Jackson (4.1), Beverley (3.9), PG (7.5), Batum (4.1), Kawhi (4.9)  As a team they're attempting 34.4 a game which is more than the [Warriors did \(31.6\)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2016.html)   Curry attempted 11.2, Klay 8.1, and then the rest of their sharpshooters were basically around the 2-3 range."
I’m enjoying this little Nicolas Batum Renaissance.
"Nicolas Batum still played for the Hornets, so no."

"I'm not gonna pretend I know much about the Clippers but Nicolas Batum just said in a French interview that he's great for the team, and he explains that he can give you 20 quality minutes. I'm glad he's finding a new home"
"James Harden got a quadruple double against the hornets.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XccafMT-_Hw lol  and though I hate nicolas batum with a severe passion and wish him nothing but the worst, he did have a 5x5 game and i think david robinson had a few"
"I mean, for me at least, my enjoyment of basketball is completely conditional on Nicolas Batum playing every night"
“They have one (maybe two with Batum) players who can kinda guard Lebron and then a team filled with guys Lebron will savage.”  So you think Nicolas Batum will do a better job than Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in guarding LeBron James? I’m gobsmacked.

"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."

"Nicolas Batum, both aesthetically and practically, would have been the Shane Battier of the Lakers"
For real his matchup would’ve been Nicolas Batum most of the time
Mavs really let Nicolas fuckin Batum finish an alley oop..
Kovid Klaw is really deffering to Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum in an elimination game.    Shannon Sharpe was right when he said Kahwi is coddled and Ty Lue should have started Terrance Mann
Kawhi or PG have to take that shot down 1 with less than 20 seconds left not a botched lay up by Nicolas Batum.
With the game on the line you let Terrance Mann and Nicolas batum decide your fate? They had time. Why would you not look for either of your best players?
Nicolas batum is playing 36mins and has +27. what?
A French guy who slummed it up playing for a Charlotte team then proceeded to be an X-factor while playing with Kawhi? Are we talking about Boris Diaw or Nicolas Batum?

"Kemba Walker, LaMelo Ball, Gordon Hayward, Nicolas Batum, Bismack Biyombo"
B and no it’s not because Nicolas batum is on team B
"&gt; i hope nicolas batum returns and retires a clipper. need that man in a clipper jersey opening night  [This is one of the tweets she liked recently](https://twitter.com/clippers24seven/status/1414805830994579456?s=21)  Granted it was before Kawhi’s surgery was announced but it seems like the Batum family values loyalty and enjoys being in LA, plus they know when healthy they have something special and if the money is equal I don’t see him leaving"
"The Clippers would beat the Lakers. Pick and roll combo of Rondo and Boogie would be a thing of beauty. Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, and Ibaka on the same team would be scary. There is also Reggie Jackson, Nicolas Batum, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Luke Kennard, and Yogi Ferrell."
And also Nicolas Batum. I though Nic was washed for sure. Had no idea he was still this effective. If he had come back to Portland we probably beat the injury depleted Nuggets in the first round.
PJ Tucker and Nicolas Batum are better centers
"nicolas batum wasn't really that bad, Charlotte just expected him to be a franchise player when he was at best an role player"
FUCK YOU NICOLAS BATUM  YOU A BUM  STOLE OUR FUCKING MONEY  HOPE SUNS WIN

"That's fair enough, but france team had Rudy Gobert, Evan Forunier, Nicolas Batum, and Frank Ntilikina, no all stars level player (you can argue for Rudy Gobert).   USA teams can overcome chemistry issues because of the overwhelming talent, but that wasn't the case that time. You have to admit that the world is slowly catching up in talent."
"i meant if hakeem didn't have an offensive game, but yea because hakeem was such a good scorer a team would never have nicolas batum on him lol."
&gt; barely used a center against them.  As a Blazers fan it's been especially surreal watching a team perform well with Nicolas Batum at the 5.
"I always say the team with the better center will win, and  Nicolas Batum proved that."
"imagine losing to Terrence Mann, Reggie Jackson, and Nicolas Batum. Rough series for Utah fans"
"Who would have thought Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Terrence Mann, and center Nicolas Batum would get it done?   Oh and MV(Playoff)P"
"when people said at the outset of the season the Clippers would smoke their way through the west, i did *not* think they were talking about Terance Mann, Reggie Jackson, and Nicolas Batum."
Mf’s really scared of a geriatric Nicolas Foster Batum
rudy gobert being a 7 foot dude and not being able to post up nicolas fucking batum is just not going to work in the playoffs when teams can gameplan specifically for you
Nicolas Batum's dad was a pro overseas and collapsed during a game and died soon after. Pretty sure Batum was watching from the audience as a kid. I can't even imagine how traumatizing that's gotta be.

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
Batum is really good in this France Team because he plays his role. He let Fournier be the go to guy and De Colo the playmaker and everything works. That´s when Nicolas tried to be the heir of Parker that he was bad for France. Batum is a magnificent super charged role player with outstanding defense and basketball IQ.

"Sometimes in basket ball, you need your leaders to commit hard fauls to wake up the squad. That's what he did with success, avoiding an easy basket at the same time. we still end up losing that year.  I'm glad americans can see the true value of Batum as an elite defender in these olympics. It's always the same, if you're not a scorer, the hate is comin'.  Nicolas ""Le Contre"" Batum for the win"
"Nicolas Batum gave us a huge game in defense.  He bothered Doncic a lot, who finished with 5/18 in shots. Obviously, with such a player, it was expected that he would concentrate on passing: 18 assists.  He realized a big triple-double but he lacked killer instinct at the end of the game.  He should have taken the winning shot in my opinion."

His best year with the Hornets (the one right before he was due for a contract extension) was 2015. Batum divorced his wife in 2013 which dragged on a few years, and he was remarried a couple years later.   He might have had some salvageable trade value for his expiring deal if he played in 2020 for the Hornets like he did in 2021 for the Clippers. He could have stepped up at any point after getting his contract extension and just never elevated his game.

"Here's the snippet from the ""report"" in question:  &gt;The Blazers **have shown no inkling they intend** to move on from Damian Lillard or C.J. McCollum, and have a slew of their own free agents—Norman Powell, most notably, plus guaranteeing the $12 million for the final year of Jusuf Nurkić’s contract, which Portland is expected to do—to deal with. Ex-Blazer Nicolas Batum is on Portland’s radar, per a source, with the Blazers projecting to be limited with what they can spend by their $5.3 million mid-level exception.  This is simply speculation from Mannix on what the Blazers might do based on what he had (or hadn't) heard from his or other league sources. The problem with that is that while our FO has its issues, the one thing it has been very good at is keeping roster moves under wraps until they happen. The last time anyone in the org leaked accurate news ahead of time was when LMA was leaving and that assistant got fired.  Essentially, when you hear the Blazers are involved in a trade, it's either not happening or it's already a done deal. It's when you don't hear anything that a trade comes out of nowhere."
&gt;I feel like he's gonna take deals similar to Jeff Green or Nicolas Batum.  Pretty sure they got different deals.  Green's was reported to be 2/$10m and Batum was 2/120% of min.
1 year $13 million for Nicolas Batum
Is Nico Batum a thing now? Sounds cooler than Nicolas. Does he bowl with his cousin?
"Neil Olshey: ""Get ready guys, I'm about to make my big move!""  Fans: ""Oh yeah, what's the move?""  Neil: ""He's a 6'9 3 and D wing, you might be familiar with him""  Fans: ""Oh really? That's exactly who we need! Who is it?""  Neil: ""Nicolas..... BATUM!""  Fans: ""Get out..."""
My favorite part about Nicolas Batum is that he's a total fucking bum who should be slandered at every opportunity

"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"

Giannis is the next Nicolas Batum
"This is great advice for the elite players, but not applicable to everyone. Why would Apple want to meet with Nicolas Batum?"
"I mean he WAS going against Nicolas Batum, stop being so harsh on him."
"“That’s a hell of a team”    Frank Ntilikina, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot, Thomas Heurtel, Nicolas Batum, Guerschon Yabusele, Evan Fournier, Nando de Colo, Fenerbahçe	, Vincent Poirier, Andrew Albicy, Gran Canaria, Rudy Gobert, Petr Cornelie, Pau-Lacq-Orthez, Moustapha Fall  Edit - grammer"
"Yeah, I mean WTF Oppenheimer!!! That said, I like Batum's name - I sometimes scroll back the highlights just to hear the name ""Nicolas Batum for three! Yes!!!"", hahaha other than that I don't even know how he looks like lol."
"&gt; Most likely, Giannis Antetokounmpo will be a solid-to-good role player like Nicolas Batum or Lamar Odom. But once again, it's hard to pinpoint both his floor and ceiling as a player due to his age and lack of experience. With time, his potential will become much more clear. This is what adds to the mystery and intrigue of drafting International prospects."
"&gt; Charlotte’s Nicolas Batum, a 6-foot-8 forward having an all-star kind of season  What? Even in his best Charlotte season Batum was nowhere even close to being in all-star consideration, this is just ahistorical"
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"Nicolas Batum signed a five year 120 million dollar contract. In the five years, his BPM total was 0.2 meaning he was basically playing at the level of an average replacement. Imagine paying 120 million for a guy that can be replaced right away by a G-Leaguer."
"&gt; I want to know why you think I said he was a 40% 3PT shooter.  I never said you said that, but you called him a great shooter, and 40% from 3 would pretty much be the lowest efficiency you could plausibly consider a great shooter. That would put him about par with the likes of Nicolas Batum and Jeremy Lamb.   &gt;You’re basing your argument off of his free throw percentage. So answer the question, could a hypothetical 40% free throw shooter be a good shooter in the league?  Oh, so we're down to a *good* shooter now. But no, a 40% free throw shooter would not under any circumstances be considered a good shooter."
"He was, and the fans around me and I knew that. But you could also see that he was a HOF pg simply not trying. Sometimes that happens and it’s a learning experience. Most recent prime example being Nicolas Batum’s stint in Charolette. Batum might not be HOF but his career definitely took an abnormal dip during that one year."
"Nicolas Batum was no dud. and other teams need to build up in part with 2nd round picks which at least pan out equally often but take years to develop. anyway, the NBA is an artificial pseudo (US sports in general) competition but its fun none the less."
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid. Guys like Biyombo, Mozgov, Mahinimi, Deng, Parsons, etc. [Here's a list from that summer.](https://www.businessinsider.com/31-best-nba-free-agents-2016-2016-6)"
"Buddy Hield's contract is similarly bad lmfao, and Barnes doesn't put them over the top. Like if you asked me Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder or Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum maybe different story"

"Gobert's problem in the playoffs is mainly his inability to punish small ball lineups on offense. It isn't as much about his defense as people say . He doesn't punish a small ball lineup, and Nicolas Batum was regularly guarding him, as a 6'8"" forward. Gobert should of feasted, but the Clippers got away with running an all out shooting lineup, while not having to worry about a big mismatch at the 5 spot.  If Gobert can be more aggressive on offense and punish small ball lineups, then this will completely shift the strategy of opposing teams, as they will be forced to play a bigger 5, and they can't go all out with an all shooting offense.."
"Let’s put it this way, I rather be chandler parsons or Nicolas batum than Adrian dantley"
"&gt; He signed that min because he was hurt.  That's the contract Batum signed *this* offseason, in August 2021. He wasn't hurt, he was coming off a good season with the Clippers.   https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/nicolas-batum-re-signs-with-la-clippers"
2010 Magic  Jamal Murray (Jameer Nelson)  Caris LeVert (Vince Carter)  Torrey Craig (Matt Barnes)  Nicolas Batum (Rashard Lewis)  Clint Capela (Dwight Howard)
&gt; Ayton's ability to not get played off the court is huge.  I'm not sold that's going to last.   He got played off the court by Nicolas Batum in an elimination game.
"&gt; if Ayton didn’t have a very small sample size of a good postseason last year  And you also have to overlook some weird red flags like Ayton getting played off the court by Nicolas Batum, giving up 50 to Giannis in an elimination game, etc."
"Perhaps. On the other hand it could light a fire in him to stop doing things like ""get played off the court in a Conference Finals game by Nicolas Batum"" or ""give up 50 in an elimination game in the NBA Finals""."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"Right. He literally gave up 50 in an elimination game. And got played off the court by Nicolas Batum in a WCF game.   He's not a surefire max, especially with a shameful owner like Sarver.   It's not guarantee if he'll ever be a top 25 player."
"in a game where both teams missed their best players (Luka Doncic and Nicolas Batum), the Clippers gritted out a win"
"Shawn Marion, Andrei Kirilenko, Nicolas Batum"
The Clippers are 8-5 and their second best player is Nicolas Batum.
"If we adjust Curry’s stats to exclude outliers, his stats look similar to 2018 Dan Majerle.  First, let’s adjust his 3pt percentage. Curry has been shooting an unsustainable 43.2% from three. The la this year so far is around 34.3%. If we adjust his 3pt% to 35 (STILL ABOVE LA) he goes to only having 2346.3 career 3pt. I’ll be generous and give him 2400.  Now let’s adjust his total attempts. Curry attempts a ball hog esque 8.7 threes per game. If we lower this to 5, his total number of threes fall to 1379.  WHAT DOES THIS TELL US?  It tells us that Curry’s perceived success in the nba is based on wildly outlier, unsustainable stats and that he’s bound to regress. After the stat adjustments I made, his career threes falls squarely between Nicolas Batum and Dan Majerle."
i just want it to be known that i absolutely fucking hate nicolas batum
They clippers played a 6ft4 Nicolas batum at center. He couldn’t take advantage of that on offense which is his fault.
Nicolas Batum will win us a lot of games this season
