"No they traded Hunter for Hayes, NAW, the 35th pick (Didi Louzada), a protected CLE pick that became two seconds, AND got off Solomon Hill’s money which allowed them to sign JJ Redick"
The way AD left too set the Pelicans up for the future.   They got;  Ingram  Lonzo  Hart  NAW  Hayes  Didi Louzada (Brazilian 2nd round pick in 2019)   And then a ton of picks.   Plenty of stars don’t request trades and leave the team when the team they were on was built to around them.
"it kinda exists in a way with draft and stash like Bolmaro, Krejči, Simonović... this year or Didi Louzada last year"
Probably Didi Louzada
Steph saw what Didi Louzada did to Luka and wants no part of that
Cristiano Felicio. And Didi Louzada just signed with the Pels.
hop on the Didi Louzada hype train before we leave station
"PG: Sexton or Lonzo, Kira  SG: NAW, Korkmaz, Didi Louzada  SF: BI, Naji Marshall, Bullock in free agency or Prince in a trade with CLE  PF: Zion, James Johnson, Wenyen Gabriel  C: Adams, Jax   Spots 14 and 15: prob 2 of our 4 second round picks   1. I’ve really been digging the Sexton trade talk. A young guard who plays passionately and scores with great efficiency and actively gives a shit on defense; I’ll take that all day every day. I’d do Bledsoe, 10 and whatever else Cleveland wants that’s not the young core.   2. I’m ready for Nickeil as a full time starter. Between his 15-20 starts last year and where he looked legit great next to Zion and BI (better than ANY other guard on our roster) along with his play in the FIBA Qualifiers for Canada.   3. I’m looking forward to Willie Green turning Zion and BI into a dynamic duo together rather than a dynamic duo apart (if that makes sense; I think Pels fans can speak to that) + raising defensive intensity   4. Need James Johnson back, he was solid for us and gave us great minutes after the deadline  5. Adams and Jax will be a top 5 Center rotation in the league next season, bet on it.   6. If we re-sign Lonzo, I’m cool with it too. I truly don’t see him getting the contract everyone’s been talking him up for. I also think Lonzo and Sexton could play together, but that’s expensive for at least one season before Sexton hits RFA."
"Pels also got Didi Louzada, a Thybulle-caliber defender, along with Hayes and NAW. All three in exchange for that Hunter pick. Given Hunter's age, low ceiling, and severe injury status, as a Pels fans I wouldn't trade any of those three back for Hunter.  That was a ridiculously great trade by David Griffin."
"Not really if you understand the context behind why he was signed in the first place. Lonzo, Ingram and Zion were all injured, and then Josh Hart tore his thumb. They needed someone to fill minutes and bring some scoring after they lost their starting PG and their two leading scorers.  Then Lonzo, Ingram and Zion came back and the Pelicans didn't need IT anymore. Plus Hart was pretty much out for the season and NAW just got hurt and looked to be a multi week injury so they needed a wing a lot more than they needed a guard. So they used that spot on Didi Louzada.  Unless he dropped 30/10 after not playing NBA basketball in 14 months, he wasn't getting a 2nd contract from the Pels. He was signed to fill a need, did so, and then was no longer needed."
Didi Mf Louzada
Y’all think y’all got hot takes gimme Didi Louzada DPOY idc
My man really listed didi louzada and Jaxson Hayes as young talent lmao
"Kira Lewis, Satoransky, point Zion, point BI, then some guard/wings off the bench like Didi Louzada and Nani Marshall"
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
"Are we sure multiple teams wanted Ball, though? The Ball buzz at the trade deadline was only about the Bulls, and clearly the Bulls were the only ones making a big offer now in free agency. (Pretty clear inference from the deal being done in the first minute of free agency; and probably also why the Pels got so little in the S&amp;T. If other teams were competing for Ball, the Bulls probably have to give up more for him.)  And can I point out that every other move by the Bulls was a grotesque overpay for a mediocre one-dimensional player? They're building around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan as well as Ball - and gave up the farm to do so. There is very little evidence the current Bulls front office knows what they're doing.  Re: the Anthony Davis heist, the Pels still have an age-22 All-Star in Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, two R1 picks, and two R1 pick swaps from that. They're doing OK there."

ESPN Sources: NBA has suspended Pelicans forward DiDi Louzada for 25 games without pay for violating the NBA/NBPA’s Anti-Drug program. Louzada tested positive for Drostanolone and Testosterone.
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
