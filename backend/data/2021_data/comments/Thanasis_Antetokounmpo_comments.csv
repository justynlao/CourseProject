"It is an attack when you insinuate that watching basketball players take shots will all of a sudden compel black people to vaccinate, if the science doesn't compel black people,Thanasis Antetokounmpo certainly isn't.  If black people are reluctant to take the vaccine,and once again Blacks are not typically anti vax,seeing a basketball player isn't going to change that feeling.  Its not fucking superstition. Its legitimate distrust of a racist healthcare system.  Black kids are vaccinated at the same rate as white kids for childhood diseases and for certain things like HPV black people vaccinate at a higher percentage.  You don't know enough about the history of racism in healthcare to make some surface level statements like you've done. They are pandering and insulting."
"Correct, but he's in a 3-way tie with Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Javonte Greene"
"&gt;Thanasis the youngest Antetokounmpo brother (he's the oldest)  Thanasis is actually the second-oldest of the brothers, but he's definitely older than Giannis and the commentators definitely screwed that (and more) up last night."
"He's really not. I watched the first half and remember he called Thanasis the youngest Antetokounmpo brother (he's the oldest) and he also called Wes Matthew's ""Matthis"" twice. People aren't exaggerating."
"This very exact comment , pretty sure word for word, has been posted under any Thanasis Antetokounmpo highlight ever since he joined the Bucks"
Thanasis wouldn't be in the NBA if his last name wasn't Antetokounmpo.
"Just woke up from a coma, is Thanasis Antetokounmpo the best player in the NBA"
We need a highlight video for Thanasis Antetokounmpo accomplishing the LiAngelo statline yesterday.
"LOL, Thanasis Antetokounmpo might be having a better season than Thybulle.  He isn't worth even a first round pick."
Thanasis Antetokounmpo
"Dude, we are literally playing Thanasis Antetokounmpo"
"Thanasis Antetokounmpo is the fake ID Giannis created to get into strip clubs and drink while underage, everybody knows that."
All the Antetokounmpo boys work hard and are good locker room guys. It's not like Kostas and Thanasis are lazy bums with bad attitudes coasting off their brother's success.
Thanasis Antetokounmpo might be less qualified lmao
Antetokounmpo Middleton Holiday Lopez Divincenzo Portis Forbes Connaughton  That’s pretty much our core rotation minus Augustin and whoever between Torrey Craig and Thanasis Bud is trying to play
JJ Redick = Eric Bledsoe / Lamelo Ball = Thanasis Antetokounmpo / Sam Merrill = DJ Wilson  any i missed?
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"Giannis, Thanasis, Cacok, and seven guys who checked the wrong Antetokounmpo."
Thanasis Antetokounmpo
Antetokounmpo of course. Thanasis is clearly this team's #1.
Maybe if yall had certified snipers dj wilson and thanasis antetokounmpo you would have broken the record

"You’re just going by PER then? So we can agree that Robert Williams III is a top 10 player? Thanasis Antetokounmpo has a higher PER than Blake Griffin this year, so we can agree that he’s the superior player right? Blindly comparing PER doesn’t mean a thing, it’s an incredibly situational stat.   To answer your questions...  1) Very questionable going forward. 2) The gap between the two on offense is pretty minor; the gap between the two on defense is **astronomical.** It’s also much harder to be one of the best defenders in the league and still produce the offense Jrue does - offense only players like Kemba are much more common and historically don’t end up as the last ones standing.  3) No, it doesn’t. Jrue is better in that role.  I’d argue you’re also forgetting about the major thing - Jrue has proven that he steps up to an elite level in the postseason. Kemba shrunk under the pressure. Playoff performance is what really matters for teams like Boston and Milwaukee, and it’s a huge difference in their resumes that you’re trying to conveniently ignore with your 3 questions."
"Reminds me of Marques Johnson. His Instagram handle and twitter handle is literally ""olskool888"" lol  He gave Thanasis Antetokounmpo the nickname ""Thanasty"" this season, I was dying LOL"
"Not really, NBA is really hard to watch right now because of it for casual fans.   I went to a Bucks game and the entire starting lineup was out. The Bucks starting lineup was Jordan Nwora, Jeff Teague, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Bryn Forbes, and Bobby Portis.   Now, I go to a lot of Bucks games so I didn't really care, but what if that was someones first and only chance to go to a Bucks game this season. They should have someone standing at the door with a voucher for a free game or discount to another game or to the merch shop when that type of thing happens. People aren't paying $100 a ticket to see Thanasis Antetokounmpo."

"Fuck me.  Ricky, Naz and Nowell have been god awful these last two games.  I'm especially pissed at Naz. He's had a golden opportunity to prove himself as a legit player and has completely shit the bed.  Look, i'm not expecting us to compete with the Bucks when we dont have KAT. But some of these players just havent been good enough and cant be defended.  Once again Vando got more assists than Ricky Rubio. How embarassing is that? Ricky is supposed to be a god tier passer, and i know our shooting was pathetic but 2 assists from him does not cut it. Thanasis Antetokounmpo got more  JO and Juancho looked good so I guess there's that"

"&gt;There was never emphasis on that  *But there should be.* Your sample size is 7 games, and 5 of those games were against a team missing its 2nd scorer. Playing well on defense against such a team is therefore not much of an achievement, unless you do work to separate the effect of the Nets defense on the Celtics offense from the effect of Jaylen Brown's injury on the Celtics offense.  Which you haven't done.  &gt;Veteran teams have historically coasted in the regular season  LMAO  They don't, though. No title winning team has been lower than 5th in net efficiency in the regular season in the last 10 years.  I can't believe I have to keep repeating this.  &gt;Common sense would tell me defense is playing a role too, unless you believe the Nets defense has absolutely nothing to do with the Bucks failing to crack even 90 points, which in that case we can end the discussion here.   There's a reason that most analytical models weight garbage time differently from actual contests. You're apparently utterly unaware of this concept.   Maybe you think the Bucks were still trying to win the game during the 9:27 they put Thanasis Antetokounmpo on the floor?  &gt;I graduated 10 years ago  With an Art History degree, apparently.

"Uh oh Antetokounmpo is coming in, we're in trouble now.  Wait? Giannis was in this whole time, that's Thanasis? Oh shit."
"Thanasis with the +11, clearly the best Antetokounmpo."

"Going out on a limb here, but are Giannis Antetokounmpo and Thanasis Antetokounmpo related"
"It's pretty incredible to me how virtually every national announcer gets shit wrong about the Antetokounmpo family. They'll say Thanasis is younger, or leave out the youngest (Alex), or not mention Francis (oldest, from what I can tell not as close to the family as the rest of them are). Like it's their job to know this shit and they continue to get it wrong even though you know they've been corrected on it every time they do."
Best of luck Milwaukee (and former Knicks Bobby Portis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as well) :)

The prophecy warned that an Antetokounmpo would need to be sacrificed to the covid deities at some point during the Finals for Bucks to win.   Coach Bud pulling a Dumbledore and keeping Thanasis warm on the roster for this precise moment.
"HOLY FUCK dude I think we just figured out how the Bucks had an outbreak.   CP3 saved some of his saliva from when he had Covid in a vial and dumped it in a water bottle labeled ""Antetokounmpo"" in game 1. Little did he know, he accidentally dumped it in Giannis' brothers bottle causing him to get it.   Thanasis then gave it to the assistant coach because they are secretly lovers.   You are the Watson to my Sherlock."
"Originally it was announced the Giannis Antetokounmpo was entering health and safety protocols but Thanasis stepped in and said, ""Take my Antetokounmpo."""
"All I read was Antetokounmpo and went full WHAT????? ""Thanasis"" didn't register until a few seconds later."
"You and the other reply so missing the point.   It's a simple engagement trick from Shams.

Thanasis definitely the second best Antetokounmpo.

When I wear the shirt with the national emblem I feel like I’m part of Greece and I try to give my best. I feel that, maybe in this way I am repaying Greece in gratitude, for what she has offered me during the difficult period of my life… This is one of the reasons why, together with my brother Thanasis, we held the “AntetokounBros” events in the two previous summers. These events aim to bring ourselves close to children and people who love us in general, as a small reward for all this love we receive. With “AntetokounBros” we can also offer something of ourselves to Greece in return for what she had offered us: Free education, a homeland that embraced my family in difficult times… these I will never forget in my life. I will always feel compelled and will try with every opportunity to give back.  &gt;Why is Greece your first choice for vacation and how do you feel when you return?  &gt;First of all because Greece is home … And I mean my friends, my hangouts and my memories! Yet, I do not think there is a more beautiful country in the world that combines such a harmony of visions, smells and flavors. Greece can offer you all you wish to experience. So what I’m saying to anyone who asks me is that … if they want to truly live their holidays and not just go on vacation, they MUST come to Greece!"

"He went to health and safety protocols, but this could be so much as a close contact, or a test conducted due to feeling symptomatic or close contact. Just because he contracted it and was tested does not mean he was being regularly tested by the NBA. Here is the NBC article for when the story broke, with no appearance of the word “test” or “testing”:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2021/07/17/bucks-thanasis-antetokounmpo-out-for-game-5-enters-health-safety-protocols/amp/"
"In three out of six games, the Antetokounmpo brothers scored 40+ points. Truly remarkable play from Thanasis and Giannis. Rivaling the Gretzky’s in terms of brotherly success."
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Thanasis Antetokounmpo 3. Kostas Antetkounmpo 4. Brook Lopez 5. Robin Lopez
Dame for Antetokounmpo. Thanasis would really thrive in Portland.
"Lmao the clippers get gianniS ANtetokounmpo, but the lakers and spurs get kostaS ANtetokounmpo, and thanasiS ANtetokounmpo respectively"
"Heel: The Tribal Chief Giannis Antetokounmpo, with this Bloodline Cousins Kostas &amp; Thanasis.  Face: AEW’s New Signees Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso"
Nah man. Thanasis Antetokounmpo. Just fouling the shit out of everyone
"its so dumb to think that thousands of redditors who 99% have never met the players themselves, are smarter/more capable than basketball execs and coaches who deal with the players on a daily basis.   if giannis hadn't sign his extension yet and the bucks were offered a straight up thanasis antetokounmpo houston's #2 pick they'd be stupid to accept."
yea but then again you gotta understand that we're dealing with real people with characters and emotion. not some 2k shit where you know the players are limited to a certain number of actions/feelings.  Does thanasis antetokounmpo deserve a roster spot on a championship-contending team? if giannis hadn't sign his extension yet and the bucks were offered a straight up thanasis for jerami grant trade would they be stupid to decline?   things like that we don't factor in because we have no personal connection to the players.
"Definitely. There are only a few sets of brothers trios to play in the NBA to start with. I can only think of:  * Will, Caldwell, Major and Charles Jones * Frank, Campy and Walker Russell * Jon, Brent and Drew Barry * Luke, Tyler and Cody Zeller * Jrue, Justin and Aaron Holiday * Giannis, Thanasis, and Kostas Antetokounmpo"

"The brawl began with 45.9 seconds remaining in the game, when Milwaukee led 97–82. Bulls player Mike Dunlevy was fouled from behind by Bucks 2x MVP and world champion Giannis Antetokounmpo, who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Dunlevy later said that Antetokounmpo had warned him he would be hit. Dunleavy responded by shoving Michael Carter-Williams in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep the two separated.  Bulls coach Larry Brown was not yet very concerned, because fights in the NBA rarely lasted for more than a few seconds. During the altercation, Antetokounmpo lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Bucks radio broadcaster Jim Paschke. The microphone was not live. Paschke recalled that the broadcasting team knew Antetokounmpo’s personality and ""figured it was a great time to interview him because he has a wonderful personality, A great sense of humor and the fans love him"". After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Dunleavy would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Dunleavy’s fans should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Bucks players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if Dunleavy got ejected, he would have to walk past the Bucks bench, which could have caused another incident.  Ninety seconds after Dunleavy shoved Antetokounmpo, most of both teams' players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Dunleavy[3](Jeff Teauge was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire game; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Antetokounmpo was lying on the table, Dunleavy threw a towel at him, causing Antetokounmpo to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, who shockingly was also coincidentally named Mike Dunleavy then threw a plastic cup of beer at Michael Carter-Williams, hitting him in the Teeth. Antetokounmpo jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man,  Michael Dunnothing,  who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Paschke stood up to try and hold back Antetokounmpo and was bumped slightly in the effort, and suffered no ill affects and promptly retired after A long and very successful career. Antetokounmpo’s older brother Thanasis followed Antetokounmpo into the stands and punched a Mike Dunleavy fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Michael Carter-William’s face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Additionally players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who did not play because of an injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to get praise Antetokounmpo and to celebrate. Antetokounmpo the punched Dunleavy twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's mother, Daisy .[3] More fans then began throwing drinks, food, and other objects, and a deafening “Fuck Mike Dunleavy” chant began to fill the arena.   The event garnered major media attention and was known henceforth as the “Dunleavy’s game that went badly in the Bradley” and won’t soon be forgotten."
"Easy, the reigning NBA champion Antetokounmpo…Thanasis  Thanasis Antetokounmpo and I share the same birthday"
"Thanasis Antetokounmpo wouldn’t be on the bucks if it weren’t for Giannis, he really isn’t a valuable member of the team. The facts that team is so riddled with injuries is why he gets any play time."
"Thanasis ""Giannis"" Antetokounmpo"
"**BUCKS TRADE:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Thanasis Antetokounmpo.  **LAKERS TRADE:** Russell Westbrook and all those picks that they somehow haven't already traded.  Easy!"
"&amp;#x200B;  &gt;Milwaukee stud Giannis Antetokounmpo is a free agent in 2021 and could want a bigger stage. But “The Greek Freak’’ has no ties to New York other than bad thoughts about brother, Thanasis, not being treated well while with the Knicks organization.   &gt;   &gt;The Knicks were actually ahead of the curve on acquiring Giannis’ brother. They drafted Thanasis No. 51 in 2014. Surprising even his own agent, Thanasis signed to play for New York’s minor-league affiliate for rather than signing overseas for a far higher salary. However, the Knicks fired their minor-league coaches after the season, reportedly due to unhappiness with Thanasis’ development. The parent club signed Thanasis in 2015 but gave him just a small guarantee. He didn’t make the regular-season roster, New York leaving an open spot. The Knicks signed him to a 10-day contract later in the season.

"&gt; Thanasis Antetokounmpo is a bumper car playing his own hybrid of rugby and basketball. **Whatever it is, you can't take your eyes off of it.**  Lmao.   &gt; Keep an eye on Jordan Nwora.   Damn looks like a lot of people are taking notice."
\&gt;Brook Lopez ambles into trailing 3s with the ease and familiarity of an old man plopping into a recliner  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Thanasis Antetokounmpo is a bumper car playing his own hybrid of rugby and basketball  &amp;#x200B;  lmao spot on
"Last year he averaged 11.8/5.9/1.9/1/.4 on 38/23/70 splits  Oh wait, those were his stats Per 36.... Dude sucks beyond belief, especially for a mid first rounder. Last year Thanasis Antetokounmpo put up 10.8/8.1/3/1.4/.7 per 36 on 49/24/51 splits, but Thanasis wasnt a mid first rounder."
I’m actually Thanasis Antetokounmpo
Can’t believe the Thanasis “9.6 playoff fouls per 36” Antetokounmpo disrespect in this thread smh.
Thanasis Antetokounmpo/Sandro Mamukelashvili/Giorgios Kalaitzakis the biggest big three in NBA history 😤
"That’s NBA champion, Thanasis Antetokounmpo."
"Antetokounmpo will dominate   Thanasis 20pt game, book it"
"But an all-time great trio of names in Georgios Kalaitzakis, Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Sandro Mamukelashvili."
**Thanasis Antetokounmpo reading this comment**: *say what now?*
"&gt; **Brook Lopez:** [...] Two of my teammates, Jordan Nwora and Giannis’s brother Thanasis [Antetokounmpo], are huge into manga. Giannis enjoys it, too, but Thanasis is … my goodness. He might be the biggest manga/anime fan I’ve met in the NBA. On plane rides he’s always watching different animes. He always comes to games with different hoodies or tees with manga characters on them. So he loves it. He’d be all about contributing.  How long until we see Thanasis wearing ahegao hoodie as his pregame fit?"
"&gt;	Less than four hours before tipoff came what multiple sources inside the organization call “an oh-shit moment”: Thanasis Antetokounmpo — the back-slapping, whisper-in-the-ear older brother and bench-warming teammate of the best player in the game — was sick with cold symptoms and getting sicker. (Thanasis’ agency did not respond to questions about his condition.) He had returned a false positive, been isolated and re-tested. He would have to miss Game Five, and word eventually arrived with a confirmed result: Positive for 2019-nCoV.  &gt;	Chatter across the organization blew up:  FUCK.  &gt;	Damn, who was with T.A.? &gt;	Well, Giannis must have it.  &gt;	The Antetokompos, after all, are inseparable. “Certainly those two guys’ connection and the closeness, everybody knows it,” Budenholzer, the head coach, told reporters 90 minutes before tip-off. “But, you know, I think we’re all good. We’re all ready. Ready to go.” Pressed by a reporter, he briefly and vaguely admitted that the Bucks would not be playing with a full staff."
Mychel Thompson  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Kostas Antetokounmpo  LiAngelo Ball  Keljin Blevins  Some of the best players of all time
"I mean it's all relative.   When I say Thanasis Antetokounmpo sucks, I obviously meant compared relatively to the rest of the league. Not the general population."
"I like Hubie Brown thinking that Thanasis can just ""post up"" and score a basket... I think he may be thinking of the wrong Antetokounmpo"
That’s Knicks legend Thanasis Antetokounmpo to you
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Jrue Holiday  Brook Lopez   just won the championship this year.  Id have to imagine adding one of the greatest players of all time in Steph Curry wouldnt hurt
We're actually moving closer to a lineup with:  Pat Connaughton  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Georgios Kalaitzakis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili  And that doesn't even include Donte DiVincenzo. Has anyone seen this lineup play in its entirety? Have they gotten 4 out of 5 of these guys?
"I'm guessing George Hill/Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora/Thanasis Antetokounmpo/Bobby Portis. Portis is likely still on limited minutes, so yeah Sandro Mamukelashvili may see some bigger minutes."
"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Grayson Allen  George Hill (I think)  Sandro Mamukelashvili  Semi Ojeleye  Scrimblo Bimblo
