"LeBron played against Kevin Willis (born September 6th 1962) and Patrick Williams (August 26th 2001) so almost 39 years span. If he plays against Aleksej Pokusevski (December 26th 2001) he goes over 39 years.  LeBron might get to a quite high number, if he can continue to play."
"As a Heat fan, I agree, Aleksej Pokusevski's game has an uncanny likeness to Aleksej Pokusevski, gonna have a real bright future in the league."
 Aleksej Pokusevski  for dpoy
Aleksej Pokusevski ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
I saw a couple a game when he played and I like what pop is doing. limiting his role to just 3 and D right now is good for him making him consistent at his strength and adding layers later on is good development. I feel sorry for ALEKSEJ POKUSEVSKI from OKC they are just throwing him in the fire and his confidence level seems like an all time low.

Aleksej Pokusevski is averaging 7 points 7 boards 3.8 assists on absolutely horrible efficiency averaging 4 TURNOVERS A GAME AS A CENTER in the gleague I don’t think kostas is worse than him tbh
Second youngest behind Aleksej Pokusevski right
"Aleksej Pokusevski, ceiling is point center god, floor is out of the league in two years."
"Even though Aleksej Pokusevski is the youngest player in the NBA, he has arguably been the worst player in the NBA. Over the course of 17 games, he’s averaged 3.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, and 1.2 ast while shooting 25% from the field and 18% from three. In addition, he hasn’t attempted a single free throw. Furthermore, he has been underwhelming so far in the G League, with averages of 5.3 ppg, 6.3 rpg, and 3.8 apg on 22% from the field and 29% from three. On the other hand, the Thunder understood that he was a project player and are giving him plenty of time to develop. He should improve as he physically matures and assimilates to NBA style basketball."
Aleksej Pokusevski was turning 3 years old

I don't really know this guy but here is a complete list of where his name has popped up for me:  * He had the worst on/off in the entire league at some particular moment when I was browsing stats * Saw an article on Why the Thunder is sending Aleksej Pokusevski to the G League bubble * Somebody called him a baby giraffe * Somebody wondered if he has any blood  And now he's balling out and this pleases me greatly.

"You're resting guys like Lu Dort, Ty Jerome and Aleksej Pokusevski when you're already a bottom feeding team? That's literally throwing a game, I can't imagine anyone would condone that"
They had to rest their 2 GOATs tonight Aleksej Pokusevski and Ty Jerome

"7. POKU!!!!!!!  What a wild ride. I have no idea what position [Aleksej Pokusevski](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683018/aleksej-pokusevski) plays, what he will amount to, how he does not snap in half at some point every game, and whether he's even supposed to be helping the Thunder right now. Pokusevski missed his first 14 NBA shots. Some of his jumpers whistle on such a line-drive trajectory, you fear they might smash the backboard. Pokusevski is so tall and lanky, he sometimes appears to be shooting down at the basket.  Any Pokusevski touch could end in some kind of strange basketball brilliance you've never quite seen before, or a pratfall-level disaster -- Pokusevski tripping over his own unruly limbs; a pass that soars 10 rows into the stands; a jumper so wayward everyone under the basket ducks as if an anvil is about to fall on their heads.  Like, what precisely is going on here? That's top-of-the-arc isolation that morphs into an up-and-under. You've seen that move before, but have you ever seen that? The loping footwork flummoxes [Chris Boucher](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3948153/chris-boucher). It's unclear if Pokusevski is shooting or trying to pass off the backboard to himself.  He's shooting 33% overall, and 27% from deep. Those numbers are up in April -- 37% overall, an encouraging 35% on 3s -- but they could only go up. Still, you can see why several teams were enamored with him. The Thunder traded up to get Pokusevski because they knew they could lose out on him otherwise. Pokusevski is 7-foot, and two skills stood out even through those early struggles: passing and shot-blocking. Both evince some undercurrent of advanced feel. Pokusevski is a connector -- someone who can receive the ball in the middle of a possession, assignments and rotations in flux, and problem-solve on the fly with some panache. Pokusevski scoots past the defender rushing at him, maps the floor, and manipulates the defense with a lookaway.  He's swatting 1.7 shots per 36 minutes, 30th among rotation players. He is willing to throw his body in the way around the basket, and his arms are a problem."

"increases or stays the same. Players that are tall are learning to handle the ball at point guard levels now. Ben Simmons is an anomaly now but players are going to learn to dribble better and faster at earlier ages. Aleksej Pokusevski, Bol Bol, and Kristaps Porzingis are all 7 foot shooting guards. Cade Cunningham is a 6’8 point guard. Not saying that they are that good but there is a trend."

"Rodney Hood, Sekou Doumbouya, Chasson Randle, and Aleksej Pokusevski all ranked worse in BPM in more minutes and about a fifth of the league ranked worse than him in RPM (without considering minutes cutoffs etc).   I'm biased because I love the guy but that's not the worst player in the league. He was bad (as a lot of rookies are, even those who go #2 overall) but will definitely improve"
"If you paid attention during the first half of the season, we did—and we were doing quite well.  Then SGA got injured (plantar fasciitis—an injury that requires rest and actively gets worse if you put more workload on it) and we went all-in from there.  What were we supposed to do: risk SGA’s health to push for the play-in game during a season where the home stadium was empty? Try to stay competitive during the last third of the season and see how many wins a big three of Al Horford, Lu Dort, and fresh-from-the-G-League rookie Aleksej Pokusevski can get?"
I’ve watched enough Aleksej Pokusevski highlights where I think I am finally prepared to watch something else.
Aleksej Pokusevski about to skyrocket and its not even close
"Due to the shortened offseason, teams can trade recently-acquired players just 19 days after acquiring them.   **I am aware that the following would never happen. I just got a kick out of thinking about it and wanted to share.**  Imagine if Brad Stevens decides to blow it up and does this in a few weeks:   Thunder get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Jayson Tatum  Celtics get:   * Kemba Walker  * Luguentz Dort  * Theo Maledon  * Aleksej Pokusevski  * 13 1sts (the max OKC can send at this point)   Celtics basically inherit the OKC rebuild, minus Shai. Meanwhile OKC now goes forward with Shai/Brown/Tatum/Bazley/Bradley. I'm sure they could improve with free agent signings or other trades, too."
Aleksej Pokusevski. At least 3 games of 20+ points. He’s a flawless player. Biggest snub of all time
"Russell Westbrook is the best passer of the 21st century. Ahead of Paul, Kidd, Nash and really anyone who’s played since 2000 really.  Also Aleksej Pokusevski will be the best player in his draft class.  Refs don’t call less fouls in the playoffs"
I Can’t Pronounce it Either: The Aleksej Pokusevski Story
Aleksej Pokusevski (POKU)
"Lauri Markkanen, Aaron Nesmith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Jordan Poole, Chuma Okeke, Robert Williams, Tyrese Maxey."
"Aleksej Pokusevski. 17th pick last year coming from a Greek league. He was the youngest player in the NBA and is still the 6th youngest. 7""1.5 with guard-like playmaking and a beautiful shooting stroke. He's still super skinny but he has shown flashes of greatness and broke so many thunder records like most threes in a game for a rookie (7)."
"Aleksej Pokusevski. 7 footer with guard skills. Extremely young, moldable, can shoot from the outside, great court vision for his size, must improve defensively but genuinely could see him being a starter for a very good team in a couple of years. Has to gain some weight to be competitive though, being 7 foot but 190 pounds won’t cut it for too long in the league."
Aleksej pokusevski I don’t care what anyone says his raw skill set at that height and age is absolutely off the charts. I truly believe that okc’s developmental program will turn him into something the league hasn’t really seen yet.
These are his last 15 picks before this draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis Semaj Christon

"Idk... I trust my man freddysbbiq, whats your outlook for my guy Aleksej Pokusevski?"
Aleksej Pokusevski. It's so interesting to see a human body that both looks and moves like that. It's unnerving in such an entertaining way. Like a super artistic horror movie.
"Perfect, just need to tank for one more season to get Chet:   Josh Giddey  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Lu Dort   Aleksej Pokusevski  Chet Holmgren"
"Why even try then? Pelicans pick 17th in the 1st round this year. The last 4 guys picked 17th are:  Aleksej Pokusevski, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Donte DiVincenzo, D.J. Wilson  Most of those guys are worthless, and none of them move the needle much. So let's sell the 17th pick for no assets in return, too."
"The Denver Nuggets are one healthy season away from winning a championship. They're not exactly up and coming so people forget that they're still very young: Jokic is 26, Jamal is 24, MPJ is 23, Aaron Gordon is 25, and Monte Morris is 26. If everything falls into place, they have the potential to be a dynasty.  In the brightest timeline, MPJ becomes Tracy McGrady, Jamal proves that he's the real Maple Jordan, Aaron Gordon turns into Warriors Iggy,  Jokic is Jokic, and they go on to win three championships in four years.  The brightestest timeline also involves RJ Hampton coming back home when he's an all-star, future league MVP Aleksej Pokusevski choosing the hardest road and joining the Nuggets dynasty because he can't win with those cats, Tim Connelly drafting another generational superstar in the 2nd round (i.e. Kai Sotto), Jokic playing well into his 40s without any decline in his play, and Bol Bol finally taking the leap to become a serviceable NBA player.  Or everything goes to shit because nothing good ever happens. Either way you'll still have fun because every single Nuggets player is hard not to root for."
"Aleksej Pokusevski is a 7ft 190lb guard essentially. Got off to a terrible start but went to the G league and was much more comfortable and efficient when he returned. He doesn't lack confidence, shows flashes of potential all over offensively. His defense was actually nice to see, he makes effort hustle plays back on defense and deflects passes with his crazy long wing span. Not the quickest laterally but has the length on his recoveries and displayed a lot of disruption when he got beat. He's going to be damn good if he keeps improving like he did after the G league bubble."
"I think after Harden's bullshit last year a lot of fans are over the ""it's a player's league"" nonsense. It's a great attitude to have to ensure players don't get exploited (maybe we should take that attitude to the NCAA instead?) but when players like Ben Simmons who are repeatedly overhyped (thanks Philly fans!) and repeatedly fail to not only meet expectations, but any semblance of starter-level play start demanding trades and acting like divas the other players and the fans are being dealt a sincere disservice.  There's a reason why Aleksej Pokusevski isn't allowed to demand trades and act like this. Why should Ben Simmons be able to? They're equally valuable players."
"It's Aleksej Pokuševski (or Pokusevski in English latinic). He's Serbian, not a Russian Aleksei."
Aleksej Pokusevski
Bold you say?  1. SGA will be a top 10 player in the league in the next 3 years. 2. Aleksej Pokusevski will be a superstar.
* Dante Exum * Nik Stauskas * Solomon Hill * Aleksej Pokusevski * Alex Len

"goddamn it, i'm so tired of these shit articles that only ever look at stats without any eye test and then proclaim conclusions as if basketball is played in a vacuum  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, however, are Thunder sophomores Aleksej Pokusevski and Théo Maledon, who according to multiple advanced metrics rated as the two worst players in the league last season.   if all it takes to figure out the value of a player is to look at his stats on paper, Westbrook is the greatest player of all time. If this dude who wrote this article actually watched a single OKC game last year, he'd know that Poku is a bonafide diamond in the rough, even though his stats were horrible. He's got both the size and the skill, and he's shown genuine flashes of brilliance in almost every game he's played.  How the hell is sad ass Orlando Magic rated higher than OKC when their top 3 best players were all over 25, and they traded Aaron Gordon for RJ Barret that wouldn't even break the top 5 in Oklahoma??

"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
What about Poku? (Aleksej Pokusevski)
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"
"The write up on OKC is weirdly just kinda shitting on Bazley and Poku lol   “Forward Darius Bazley has started every game this season, but the 21-year-old former first-round pick isn't making much of a case that he should be considered part of the Thunder's long-term core. Bazley is shooting only 37.1% from the floor and 28.1% from 3-point range, slight dips from last season's poor percentages. But 19-year-old former first-rounder Aleksej Pokusevski (34.9% from the floor, 20.5% on 3s) isn't exactly pushing for more playing time”"

"I mean Cam Payne (before his rookie contract was up) was traded for Taj Gibson, Doug mcbuckets and a 2nd round pick (I believe it became Mitchell Robinson). OKC then traded Kanter, Mcbuckets, and the 2nd pick for Carmelo Anthony. They then traded Anthony and a top 14 2022 protected pick for Dennis Schroeder. Dennis then got shipped to the Lakers for Danny Green, a first that became Jaden McDaniels I believe. OKC then packaged that pick to Minasota for pick 16 of the 2020 NBA draft to pick none other than Aleksej Pokusevski. So in the end I think the Thunder got their guy!  Also, at least Cameron Payne figured it out and is a role player in the NBA.  A D.  On your report carddoesn't bring your GPA down to a 1.0 if you have all A's."
