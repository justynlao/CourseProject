Joe Wieskamp
"Shooting specialists shouldnâ€™t go that high in the draft. Much like unskilled bigs, there is a huge cost (a lottery pick) for a role you can fill 75-90% of with a second round pick, mid level or minimum free agent or a UDFA. If you want to draft a shooting specialist, trade back to the late first/early second and draft Trey Murphy or Kessler Edwards plus these guys have more athletic/defensive upside. Or just pick up Joe Wieskamp or Johnny Juzang as an UDFA"
"Don't worry we just drafted our version (hopefully) of Duncan Robinson, Joe Wieskamp lol"
We have Duncan Robinson at home already in Joe Wieskamp.
and Joe Wieskamp. I think they did well.
Enjoy this interview taped with Joe Wieskamp two days ago. The Spurs got a gem. Hosts predicted after the interview he'd go to the Spurs and discussed why it's s good fit. You'll love him more after this interview! FF 5-6 mins in.  https://youtu.be/SmI-acYRXNw
"i don't hate the Primo pick since people wanted him to stay so he'd be a top ten pick next year. now Wieskamp too? I'm honestly not as mad as the other Spurs fan. i think Sengun can be Sabonis, sure, but clearly PATFO didn't feel that way and I'll roll with it. really into Joe in the second, he was who I wanted the whole time at least lol"
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
Star: Mobley   Bust: Sengun  Steal: Joe Wieskamp
Joe Wieskamp is somebody who everybody projects to go around 40. Think he can be better then Duncan Robinson
"Hey guys we just had an awesome interview with Joe Wieskamp on the eve of him getting drafted. interview starts at 5:45 and is also available on iTunes, Spotify etc. enjoy!  https://youtu.be/SmI-acYRXNw"
"In terms of guys who I'd trade up for or pray they fall in the draft, it'd be Jalen Johnson 100%. For someone who will definitely be available, I like Joe Wieskamp from Iowa; this seems like the kind of pick that might not age well, but he's got good size, speed, and was a 3-pt sniper in college. But he's not just a one-dimensional player either, he gets involved on both ends. I hate to curse it, but he's *almost* ^(Duncan Robinson-like.) Nuggets could use that skillset if he pans out, if not, no biggie, it's just the 26th pick."
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
