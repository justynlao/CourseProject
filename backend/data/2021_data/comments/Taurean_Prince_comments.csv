"Bickerstaff simplify the game for Sexton just get buckets and surround him with Jarrett Allen, Larry Nance Jr, Taurean Prince, and Issac Okoro play on ball &amp; help defense, set screens, and make extra passes."
"The Nets obtained James Harden and gave away Caris LeVert, Jarret Allen, Rodion Kurucs and Taurean Prince, their umprotected first round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, plus a first round pick swap (so if the pick of the other team is lower that that of the Nets they trade those picks) in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.  The Cavaliers obtained Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince and gave away Milwaukee's umprotected first round pick in 2022 and Dante Exum.  The Pacers obtained Caris LeVert and a 2nd round pick in 2023 from Houston and gave away Victor Oladipo.  The Rockets obtained Victor Oladipo, Rodion Kurucs, Dante Exum, the Nets 3 umprotected first round picks, Milwaukee's 1st round pick (via Cleveland), the Nets 4 1st round pick swaps and gave away James Harden and a 2023 2nd round pick."
"Rockets get: Victor Oladipo + A shitload of picks  Nets get: James Harden + some picks  Cleveland gets: Jarett Allen, Taurean Prince + some picks  Pacers get: Caris Levert + some picks"
"He's been awful these last couple of weeks.  Can't believe I'm saying this, but possibly even worse than Taurean Prince."
"Theyre actually really tight.  They embraced before the game and he was just doing friendly trash talk in a game that was already decided.  This clip starts too late but lebron playfully yells 'cedi miss it!'  And then goes 'YEA thats my guy thats my guy' and then continues trash talking with his bench and then tells taurean prince to stfu.  If anything, this would boost cedis confidence that lebron would personalize his trash talk enough to call him 'his guy' in front of everyone on the court.   This and their workout in LA with kawhi and KD might be the highlight of cedi's career tbh."
Bro taurean prince was looking like kd out there
"KD is going to have to be their defensive anchor, as the only one that can probably do it.  They don't have anyone else to stick on the other teams best player.  DJ seems capable of manning the post, for maybe 30 minutes a game?  Other than that I'm not sure.  Harris was getting destroyed, Kyrie is okay when he tries, Harden has limitations but can usually at least hang in down low but looks slow until he gets in shape.  They could really use a Taurean Prince type dude, and can maybe find a buyout version later?  Offensively they can probably just keep passing to each other and all big 3 take 20-25 shots a game, but they need some kind of scheme on D.  Maybe work on a zone?  Whatever is easy and can cover up some deficiencies.  If they get to average-ish defense they'll have a chance."
"Of course, the Nets gave prime Sexton Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince. Lakers are literally drawing dead against the Cavs"
TAUREAN PRINCE IS EVEN QUITE GOOD LOL
They could sure use a guy like Jarrett Allen or Taurean Prince
"You can actually (kinda) connect this trade as being a continuation of the Kyrie trade. It's not a perfect match but...  Kyrie was traded for IT, Jae Crowder, BKN's pick, etc.  Crowder + Shumpert + D-Rose (free agent pickup) were traded for George Hill &amp; Hood  George Hill was traded to Milwaukee for their first-round pick  Milwaukee's first-round pick was traded for Jarrett Allen &amp; Taurean Prince."
"And for the second game in a row, the combo of Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen substantially outscored James Harden.  Wait, Harden started at power forward what the fuck?"
"They need to trade one of their Big 3 for solid role player defender types.   Just watching tonight guys like Taurean Prince and Jarret Allen would be perfect fits over there, as an example"
"Taurean Prince had way less touches and wasn‚Äôt as involved as he was tonight. Last game he wasn‚Äôt as envolves and nobody was commenting about not including him on a trade. Oh, and every year some asks how is Jeff Green playing for the minimum, which feels like the same comment as ‚Äúwhy did they include Prince in the trade?‚Äù But both are usually answered pretty easily as the season progress."
Taurean Prince fits like a glove
We should trade Harden for some defensive pieces..is Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince available?
Nets fans probably HATE Taurean Prince lmao
Taurean Prince is a vengeful motherfucker.  I love it.
"Free taurean ""rebounds"" prince"
Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen are exactly the kind of players the Nets could really use right now.
"Can‚Äôt decide if that‚Äôs worse, or him calling Taurean Prince the wrong name for an entire game"
"Levert was redundant, he wasn't really good in the games Kyrie and KD both played. Guys like Bruce Brown, Shamet even TLC can replace those mins and while they are way worse players, the can fit better, and Levert shot creation isn't needed anymore (and really wasn't before the trade when everybody was there)  Taurean Prince is an absolutely terrible player  So really they lost Allen, and yeah that's a huge loss... but it's James Harden"
Wait is taurean prince the Baylor rebound guy
would‚Äôve been a good time for a taurean prince answer
Yes with great defensive players like Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen all things are possible
Yeah I was mad when we traded him but we weren‚Äôt going to get anything better for him and his contract was expiring. And we traded Exum for Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince so I guess it worked out ok.
Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince on the revenge tour
Fluke game. Taurean prince told the team the entire Nets playbook. Just watch they will lose to Minnesota or something.
Taurean Prince really gave it back.
"* James Harden: 6-14 shooting, 3-6 from 3, 21 points, 10 rebounds, no blocks, 2 steals, 5 turnovers, 5 fouls, -3 * Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince: 11-19 shooting, 3-5 from 3, 27 points, 18 rebounds, 5 blocks, 2 steals, 4 turnovers, 1 foul, +26  Welp, Nets clearly lost that trade."
Then just take out Joe Harris put Brown on Sexton and let Kyrie guard Taurean Prince or Osman
"it has to be, idk how you score this many points in a second OT. and then Taurean prince with the revenge 3 at the very end lmao"
Getting Jarrett Allen (and Taurean Prince) for Dante Exum and a Bucks 1st was absolute fucking robbery by the Cavs.
Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen getting payback already lol
i want taurean prince to sink it
every now and then i have to remind myself taurean prince isn't demarre carroll - both played for atlanta and brooklyn too
Prince Taurean &gt; King James  At least as far as Cleveland legends go
ah yes who could forget that epic duel between KD and Taurean Prince...
I can't believe that the Cavs managed to get rid of Exum and got the Fro and Taurean Prince back
2021 NBA MVP Taurean Prince
"Taurean Prince, the Nets killer?!"
Taurean Prince getting his revenge!
Lol taurean prince
Taurean Prince making Kevin Durant shots lmaooooo
Taurean prince revenge game
one of those occasions you have to remember where you were when you were watching the Taurean Prince revenge game.
Taurean prince revenge game
Taurean Prince revenge game
Nets fans    ü§ù   Cavs fans  ü§ù Hawks fans:  What is Taurean Prince doing????
can taurean prince do a single thing right today?
I had assumed Jarrett Allen was the cost for dumping Taurean Prince and his deal basically.
Taurean Prince is a 5 year NBA vet. KPJ has one year under his belt. Likely that's all there was to it.
Is that normal? Having a hierarchy based on your lockers seems terrible for team chemistry.  His reaction was definitely overblown but I understand being pissed about having my locker moved just because some other bench player joined the team.  If it's LeBron or a different superstar I would understand but Taurean Prince?
Montrezl/Demarre/Taurean Prince/Predator
"&gt; Porter, 20, who has not played this season due to personal issues, grew angry when he entered the locker room and realized the team gave his old locker to Taurean Prince, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade Wednesday.  He's gone. Unfortunately, nobody is worried about you."
"Taurean **Prince**, hence the royalty comment"
"&gt;Originally¬†reported by The Athletic this morning, Porter's locker was given to newcomer Taurean Prince and his new locker was near the lounge area with the reserves. The report indicates that Porter started shouting and at one point threw food (though the source told BasketballNews.com that this was relatively minor). However, the confrontation between Porter and general manager Koby Altman was very heated.    * Whoa, non-sensationalized news reports  &gt;The argument kept escalating and Porter was heard yelling about ""modern-day slavery."" Porter had grown frustrated recently because the team had been holding him out. He has yet to play in a game this season.  &gt;""He snapped on Koby, and Koby snapped back,"" the source told BasketballNews.com. ""Ultimately, I think Koby being unable to calm him was the last straw that broke the camel's back.""   * This is meme material lol"
"I mean, I would be kind of upset too if my locker was moved just because we got Taurean Prince. But you don't throw food at people."
"I'm not defending KPJ's behavior, but yes its a locker, so there's no reason why they should have moved him for fucking Taurean Prince (at least without telling him first)  It's like a weird, passive aggressive message."
"He felt disrespected from the CAVS, because he can dribble and put the ball in the bucket better than Taurean Prince in Kevin Porter Jr mind. Looks like he can't handle this situation as a mature adult, and he is finding out he is not that valuable to the CAVS."
"""Porter, 20, who has not played this season due to personal issues, grew angry when he entered the locker room and realized the team gave his old locker to Taurean Prince, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade Wednesday.""  I'm not saying Porter Jr.'s reaction was warranted, but moving his locker without telling him is really poor management. Him being angry is warranted."
"""Porter, 20, who has not played this season due to personal issues, grew angry when he entered the locker room and realized the team gave his old locker to Taurean Prince, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade Wednesday.""  His reaction was over kill, but that's really poor management on behalf of the Cavs to just move his locker without talking to him. For those of you that worked in an office, how would you feel if you just came in one day an your boss had moved your cubicle to a new floor and didn't say anything?"
"I challenge, Prince Taurean, for the right to hold, this locker!  Don't worry, he wasn't going to kill him, but he was going to throw some food."
not to defend him here because that's obviously insane but why did they move his locker? for taurean prince of all people? like I get doing it for durant or kawhi or something
"Here yall go:  &gt;CLEVELAND ‚Äî Cavaliers guard Kevin Porter Jr. is expected to be traded or released following an outburst Friday in the Cavs locker room, The Athletic has learned from several sources with direct knowledge of the events.  &gt;Porter, 20, who has not played this season due to personal issues, grew angry when he entered the locker room and realized the team gave his old locker to Taurean Prince, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade Wednesday.  &gt;Sources said Porter, whose locker was moved to the wall where the younger, end-of-bench players reside, began yelling and at one point threw food.  &gt;Sources said general manager Koby Altman came into the locker room and confronted Porter, and the player remained combative with his boss. The Cavs spent the weekend trying to trade him.  &gt;Coach J.B. Bickerstaff heard the commotion in the locker room from his office and came in, shocked and disgusted by what he heard.  &gt;Porter was involved in a one-car accident in November. He was arrested and charged with improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, failure to control the vehicle and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. All of those charges were dismissed. He was considered to be the most promising of Cleveland‚Äôs young players after last season. The Cavs were helping him get his life together before putting him back on the court.  &gt;Porter averaged 10 points and 3.2 rebounds as a rookie last year in 23.2 minutes per game. He shot 44.2 percent from the field and 33.5 percent from 3."
"We‚Äôll take him on if you attach Jarrett Allen and ~~Taurean Prince.~~ Actually, just Jarrett Allen."
According to the article he basically got super pissed and starting yelling and throwing food when he found out they gave his old locker to Taurean Prince and he had to move to a new locker.
"You really think that this sub believes that perennial MVP candidate James Harden, who's led the NBA in 3 pointers for three consecutive seasons, is a league average shooter?  Like, if you posted ""Who's a better shooter- James Harden or Taurean Prince"", do you really think the responses will be split 50/50?"
"No one is guarding Embiid, Giannis or AD.  Jarrett Allen wasn't.  Taurean Prince wasn't.  Jeff Green at the 5 gives the Nets the most switchable lineup.  There is going to mismatch no matter what, but determinations have to be made.  I'm sure the Nets would rather have AD than Harden or Kyrie but they can't get him.    BTW I like Bam, but offensively he is not in the same conversation as the other three."
Taurean Prince isn't on the Nets anymore
I‚Äôm not sure who KD guards. Harden is a good defender as well though. I think Taurean Prince or Jeff Green would get assigned to AD or Lebron.
Jarret Allen didn't just fetch Mil's first round pick in 2022. It was Jarret and Taurean Prince for Exum and the pick. Taurean is a bad contract and still has two years remaining; it would have probably taken a late first round pick just to dump his contract.   The trade gives Rockets salary flexibility for summer. They can use the cap space to sign a promising young player in the offseason (similar to Christian Wood). Talen Horton-Tucker could be a good target.
Cleveland Cavalier Taurean Prince?
"Fuck it I‚Äôll throw them Coby, Otto, Wendell and picks for Kyrie and Taurean Prince"
Did the Spurs reporter just say Tayshaun Prince is going to Cleveland instead of Taurean Prince? Lol
Nets basically gave up Jarrett Allen.  Harden replaces Levert. Kurucs was a benchwarmer. Taurean Prince is absolute garbage.   Allen is a huge loss and I'm sad to see him go. But we didn't destroy our depth.
What does finalized mean though?  Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen were at last night's game on the Cavaliers bench in Cavaliers warm-ups.   James Harden already had his introductory press conference and the Nets are using him in marketing material.   How would any of that be legal if the trade was not approved by the league office?
"Whole bench? lol I love LeVert, but Harden is a huge upgrade. Taurean Prince was super inconsistent and Rodi was basically our 15th man. JA is the only real loss (it‚Äôs a big loss). But they‚Äôve got 3 open roster spots to fill and the MLE &amp; DPE and the buyout market to use to try and fix their defensive issues. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be able to attract some serviceable vets to fill out the bench."
Taurean Prince is now on Reddit
"dude I totally feel that, my favorite dudes in the league are jakarr sampson, bobby portis, and taurean prince. I think rooting for the guy who no one expects to be great is a lot of fun. moments like rodney hood coming in for portland in 4ot to save the game vs the nuggets are the moments I live to watch as a fan"
"Getting Jarrett Allen for a (most likely) late first round pick that wasn't even their own is really good.   They did have to take on Taurean Prince, but he only has one year left on his contract. He's overpaid but it's not anything crazy."
"I've seen a lot of people either misunderstanding what we gave up or blatantly over-exaggerating it.  I've seen people say we gave up 8 first round picks. No, we didn't. Hell we didn't even give up 4 picks. We gave up 3. The other first round pick is coming from Cleveland. We also gave 4 swaps, which aren't the same thing as picks. For some reason a lot of people have trouble understanding this. We still have picks in the years of those swaps, we simply have the worst pick out of ours and Houston's  In total it was: 3 first round picks, 4 swaps, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, and Rodions Kurucs for James Harden and a second round pick. In no conceivable way did we get fleeced"
"You forgot about the FRP coming from the Cavs (that they got from the Bucks) and the 4 pick swaps. All unprotected.  The starter they gave up, Jarrett Allen, was pretty important for them considering how atrocious their defense is. I'm assuming LeVert is the 6th man. They also gave up Kurucs and Taurean Prince."
"Rows of tall, bushy-topped trees flank the procession, among them a prized chestnut Ok. There is a turkey running around, frightening the children. An enormous Drum plays consistently in double-double time.   The king and queen of SexLand, Darius and Collin stride down the central promenade at a brisk pace. A Porter and a well-regarded Yogi smile and nod in approval to the side. They are not involved today but wanted to be in attendance. Behind the royal couple walks the handsome Prince, Taurean, and the lovely princess Nance, named after her mother.  It's a happy day for the royal family, but from the shadows watches the princess's disgraced Ex, um ... Dante was his name. He was the old candlestick Maker. If only he could break the ankles of her new beau, the Bold Son of the king's adviser from a land down under. He plots his revenge for six or seven weeks from now, or not at all.  Love is rarely ever in the air, but today, one might say it is."
Taurean Prince is meh because of his contract.
"DeMarre Carroll (the Nets version of him, not even the peak Hawks version) is way better than Taurean Prince lol  Find it weird how it seems non-Nets fans think that Prince is pretty good or at least respectable. He's just bad though. Idk where the misconception comes from."
"Did we really?  If we took on Prince and Allen, we wouldnt be able to pay Allen, wothout going into the tax for a non contending team  We basically paid an Expiring Allen and dumping Taurean Prince for a late FRP  All in all not terrible if we couldnt pay him either way, and hes going to get a bag, have u looked at next years FA?  The Oladipo deal is a question mark, my guess is we want to compete this year and still be able to tank the next"
They sent the 17th pick and Allen Crabbe to Atlanta for Taurean Prince + 2nd. Then Griffin declined Atlanta's 10th pick for various other things including 17.
Cavs somehow turned Dante Exum into Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince. Gotta give it to them.
Also Taurean Prince!
"We‚Äôre getting more dudes with big boy appetites, he may have to bring extra  I‚Äôm so hyped for this though, from a basketball standpoint. In a vacuum we gave up Dante Exum, a bench player who never stuck and that we didn‚Äôt need, and a first round pick for *Jarrett Allen* and Taurean Prince. It‚Äôll be a lot of sharing the paint, but good luck getting to the rim on us"
"Not really , Allen essentially offers the same rebounding skills with better rim protection and comes at a lower price tag . Drummond is a free agent after this year and will want a max deal. Cleveland won‚Äôt give him that (Drummond does not fit with what the NBA has turned into - it‚Äôs a shooters league).   Cavs just turned Dante Exum into Allen ( one of the best young centers in the league) and Taurean Prince who‚Äôs a decent bench player. They can move Drummond now for draft capital or other young pieces to go along side the core group of Sexton, Garland, Allen , and Porter Jr. (if he ever comes back).   This was a great move by Cleveland"
"""The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four-pick swaps, all unprotected. Those picks will come from Brooklyn in 2022, 2024 and 2026 along with Milwaukee in 2022 (previously owned by Cleveland), and the swaps will come from Brooklyn in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027. They will also receive¬†Rodions Kurucs¬†and¬†Dante Exum.

"Trade him for Jarrett Allen, Rodion Kurucs, Caris Levert, and Taurean Prince. Get a haul of picks, reinvigorate the defense with some youth."
"The Nets sent Houston a package that includes multiple players and draft picks and features guard Caris LeVert, who was then traded to the Pacers for Victor Oladipo, sources tell ESPN.  Center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince are headed from the Nets to the Cavs in the deal, according to sources, while the Rockets receive Cleveland guard Dante Exum and Brooklyn forward Rodions Kurucs  Houston also receives Brooklyn's three unprotected first-round draft picks -- 2022, 2024 and 2026 -- in the deal, plus pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, according to sources. The Rockets also get Cleveland's 2022 first-round pick, via the Milwaukee Bucks.  Wow"
"Hahaha wtf, going to the Cavs is having your life ruined???  Fuck you too!!  The Cavs would be a good team to play for in my opinion.  There‚Äôs no clear #1 star so Allen, Sexton, Garland, Nance can all figure this out together.  All of these players have shown clear development recently, they‚Äôre on the right trajectory.  Taurean Prince gets a chance for more shots.  It‚Äôs really not bad."
So the Cavs really gave up the perpetually injured Dante Exum and a late first for Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince? Completely fleeced em
"I'm not sure if this is complete, but from what I gather:  To Brooklyn:  * James Harden (obviously)  To Houston:  * Dante Exum * Victor Oladipo * Rodions Kurucs for some reason * Two 2022 firsts, a 2024 first and a 2026 first  To Cleveland:  * Jarrett Allen * Taurean Prince  To Indy:  * Caris LeVert"
"Via @ShamsCharania on Twitter  ""Sources: Full current trade:  Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)   Nets: James Harden  Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder  Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"""
aw man just when I was starting to dig the vibe in Brooklyn. now they DON'T have Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince and they HAVE Harden. oh well. Going back to my Wiz kidz.
Hey at least you gave Taurean Prince his locker to teach him a lesson. I'm sure he'll never forget.
They really got Jarrett Allen and Taurean prince for Dante Exum. Unbelievable
"So the Cavs took on Taurean Prince‚Äôs deal which expires next year, thats why they got Allen and sent the Rockets a pick.  Thing is Prince is really not a bad contract.  Its another year around 13M.  They could had dealt one of their picks for someone to take on his deal if they didnt want it.  So IMO they essentially opted for 4 picks, 4 swaps and Olapido   vs 2 picks, Jarrett Allen, 4 swaps and Olapido   or vs 3 picks, Allen, 4 swaps, Olapido and paying Prince for 1.5 seasons."
"The Cavs picked up Allen and Taurean Prince for the corpse of Dante Exum and Milwaukee‚Äôs 2022 1st. Neither of those are assets I‚Äôd lose any sleep over wasting. Obviously I hope we keep Allen around, he‚Äôs a great young player, but I think he‚Äôs limited enough as a player that he‚Äôs not gonna get the max.   He‚Äôs a good defender, rebounder, and rim protector, but he‚Äôs skinny enough to get bullied by larger 5‚Äôs and not quite quick enough on the perimeter to be comfortable switching. Offensively he can catch lobs and sometimes hit an open midrange jumper, but he‚Äôs extremely limited on that end. If he can add some muscle and mass for screens and the low block, he could have a broke man‚Äôs Gobert kind of impact, but he‚Äôs not nearly there yet."
"That‚Äôs pretty much all of them. Most stretch four/fives are on contenders who likely wouldn‚Äôt give them up. Taurean Prince and Harrison Barnes are two other ones, but both have large contracts and I doubt the Kings want to move Barnes."
Them Nene and Taurean Prince are the same dude.
I've messed with Clarkson since before college. Then again I'm from San Antonio so him and Taurean Prince were on everyone's radar around there.
I think he‚Äôs joking. He‚Äôs probably making a joke that Singler looks like Taurean Prince
"Thank you, Taurean Prince"
the Cavs are gonna sweep the shit out of us on the way to the finals and Taurean Prince is gonna be crowned FMVP to spite us
Taurean Prince explains it best   https://youtu.be/atr60tR7Emo
Fucking Taurean Prince
"Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and Taurean Prince who were all contributing on Defense to various degrees along with Rodions Kurucs who was relegated to the Bench.   They received James Harden who isn‚Äôt known for his Defensive skills and only recently filled up 3 Empty Roster Spots a month after the trade.    Nets essentially lost their entire 2nd Unit between the trade and Dinwiddie‚Äôs injury. Not to mention Sean Marks shitting the bed on the Bey for Shamet trade. Of course their Defense was going to be bad.   How many great high quality Free Agents are available to sign mid season? Nets can only do so much and so far Sean Marks hasn‚Äôt proven himself to be on the level of Morey when it comes to in season roster building.   Sean Marks gets a ton of his shine from hitting on LeVert and Allen back to back in the draft along with finding Dinwiddie and Harris in the trash bin. He‚Äôs been very limited in his drafting skills since 2016-17."
"The King vs the Prince, and I ain't talking Taurean"
he threw food at Taurean Prince after getting his locker replaced. what‚Äôs wrong with what I said?
"He wasn't that bad last season, and of course he had a good bubble run, so Nets fans thought he'd be at least okay (and better than Taurean Prince, who was the old punching bag).   But he's way worse now."
Taurean Prince in shambles
"You don‚Äôt think a team of Durant, Kyrie, Dinwiddie, Harris, Allen, DeAndre Jordan, LeVert, Jeff Green and Taurean Prince would have been competitive with the Lakers?"
"Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince, and Kenneth Faried"
Taurean Prince with the game high +30 for Cleveland
"Last time the Cavs beat us in Miami - Obama was still in his 1st tenure. (Jan. 25th, 2010)  Good win. 'Dipo's inefficiencies are still present but I'm digging the way Ariza has played the last two games + Bjelly contributing. Lowkey really, *really* would love Taurean Prince to become a Miami Heat at some point in the future. Love the idea of him as a role player on a playoff contender since his Atlanta days."
And then Cleveland turns around and somehow turns Exum into Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince lol
Demarre Carroll Jae Crowder and Taurean Prince are all the same player
You really need to include the picture? People know who Taurean Prince is lol
he lost some weight and now goes as [Taurean Prince](https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/1040x760/1627752.png)
"couldn't he have just received Caris LaVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen.  Jarrett Allen is a franchise cornerstone center for a team to build around. Between him and Caris those two could've easily netted them a SGA type player or a whole bunch of picks. Jarrett Allen is going to be so valuable as a RFA, so many teams will throw him money. The entire deal with Cleveland and Indiana to land Oladipo was so stupid, did Tillman really think that Oladipo was going to have value as a star coming off an injury? I guess he loves picking up injured former stars considering he has John Wall (which is now looking like an absolute savior for DC that we got rid of him)"
To think Rockets got laughed at for trading Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cavs. Rockets got KPJ and a 1st rounder for them.
KPJ is such a steal man. Rockets basically got him and a 1st rounder for Allen and Taurean Prince.
"Considering we're talking about Cleveland Cavs drama, you definitely mean Taurean Prince, right?   *The player Formerly Known as Prince of Atlanta and then Prince of Brooklyn.*"
They chose Taurean fucking Prince over a 20 year old with star potential. Cavs gonna Cav
They moved his locker over a spot for Taurean Prince who legit just joined the team and he apparently threw food around the locker room after. I‚Äôm highly doubtful it‚Äôs actually about the locker and not about more of an amalgamation of situations however.
this is what happens when you give  your best players locker to Taurean Prince
Imagine having this talent then botching it by giving his locker to Taurean Prince lmao üöÄ
Can't believe bum ass Cavs chose Taurean fucking Prince over this stud. We all knew this guy had all star potential just from watching him play. Cavs are so dumb god damn
Cleveland shipped him off during the Harden trade and somehow got Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince out of it
We trade JC for Taurean Prince (who we traded last season for the corpse of allen crabbe) the 25th pick and a low second rounder and we somehow also have to give up Kris Dunn? Absolutely not. I'd rather let him walk than make sure a terrible trade.
"I understand that if they trade him they‚Äôre not gonna get the same value as Collins, but Taurean Prince, a late first and a second is laughable."
Lol hawks FO aren't dropping off John Collins for Taurean prince and a shitty pick. They aren't gonna get finessed so badly.
"Absolutely awful trade for Atlanta. A pick in the late 20s, the corpse of Taurean Prince (48%TS) and a late 2nd?"
They didn‚Äôt do it to piss him off. Taurean prince (a guy who was actually playing) needed a locker and Covid protocols limited availability. Learn some details before  blind stumping for some kid who was 100% in the wrong
I get DeMarre Carroll confused with Taurean Prince
"No, didn‚Äôt you hear? We held the rockets at gunpoint and forced them to give us Harden. We clubbed the Pistons knees until they bought out blake. We gave Taurean Prince blankets with small pox to pass out amongst the Cavs because they haven‚Äôt handed us Drummond yet. We‚Äôre the worst"
"Taurean prince going from pretty good to falling off a cliff, fucking Jalen Adams, JEREMY LIN (lest we forget), the living meme deyonta Davis. Allen Crabbe existed for a moment in time and we were actually excited to get him too lmao, who else? Fucking Damian Jones who is maybe the worst player I‚Äôve ever seen in the nba, Tyrone Wallace, CHARLIE BROWN JR.   YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN LADS"
"Let's not forget the Nets trade away Caris Levert, Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince for Harden, then Kyrie switch to the SG role while Harden switch to PG role.  This all happen when Dinwiddie, the only good PG they have left was injured.  After that trade, Nets sign Andre Roberson (defensive SG), Iman Shumpert (another SG), Alize Johnson (wing player) Blake and Lamarcus (big men). None of them are PG. Until the Harden injury which the Nets sign Mike James as a stopgap measure until Harden return.   So yes, it was clear that Nets intend for Harden to be the playmaker."
"His contract is 3 years $40 million. Players who make around that: taurean prince, patty mills, Cody zeller, Davis Bertans, Rudy gay, justice Winslow, dion waiters. Kuzma has been big for us all year if you watch the games. And what are you on about we kept him over lonzo? There was no way we kept lonzo or BI in that deal."
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
Don't forget Taurean Prince
"&gt; TLC is terrible but at least he knows his role  Agree with you on James but completely disagree with this. TLC does not know his role at all, or at least forgets what it is too often. There's a ton of times where he's jacked up threes when he's had no business to. He's basically become an even worse version of Taurean Prince at this point."
I wonder how much Taurean Prince likes his locker.
I wonder what the CAVS front office are thinking right now? Basically choosing Taurean Prince over him.
"Seriously, fuck my team.  Let's make sure benchwarmer Taurean Prince is more respected than the 2nd best player on our team at the time.  Cavs are dumb.  I don't care what he did, you don't give someone away like that for free.  I hope our front office and coaching staff feel really stupid right now"
"During the off-season he had legal troubles involving illegal possession of a weapon, during the season he got his locker switched with Taurean Prince, had a fit and threw food at a staff member."
It was scrub ass Taurean Prince.
"Lmao bro, some of your fans are willing to die on a hill that he was a locker room cancer for throwing a tantrum because they moved his locker for scrub ass Taurean Prince. Who the fuck wouldn't throw a tantrum if their locker got moved for his scrub ass?   Then they want to bring up the gun shit like it has anything to do with him playing basketball. For fucks sake, it's not like he pulled an Arenas."
Didn't the Cavs basically give Taurean Prince KPJ's locker without notice which lead to the entire blowup?
Had to move all his stuff to make room for Taurean Prince
Cavs legend taurean prince deserves that respect bro
Had to move all his stuff in the locker room for Taurean Prince
This is why midsize contracts are important. I think most nets fans were confused when marks signed taurean prince to that deal when we did but it‚Äôs clear that he was being used as a salary filler for a potential trade whether it was a smaller salary like lavine or for a big star like harden
"Those two points are all that's needed to know the other user is being beyond disingenuous in trying to defend the cops at all costs.  This is on top of the fact this~  &gt; KPJ called the cavs black/jewish gm a ""modern day slave-master"" bc his locker was moved to make room for Taurean Prince  Never actually happened and this user keeps spewing this BS all over the thread and when questioned give a source that does not back that up"
"&gt; KPJ was kicked off his College team and first Pro team bc of his attitude/mental issues  &gt; KPJ called the cavs black/jewish gm a ""modern day slave-master"" bc his locker was moved to make room for Taurean Prince  These two things have literally nothing to do with this situation though. You don't think the public deserves transparency because KPJ said some questionable things months before this, thousands of miles away from the incident? I honestly have no idea why you're bringing this up (though I'm starting to get an idea since you're shitting on KPJ all over this thread)."
These Taurean Prince jokes aged horrendously.
People in here making Taurean Prince jokes but this article has some dope stories
This gave me Taurean Prince what is a rebound vibes lol
Taurean Prince level analysis
"we traded taurean prince to cleveland in the harden trade, who took porters locker...."
"Exactly. The Rockets fleeced themselves out of a good trade. Like, how the hell did the Cavs even enter that trade?I'm pretty sure if they didn't make it a 4 team trade, the Nets would have given up a Allen, LeVert, picks, and Taurean Prince deal to get Harden. Instead, this happened."
"Did the Heat have that many picks and pick swaps to trade? Seems like that's what the Rockets wanted... do the Nets even any picks left in the next like 6 years?  By the way everything went down, it seemed like the Rockets were clearly more interested in sending Harden to the Nets, and didn't really want back players. They rerouted Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to Cleveland, Caris LeVert to Indiana, and eventually traded Oladipo to Miami. The only player they actually kept was Kurucs, and he plays like shit. If you look at all that, I don't think they were all that serious about negotiating with parties other than the Nets, unless they were gonna fleece them."
&gt; Taurean Prince  You're telling me this isn't a World of Warcraft character?
"Because nobody cares about the Cavs without LeBron. You probably haven't seen much Collin Sexton (who averages an efficient 24 ppg including 30 pts tonight), Darius Garland (who just recently had 37 pts and 7 ast), Taurean Prince (had an efficient 25 pts against Charlotte last night), and others either"

"There is no indication that the GM preferred Philly's offer over what we got from Brooklyn. Simmons (who wouldn't re-sign in Houston) and a couple protected swaps vs 7 or 8 unprotected pics, caris levert, jarrett allen and taurean prince. Pretty easy call in my opinion"
The best is still the Taurean Prince trade netting us the pick to trade up for Hunter and the pick we traded for Capela
Should have kept Taurean Prince and traded Harris if he's going to play like this.
"Not having taurean prince helps you win. Levert missed more games than Harden. You‚Äôre basically saying Jarrett Allen makes up for the loss of Harden. Claxton and Allen provide many of the same things and personally I prefer Claxton because he is better switching onto perimeter players, but he never cracks the rotation if JA stays. Plus the Nets were not the clear favorites then, so good chance they don‚Äôt get Blake either. I would prefer Blake Claxton and harden to Allen Levert and prince lol"
Taurean Prince explaining what a rebound is will always be a classic
If Brown gets all those Taurean Prince minutes at the start of the year do they still trade for Harden?
I think you mean Taurean Prince
"Well when you‚Äôre the GM you take on the the risk and reward when you sign a player. I don‚Äôt think the problem is Ainge being complacent or looking at offers to move him. I think that Ainge failed to communicate with either Kemba or his agent that a trade was a possibility and that he would actively look at offers. When Sean Marks traded Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince he made it clear to each of those guys that a trade was possible so they wouldn‚Äôt be blindsided when they saw their names in rumors or when ultimately they had to move their entire lives and families to another city. Ainge isn‚Äôt a bad person for that."
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It‚Äôs not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
"Caris Levert,Jarrett Allen,Taurean Prince,Rodion Kurucs 3 unprotected first round picks and 4 draft swaps"
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll leave. I was curious where he *could* go though, cause I hate the Lakers (not a LeBron fan either tbh) and it‚Äôd be funny.  -	Mav‚Äôs would be the best option, they‚Äôve got cap space, a good coach, shooters, and a young star. He runs the risk of being called a snake since the Mav‚Äôs beat his old Miami team.  -	Miami has cap space too, and he could frame it as a ‚Äúreturning to his roots‚Äù kinda situation. I‚Äôm not sure how much better their roster is than the Lakers though.  -	Knicks have max cap space and need a playmaker. NY would also be good for his advertisement and investment potential -	Portland might be the best option legacy wise. They‚Äôve never won a title and even non Blazer fans want Dame to win one. Dame would also be the perfect compliment to current LeBron.  -	The Cavs wouldn‚Äôt be the worst option in the world. They‚Äôve got a bad record, so it wouldn‚Äôt look like he was just aiming for a ‚Äúhardest road‚Äù situation. Despite this, the team is reasonably built to be a good fit for LeBron. SexLand can definitely make shots at the very least, and Larry Nance Jr and Jarrett Allen are good defenders. They‚Äôd need to dump salary though either by packaging Love with good draft picks or trading a combination of Taurean Prince, Larry Nance Jr, and Cedi Osman.  -	The Pelicans would be a hilarious option, and might be my favorite option. They‚Äôve got two young start already in Zion and Ingram, and could potential keep Lonzo too. They‚Äôve also got a ton of picks to facilitate trades and clear cap with.  -	The Raptors would be an out of left field option. LeBron may view it as a good way to boost his international brand.   How I‚Äôd rank them:  1.	Of all these options, the Mav‚Äôs seem like the clear cut winner. They‚Äôd probably need to find a way to dump Porzingis though, so that they can re-sign Hardaway Jr and have room for LeBron, but that seems do-able.  2.	The biggest knock on Portland is I don‚Äôt know enough about their Cap Space situation to know if they could manage to sign him. I‚Äôd imagine that it wouldn‚Äôt cost a ton to find a way to offload CJ‚Äôs cap space though. Dame would be the best possible fit next to old LeBron of almost anyone in the league though. It‚Äôd also look the best for his legacy since the Blazers have never won and Dame is universally liked. The other big negative is their porous defense.   3.	The Knicks wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a good fit if he wants a guaranteed ring. However, it would look decent for his legacy. The team would be decent around LeBron if they could re-sign Rose too. Rose, Barrett, LeBron, Randle, Robinson is a decent lineup especial when you figure they‚Äôve got all they‚Äôre picks available to find other pieces.  4.	The Pelicans would be hilarious but could turn really deadly, really quickly. Especially since the Lakers picks the Pelicans own become prized trade capital id LeBron just decides up up and walk. Ingram plus lotto picks could probably net them Beal or LaVine which couldproduce a Lonzo, Beal/LaVine, LeBron, Zion, Hayes lineup which could be very deadly."
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
He got conditioned to expect misses after playing with taurean prince and deandre bembry as his wings his rookie year
"all I remember for Taurean Prince before he came to us is ""What does a King do to a Prince!!!"""
Also the first we got in the Taurean Prince trade. Can y‚Äôall believe we got a first for Taurean Prince???
No taurean prince wouldn‚Äôt be dressing for games if he was a laker
"Because he gets credit purely off the fact that he's a Laker, and for no other reason. He's at absolute *best* a middling role player level talent, who has completely wasted his natural athleticism.  Kuz has been relegated to just rebound robot, and yet he still thinks he's hot shit. In reality if he were on a team in a city that doesn't have 8 fucking million people, he'd be drowned into complete obscurity.  If Taurean Prince took his place, LA fans would think he was literally Jesus in comparison. And I'm not even a fan of Taurean Prince, **at all**.  All this to say.. Fuck the Lakers."
I can hear Taurean Prince in this
They moved his locker for Taurean Prince.. They obviously didn't respect him
It matters.   It determines the playoffs.  Taurean Prince
[Taurean Prince explains rebounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atr60tR7Emo)
Taurean Prince would be goated if it happens
It was Taurean Prince I‚Äôm pretty sure
"They had shitloads of draft picks, the Lakers do not. The only picks the Lakers have are the 22nd pick in this year's draft and the 2027 pick. That's it. Brooklyn traded three 1st round picks and 4 pick swaps for Harden along with Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Rodions Kurucs."
It's normal don't let others tell you how to enjoy basketball otherwise. Those people are lame.   I got into the NBA and followed the tanking Hawks led by Taurean freaking Prince. Fast forward years later and I'm loving where we are now. I've also started following the Pistons this year and they have a lot of potential to go big. I'm all for long term storytelling baby.
"In college, but [Taurean Prince](https://youtu.be/atr60tR7Emo) had this great response to being asked about being out rebounded"
"They can have Taurean Prince and a 2nd for him.   Actually, no. That's an overpay."
"Wait hunter trade is not related to this in any way iirc   Mavericks moved from 5 to 3, gave up the pick that became reddish   Hawks got hunter cuz they traded up from 8 (their own pick) to 4 by giving up 17 (from the Taurean Prince trade), 35, and took on the Solomon hill contract. These are not related in anyway, it‚Äôs just Trae + Reddish vs Luka"
"Taurean Prince looked good his rookie year, then he apparently learned from Bazemore how to go 3-13 with 5 TOs every game"
Bring in Taurean Prince to talk about rebounding
"The only real fleece is getting 2 firsts for Taurean Prince.. but that allowed the nets to sign Kyrie/KD lol so yeah. kinda funny how his trades work out like that  schlenks done a lot of smaller scale ""doing teams/players a solid"" type trades-- trading for Labissiere so portland could save money, same with uhh a guy from boston in 2019 I think, he basically asked Rondo if he wanted to go to LA, etc"
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
Should be noted he took Collins and Huerter at pick 19.   He also turned Taurean Prince into Capela and Hunter
"nah, you guys just managed to make it find its way home.  [here's the jarrett allen trade release from the nba](https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/allen-prince-trade-210114)  &gt;The Cleveland Cavaliers have acquired center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince from the Brooklyn Nets as part of a three-team trade that also includes the Houston Rockets, Cavaliers General Manager Koby Altman announced from Cleveland Clinic Courts. In exchange, Cleveland is sending guard Dant√© Exum and a 2022 unprotected first round draft pick via Milwaukee to Houston"
YO taurean prince viewed my story like a year ago (I literally have like 400 followers) and I was so hyped. Now it doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as cool
&gt;Taurean Prince - views fans IG stories randomly to try and get them to follow him  This is hilarious
"Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. The NBA is a little weird with draft picks and unless you get a top pick in a good draft class, their value is very small. Compare that to the NFL, who value top 15 picks like gold and you can many times find a franchise changing player. The NBA is just strange that way, and many times, you need 2-3 firsts as well as a decent player or two to trade for a all star.   Look at the Harden trade, for example. The Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, Rodions Kurucs as well as three unprotected 1st rounders (2022,  2024, 2026) and four first-round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027). With two young promising players they still had to just throw in 4 firsts and 4 swaps to get Harden. If the Nets team goes bust any time soon (which, can happen with Kyrie.. just sayin), they are fucked. Even if they tank down to the bottom of the league, they either gave their pick away, or another team will swap their pick away.  I'd imagine the same kind of firepower in a trade for Dame will be needed, likely with a 4 team trade as well, so even with a young a promising Anthony Edwards, I would expect a TON of picks to be going Portland's way as well as at least another decent starter."
Taurean Prince
"I iant saying Okoro is the next Kawhi, but as a 19 year old kid he guarded literally every single All-Star night in and night out and held most of them to well below average scoring and play.    https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/04/isaac-okoro-undaunted-after-defending-gauntlet-of-nba-stars-including-stephen-curry.html   ‚ÄúBut Isaac makes you beat him. He doesn‚Äôt give you angles, he doesn‚Äôt go for steals and get out of position. He makes you have to score over the top of him, and I thought he did a great job of that in the first half for sure.‚Äù  Harden‚Äôs attempts to get past or around the stout Okoro were to no avail, so much that he didn‚Äôt even take a shot until a minute and 25 seconds into the second quarter.   ‚ÄúIt was impressive from the young fella,‚Äù said Taurean Prince, who scored a season-high 17 points in his Cavs debut. ‚ÄúUsually you see guys kinda get happy feet guarding those caliber of players, but he was staying solid and sticking to his principles. Definitely stuck to the game plan. He definitely looked well-prepared and focused out there, and that‚Äôs truly all you can ask (for) out of the young guy.‚Äù  Of course, Harden is not going to be held down for very long. He found some success in the second-half and overtime periods, and ended up dropping 21 points (along with recording his third consecutive triple-double for the Nets). With that said, when you look at the shots he made, he didn't actually score on Okoro until the 3:28 mark in the fourth quarter.  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-isaac-okoro-swarms-james-harden-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-defense  Pre All-Star break, a span of time consisting of 31 games, Okoro averaged a mere 8.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Not exactly encouraging numbers for a top five pick averaging 33.2 minutes a game up to that point.  Post All-Star break, the rook has scored at a rate of 10.6 points per game, adding 3.4 rebounds and is still dishing out just 1.9 assists. What‚Äôs more? Okoro is having a great month of May as through seven games, he is posting about 16.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists.  ‚ÄúIce,‚Äù as he is often referred to, showcased exactly what he is capable of in a May 4 matchup against the Phoenix Suns (currently the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference) in which he exploded for a career-high 32 points while defending two of the game‚Äôs best in Chris Paul and Devin Booker.  He did a bit of everything offensively as he hit 10-of-16 of his field goal attempts and shot three-of-four from three-point range while also going nine-of-nine from the free throw line.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/05/14/cleveland-cavaliers-should-isaac-okoro-make-one-all-rookie-teams/"
I saw once that Taurean Prince checked out my IG story.... So you could say I'm kinda of a big deal
"Pelicans trade #10, NAW, Bledsoe, Lakers 2023 FRP for Sexton and Taurean Prince.   Resign Lonzo, Lonzo/Sexton backcourt, Lonzo can take on the harder defensive assignment and playmake while letting Sexton do what he does best: play the 2 guard and score."
"Jerami Grant, Malcolm Brogdon, Aaron Baynes, Taurean Prince. All those guys fetched protected FRPs in Sign &amp; Trade deals."
"Almost all his highlights on here have cavs fans regretting the trade, and he only got traded after the Taurean Prince incident. Not because of his allegations."
"I got another example for you, I watched a team this past year take on 13 a year of Taurean Prince playing hot garbage basketball in exchange for having a better asset attached to the same deal."
"Tanking is always an option.   The Hawks didn't have a boatload of picks from trading superstars. Most of our good players left for nothing. Got nothing for Horford. Got nothing for Millsap.   We did get a 1st for Teague (was technically pre-tank though). A pick for Schroder (it was part of a salary dump for Melo's contract), and 2 1st rounders for Taurean Prince (who we drafted with the Teague pick) in a salary dump with Brooklyn to unload Crabbe so they could sign Kyrie and KD.  If the Spurs are willing to trade middling players and take on bad contracts then they can get a few picks that way too."
"Jamal and Dejounte Murray!  Then like Darius Bazley, Terrance Davis, Taurean Prince, and WCS. Qickley, Maxey, and Patrick Williams as rookies.  So... you can go real young + Kawhi, or very Murray + Kawhi."
Shit. Taurean Prince. Is he even alive?
Yeah  Don‚Äôt feel bad we turned the Nets picks we got for Taurean Prince into Hunter and Capela
"First of all, false. Second of all, where were all the people comparing rosters when the Hawks were starting Alex Len, Taurean Prince, and DeWayne Dedmon?"
"No I wouldn't, and you're not getting my point. Nobody outside of GSW thought that KD going to the Warriors as a free agent was good for the league.  Imagine if Harden went to Brooklyn without Brooklyn having to give up most of their playoff core, and without them having to mortgage their future. Would you see a team with KD, Kyrie, Harden + Joe Harris, Levert, Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, and Taurean Prince as fair, especially if they had their first rounders every subsequent year?"
I saw two players named Taurean Prince and Brice bowen and I was wondering what year it was lol
"Montrezl, demarre Carroll, taurean prince, Kenneth faried, nene"
"Jabari Parker was supposed to be a sixth man on a projected 30 win team. The goal wasn‚Äôt to win games. Why is this difficult for you understand? Schlenk came in at a time where the team got bounced from the first round of the playoffs, and our only true positive assets were basically Taurean Prince and John Collins. That team was obviously going nowhere. He took a team with a lack of assets and got them to the eastern conference finals in three years. That‚Äôs objectively very fucking impressive and you know it."
Reminds me of Taurean Prince describing to a reporter what a rebound is..lol.
Strong Taurean Prince being asked about rebounds energy  https://youtu.be/atr60tR7Emo?t=20
The dude turned Taurean fucking Prince into Capela and Hunter. Give him some credit
"When we traded Allen Crabbe for Taurean Prince I would never have guessed Atlanta would make it to the ECF in two years, faster than the Nets."
"What's more interesting is how little of what that 2014- 2015 team became assets for them:  * The following left in free agency for nothing: Al Horford, Paul Millsap, DeMarre Carroll, Thabo Sefolosha, Pero Antic, John Jenkins, Elton Brand, Austin Daye (waived in his final season) * Adreian Payne traded that season (his rookie year) to the Twolves for the pick that became K'Von ""Red Velvet"" Huerter  * Following were traded for things that didn't matter: Mike Scott  (a 2nd that did not convey), Shelvin Mack (traded for washed up Kirk Hinrich in his final season), Korver (traded for a retired Mo Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr. in his final season and a 1st that did not convey). * Schroder was traded for a pick that conveys next year plus a whole bunch of nothing. *  Jeff Teague traded for Taurean Prince and a pick that was packaged with other picks to get DeAndre Hunter. * Kent Bazemore and a future first eventually became Clint Capela.   So in summary, from that roster they only really got Clint Capela, Huerter, and DeAndre Hunter. 4/5 of the ""NBA Player of the Month"" team left for nothing. I remember there was a lot of criticism of the Hawks for not getting assets for their players, but it didn't really matter. Schlenk did a good job of rebuilding through the draft and free agency."
"We sent Taurean Prince to Cleveland, which resulted in the Cavs giving Porter his locker, leading to a meltdown."
"&gt;DeAndre Bembry  &gt;Taurean Prince  &gt;Traded Oubre  Mixed bag, Prince is a bad piece on a bad team, Bembry is on a minimum in Toronto, and Oubre is the best individual player, but was traded before he could really do anything for the team"
"Reminder that as part of the trade to get harden, the nets gave up 3 first rounder, 3 picks swaps, and lost LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince and Kurucs.  Now they have 3 aging stars, a threadbare team and no assets."
"Word is Bev and Taurean Prince can‚Äôt be traded again until late September. My money is on a 3 team deal sending SGA, Bev, and Prince to Philly, Simmons to Minny, young players/picks to OKC"
Does anyone follow Taurean Prince? He‚Äôs been sharing some Anti-Vax stuff on his stories. Shame.
We wouldn‚Äôt have KPJ or Green if we took the Simmons package  KPJ was waived because of the Taurean Prince locker room incident. Taurean Prince was traded to Cavs in the harden trade and then took KPJ‚Äôs locker  Jalen Green was gotten from us getting the number two pick. We would‚Äôve lost our pick of it landed outside the top 4 and it would have if we had Simmons because he‚Äôd prolly win us 3-6 games.  It‚Äôs also important to note that Simmons is on a max for 4 years and we still have Wall on a super max for two more years. I think a complete rebuild was a better option  I do think we should‚Äôve traded Harden for like MPJ and picks but I‚Äôm not sure that deal was even available
Y‚Äôall better hope someone wants Fresh outta jail Beasley or the Taurean Prince of Bel-Air
"Minnesota thinking they can get Simmons without giving up Ant, Dlo or McDaniels is one of the funniest storylines I‚Äôve ever seen.  They‚Äôre not going to get Simmons or any win now pieces to trade for him with a deal centered around Taurean Prince and All-Prison first team members Pat Bev and Malik Beasley"
"&gt;On Nov. 14‚Äîtwo months before the trade was officially announced‚Äîearly talks between Houston and Brooklyn included Harden for Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen. The picks weren't finalized at that point, but a verbal agreement was made, according to sources close to Harden and Durant. (A Nets spokesperson denies a verbal agreement was made at that time.) Harden and Durant believed the deal was done and celebrated the occasion together.  &gt;By Nov. 17, news of the potential deal had spread across the league. Harden and Durant thought it would be finalized on Nov. 22, when trades could officially be announced. But Rockets management changed its tune. Harden, Durant and the Nets had underestimated the Rockets' capacity to posture for a better deal.  &gt;""Houston was being difficult,"" a front-office executive familiar with the Rockets' negotiating tactics at the time told Bleacher Report.  Ah yes I'm sure Harden and KD celebrated the trade based off of nothing. Fuck outta here"
Taurean Prince - Explaining to reporters what rebounds are.
"Anderson Varejao, Delly, and Taurean Prince (gonna miss him)"
If Taurean Prince sticks on the team he‚Äôd probably take 12
"I kind of understand how the Wolves won the trade - Culver needs to be another team's rehab project and most Wolves fans are just completely out on Juancho but my God your forward rotation outside of McDaniels is absolutely awful.  Ant's too small to defend the 3 + doesn't have the defensive acumen yet. Okogie's undersized and is a black hole on offense.  That leaves you Taurean Prince (solid enough as a rotation guy, but he's also an expiring that I don't see being on the team in the future), Jarred Vanderbilt (basically a small-ball 5 but okay maybe you can work around that with KAT), Jake Layman (oh boy)."
"&gt;Think you could argue that those three guys combined would provide more value in the playoffs than Simmons.  Yeah I dont think that at all, I think that's genuinely a delusional statement.  First of all Prince is the definition of a replacement player, posting a grand total of 0.1 VORP over his 5 seasons in the NBA. I watched him for both the Hawks and Nets - genuinely one of the most frustrating players to ever watch (/u/Bigbadbuck knows.) You can get and Vanderbilt's value for 2 minimum value contract guys without having to pay $13m/yr for Taurean Prince. They are human TPEs to deliver the 3 picks.  Patrick Beverly literally does nothing better than Simmons other than spot up shoot while being way older and could decline at any point. He probably does still have value to the Sixers but in no way is what is essentially a Bev + picks for Simmons trade be fair considering picks from like 2028 (which if the Wolves are sending 3, it has to start in 2024) help Joel Embiid or is seen as a win."
"Selling at  all time low value is just bad management in my opinion.   There's no defensible thing about replacing Rubio, Culver and Juancho with PatBev and Taurean Prince."
"In the last few years Minnesota has turned Kevin Love, Zach Lavine, and 4 lottery picks into D-LO, Malik Beasley, ~~Ricky Rubio~~ Taurean Prince, and ~~Jarret Culver~~ Pat Bev."
"Could they have used their TPE on Rubio? Because unless the Wolves were keen on trading Rubio for Taurean Prince then that was a missed opportunity to fill their need at a cheap price.. they then used their TPE for Josh Richardson, who really doesn‚Äôt do much or do anything consistently these days"
"Id try to force a trade to 6ers, essentially forcing the Blazers to rebuild, which means they wouldn't want Simmons, so a third team that really wants a defensive pf who won't take touches away from players will have to be involved in this completely hypothetical and unbiased trade. If I was the Blazers FO, I would get rid of McCollum obviously, but I would need draft picks and some young players who haven't hit their stride, someone like, idk, Jarrett Culver, maybe a shooter and an ok pf, like, Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince maybe? That's just what seems fair and unbiased to me."
"Who knows what they'd do - Jody Allen is apparently trying to sell the Blazers and it's easier to sell a competitive team (probably).  I imagine if the Blazers are blowing it up they'd clear house for all of the picks they can. Here's the rough deal:  Philly gets: Either Dame/CJ, Robert Covington  Minny gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, picks from BOTH Philly and Minny"
Trae had Collins Dedmon and Taurean Prince and averaged 8.1 as a rookie
"Taurean prince, Denzel valentine, Markelle fultz, lauri markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, marvin bagley, Kevin knox. That's my list of guys that were hyped but either have had bad injury luck or don't know what the hell is going on."
This doesn‚Äôt make sense  The Rockets arent bad enough for green if harden stays   Taurean Prince never goes to Cleveland without the harden trade and KPJ never complains about his locker  Sengun was also apart of the trade and he isn‚Äôt a starter yet to begin with  KMJ doesn‚Äôt play big minutes for a playoff team
"Jaden McDaniels is going to establish himself as one of the more coveted 3 and D players in the league this season. Wolves making it to the playoffs with help from his improvement, Edwards taking a big step up with efficiency and leadership, Balmaro being more useful than most expect, and Taurean Prince fitting in as a bench 3 point sniper to go along with Malik"
"He was great in college. 14th wasn't a reach at the time, but it's a cautionary tale about overvaluing production as a senior in college when the player is older and more experienced than the competition. It just didn't translate to the NBA.  Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Thon Maker, Taurean Prince, and Georgios Papagiannis all had similar or worse NBA careers than he has had and they were drafted ahead of him. It's just the nature of the draft that not every guy is suited for the NBA/not every team is good at developing prospects. Not the worst 14th pick ever imo"
they sent taurean prince to cleveland and the cavs gave him kpj's locker and kpj was understandably upset so the cavs traded him to the rockets for a bag of chips
"So Taurean Prince, Malik Beasley and 2 1sts? We will even throw a Prince Prince jersey."
"If MIN isn‚Äôt moved, they need to do something. The only thing I heard about them this off-season was trading for Taurean Prince."
Oh shut tf up. Porter was under investigation for assaulting a woman AND flipped his car over at 3 am on the highway in the ghetto of Ohio and cops found an unregistered gun in his car. The Cavs weren‚Äôt letting him play until he proved he was focusing on himself. Then the FIRST DAY they bring him back he throws a temper tantrum over his locker being moved for a recently acquired veteran (Taurean Prince) and calls our black GM (who gave KPJ plenty of leeway) a slave owner and threw food around the room.   KPJ‚Äôs locker was moved because he wasn‚Äôt an active player on the roster. It was moved to the end of the room temporarily while he was basically on a team inflicted suspension.   AND the way I‚Äôve heard it was Cleveland had offers from other teams in the league but chose to send KPJ to houstin because of their history of dealing with troubled players. They wanted him to be in a place he could succeed and made sure to only trade him to a team that had a plan in place.
It actually can work pretty easily if you use Malik Beasley's and Taurean Prince's contracts. They earn $27M between them this upcoming season. Not to mention that Prince is an expiring and Beasly is on a rather team friendly deal. I can see this trade as one of the few possibilities for a Dame/Simmons trade to happpen.

Tobias might have a big contract but I'd still take it in a heartbeat (depending on what we have to send to Philly) because Tobias on 30 million is still far more useful than Juancho Hernangomez and Taurean Prince
We really just traded Rubio for... checks notes... Taurean Prince....
How many points did Taurean Prince ever score against Team USA?
Minnesota just traded Ricky Rubio Plus a Second Round Pick Plus Cash to Cavs for Taurean Prince! HIGHWAY FUCKING ROBBERY!! Good Luck Cleveland!
"Yeah but Taurean Prince is a better ""fit"""
Taurean Prince
ricky rubio is gonna eliminate team USA and all the wolves were able to get for him was taurean prince and a 2ndüíÄ
We traded Ricky Rubio for Taurean Prince. And we also gave the Cavs a 2nd round pick.
Unless the cavs are included rubio is already out (reportedly traded Rubio for Taurean Prince and a 2022 2rp (via washington))
Taurean Prince made a fan out of me that game he dropped 30 something on the Celtics a few years ago. Really fun player to watch
"He's the new Taurean Prince. People just gave him the reputation of a ""defender"" because he looks the part when he was a rookie and went from there. He's terrible he doesnt guard anybody. He's much closer to one of those microwave scorer type guards than he is some kind of 3+D wing."
"Taurean Prince is arguably one of the best defenders on the team. Jesus, that tells you everything you need to know."
"He said he's looking, but what we got right now... Taurean Prince is a smallball 4, Jaden McDaniels is a smallball 4, ect."
They do have a Taurean Prince tho

We got Taurean Prince and no draft picks how tf do you think
Taurean Prince was a sleeper agent sent to disrupt the Cavaliers locker room. You will not change my mind.
What?? Point guards are everywhere? We just got one for a shit pick and Taurean Prince
taurean prince to the rescue
"I mean, we sent Taurean Prince to Cleveland to take Kevin Porter's locker, causing a blow-up, and forcing the Cavs to trade him to us for free."
Here  Adams and Bledsoe and 10 and a lakers first for JV and 17  Shamet for pick 29 and Carter  Rubio and a 2nd rounder for Taurean Prince  Plumlee and 37 for 57
"Is Taurean Prince any good?  I thought he was just some end of bench guy, which makes this trade look like a salary dump from the Wolves."
Mavs should've jumped on that Rubio trade. They could easily outbid a Taurean Prince.
"Not happy about this one. As a Wolves fan from NYC, i've seen Taurean Prince absolutely stink up the show many times when he was on the Nets. What an awful pickup. Surely there was a better option available."
"TRADE: The Cleveland Cavaliers are acquiring Minnesota Timberwolves G Ricky Rubio, a 2022 second-round pick and cash for F Taurean Prince, sources tell ESPN."
Wasn‚Äôt taurean prince decent at one point
Rockets legend Taurean Prince
"I don't hate the guy or anything and I think he might even put up decent points and rebounds if he got to start at the 4 somewhere, but 538 had him between Solomon Hill, Wes Iwundu, Taurean Prince, Thad Young and Torrey Craig last year. That's what, an 8-10M guy in Thad, a 5-6M guy in Prince, a 3-4M guy in Craig and a couple minimum guys. Kuzma is younger than those guys except Iwundu, but I think you're still talking 20M over 3 kind of deal, though as I said I think if he moved to a non-playoff team where he could be a full-time 4 he would probably put up decent numbers.  As a Raptors fan, if Lowry signs with you guys and we have 19M in cap space, I wouldn't be stoked if we spent 13M of that on Kuzma. The Lakers have apparently been offering him and KCP all over town for a reason, and it's not because LeBron think he's a solid rotation guy. He's shot 40 percent in the playoffs and 28% on 3s in the 5 playoff series he's been in at age 25 and 26.  Though ironically, I think he'd be a good fit for us at forward next to whichever of OG or Siakam is sitting. Kuzma is a tantalizing player, but there's no real evidence he's more than a 9th man. My guess is he goes somewhere, puts up slightly better numbers but doesn't help his team win. But today? I think he's a 7M guy on potential and 5M on actuality. I wouldn't trust him over a guy like JaMychal Green and that seems like a guy who would be overpaid at 10M a year, never mind 13. He's not Marcus Morris, he's a guy who in theory could be."
"Okay fine: you got Larry Nance Jr, Taurean Prince, Cedi Osman and a protected future first."
"Don't forget that the Cavs had Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince who the Nets JUST traded for Harden   Watching OT was hilarious to me because Sexton just turned on the ""I'm not missing tonight"" settings and it was hilarious watching the leagues new Superteam not able to match or contain him   So after getting embarrassed in double OT and get ripped by social media and TV personnel, the stars are gonna come back and destroy them to show them who's boss right? Nope, their very next game was also against the Cavs and they LOST AGAIN. It was just quality memes"
It's Taurean Prince syndrome people decided coming out he must look like he's a good defender so he got that reputation and everybody just ran with it. He's terrible he doesnt guard anybody gives off all kinds of slap your hands on the court before your guy blows by you on defense energy. He's young so he might be able to get to being fine/non issue on that end but he's much closer to a combo guard microwave scorer/chucker than any kind of 3+D wing.
"Larry Nance, Taurean Prince, Cedi Osman, and a top 10 protected 2022 1st."
funnily enough they moved it because they gave the locker that he was using to taurean prince who they got from houston in the harden trade
it was because he had a locker room outburst because the Cavs gave Taurean Prince the locker KPJ was using (ironically Taurean Prince was traded to Cleveland by the Rockets) he hasn't had any outbursts like that in Houston though
"I mean KPJ very clearly has raw talent, but the off-court issues have pretty much zapped his value as an asset.      Keep in mind, a lot of people had him as a top 5 talent in his draft class but he slipped all the way to 30 because of the off court stuff/suspension at USC.      Then he had the weapons charge/car accident and the Taurean Prince outburst in Cleveland and was traded for a heavily protected 2nd rounder. There was even rumors he was going to be cut entirely.      As talented as he is, he's still a major risk. I doubt teams value him more than like a mid 20's pick."
Taurean Prince got the answer
"I mean if you want to bank on those unprotected picks turning into lotteries, I got a bridge I'd like to sell you. Nets under Sean Marks never tanked and made playoffs with D'Lo as their best player. To think that any of those picks would convey top 10 is fool's gold. Ben's trade value was way higher last year than it is now. Minny or Denver would've given up valuable assets for him at the time. Just because you acquire Ben doesn't mean you have to keep him and worry that you're gonna make the playoffs, you could flip him immediately and continue sucking for the foreseeable future.   &gt; Not acquiring Ben Simmons and bottoming out into the worst record in the league maximized getting a top pick and Cleveland did us a favor after routing them jarrett allen in harden trade.  &gt; Not to mention that KPJ never gets kicked off the team this year without the locker room incident which happened from... taurean prince entering cleveland as part of the harden trade.  &gt; Do you not see how everything is holistic and affects each other? Do you think we getting get the no 2 pick, getting kpj, developing kpj at point and him going 50 11 in a game, was compatible with us acquiring simmons this year?  Not gonna bother even arguing with this level of copium. The mental gymnastics some Rockets fans do to justify that trade lol"
"As recently suggested in the Cavs sub‚Ä¶ Collin Sexton, Kevin Love and Taurean Prince to the Knicks for RJ Barrett, Immanual Quickley, Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, and picks 19, 21, 32, 58 lmao."
Finch is a good coach.    All of the terrible contracts are gone.  You can argue DLos contract is terrible.  That's what it is.  He picked up McDaniels and Naz Reid.  Nowell and Mclaughlin in the second as well if you care about young bench depth.    Gorgui and Teague money is now Beasley and Taurean Prince.  Watching KAT get doubled on the break and tripled in the post only to kick out to a sub-30 percent shooter sucked.  That was the situation that Rosas inherited.
"&gt;Sure ""anybody"" might be able to beat the Wolves offer, but how many are willing.   Multiple teams, including a majority of the ones I named would be willing. I promise you if the best offer Philly gets is that dog shit Minnesota one centered around Beasley and Prince MULTIPLE teams will swoop right in and take Simmons.   &gt;To trade, you need at least two interested and willing partners.    And please explain to me why Philly would want Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince when there are CLEALY better offers out there????  &gt;Right now, it looks like Minnesota and two others and none of the offers out there are better than the Wolves offer.  False. I don‚Äôt understand why you Minnesota fans think your offer is so good. You‚Äôre setting yourselves up to be inevitably disappointed when Simmons is traded else where after Morey laughs at that offer.   &gt;So sure, sit on Simmons, deflate his value even more   Declining to take a horrible trade package isn‚Äôt deflating someone‚Äôs value."
"If there is a trade, the package would most likely be something like  Ben Simmons to Timberwolves  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, and either Patrick Beverley or Taurean Prince, and 2-3 first round picks (with some initial protections) to Sixers  Salaries match. No way Sixers do this unless they are desperate. I don‚Äôt think Sixers are that desperate. I think they are actually hopeful to give Maxes/Thybulle/Reed some of Simmons playing time to see how they do, even if he sits out."
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
Taurean Prince trade I think
"The whole Morey connection has me thinking though. PatBev would make sense for the Sixers. But then if you‚Äôre Minnesota why do this whole press conference? If you‚Äôre not trading him or KAT/DLo/Ant then how are you getting the salaries to match for Simmons? Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince gets it done in that sense, but then you‚Äôd have to include every pick in your arsenal for it to work value-wise. At that point Philly would probably prefer a third team getting involved to take that junk + picks deal and send a star their way, but nobody they want seems to be available. I‚Äôm sick of replaying the possibilities in my head lol just gimme a damn Sham slam or Woj bomb already."
"If the Wolves don't find a third team I think salary + 3 first round picks would be the best deal for both parties.  3 picks is a lot, but Simmons fits the Wolves like a glove but with him they would have their best team in decades.  Morey won't be getting an all star for Simmons anyway so I think his best option is to get assets and try to trade for a star next season, and hope that someone good is available.  So it would be something like  Simmons for 2 of Beverley, Taurean Prince and Beasley and 3 picks"
"**What realistically do Timberwolves end up giving away for Simmons if anything?**  &gt;We‚Äôve reported that Edwards and Towns are off the table. I also believe Rosas wants to keep Russell, and there are questions about whether Philly would be interested in a Russell-centered package in the first place. What is important to remember is that these are negotiations. Morey might be saying he needs Edwards or there‚Äôs no deal right now. Maybe Rosas is saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trading you KAT, Ant, Russell or McDaniels.‚Äù That‚Äôs how these positions are staked early. Remember above with Thibs asking for Embiid and Simmons for Butler.  &gt;Those things can change over time. As high as the Wolves, and fans, are on McDaniels, he is one of the team‚Äôs most attractive players. If you want to land a star, you‚Äôve got to spend money to make money. Beasley would seem to be a great fit with Embiid as a floor-spacer. Beverley‚Äôs defense and his playoff experience could be attractive, in addition to the money on his deal to help make it work. Taurean Prince could be used on that front as well.  &gt;The most viable scenario for the Wolves making a deal work is to find a third team to direct more of what Morey wants to Philadelphia. And that is where the draft pick compensation comes in. An unprotected Timberwolves first-rounder carries a heck of a lot more weight than, say, one from San Antonio. That is true for Philly, who could use those picks to try to pry a real star away from a playoff team that shifts into rebuild or for another team that is looking for a reason to jump in and facilitate the deal.  &gt;Will any of that blow Philly away? No. It doesn‚Äôt seem like there is a ‚ÄúHarden-like‚Äù package out there for Simmons. So the Wolves‚Äô best hope is that the market remains cool, the temperature in Philly gets hotter and their offers look better over time.  &gt;Getting a third team involved is a very complex and delicate process. That‚Äôs why all of the discussion revolving around Simmons to Minnesota has to be colored with that context. Finding a third partner, or finding a way to make a straight-up trade with Philly will be exceedingly difficult. But the Wolves are motivated, just as they were with Russell and Golden State. That‚Äôs why it can‚Äôt be ignored or dismissed.  He also added earlier this;  &gt;Maybe the Blazers do ante up with a C.J. McCollum-led package. Maybe San Antonio or Toronto make a run. But if the market stays dry, that gives the Wolves a chance. And a couple of unprotected Timberwolves picks, while not helping Morey immediately, could be a nice carrot to dangle for a stepping-stone move that would give Morey a bigger treasure chest of assets to deploy should Lillard or Beal eventually ask for a trade.  I don't want to spoil anymore of the article so go and read it for yourself and give Jon some love!"

"Bruh... Kenneth Faried, Trezz, Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince, DeMarre Carroll  are they gonna be the most intimidating line up?"
And taurean prince
"For me used to be DeMarre Carrol. Remember back in days when I did a bit of scouting reports for prospect and any time end up watching a mediocre 3&amp;D that will end up in the 1st round but which nobody expect to play the star role on a team ever, I always labelled him like ""DeMarre Carroll like"".  In those days DeMarre became also an important piece of the Hawks and for some years was really good 3&amp;D, courios that almost nobody lived that Carrol hype üòÖ except for Taurean Prince that now us my kind of Carroll. Good player but for sure replaceable."
Allen being traded had nothing to do with DJ and everything to do with harden and taurean prince. Nets had nobody else to trade who would‚Äôve made Cleveland willing to part with the 1st the rockets needed while also absorbing prince‚Äôs bad contract
"‚ÄúReport: 76ers have traded Ben Simmons for Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, and 2025 2nd round pick‚Äù  Yeah I‚Äôm calling bullshit on that one.  *wins 2021 Championship*  Ehh, idk, highly debatable"
"Yep. My guess is V8 and perhaps McLaughlin are waiting to sign because we're still trying to position ourselves for a Ben Simmons trade, which won't happen until the end of the month at the earliest (if Taurean Prince is involved) or just before season tip-off (if Beverley is involved). So he should hopefully re-sign within 1 month or so, which is still quite late.   He has been involved with the team a fair amount this offseason, for example going to Summer League with the team, so I think there's almost no chance he gets poached at this point. If he did, it would've happened earlier because a team would've made him a great offer, maybe similar to the DJJ offer from Portland last year."
"Trying to think, is that better than Pat Bev, Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince and 3 1sts?"
"The most realistic to me for the Wolves requires a 3rd team. I think the Wizards makes sense, with it going:  Simmons to Minnesota  Beal to Philadelphia  Patrick Beverly (sorry for the 1000000th trade), Taurean Prince, Jaden McDaniels, and two 1sts to Washington.   I could also see Washington getting a 1st out of Philly to get it done. Beverly and Prince are expiring contracts so they get cap flexibility going forward.  McDaniels looks like he could develop into a very good player, probably not an all star, but one of those guys that you love starting for you under a cheap contract for 3 years. They also get 2 or 3 extra firsts, and Minnesota firsts hit different.   I'd be interested to get the perspective of a Wizards fan because from the outside your team looks like a prime candidate to blow it up and see what can happen in a few years."
Malik Beasley  Taurean Prince  Naz Reid  2022 2nd round pick (via Washington)   Unprotected 2023 FRP  2024 1st round pick swap  Top 5 protected 2025 FRP  Top 5 protected 2027 FRP
"I‚Äôm betting on San Antonio.   I think it‚Äôll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I‚Äôm going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I‚Äôll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I‚Äôd probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it‚Äôs not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they‚Äôd be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I‚Äôll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don‚Äôt see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn‚Äôt take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
"They could have come for the culture, but are you really teeling me you wouldn't trade Jarett Allen, Caris LeVert and Taurean Prince for a chance to sign James Fucking Harden?  Even Jarett Allen said he would trade himself because the chance of trading for a superstar like Harden is so slim.   Now ofc they asked KD &amp; Kyrie their opinion, but what are they supposed to do?  Tell them ""Oh sorry we don't want to play with Harden""?"
"Damn sixers about to end up with Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Jaden McDaniels and like 3 firsts"
"Really? Nets gave up Jarrett Allen, Levert, Taurean Prince, Kurucs, 3 firsts, and 4 first swaps for Harden.  Even if minny matches those picks, Allen and Levert are way better than any player in this package"
Fair üòÇ  Until you guys swooped in for Nance the Wolves and Blazers were fighting for most uninspiring offseason. At least you've got *something* to point to this offseason to be encouraged by now.   If the Wolves don't get Simmons their biggest acquisition is a fight between Patrick Beverley or Taurean Prince.
"&gt; Detroit: Jaden Mcdaniels, Taurean Prince, Danny Green  Bruh"
Key dates if yoi think its a Minnesota deal:  Sep 12th Taurean Prince can be traded and Oct 1st Pat Beverley can be traded
Who is their best wing defender? Taurean Prince? That seems problematic in terms of roster construction.
"I actually do think Blazers take Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, 2 1sts for CJ McCollum, CJ's overpaid because he's forced to take a reduced role and they paid him for his talent level, which is greater than his role. Malik does 80% of CJ at 50% of the cost, for two more years then a team option, off ball. Taurean Prince is a feasibly switchable rotation player who gives you mildly efficient but not super productive play on both sides of the ball.   If you throw Naz Reid into the mix then you have a super young but productive backup big who is on a &lt;1st Round contract."
I'm not treating him as anything significant here. Make it the expiring Taurean Prince instead of Beasley for all I care. the only serious value here are the picks.
"Minnesota: Simmons Philadelphia: Damian Lillard Portland: 2022 FRP Minnesota, 2023 FRP Philadelphia, 2024 FRP Minnesota, 2025 FRP Philadelphia, Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, and Tyrese Maxey to Portland"
"His trade value remains the same.  The same teams have reported being interested and there hasn't been reports on the price changing.  I know this sub exists in it's own reality, but Simmons publicly asking out does not mean he is now only worth a Taurean Prince and a 2nd"
"I think the Wolves gotta give up Ant Edwards if they want to get this done.  Simmons + Maxey for Edwards + decent players as salary filler (Taurean Prince &amp; Pat Beverly) works salary-wise, and I think it‚Äôs fair for both teams.  Thoughts? Minny giving up Edwards means they get Maxey back, and can hold onto McDaniels/all their picks   I have Ant as a better asset at the moment over Simmons. Would suck to lose him, but Ben might fit the timeline better and help you become a playoff team quicker."
"&gt;Some combination of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Ried, multiple big expiring contracts (Taurean Prince or Patrick Beverley), and/or multiple future 1sts.  LOL"
"Some combination of Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Ried, multiple big expiring contracts (Taurean Prince or Patrick Beverley), and/or multiple future 1sts."
"Sure. Cleveland wants to be competitive and actually make the play in / playoffs this upcoming year. People want to slide in Mobley as a starter from day 1 but forcing him to guard starting PFs doesn‚Äôt really make sense if you‚Äôre trying to win now. There will be plenty of backup Center minutes for him behind Allen. They traded Taurean Prince (who was a PF for them) for a guard in Rubio. They traded Nance (a PF) for another PF. If Love isn‚Äôt in the plans, who are the PF/Cs on the team that are going to get minutes? Isn‚Äôt it just the 3 guys I mentioned (Lauri/Allen/Mobley)?"
"Taurean Prince - San Angelo, Texas before he moved to San Antonio to live with his mom"
But then what can you offer the 3rd team to make them give a great piece? It‚Äôs not like teams are knocking down the door for Malik Beasley or Taurean Prince. Best I can see is maybe Hield and the Kings won‚Äôt help the Wolves get Simmons.
"Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince, Demarre Carroll"
"Taurean Prince, it's in the title..."
"they opened up a shitload of cap in 2019 and got Kyrie and KD (and deandre jordan who hitched a ride onto his talented friends). they had bird rights on Joe Harris and Brown. blake wants a free ring and signed for minimum wage. patty wants a free ring and signed for the MLE which every single team gets. they traded levert, allen, taurean prince, and 3 first rounders with 4 swaps for harden. their tax bill will be 200+ million soon but the owner can afford it"
"&gt; Blazers get: (from Minny) Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, LeAndro Bolmaro   LMAO."
Ricky Rubio and a second got traded for Taurean Prince. You're right.
"When they play us, Taurean Prince can give him a lesson."
Had Taurean Prince playing Twister
‚ÄúThe guy‚Äù from Baylor was Taurean Prince actually. Don‚Äôt know about the dude from Wisconsin though
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
"Ask Taurean Prince, I think he knows a word for that"
"Now that Taurean Prince is not on the Nets, he needs to take the role of making snarky answers to reporters."
"A bunch. Played against KAT a few times back in the day, him and his family were great. He played alongside Wade Baldwin, who actually got ejected when we played him and we thought was pretty overrated but we ended up reconnecting a few years later and laughed about the whole thing.  Worked at a hotel that hosted the NBA Rookie Symposium in 2016. Served Ben Simmons, he very much kept to himself and didn‚Äôt socialize like everyone else. Buddy Hield gave me a free speaker, shirt, bags, etc. because ‚Äúman we got money we don‚Äôt need this‚Äù was super appreciative. Jamal Murray was my guy too, super nice. Did not like Taurean Prince because he was offended I didn‚Äôt know who he was and was kind of a dick (to be fair, I knew most of them, but like dude you‚Äôre Taurean Prince).  Went to college with Kevin Huerter, wasn‚Äôt super close but he used to hookup with my friend and we talked a few times, he‚Äôs pretty quiet and reserved but a good guy. Bruno Fernando was hilarious, we loved him."
"Idk man it's making me think of people who say DeMarre, Nene, Taurean Prince and Montrezl look the same back in the day and it doesn't sit right with me  (Also light skinned black dude)"
"It's not like the Hawks were in a good position when we drafted Trae, our best players were Taurean Prince and Schroeder. The only player we still have from that roster is Collins. It's a credit to Trae's skillset that we've been able to build around him so successfully. Sure, our front office has been competent but you couldn't have asked for much more from Trae."
Taurean Prince.
"KPJ and Green are literally products of that trade  We literally got KPJ because Taurean Prince took his locker. Taurean Prince was in that Harden trade  We also 100% wouldn‚Äôt have been picking in the top 4 , if we had Simmons from January"
We weren‚Äôt already getting KPJ  KPJ got cut because of his tantrums when Taurean Prince took his locker  Taurean Prince was traded to Cleveland because of the Nets trade
Taurean Prince better
"you all were [actually one of the healthiest teams in the NBA](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNBA/status/1390054193294159874?s=20) and just massively underperformed relative to number of games missed but not that it mattered at all   a healthy wolves with Dlo, Ant, and KAT got taken out behind the woodshed and shot by a Pacers team led by Tj McConnell and missing Sabonis, Turner, Warren, and Brogdon  there isn't really a single PF on the roster, they have zero defensive identity or really any net positive defensive players, and i dont see how adding patrick beverley and taurean prince (seriously wtf?) is going to add 10 wins to this roster."
"You are obsessed with the idea that you are a better person than me that you don't actually bother caring what I said. When I went from not caring all that much about sports, to wanting to really get into sports, the Falcons had a soul crushing loss in the super bowl. I felt the heartbreak of loss, and didn't want to pick up the sport. Instead I only focused on Basketball, and the Hawks.  Not to mention. I AM A HAWKS FAN. You realize that since 2016-17 we haven't been the team that's been lighting the league up, night in night out. The 60 win team was the year prior, and the team immediately began making moves that didn't make us objectively better. 16-17 was the beginning of the journey to our rebuild. I didn't pick the Hawks for Wins, I liked Kyle Korver Shooting threes, the Hype of Sir Foster, I liked watching Paul Millsap be one of the best players in the league, without getting the recognition I thought he deserved. I defended Dennis Schroeder to the ends of the earth. Saying he could be our point gaurd of the future. I watched Taurean Prince describe how to rebound a thousand times because it was legitimately hilarious. It wasn't about picking a winning team, it was about vibe when I wanted to start following a sport.  But Nah King, here is your üëë, And your üîë to keep the gates nice and locked up."
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
"I'd have to imagine Wolves still are willing to offer Beasley, McDaniels, Prince or Bev and two unprotected firsts, that is hardly nothing.   Definitely not the value he would've gotten a year ago, or two years ago, but its probably only going to go down from here on out.   Ideally, the Sixers would've done this all behind closed doors, but they didn't and hindsight is 20/20.   The Wolves, seemingly, want Simmons the most and have one of the better offers on the table, but they also have two timelines going on right now. They have the Ant/Jaden timeline and the Kat/D'lo timeline. If they start out hot, like 10-5 in the first 15 games, (which seems unlikely), then the Wolves offer might be going down and they may not want to include Jaden, and Jaden is the real prize in that deal.   If the Wolves are healthy and suck and start out 5-15 the thought process could definitely shift towards trading Beasley, D'lo and Kat to buy into the Ant and Jaden timeline. This means they wouldn't be in the market for Simmons at all.   So, Wolves being too good or too bad could mean them no longer wanting Simmons or their offer changing substantially. Meanwhile, Simmons is sitting and either not showing up or faking an injury to not play, his value would only be slowly going down.   I suppose if I were Morey I would try to get RoCo and CJ from the Blazers and go all-in on the next two years, and hope to flip Thybulle down the line. But at this point Jaden is the better defender between him and RoCo, and has more promise on a cheaper contract.   If Morey does go with the Wolves offer, Beasley would feast next to Embiid, sure he sucks on defense, but he is an elite high volume 3-pt shooter and on a good contract, assuming he stays out of prison. Beasley is the type of guy who could shoot his way into an all-star game, even while being average or below average at pretty much everything else.  Embiid, Jaden and Thybulle would have to cover for his defensive lapses though.   Jaden could slide next to Harris as a 3/4 option, his numbers dont really reflect his impact, he's been very impressive so far, and within a year could be packaged with the Wolves picks and Thybulle for a star to pair with Embiid. Jaden's value should increase. He's like 6'10 and 195 lbs or something, but is above average on man and team defense, can guard the perimeter and in the post with above average rim protection. He also has a pretty decent 3-pt shot and has been working on his handles.   Plus they would get either Pat Bev or Taurean Prince, and Bev would fit what they needed a lot more.   If Morey goes with the Blazers, those guys will just be losing value over their contracts as both are getting up there in age. If he goes with the Wolves offer he'll have to work to improve value of guys to then flip for someone around Embiid's age, or someone like Beal.   I wonder if the Blazers would offer CJ and Anfernee Simons with RoCo, and a pick? That'd probably get me to slide more towards the Blazers offer, but everything i've heard is they won't offer RoCo.   Either way, didn't get Harden, so that is what all this will be compared to. Would've been a great combo, Harden and Embiid."
"3 firsts, Taurean Prince and Patrick Beverely isn't even close to enough to bring Ben Simmons back."
"How about Taurean Prince?  He‚Äôs never really been bad, just also really hasn‚Äôt been great.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs had a great opportunity for years."
"Patrick Beverley, Taurean Prince, a couple filler players, 2022 MIN 1st (unprot), 2024 MIN 1st (minimal protection), and either 2026 MIN 1st or Jaden McDaniels. Maybe throw in an additional pick swap in the distant future. It probably becomes a bigger trade that moves a pick or two for some immediate help to Philly."
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"I thought I read that Pat Bev was already vaccinated?  It‚Äôs likely new players, so Bolmaro makes sense. You could also potentially see Taurean Prince in that category. But it also could be the young guys (like Nathan Knight or McKinley Wright)."
Taurean Prince lmao not the Artist Formally Known as Prince ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"The fuck? They forced a dude to move lockers for Taurean Prince? Taurean the definition of ""some guy"" Prince? I'd be upset too."
"During the Harden trade when the Cavs acquired Taurean Prince, they moved KPJ's locker to make room for him. That set him off. Kinda justified from KPJ, but he probably went way overboard to justify shipping him off"
Forgot Taurean Prince existed. Nice to see him out here still
"&gt; Who would‚Äôve thought we‚Äôd have a Taurean Prince game winner  I always believed.  If Prince has million number of fans i am one of them.  If Prince has ten fans i am one of them.  If Prince have only one fan and that is me.  If Prince has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth.  If world against Prince, i am against the world.  I love Prince till my last breath...  Die Hard fan of Prince, hit Like If you Think Prince Best player &amp; Smart In the world !"
"we'll give u malik beasley and taurean prince for ben simmons to help kick it off, we'll even throw in a second."
Who would‚Äôve thought we‚Äôd have a Taurean Prince game winner after all those heroics
Lol the worst part is getting beaten by Taurean fucking prince haha
Taurean Prince. Dudes making like 13m this year to come shoot 23% on threes for 13 minutes per game.  He‚Äôs the third highest paid player on the team.
Had no idea Taurean Prince is still out there getting run
Saw the Raps play the Hawks the last year Bud was the coach. Raps had essentially won but the Hawks were still (sorta) playing defense on a rookie Anunoby who had the ball.  Anunoby goes up for a dunk right before the game ends. Bud gets pissed because he thinks its unsportsmanlike and yells/says something to Anunoby.  Dwane Casey overhears it and freaks out at Bud to the point of screaming from across the court at him.  Totally meaningless regular season game   Also Taurean Prince was torching us to the point where I thought he was gonna develop into a star lol
"Oh yeah for sure thats an overpay. I think Wood is around Dlo value but on a better contract. Taurean Prince is a bum on the same contract, so yeah ya gotta give up something yk"
"Former Hawks:  PG: Dennis Schroeder  SG: Tim Hardaway Jr.  SF: Paul Millsap  PF: Mike Muscala  C: Al Horford  Bench: Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, DeAndre Bembry, Taurean Prince, Dwight Howard, Dewayne Dedmon  Thank goodness for Trae."
Y‚Äôall remember that video of Taurean Prince talking about how his team got out-rebounded when he was at Baylor?
"KAT gets doubled every time he‚Äôs in the post, so he‚Äôs forced to kick it out a lot. Unfortunately, a lot of the Wolves shooters have been horrible this year, and can‚Äôt take advantage. Beasley and Prince both shot 40% from 3 last year, but have been super cold. (Taurean Prince is 4 of 24 from 3 so far) The opposing defense barely guards half the team and just sinks in the paint to double or triple team him. KAT also slimmed down this offseason, so he‚Äôs been getting pushed out of position a ton. He‚Äôs really struggled against bigger, physical centers this year."
"Not a fan of that trade tbh, wolves be clowning trading him for taurean prince after that top tier olympic performance. Atleast trade  him for someone his level ffs."
Taurean Prince is on the Wolves? Jake Layman is still in the league? I obviously don‚Äôt watch enough Minnesota basketball‚Ä¶
"Gary Harris, Taurean Prince, etc.   Gotta hope the LeBron effect and moving from a struggling team to the Lakers will reinvigorate a cheap wing"
"Last year we had horrible injury luck. This year was going to be the ‚Äúmake or break‚Äù year. If there‚Äôs no progress, then we think about rebuilding around Ant. But it never made sense to rebuild last year or before this season was done, you‚Äôd have to really know nothing about the wolves to think that.  I still think this team potentially has good basketball ahead of them this season. Almost every game they‚Äôve lost has been very winnable, and they‚Äôve blown many large leads.   And obviously KAT is going to get dragged right now, but most nights he has not been the problem at all. Ant and Dlo have been much worse. Literally all of our players are shooting below their career averages. If Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince were shooting anywhere near their career averages on 3s, we would be okay.   KAT is getting traditionally good shooters pretty good shots, which they have been absolutely bricking."
"It's 2021, the NBA has been dominated by forwards for the last decade, and the forwards on that roster are Jaden McDaniels (pretty good defensively, but ultra raw on offense), Jarred Vanderbilt (great rebounder, has some talent, but a bench guy), Josh Okogie (really a guard, can defend, is abysmal on offense),Taurean Prince (is in the NBA because for some reasons NBA teams always assume a guy with dreads plays good defense) and Jake Layman (is in the NBA because he's white so people assume he's a shooter)  You don't win in the NBA with 0 quality forwards"
"I thought Taurean Prince was at least an OK 3-and-D guy, probably about worth his $13 million salary. But, uh, [ew](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/princta02.html) is all I can say. And this is a *contract year* for him. Amazing that we turned him, a second-rounder and cash into Spanish Jesus. Koby Roolz."
"League's beating down the door for Taurean ""23/17/63"" Prince."
I‚Äôm very confident that we can get something better than a Timberwolves 2nd and Taurean prince for Thad. And to be honest I‚Äôd rather have nothing than prince
I like taurean prince tbh. Or maybe I'm trippin cause he had a few games where he was good and I thought he'd be that forever
yeah i forgot you guys got richarsons contract. perfect trade filler. if eel like some guys literally have made millions off just being human trade filler. for example taurean prince is another.
"Yeah you can tell Rubio's IQ is rubbing off on Garland, he's a perfect player to learn how to run an offense from. The entire team seems to love Rubio and to think we got him for Taurean Prince. Such a good pick-up"
"Thank you, and you're 100% right.  We went 23-49, swapped Rubio and Juancho for PatBev and Taurean Prince, and everyone acted like we were suddenly a playoff team.   If we stay healthy and figure some stuff out, we should be able to hover around .500 and compete for a playoff spot, but it's still a deeply flawed roster."
"3 things I took away from this game.  1. The Wolves offense is a self-inflicted mess. They force a ton of bad shots early in the shot clock for no real reason, it also usually comes when they have the momentum, which is why the Wolves have had so much trouble closing out teams. As much as I love Ant, he‚Äôs been one of the biggest perpetrators of this. I know that he can explode at any minute, but he needs to recognize that we don‚Äôt need him to go nuclear all the time, in games where we have the lead there‚Äôs no real reason to force an off the dribble 3 5 seconds into the shot clock. Finch needs to get ahold on this because Ant isn‚Äôt the only one and it has plagued us throughout the start of this season.  2. In a game where Jordan McLaughlin was absolutely cooked and highlighted just how much we need Pat Bev and Dlo, Taurean Prince was still by far the worst player on the court. His shot isn‚Äôt falling, his defense is exposed by any player who has a semblance of athleticism, and the amount of miscommunications he has with a teammate that leads to a turnover is startlingly high for this early in the season. The +/- stats in this game now are a bit skewed because of the Magic‚Äôs late 4th quarter surge but when this game was close in the 3rd he was like a -15 or something.  3. The Wolves will probably be alright, they missed a ton of open looks tonight (and this season) that will start falling eventually, but for a team that is a fringe playoff contender losses like these will come back to hurt you later on in the season. Credit to the magic who played great (especially Cole and Franz) but Wolves were up 13 in the middle of the third quarter and should‚Äôve won this game. Finch needs to get a hold of this team because this is multiple games now where we‚Äôve thrown away a lead due to sloppy and erratic play."
wait they got Ricky Rubio for Taurean prince and 2nd round pick?  What the fuck???

Damn Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince for essentially a late first is a great haul for Cleveland.

This is a steal for Cleveland  Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince for a first? like shit
"I'm gonna focus on the Taurean Prince Redemption Arc.  And if 11 shows up to games I'll root for him too.  Anyone out there in a Nets uniform on the court has my support, til the end."
Man has been taking lessons from Taurean Prince
"Taurean Prince, Nene"
"His volume isn't league average so why are we holding his efficiency to the standards of average players like Taurean Prince, etc who can never put up his volume  What a flawed way of thinking. His efficiency isn't league average but neither is his volume."
pretty sure he did. like a minute after he correctly called him taurean prince
I thought they called Taurean Prince Demarre Carol
"I vehemently disagree. Webber's commentary is not only wrong multiple times a game, but he watches the replays and sticks with his original points.  I remember him calling Taurean Prince demarre Carroll. He called Kevin Durant Kevin garnett once (retired 2+ years at the time)."
"Could you imagine if Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince and Demarre Caroll were in the same game?"
Yesterday they called deandre Jordan Taurean Prince.
Webber called Taurean Prince Damare Carrol.  Then they had to say Taurean Prince like 5 times in the next 2 minutes and they hesitated saying his name each time. It was quite amusing.
Marv is getting worse... last nights Nets game he repeatedly called Chiozza Shamet and i think even confused Taurean Prince With DJ.
"Ahh that makes so much sense.  I had the game on but was doing something else and thought a couple times, ""Is that not Taurean Prince?"", but I couldn't be bothered with it in the moment."
Marv also kept calling DeAndre Jordan Taurean Prince
Not a great day for announcers considering Chris Webber probably still thinks Taurean Prince is DeMarre Carroll
"oh, lol.  Chris Webber kept calling Taurean Prince Demarre Carroll today.  It was pretty funny."
They already have Taurean Prince. Why trade for another of him?
Chris Webber keeps saying Taurean Prince is DeMarre Carroll
"take a shot everytime C-Web calls Taurean Prince, ""Carroll"""
Is Taurean Prince the Trae Young on Offensive fouls?
"Chris Webber just called Taurean Prince, Demare Carroll right?"
Did Chris Webber just call Taurean Prince Carrol?
"that's the worst call ever. also thats Taurean prince, this broadcast is so pathetic"
Some Albert/Webber to English translations:  Chris Chiozza = Landry Shamet  Tyrese Maxey = Shake Milton  Taurean Prince = Deandre Jordan
Marv is hilarious. Taurean Prince looks a lot like DeAndre Jordan wow
&gt; They do for someone who is entering the prime of his career and has consistently been a good spot up shooter. They don't for someone who's best days are behind him.  This would be true if it wasn't for the fact that Prince has actively regressed during his stint in Brooklyn. I am not all in on the Melo train but Taurean Prince is atrocious.
"I understand that but he can bring fire power off the bench, best to start levert at the 2 now since dinwiddie is gone, what you gonna have taurean prince as your 6th man leading the bench unit? Lmfao"
On both ends is just wrong.Melo is abysmal on defense that's a fact.But don't say bullshit like Taurean Prince is better offensively.
No he isn't. Taurean Prince is an average defender but an absolutely horrid offensive player. Shumpert in a SF's body...
Taurean Prince is better than Melo rn on both ends and I say that as a card carrying member of the Taurean Prince hater club
The best basketball comeback has to be taurean prince explaining how to rebound after they got out rebounded and upset by Yale
Ship taurean prince to the fuckin moon
Taurean Prince playing good basketball???? I must be dreaming
If you replace Bruce Brown and Taurean Prince with Bruce Bowen and Tayshaun Prince are the Nets favorites this year?
Taurean Prince
Taurean Prince pls
Can we amnesty Taurean Prince after this game?  DUDE IS TRASH.
I'd give up Taurean Prince and 2 second round picks for him
"I mean Dinwiddie himself lol he's expiring. But that would be a really cold move, the type people shit on Danny Ainge for. Not sure if Marks wants to go there.  Then there's Taurean Prince who would match salary. Issue is that he's not expiring and has 1 year and $13,000,000 left on his contract. The Nets would probably need to send a second rounder or two to compensate the Thunder for that. Then again the Thunder could flip Prince next season to a team looking to shed a longer contract, and get another first round pick in return."
"they have Dinwiddie's contract, also Taurean Prince."
