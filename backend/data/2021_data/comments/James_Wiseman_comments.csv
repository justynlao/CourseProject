James Wiseman thinks he can. But he can't
"Not as long as they keep James Wiseman. I don't think they can afford to wait for him to develop into a superstar, if he ever does, while also maximizing the years that Steph has left on this level. They'd need to get pretty desperate in order to do that with Klay's injury concerns."
"Warriors centers:  James Wiseman - Out with sprained wrist, at least 1 week  Kevon Looney - Out with sprained ankle, too soon to know how long  Marquese Chriss - Out with broken leg, rest of season  Alen Smailagić - [Out with meniscus tear,](https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/alen-smailagic-surgery-20210104) possibly back soon  Eric Paschall - Is 6'6""  Draymond Green - Is 6'6"""
Was James Wiseman undrafted by the NBA because he wasn’t drafted right after high school last year when he wasn’t eligible? It makes no sense to call someone undrafted when they weren’t even eligible to be drafted in the first place.
1. Anthony Edwards  2. James Wiseman  3. Lamelo Ball  4. Patrick Williams  5. Isaac Okoro  We're 20 games into these guys' career and none of them have looked like they don't belong. Wait at least a year before you try to bring up this discussion.
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
James Wiseman
The Bucks aren't any worse if you replace Giannis with Siakam. Lamelo Ball has peaked. Kemba is finished because of his knee. Timberwolves passed on generational talent in James Wiseman for a 6th man (Anthony Edwards). Sexton wins the MVP in this next 5 years. Luka is faaaaaaat. Ty Lue wins his second title.
Betting odds as of earlier this week   https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/nba-rookie-of-the-year-odds-update-lamelo-ball-tyrese-haliburton-james-wiseman-01ex0a09qq18
"I think this draft will be seen as one of the GOATs 5-10 years from now . I’ve been saying forever that Lamelo should’ve been seen as the generational talent and gotten the same hype as Zion or Luka. Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman are a teir or two below him, but they still have superstar potential. Up and down the draft are people who will have significant careers in the league"
"The top 3 guys look like they could be all stars. Anthony Edwards has been unsurprisingly inefficient from long distance but he's a great finisher that has the tools to also be a good defender. James Wiseman is already one of the most fluid 7 footers I've seen. Lamelo is a great passer already and seems to be gaining confidence as a scorer.  Tyrese Haliburton is great, too. The guy has so much poise for a rookie.  Okoro looks like a good defensive player already. Not the type of guy who gives you flashy defensive highlights but the guy who can contain scorers for long stretches.  PWill was definitely a project coming into the draft but he looks already like an NBA starter Sometimes he goes a little mental, though, and shoots ill advised contested middies. Quickley and Maxey deserve a shout out too because of surpassing expectations."

"Look at Ben Simmons, Magic Johnson or to an ever reaching extent, James Wiseman (if he ever goes the finesse center route and not the rim racking explosive route) When you tall, your court vision is exceptional and when you can make the right pass, you can exploit a lot of crevices the normal point guard may not see."
"No one mentioning James Wiseman, GS was ahead of the curve with the “death lineup” they could be doing it again with the resurgence of Bigs"
"&gt;Bradley Beal, Robin Lopez FOR Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, 1st Round pick  &gt;Beal, Moritz Wagner FOR James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota pick, 1 warriors pick  How the fuck are you equating these two deals, my god"
"&gt; James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota pick, 1 warriors pick  No way Warriors give up Wiggins, Wiseman, and the Minne pick. That would gut their franchise. I like the Bill Simmons idea, which is Wiseman, Oubre for salary matching, Minne pick, Warriors pick. That's 2 bonafide assets + another pick. Maybe the best the Wiz can get."

james wiseman
"Not watching the Lakers a lot this season, but during the game on the MLK day, Wiseman was on a fast break but committed an offensive foul against Marc Gasol which his fifth foul. During that play Lebron James ran behind Wiseman and pushed him into Marc Gasol then Wiseman fall onto Marc Gasol. This is not only dangerous for Wiseman but also for Gasol.  This is the play: https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=368&amp;GameID=0022000212&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Wiseman%20Offensive%20Charge%20Foul%20(P5.T2)%20(J.Goble)&amp;sct=plot"
"Penny helped pay for Wiseman to move to Memphis before 11th grade to play at his high school and AAU team. He had no intentions of coaching at Memphis at that time. He paid like 11,500 or something for moving fees. For whatever reason, the NCAA suspended James 12 games and said he had to pay the fine, which how is that even possible when he can’t make legal money according to them. He absolutely got fucked but he would’ve still been allowed back if he wanted"
"also interesting to note that James Wiseman takes 35.1% of the shots at the rim while shooting an incredible 82.0% there, but not sure if he will meet the volume minimum"
"James Airtime Wiseman; JAW on the floor, JAW snackin in crunchtime! So many good plays on that abbreviation"
"That guy didn't mention their ages at all, which was my main point. Most of Harden's best seasons are done, and if you buy him now you aren't getting any of that. All you're getting is 31+ year old James Harden, who could age like LeBron or he could age like Westbrook. There's significant risk on that end of the deal as well.  You can say ""there's no guarantee Wiseman will ever be great"" and it's true, but he's what? 20 years old? If he turns out to be an All-Star, you have maybe 10-14 years of elite performance. It's probably worth more than a short-term rental of a guy approaching the backslope of his athletic prime."
"I like this one, or James ""getting"" Wiseman"
"What? I don't understand, why wouldn't you trade Wiseman for James Harden?"
James Wiseman is legit
Don't forget James Wiseman!
"But LeBron James also might not do all star this year. We don't know. But saying he is is a pretty educated guess.   Wiseman is showing signs he is going to be a star. He might not be. He might. But around people who know a lot about NBA basketball, the consensus is that he is going to be a star."
James wiseman has 25 points and the scary thing is I think he can still do better!
Watching James Wiseman is hilarious.
I fucking love James Wiseman
James Wiseman seems like hes gonna major bigtime in this league soon
JAMES WISEMAN BABY
Ok i think ill make it home and start watching by the 3rd  damn oubre and james wiseman are ballin huh
"James ""Chris Bosh"" Wiseman"
"&gt; The value is only going to go up  I think its pretty obvious what I meant.   Me: ""James Wiseman is only going to get better from here.""  An idiot: ""You really think that James Wiseman is still gonna be in the nba when he is 90 years old?"""
"The coaching staff seems to be very clear that this will most definitely be a temporary change (Looney even told Wiseman as much himself); watching Looney play with the starters should give James a good idea about what he should/shouldn't be doing and will benefit his development. In addition, this should help Oubre and Wiggins get more comfortable in the starting unit and gives Wiseman a chance to play a larger role on offense."
"I'm just gonna throw this trade idea out there...  Warriors get: Bradley Beal, Thomas Bryant  Wizards get: James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minny's 2021 pick, and some other draft assets"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Ziaire Williams, Draymond Green, James Wiseman"
Seems fine. I don’t know why some Warriors fans are so upset with his messaging and rotations. Its lots of people expecting Kerr to treat this like win now mode while simultaneously starting James Wiseman and playing him meaningful minutes
Wiseman hits a nice jumper.  Draymond: NICE SHOT JAMES  **Ref blows all the whistles**
"&gt; If they did the top 5 picks would all turn into stars every year  They wouldn't, though.  The problem with top 5 picks is that they usually go to shit teams, who are shit because they have bad coaching and development and culture.  James Wiseman is looking really promising, but he came in super raw. Would he look as good if he were on a team that had the worst record in the league because they were *just that bad* instead of because they had two of their star players missing all or most of the season due to injury, and the third going full tank commander because the season was clearly fucked the second Steph's hand got broken?  Or would people look at his first handful of games, see that a dude who'd played three games since high school wasn't playing great NBA-level basketball, and call him a bust... including his coaching staff?  Wiseman's improving rapidly, but the Warriors have great coaching and he's playing alongside Draymond Green, who coaches him *on the floor*.  Look at how much better Wiggins is playing on the Warriors than the TWolves (although having said that, there's clearly a lot of reasons that the Wiggins-TWolves situation had gone toxic.)"
Can i introduce you to james wiseman? (I know its way too early to be saying this with any seriousness its just for shits)
James Wiseman better be David Robinson 2.0
He didn’t deserve to be ejected. But my problem was why did he have to yell at james wiseman like he sacrificed a small child.
"&gt;James Wiseman will never contribute to winning Basketball for the Warriors for the entirety of the Curry, Klay and Draymond era. You can take it to the bank.  I think he'll contribute next season plenty but I don't think he will be good soon enough for it to matter. He'll certainly win them games lol."
"Disagree, I think Draymond has been encouraging James Wiseman to take advantage of all the physical gifts and skills that he has. He hasn't berated him with insults or done anything to tear him down, but it's just a constant dialogue. Sometimes it comes out as ""hey, you need to shoot it more"" or ""don't let these guys take more shots than you"" other times it comes out as ""I think that you can take guy."" Two different deliveries but the message is the same really, he wants Wiseman to be aggressive because the talent is obviously there. Would rather have Dray, who has a high basketball IQ and tells it how he sees it, out there coaching him up through the growing pains than nobody doing it."

"pretty obvious Dray had some choice words for Wiseman, ref thought it was directed at him, and it’s not like “jk I was talking to James” would be an excuse any ref would buy. Unfortunate and definite reputation ejection"
"Wiseman had Noel sealed in the post, Green passed it in, but James either gave up or tried to fade to the corner right as Draymond let the ball go, and Nerlens got the easy steal."
Warriors probably aren't willing to give up Wiseman for anything.   He's the #1 priority for the franchise right now. James Wiseman's future is more of a priority than maximizing Curry and Draymond's present.
James Wiseman and Oubre let's say
"Tongue out dunking, scotch sippin, cigar smoking, gambling fiend scourge of the West, James Wiseman."
This James Wiseman kid might just be good at this basketball thing
"Unlike Jayson Tatum, James Wiseman is in fact only 19."
"I have seen the future, and its name is James Wiseman."
James Wiseman is the greatest hero in American history
"A further explanation I wrote for a deleted comment:  The bigger the number, the more free throws you attempt compared to how many field goals you have made.  For example James Harden attempted exactly 81 free throws and made 81 baskets so his ratio is 1. Trae young on the other hand shoots 3 free throws for every 2 shots he makes (1.5 ratio). James Wiseman shoots 1 free throw for every 2 shots he makes (0.5 ratio)."
"I mean, in the context of the play Green is talking about, it makes sense. KCP missed a 3 short, Dray got the rebound and was looking to push it to Wiseman to make a play. Wiseman probably easily could’ve beat Gasol in the open court or made the play to Wiggins who was in the corner. But Wiseman wasn’t looking for the ball right away, he was just jogging up court. Dray still threw the pass, which he probably shouldn’t have done since Wiseman wasn’t paying attention, but he was able to catch it at the last second. Just didn’t have the space from Gasol and he knocked the ball away.  Dray is telling James to always be aware of where the ball is and get into open space because he could’ve had Marc beat"
"They didn't purposely throw the season.   But at some level they definitely mortgaged Steph Curry's present for James Wiseman's future, by keeping Wiseman and keeping the Minny pick."
"Team: Dubs   Rookie: James Wiseman   How have they looked?  Pretty good so far.  Under the tutelage of Kerr and Draymond, I believe he will be a stud for us as early as next year."
James Wiseman. That is all.
"Unbelievable fourth quarter by Golden State. How they held off the Lakers in the fourth the way they did may be an anomaly, but it surely was impressive. Makes me want to think about how good this team would be with Klay Thompson in the lineup. I'm a big fan of James Wiseman as well, and I was surprised to see him on the bench at the end of the contest last night."
"James Wiseman, Justinian Jessup, Paschall. Warrior’s future looking good."
"I’m pretty sure they do it because Wiseman asks for it...  Penny on Wiseman: &gt; “James Wiseman is a kid that is a coach’s dream because he’s going to do exactly what you need him to do,” Hardaway said. “He’s the type of kid that puts his ego to the side and comes to you during practice (and asks), ‘what do I need to do better?’  “At every water break, he’s coming and asking that. After practice, (he says) ‘let’s work on my weaknesses.'”   Given that this is also a kid who decided to learn Mandarin because of the NBA’s relationship with China, I’m tempted to believe that Penny’s comments were genuine."
"I honestly think Wiseman is a major part of the problem on that starting unit. He makes insane plays on occasion, but he also turns the ball over often and gets into foul trouble early on. The team seems to do better when he’s on the bench.  Now that was to be expected. Dude played 3 games in the past year and is all of a sudden guarding Lebron James and AD. But i think Kerr needs to be smarter with Wiseman’s minutes. Maybe it’s time to have him run with the 2nd unit."
James Wiseman would have made that
James Wiseman would have made that
"I wanna see a James game winner. Not Lebron James, but James Wiseman"
james wiseman = sam bowie  lamelo ball = michael jordan
james wiseman is the warriors' sam bowie and lamelo is their mj
"James ""foul 'he's 19' trouble"" Wiseman"
What an atrocious game for James Wiseman. More fouls and turnovers EACH (5) than points (4) and rebounds (3)
"James ""foul trouble"" Wiseman"
James Wiseman only played 3 college games
James Wiseman.
why does james wiseman fumble every rebound lol
"I think you can get these young pieces and some picks from their teams for Simmons today  Fox, LaMelo, Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, JJJ (maybe), Ayton. I dont think any of their teams is giving them up for 2 years of James Harden"
"It was [homework that Penny Hardaway gave him](https://theathletic.com/2297714/2021/01/06/warriors-james-wiseman-penny-hardaway/):  &gt;Hardaway used to give him assignments at Memphis East.  &gt;“Go watch David Robinson, come back and tell me what you saw,” Hardaway said. “Go watch Shaq. Go watch Hakeem Olajuwon. Go watch Chris Bosh. Go watch Kevin Garnett. Go watch Bill Russell. Go watch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. What made them? How did they set screens? How did they rim run? I used to challenge him.”  &gt;Wiseman would surf YouTube and return the next day for an extended conversation on the lessons learned. He then went to the University of Memphis, where Hardaway had moved on to coach, to begin his hopeful path toward the realm of those legendary centers.  On another note, I think Kerr is still friends with David Robinson as well, so maybe that's a phone call that could be made, although I'm not sure how well his game would translate."
"You know what? I hope james wiseman becomes a superstar soon cuz youre cool, dude."

All I know is if James Wiseman can get half the whistles that AD does then the rookie gonna end up being a top 10 guy in the league for sure.
"relative to expectations yes but in the grade scheme of things no. Lots of these guys are high floor/low ceiling types. So like Tyrese Haliburton, LaMelo Ball, and even James Wiseman are all guys who will realistically peak at a sub-all star level."
Both players are pretty athletic and big for their position. Ceiling-wise I'd give it to Lamelo since he seems to have great innate basketball instincts. I think that's what ultimately separates the superstars from the All-Stars.  On the other hand James Wiseman probably has the simpler path to becoming an effective player.
I don’t see much difference between LaMelo and Michael Carter Williams except for his fan club. Sorry it’s James Wiseman.
James Wiseman.
1. DeAndre Ayton  2. Bam Adabeyo  3. James Wiseman  4. Mitchell Robinson  5. Jarrett Allen  6. Wendall Carter  *Onyeka Okongwu( Way to early to tell)
"My list on *expected whole career value*, but disagreements welcome:  1. Bam Adebeyo 2. DeAndre Ayton (but not currently this high) 3. Jarrett Allen 4. James Wiseman (too early to really know but his flashes are balanced by his decision making) 5. Wendall Carter Jr 6. Onyeka Okongwu (too early to really know) 7. Mitchell Robinson (I'm kind of low on him and think he's already peaked)"
Bam head and shoulders above the rest not counting James   Still too early to make an assessment on Wiseman

James Wiseman is gonna be scary in a few years.
james wiseman is big as hell no pause
"I disagree with that.   The reason being that NFL draft picks are players who are 3 years removed from high school. They are grown men. They have proven themselves in college football.  NBA has some guys who played a few games of college ball (James Wiseman), some guys who played overseas in leagues of varying quality, some guys who just wait a year after high school.  Also you are drafting 19 year olds who need years to develop. In the NFL pretty much every draft there are multiple QBs who are franchise QBs right away."
"Ben Simmons with less picks would have been a great package, he’s a proven star and #1 pick  A trade for CJ, who Imo is better than oladipo to pair James Harden with Lillard  A trade for Anthony Edwards, to team James Harden with KAT and DLO. Minnesota is desperate to win something, and there’s no guarantee any of those draft picks are a #1 pick and Anthony Edwards has looked good  James Wiseman maybe, with Wiggins or Oubre or Draymond. Gives Curry help and Harden might fit well in the Warriors offense  Clippers for Paul George  Nuggets maybe for Harris, Michael Porter JR, some other players  Bucks for Middleton and some picks  They’re other trades they could have pursued Celtics Jaylen Brown, Raptors Siakam,   It’s not 2K and I’m not a GM and I don’t know of any of these salaries match but they’re ideas. Oladipo is a great player but I think the players I listed above are better and Oladipo has been dealing with a lot of injury issues the past few seasons"
"Yeah I mean his name is James Wiseman, how is he not getting this?"
"Let's get one thing clear: I am a stan for James Wiseman and James Wiseman alone.      Having said that, I'm gonna have to bail. Sorry I have a different opinion than you, and enjoy the rest of your day."
"It can definitely bridge the gap. I mean James Harden just went for picks and Caris LeVert lol.  So sure it would take Wiseman, the 4th pick, and possibly some other picks/players but those two assets would be the highlights of the trade package."
"They can flip Wiseman and/or the Minny pick.   But I think they think Wiseman is the next David Robinson, and so it's worth trading Steph Curry's present for James Wiseman's future."
I’m 90% sure that the warriors will not trade steph curry and James wiseman for terry rozier and Cody zeller
It will definitely haunt the wolves but I'm happy with James Wiseman and I'm sure other warriors fans are just as happy as I am
"Don't worry, in only 10 years we'll be able to determine if he's more promising than James Wiseman"
I mean... he a rookie... the same thing happens to Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman
Actually I'd love to see Shaq as a position coach to a guy like James Wiseman
Y’all really trying to make James Wiseman respond to “Big Jim” lmao.

"James ""The"" Wiseman"
"James ""Sun Tzu"" Wiseman"
"My guy... do you not understand that for a sign and trade to work BOTH sides have to approve of it? Not Kawhi and the Warriors, *the Clippers* and the Warriors. And since the Warriors are literally $80M into the luxury tax they can't sign Kawhi outright. So, contrary to a scenario where Kawhi would want to join the Hornets really really badly and Kawhi could leave for his preferred destination at a moment's notice forcing the Clippers would have to accept anything they can get before Kawhi leaves for nothing, the Clippers don't have to accept the Warriors' scraps in this deal.  In fact, the moment Kawhi's preferred destination is a place without the cap space to sign him that'll immediately drive the asking price up for that team, gives the Clippers more leverage, and lowers it for all the other teams forcing the destination to give up even more for him.   If Kawhi says ""I want to sign with the Warriors and no one else"" and they don't have the cap space to do so the asking price becomes Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, the Minnesota pick, every other pick from then to 2026, and pick swaps. Unless Kawhi is suddenly okay with taking a 1yr/$868K deal lol  *""This superstar wants to play with you and no one else so either you pay the superstar price or he's gonna be forced to re-sign with us or go play somewhere that has no realistic chance of winning a championship.""*"
"To be fair that's what a lot of people (including me) thought in this past draft. The Warriors FO doesn't often get the chance to draft a top fifteen pick, and they really crave it. The last top 15 picks they used since 2009 netted them James Wiseman, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, Epke Udoh (hard miss), and Stephen Curry. They haven't missed much in the last eleven years when given a good chance."
The Warriors throwing bad passes to James Wiseman is now officially my new favorite NBA running gag.
"I post about this a lot but I'll say it again: Chris Bosh decided to learn Spanish because fuck it, hired a tutor and everything. This was during his NBA career. Based on what I've heard from him, dude seems like an actual intellectual. One of my favorite players  James Wiseman also knows Chinese and I will always root for him cause of that. I want to learn Chinese too"
"Imagine old man Curry, Klay, Draymond playing alongside James Wiseman and a lottery pick."
"i don't buy that ""longest leash in the league"" bullshit narrative. he gets really unfavorable calls and actually gets techs for chirping. he got T'd up a couple weeks ago for coaching james wiseman. i could list over a dozen players who bitch at refs all game and rarely receive techs."
Lebron is now 0-2 in his career against Precious Achuiwa and James Wiseman. Clearly doesn’t have what it takes to defeat the Memphis rookies

"At an individual level I would look at the style of play that Harden was playing through. This was before Dantoni turned James into a full time point guard but Harden’s usage rate was 31.3% where Curry at that time was at a 29% rate. Harden led the Rockets in scoring at 27 a game as well as led the team in assists at 7 a game. Harden’s second best player (a post back injury Dwight Howard) missed half the season and only averaged 29 minute a game when in. Harden had to deal with a multitude of different starting lineups due to injuries to Dwight, Terrence Jones, Ariza, and Beverly, that resulted in 6 different lineups just within the first 13 games. The Rockets still had a 10-3 record to start the year and the only player who was available for all those games was Harden. Within that same 13 game stretch, the warriors had the same lineup for all but 1 game where Harrison Barnes was out. Harden had to deal with a multitude of injuries to his support throughout the entire season where the starting 5 for the warriors were all together for at least 67 games of the season (Bogut missing the most time of the 5).  Harden was working with guys like Kostas Pap, Donatas Montejunas, Isaiah Cannan, Joey Dorsey and Correy Brewer for 50+ games and still somehow managed to crack 56 wins and a second seed.   The Warriors were awful last year but we can’t look past the moves that we’re made that makes this team better than last year’s. A 19 point game scorer last year in Kelly Oubre, a decent back up point in brad Wanamaker (which I know he’s been bad to start the year but he was solid in Boston), a rookie in wiseman that has added spark when playing, Kent Bazemors who adds outside shooting and versatility along the wing, and of course another year of development for guys like Paschel, Lee, and JT that have all looked better this season.   Curry is still dealing with a mid level team and I have no doubt they’ll be top 4 in the west next year with Klay back but to act like Curry is dealing with one of the worst teams or situations is going a little OD."

James Wiseman
"&gt; let's all take note that there's a big difference between shopping a player and actually trading him. Let me state that again: This is not a blanket recommendation to move James Wiseman. His future already looks fascinating. But that fascination is surely shared around the league, and it might be regarded as more valuable by teams with less win-now intentions and more patience than the Warriors. He has flashed some high-level potential but also proved he's rough around the ages. That should be expected, since he's still a teenager, but that's one of the reasons there was so much speculation on whether the Warriors might move the No. 2 pick they eventually spent on Wiseman. Golden State needs to know what the market would bear for the young big man, especially if the plan is to go championship chasing with a (hopefully) healthy Thompson next season. If Golden State wants to add another impact piece to that collection, Wiseman might be the necessary trade chip to bring one back."
2017 Warriors with 2027 James Wiseman at Center
I mean you you are talking about a universal top 3 nba player who hasn’t slowed production. It’s a pretty shitty take by you to think that the former finals champion and finals mvp wouldn’t do better. It’s guarded by the warriors fans on that platform who tried to convince me that James Wiseman was the next Giannis
"Steph being MVP or not this year literally was decided by James Wiseman not quite being NBA ready. If Wiseman would have come into the league as an impact player (not even a star, just positive impact), Curry would be running away with mvp."
Pat Riley: “We got James Wiseman”  Jimmy: “Cool”  Pat Riley: “Heres your plane ticket to San Francisco”
A lot in the sub were saying he’s so much better than James Wiseman. Where are those people now? Still playing 2K?
"They were talking about James Wiseman. He doesn't actually rap in Mandarin lol, but he does speak fluent Mandarin and also has some decent songs on SoundCloud."
I believe they were talking about James Wiseman
James Wiseman the producer?!?!
"Lacob, Hire this man to train James wiseman"
"That has nothing to do with this thread. This thread is saying Steph playing with Wiggins (55.6 TS%), Wiseman (54.8 TS%), Oubre (50.2 TS%), and Draymond (42.7 TS%) is the equivalent to when James Harden had to play with Chris Paul (60.4 TS%), Trevor Ariza (56.7 TS%), Ryan Anderson (59.2 TS%), and Clint Capela (65.0 TS%), with Eric Gordon (57.8 TS%) off the bench."
&gt;The Bradley Beal speculation doesn't make sense. Beal doesn't make the warriors a finals team. James Wiseman two years from now might.  Warriors lmaooooooooooooooooooo
Wiseman just got hurt. He was benched 3 weeks ago.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30779123/golden-state-warriors-shake-starting-lineup-bench-james-wiseman-kevon-looney
"&gt; Yes, it's still early, but it's still safe to say that Ball should've been drafted No. 1 overall, and it shouldn't have been particularly close. That's not a knock on Anthony Edwards or James Wiseman who are having solid rookie campaigns, but what Ball has been doing this season is ridiculous. What's even more ridiculous is he's been doing most of his damage off the bench, as it wasn't until the past two weeks that he got pushed into the starting lineup due to injuries. In the six games he's started, he's averaging over 21 points a game, six assists and five boards.   I haven’t caught too many Hornets games but he seems to be doing really well."
A ton of analysts viewed Wiseman or Anthony Edwards as the #1 also.  https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-draft-2020-mock-draft--who-will-be-the-no-1-overall-pick-anthony-edwards-lamelo-ball-james-wiseman/fzjr07j7twd5190ibt14yhz4g
"Dipo wasn’t the player he became after playing with the Thunder yet. He even said himself that playing with Westbrook slowed him how to lead a team, hence the all-NBA season in 2017-18. Steven Adams is one of the most overrated player in the league, and he couldn’t do a damn thing without Russ setting him up other than offensive rebounding. And Andre Roberson? Really? You just listed three players that couldn’t create offence to save their lives at the time. Just look at what happened to their leads whenever Russ went to the bench, especially in the playoffs. Grant and Sabonis were both rookies, so I don’t even see the point of mentioning them considering they barely played and weren’t good yet. Mentioning them would be like me saying a few years from now that the 2021 Warriors were actually really good other than Steph since they have James Wiseman. Peak Kanter means practically nothing, dude couldn’t guard a cardboard cutout and once again, couldn’t create his own offence without Westbrook.   I never once said that Russ was better than Curry from an efficiency standpoint. But Russ outplayed him in pretty much every other area of the game.   And like I said, Sabonis and Oladipo would both later go on to credit Russ for helping them improve. Besides, if the offence was “all about Russ” and if he didn’t raise his teammates when he was on the Thunder, tell me why almost every player he ever played with had their best (or at least one of their best) seasons playing beside him? Paul George looked like an MVP candidate for the first (and only) time in his career. Ibaka is a better offensive player now, but he probably peaked with the Thunder since his defence was so game changing. KD was the runner up MVP like three times playing beside Russ, and then won his only award in 2013-14. You said yourself that Kanter and Adams peaked beside him. He also made half that awful roster look like semi-capable NBA players, and now those players are completely out of the league. I don’t think most of this Warriors roster will be out of the league in just a few years. Shit, even James Harden had a monster season last year and Bradley Beal is also playing his best ball right now."
James Wiseman better be David Robinson 2.0
He's okay in isolation but doesn't contribute winning ball. Steph even said james has a chance to watch the team play with moving the ball. Wiseman takes too many shots and destroys rhythm
Cuz James Wiseman is gonna be spooky.
"Lamelo ball wasnt projected to go number 2, the warrior needed a more nba ready player and that was Wiseman. The warriors already had a pg in curry and lamelo ball shouldn't be played as a wing he has the size but hes best utilized as a pg. Also the warriors were in deep need of a center james Wiseman filled that role."
"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
James Wiseman was born 3 years before the last episode of Friends aired. Good God.
James wiseman liked that
Yeah I mean they were literally the worst in the league last year lmao and all that they really added was Kelly Oubrick and a rookie James Wiseman who plays like 20 minutes per game
Nah. James Wiseman like a young Kevin Garnett without the intense drive to be great yet. Skilled big men like Wiseman are rare. They had no choice.
"Does KG see something in Willie Cauley-Stein that the rest of us don't? Or is he just saying, Willie Cauley-Stein could use some help?  &gt; **I know that since retiring, you’ve trained a few younger players. Who do you see now and think you could help his game?** A lot of big men. James Wiseman. Joel Embiid. Jokic. Willie Cauley-Stein. Marvin Bagley up in Sacramento"
James wiseman is the youngest wym
"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players — and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  “It’s hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,” said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  “It is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I’m going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,” Ms. Hassam said. “Americans looking to profit off China’s market find themselves in a much more challenging place.”       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade’s Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  “By speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,” Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.’s biggest stars, is known as “China Klay” to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand’s social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to “commit genocide and crimes against humanity” in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.’s reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey’s message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.’s partnership with China was “complicated,” but that “doesn’t mean we don’t speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.”  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D’Angelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  “My decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it’s not just one way of doing things,” Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell’s contract in November 2019. “I had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.”"
I would like to introduce james wiseman to you
Did James Wiseman not leave you a tip when you delivered a pizza to him or something? Never got why some people constantly bring up the same guy.
Gimme this guy over James Wiseman honestly
"I think the idea is you trade Wiseman and picks (Minny pick?) for an established (possibly disgruntled) star.  Hell, throw in some future picks way off in the distance to acquire an older disgruntled star, and the other team hopes you suck 3 or so years later - see James Harden (altho in this case probably not someone quite on Harden's level)."
"Tier 1: Jokic, Embiid   Tier 2: Gobert, KAT, Vucevic, Bam  Tier 3: Ayton, Nurkic, Capela  Tier 4: Turner, Drummond, Adams, Carter Jr  Tier 5: Pretty much everyone else   Tier 6: Deandre Jordan, James Wiseman"
James Earl Wiseman
"Do you want to know who are the guys which are even below Deni in this  VORP rank?  I will give you several names: Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, Isaac Okoro  Patrick Williams, Killian Hayes aren't much higher than Avdija.  Basically all top-10 selected rookies playing big enough minutes per game except Lamelo...  Yes... send them all to G-League"
Just wanted to point out that James Wiseman has been “in his 20’s” for only 8 days.  A bit misleading to phrase it like that.
I don't care what anyone says KD is the best player in basketball when healthy. He took the throne once he joined GSW.  Players around the league seem to respect him more than LeBron. Look at all the players demanding to join him on the buyout market. Harden joined him.  James Wiseman said KD is his mentor.    KD runs the league now.
James Wiseman is gonna to take a fantastic leap after the offseason and will come out proving everyone wrong.
James ~~Wiseman~~ Earl Jones
"S-Kerr: ""What is James Wiseman's identity? It's not defense. He's not great in transition. He's not exceptionally great in the halfcourt when it comes to execution of the game, even though he has an amazing coach and players. You gotta have an identity as a player. James Wiseman doesn't have one."""
James wiseman will become an all star by 23
James Wiseman will be modern day version of Darko Milicic. Only difference is that Wiseman wont luck his way into fluky rings
"&gt; Lmao ok James Wiseman is better than lamelo.   Again, not what I said. Not what we are talking about. It's nothing. The best you can offer, is nothing."
"Lmao ok James Wiseman is better than lamelo. Despite everything that says otherwise...literally everything. Ball came here dominated his rookie class just like all the players that got drafted from pro leagues that blazed that trail for him. Wait I'm sorry he didn't outplay his rookie class, he was just further along in his development. I can't wait until Marvin bagley shows the world that he should have been picked over Luka. He just needed to catch up on his development bc he didn't have the luxury of playing pro ball...he was stuck at Duke like a bum"
"Golden State's salary structure is so bad that the trading Wiseman for a Star talk really doesn't make sense because they would have to move the Andrew Wiggins contract and it would probably cost them an additional asset or two to move it given the salary compared to the play. Just do the mirror test: if you are a Golden State fan, are you really letting go of Steph Curry for James Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins at 60 million over 2 years? Chances are you're not, which means that a hypothetical trade for Karl Anthony towns or kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal probably ain't happening with the assets the warriors have available.   If the warriors get Thompson back healthy, there's a good chance that they can be a competitive team again and if they can't get him back healthy, there's a good chance that they aren't going to be a competitive team again and that's relatively independent of other factors.  The best case scenario for them is that the Minnesota pick conveys to them and then they get Klay back next year and can make a run with their big three while developing their younger players in meaningful games."
Well yeah. You can't compare luka's pro career with ball's. Luka was getting mvps while ball was taken back to the states bc he wasn't getting minutes. He then played his senior season against people ages 16-21 in the jba. Its a ridiculous argument anyway. Euro players never came into the league with an edge on their college counterparts. And to say that lamelo ball was only better this year than James Wiseman is because he played a year of pro ball over seas is even more ridiculous. I can't tell if your trolling or you're related to Wiseman lol
That’s exactly what James Wiseman would say...🧐
"I'm pretty sure this is James Wiseman's franchise now. Joe Lacob has given up on Steph's prime.   If anything, they trade Steph to build around Wiseman. That's the path Joe Lacob has set them on."
I don’t believe you. Only James Wiseman would keep a bit about random redditors being James Wiseman going this long
My first guess would be Kerr because James Wiseman is on the Warriors chief

James Wiseman without post up isos and functioning in the PNR while being active on the glass is the truth
james wiseman threads
"James Wiseman sucks at basketball. I wish I could use a time machine to swap him out for 25 year old, better developed Wiseman"
The Lakers made the strategic decision to not have James Wiseman on the roster.
Did James Wiseman write this?
"[FIRST PARAGRAPH] (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31200849/steve-kerr-force-issue-warriors-rookie-james-wiseman-development) idk how you missed it what you quoted is just right after it lmao, said all that yet bench him over for missing a COVID test &amp; drops like 14 pts in the 4th against the clippers in garbage time lol."
"I blame Joe Lacob, he really wanted James Wiseman and ignored or didn’t even see the red flags. He saw all these teams with elite centers and wanted one for his team, even if he couldn’t play."
Yeah these guys definitely compound each other’s issues. Seeing their chemistry really made me understand why Wiggins is for sure the starter next year if Oubre resigns. Wiggins always looks for Wiseman on a drive.  I just want to caveat that James and Oubre have a different kind of bad BBIQ. Wiseman just needs more experience. Oubre can be pretty selfish and gets tunnel vision.  I’d be sad to see Oubre go though. He’s an exciting player to watch and if he hasn’t figured out to play Warrior’s basketball at least Steph and Draymond have figured out how to use him. I do think Oubre has been improving but his chemistry with Wiseman is definitely the farthest behind. Which is understandable since Kerr had kept them as far away as possible from each other until Wiseman became a starter.
"If LaMelo will only ever be Ben Simmons without defense, that’s still better than being Hasheem Thabeet 2.0 a la James Wiseman lol"
"You hear that Magic Fans? In 3 years, you could have James Wiseman! All you need to do is give up your franchise player, and you will get an underwhelming big man and a washed big contract wing"
"When he was drafted by the warriors. It’s unfortunate, but steph curry doesn’t have time to wait 5-6 years for James wiseman to become good"
"Wiseman is in a bad place. There are some actual warriors podcasts that cover this topic with the grace and insight it deserves (the light years podcast for one.. or locked on warriors).   The consensus I’ve seen is that yes he is worse BUT it’s because of the coaching staff and Steve Kerr completely flubbing his development and using archaic coaching methods to punish rather than promote. I.e. his confidence and his mental state have taken massive hits since his first game over and over from the warriors and Steve Kerr and they’ve done nothing to help that...  He missed a Covid test because he was with his mom and forgot? Yeah Kerr goes public and passive aggressively pulls him from the starting lineup and only plays him in garbage time...  He needs development and they say they want to do that??? Yeah they yo-yo his minutes and pull him out when he is finally starting to get something going...  The warriors aren’t helping wiseman in the least when he is their 2nd overall pick and they should be either:  Trading his ass in a package to get steph some help  OR  devoting this entire season to developing him properly  I vote on the former but the reality is that they are doing neither.  Pisses me off for both the warriors, steph AND James wiseman... no one is winning...  Especially James wiseman. I thought he was going to be one of the best players in the draft and is definitely the most physically and athletically talented.. to see that squandered and his mental state to deteriorate over the year and effect his play it hurts man.  Lamelo is out there loving the game. Ant clearly has fun. Wiseman hates his life on the court."
"&gt; If the Warriors want to compete for a championship with Stephen Curry in his prime, they will trade James Wiseman this offseason.   Who could you trade Wiseman for that makes this roster a contender? You could trade him for Giannis, and that's still not a Top 2-3 team in the western conference."
You think those guys have careers on most other teams? You think guys like Jordan bell and james micheal macadoo would be good on other teams? Theres no real evidence to suggest kerr cant develop talent. They have never had any high level prospects. Wiggins and wiseman are the most notable. And wiggins is playing a lot better in GSW
"I’m old. I’ve watched pro sports my entire life. Different sports in different cultures. Seen lots of teenage rookies. Watched lots of players lose their cool and get emotional. I have never seen a player sulk and swing their head down around their chest, constantly, the way James Wiseman does. I have honestly never seen it."
I’m assuming they are referencing how the media always talks about how James Wiseman is learning to speak Mandarin Chinese
This man hates James Wiseman
"I think he should be traded too just because it would be better for both sides, but about the advanced stats, they are discouraging but you need to look at things from a simple view as well, Wiseman in his rookie year has averaged more points than Kwame Brown did in his entire career and almost matches him in his best season in rebounds, the comparison may be made but James Wiseman is not Kwame Brown"
James Wiseman doesnt have confidence to say something like that.
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."

2011: Yi Jianlian or Hasheem Thabeet?  2021: Aleksej Pokusevski or James Wiseman?
"It was James Wiseman, he said it in Mandarin"
"They are both elite big men who can hit three/mid range shots to space the floor. They are great FT shooters as well for their size.       Tough to compare their full career given their growth as players combined with injuries, but took from their 3rd year onward:       Jokic 52/36/84, 20/11/7/1.3stl/0.7blk  KP 44/36/80, 21/8/1.5/0.7/2.1blk       I love Jokic and think hes an incredible player who should be the front runner for MVP, but in this comparison, there are only 4 teams.  When the other centers are Enes Kanter &amp;Nurkic (who combined for 54 threes in their career) and rookie James Wiseman, i would put KP closer to the Jokic side of that spectrum (and even this isnt meant as a knock on these players, its simply talented veteran bigs who can space the floor that are focal points of their teams vs bigs who serve more as roleplayers)"
James Wiseman lol
James Wiseman is a bust halfway through his first season
James Wiseman my absolute goodness
James Wiseman will take this crown despite all the ridicule
"If it's a lot worse than expected, people expected too much. There was very little college tape, but his one game against Oregon was really not promising. I had him rated as a second round pick, and here was my scouting report:  &gt;James Wiseman is bad at basketball. While he only played two games, he showed terrible hands and no basketball skills. He’s a future rim runner/rim protector, and if and when he reaches a point where he belongs on an NBA floor, the NBA is likely to have already reached a point where that role doesn’t exist anymore. Draft him hoping that rule changes curtail 3P shooting?  The problem here is twofold. One is that Wiseman, himself, is terrible at basketball. The second is that, even if Wiseman was good at basketball, he's still ultimately a center, and unless you are Embiid/Jokic/Davis level, there's very little value in centers. And Wiseman is not and never was anywhere near Embiid or Davis level as a prospect.  Like, being honest, what's the best case scenario here? Barring a miracle, it's something like in a few years, he turns into a Drummond level player, a guy who puts up a lot of empty numbers while playing poorly and hurting his team because of his inability to do the little things necessary as a center. So not only do you waste the last few years of Curry, the payoff is a big fart noise. Maybe an outside chance of reaching Ayton level, a guy who is so completely neutral he makes absolutely no impact on the success or failure of his team. And the much more likely scenario is that Wiseman's flaws are too great to ever be more than a backup.  Fans and analysts are far too slow to adjust expectations for ""top prospects"". Just look at your roster for two guys who never deserved to get drafted where they did, and who still have ""potential"" despite being 25 years old already. Don't get your hopes up for Wiseman."
Almost like   1. Guards develop slower than bugs because they physicality  2. Lamelo has been a pro since he was 16 while James Wiseman played 3 games in college
"Jordan Poole like like he will be a legit scoring guard off the bench.   Warriors haven't started 10 players in five years either...  2015 was Looney with the 30th, he worked himself into a reliable rotation player.  2016 was Damian Jones, a raw, athletic center prone to fouling. Probably won't be in the league much longer.  2018 was Jacob Evans with the 28th pick, he never worked out.   2019 was Eric Paschall, someone who may not quite fit this roster but was a steal with the 41st pick and was all rookie first team.  That year was also when they selected Jordan Poole who looks like he will be a legit player. 28th pick.  Then of course 2020's #2, James Wiseman, who isn't very good but as a young, raw big man that's kind of expected. I believe he will be a great player.  They only had late 2nd round picks that year but Mannion already has given some ball handler minutes off the bench and Justinian Jessup is doing well in Australia.  It's rare to draft great players when you draft really low and expect for 2020 the Warriors have drafted really low. Despite that I think they've done well.  Also while Curry was a gift from the departing ownership/Larry Riley it was the new ownership and front office who drafted with better picks. Who did they select?  Klay Thompson with the 11th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th, Draymond Green with the 35th and Festus Ezeli with the 30th.  Stacked up against any other team during the last ten years I think the Warriors have drafted much better than average."
Tank commander James Wiseman is trying his hardest
Someone get James Wiseman in here
"Prior to the season starting there were posts about how rookies were going to get ripped apart unfairly this season because of their lack of prep time/training camps/NBA practice. I think James Wiseman is probably experiencing the bulk of that criticism. I think he would've benefited the most from a legitimate training camp and lots of practice time with the Warriors.  I kinda think for James Wiseman, it would be best to save judgement/assessments until after next offseason. A shitload of game tape + practice + Draymond screeching at him for a couple months in practice could do him a lot of good."
James Wiseman. (Yes worse than Wanamaker)
"Plot Twist, he is James wiseman"
"James Wiseman is a bonafide scrub.  He can’t play. No disrespect whatsoever, but I’m sorry to tell everybody the truth, the man cannot play the game of basketball. He has small hands, he can’t catch the ball, he has bad feet, he can’t really move even though he’s mobile, doesn’t really know what he’s doing, doesn’t have a post move that he or he puts to memory that he can do two times in a row.  He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn’t have the heart, the passion or anything that comes with it..."
"If I am picking top 3, why would I pick a guy that isn't a top 3 prospect? I am trying to pick stars.  Giannis as a prospect wasn't that good, wasn't even in top league in Greece. If Giannis was picked third, he wouldve struggled because  he would've been tasked with creating his own offense due to playing on a completely dysfunctional team.  Giannis development was standard for a guy who is a late lottery pick and has NBA skills. Most of development came when his body started changing and the ball was put in his hands. If anything, the Thunder who had the 12th pick should've drafted Giannis because they had the talent to take the risk of him flamming out. They drafted Steven Adam who had zero skills besides being big and strong. What's the difference between an unskilled 7 footer and a raw big wing with some guard skills?  Thinking raw players like Giannis will turn into MVP like players if you just put the time in is what leads teams to picking someone like Dragan Bender 4th and Bender actually played in a top European league, albeit off the bench. Suns could've had Jamal Murray, a guy that demonstrated he was clutch and capable of scoring at will in college.  I am taking that Jamal over some 7 footer that supposedly dribble and shoot but rarely get minutes.  My mentality is what leads the Warriors to pick LaMelo or Hali over James Wiseman. Lol, I would've even picked Patrick Williams over Wiseman if I wanted a project player. At least he plays the 3/4 wing, most important position in the NBA."
"Giannis was a #15 pick and was a wiry strong physically underdeveloped 6'9 player, playing on some no name team in Greece. He wasn't a known entity like Jahlil Okafor or KAT.  Bucks picking Giannis and Giannis being MVP was luck on the Bucks end. Hardwork and God Given talent on Giannis end.  At best Giannis was supposed to be like Nicholas Batum or Toronto TMac,  a big do it all wing that could help a contending team. Giannis developed fast given he his experience level. His first year he stood in the corner  and ran the floor. By his second year he was a starter, by his third year he broke out. That's a normal trajectory for a non-top 3 pick that isn't expected to be a star.  Giannis always had motor, instincts and athleticism with guard like fluidity in a big body. He never looked completely lost. James Wiseman looks like he doesn't even belong on the floor. You don't want your number 2 pick being the worst player in the league.  James Wiseman is the 2nd worst offensive player on the Warriors. Only Brad Wanamaker is worse and Wanamaker is a 31 year old Gleague caliber player that only shoots 3 and drive right.  James Wiseman looks terrible."
I don’t blame him. That entire locker room should be revolting against a FO/coaching staff with the balls to start James Wiseman every night. At least Oubre suited up for the game. Draymond gave up just from having to warm up on the same court as Wiseman.
I think it's safe to say that 19-year old rookie James Wiseman is not as good as 24-year old rookie David Robinson.
"Idk, getting DLo and then flipping him for Wiggins has been a really solid move. James Wiseman is young but skilled and could have amazing potential, and they got a bit unlucky with the injury bug. I wouldn’t rule out them making one move to put them closer to contention next year. They went to like 5 finals in a row, they were due for some rest."
James Wiseman bullied him in highschool
"Nah, maybe it’s just me but I wouldn’t give up Wiseman and the Minny pick for Brogdon and Myles Turner. We’re getting a stretch 5 who if his shots don’t fall he is an offensive liability and a guard who looks like a Walmart version of Manu.   You have to understand that the Warriors could’ve offered a trade package better than any team that big for James Harden, Wiggins+Wiseman+Wolves Pick+3 1st Rounders beats any team in the league in terms of package. So ideally what the Warriors need to get is at the very minimum a multiple-time All-Star that can shoot if they want to give up on Wiseman and are willing to add in more."
Tank commander James Wiseman to you
WHY DOES WISEMAN THINK HES JAMES HARDEN? WTF
James Wiseman has looked horrific tonight. Like a bay deer learning to walk.
james wiseman is ass
This was a really mean thing to do to James Wiseman.
"How do you know they will have at least 2 top 3-5 picks? Can you tell me if I’m going to win the lottery? Seems like you’re assuming there’s 100% that the Nets will have a terrible record, and the pick will hit 1-5 with the new lottery odds.   And probably the most laughable thing you assume is a 50% chance that a single top 5 pick will be better than Ben Simmons? That would essentially mean that you think Simmons is the average top 5 pick, which is just hilarious. The top 5 picks from the last 2 drafts were Zion, Jah Morant, RJ Barrett, DeAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Isaac Okoro. The only guys that have even shown the potential to be better than Simmons are Zion, Jah, and LaMelo (3/10)"
James ~~Wiseman~~ to the rescue
"https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2020/12/08/james-wiseman-draymond-green-coronavirus/amp/  and if you watch Wiseman, it is very clear that he gets fatigued after extended stings. He currently has an issue with maintaining a consistent motor. That is NOT solved by playing more."
"I believed Lamelo would be a Jamal Crawford type of player at best. Right now he is Pistol Pete ish. An exciting player.  I don't know what the hell people saw in James Wiseman besides height and athleticism.  Seriously, what in the world has he ever displayed beside a shaky jump shot and dribbling drills?  Big Men are like running backs, unless they are Hall of Famers, they are not worth anything.  6'6 and up players that can shoot, dribble and pass, even if they are borderline all-stars, are worth more than some time runner.  Big Men aren't worth top 5 picks 9/10 times."
Just because teams were built to help harden doesn’t mean it actually helped him. Dwight missed 41 games in 2015 and Harden carried scrubs and has beens to the 2nd seed. Harden led a Rockets team to the 3rd seed with Eric Gordon as his second best offensive weapon. Difference between Harden and Curry is that James can play heavy minutes and impacts the game in more ways then just scoring. The Warriors run limited action with Curry as a facilitator and ultimately I feel that limits the offense. A pick and roll game with Wiseman would look nice but they hardly ever run plays for that
"Tbh Wiggins would be great as a 3rd option. If you replaced Kelly Oubre with a healthy Klay Thompson the spacing alone would completely transform the Warriors offense.  The other issues though are their bench depth, a reliable sixth man scorer, and growing pains with James Wiseman."
April fools! It’s actually James Wiseman
Beach volleyball aka James Wiseman trying to grab a rebound
"1)What surprised me the most was how raw James Wiseman is. Still has great potential.  2) Steph letting it fly and dropping multiple 50 pts games. I also love the defense when we are focused. Poutine Pippen has been pretty good. Looney has got to be one of the most mentally solid player I've seen around this year.  3) Our consistent inconsistency. Wiseman being raw. The injuries. The lack of focus and the poor spacing. Klay Thompson not playing. Paschall having a sophomore down year, and at times, Oubre. Finally, Wannamaker.  4) Hoping to finally see some wins with our schedule being easier.  5) Wiseman and Nico have been pretty alright. Both need to work. Waiting on Jessup who will play next year."
i wonder what James Wiseman was doing at 17. he's truly come a long way
James Wiseman is going to be really good. If he can defend without fouling he’s already a net positive.
Was that in the playoffs? Did the warriors actually go small ball? Gobert cooking 19 year old James wiseman isn’t any indication for a playoff series.
Give us the Wiseman stat line  4 blocks from the best James in the league
That’s with 8 minutes of James Wiseman out there  DEVELOPMENT
"2 Titles in 8 years. I want our two titles to be the next season and the season after giving the Big 3 and specifically Steph their final rings and second repeat. The next 6 years will be a mix of reloading and retooling, as James Wiseman improves and takes us progressively from 8th seed to 2nd round, to conference finals, to finals and by then we have prime Wise with 6 years of rebuilding for a great roster."
"The point is that because James Wiseman is the sole reason the Warriors aren't a super team, he is forbidden from ever making any jokes about the Brooklyn Nets. OBVIOUSLY, JESUS FUCKING CHRISt, do you even logic bro?"
If we are calling early bust James Wiseman has looked bad
I thought this was a joke name for James Wiseman.
James Wiseman is the black Shaquille O'Neal
Are you trying to tell me James Wiseman isn't lefty Shaq? I can barely tell the difference when he's on the floor
"I think Wiseman has been getting a bad run. What we all need to remember is that he is on a great team with a top coach and the greatest shooter of all time. Kerr can pull James when he wants to, play him situationally and not feed him bad shots. Right now Kerr has a chance to build him from scratch since he is so young and does not really have bad habits yet."
"Lebron has guys like Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, Dennis Schroder, Gasol, and even Matthews is decent   Green has Kelly Oubre, Andrew wiggins, Steph Curry, James Wiseman etc.   One team has much better defensive personnel than the other."

"after watching other top lottery bigs like Jaren Jackson Jr and James Wiseman miss time with prolonged lower body injuries, maybe his finesse style of play is a good thing for his long term health?"
James Wiseman
"If James Wiseman ends up having a better NBA career than LaMelo Ball (freak injuries nonwithstanding) I will eat my hat. Everyone gives Wiseman a lot of leeway right now, which is fine because he is barely 20 years old. But LaMelo isn't even 20 yet and he's *already an above-average NBA starter*. He's also one of the top 10 passers in the NBA, again as a 19 year old rookie. For Wiseman to catch LaMelo at this point would require an absurd, MIP-level developmental leap from JW that is at this point based on nothing."
Steph Curry would not want that trade you Laker fans are ACTING up lol  Covington for James Wiseman are you crazy?
"Yeah, looks like they're willing to sacrifice Steph Curry's present for James Wiseman's future.   James Wiseman better be the next David Robinson."
"James Wiseman is 20 years old and his potential ceiling is ridiculous, i dont see the warriors not seeing the end of his rookie contract at least"
"I mean, considering LeBron on his own is arguably the GOAT...I'd say giving him the positive traits of all-time scorer James Harden and also James Wiseman removes the ""arguably""."
James (Lebron/Harden/Wiseman) is arguably the goat.
"Jordan Bell played three years in college. James Wiseman played three games. Plus, Bell was playing alongside KD, Klay, and Andre.  He also definitely did not look like a starting big lol. He had a couple good games."
Would you trade Christian Wood for our James Wiseman?
This headline kinda sucks.   Warriors look to Rudy Gobert’s development as model for James Wiseman
James Wiseman
"As a Warriors fan, without James Wiseman, their height will become a problem, unless Steve Kerr has something up his sleeve that would work for 1 game."
"Oubre likely isn't going to sign with the Pacers. Also if that Minny pick ends up being #4 or #5 in this draft it's worth a lot more than Myles Turner.  Oubre S&amp;T to a third team of his preference for a 2nd round pick and TPE   TPE, James Wiseman, GSW pick for Myles Turner and TJ Warren"
Same.  Cries in Klay Thompson  Cries in James Wiseman  Cries in Kelly Oubre
Lmao and James Wiseman is just Kwame Brown
"Thank you so much!  That’s really encouraging to hear. I want Ayton to succeed even if he is in the same division. I like his game a lot and I love that bigs are still getting taken early. That’s really impressive he’s there in that second tier of defensive bigs.   I feel like Ayton’s the only big that we in the Bay can really use to track James Wiseman’s developmental path except James’ second year will probably look like Ayton’s first year since he missed college. Because KAT was kind of amazing off the bat, Embiid was hurt for two years, Bam’s an undersized playmaker, and Jokic is the polar opposite of Wiseman.  Do you think Ayton will make an all defensive team in the next few years and will he be a 25/12 guy?"
James Wiseman.
"I think James wisemans underdevelopment is all Steve Kerr's fault. Wiseman has a lack of experience but Kerr punishes him when he makes mistakes, how else is he supposed to learn? Also I think the argument that he costs them games is futile because the chances of warriors sniffing the wcf is a pipe dream. Who cares if you guys are losing games, if you developed Wiseman well this year he could have been a great piece for a championship run next year and further into the future.   Also I think Steph is easily the best PG ever  I believe LeBron is by far the goat"
James Wiseman pretty easily
Nah James wiseman
I mean he literally ended james wiseman career
"A lot of trade ideas I've had involve the Pacers, I agree they're the team in that sweet spot of having good assets but needing to blow it up. We'd have to break it up into multiple deals for the S&amp;T to work, but an overall deal like this would be great:   Warriors get:   * TJ McConnell  * Caris LeVert  * Myles Turner  Pacers get:   * Kelly Oubre  * James Wiseman  * Jordan Poole  * Minny 1st   That seems like a fair exchange of value. Pacers get a great pick, a promising young guard, and a blue chip Center prospect, plus a reliable wing. Warriors get a starting C and two fantastic bench guards. Caris becomes sixth man, TJ becomes the bench PG we desperately need.   Curry/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Turner, TJ/Caris/Juan/Paschall/Looney - I really like this rotation for the Warriors. Good mix of pieces that fit well together. Bench could use more shooting, but with Curry/Klay/Wiggins working in with them, it should work.   Brogdon/Lamb/Oubre/Warren/Sabonis, Poole/Holiday/McDermott/[draft pick]/Wiseman   Pacers get younger, gain draft capital, and still have a competitive team."
"Nuggets for sure have a more balanced squad. Dray is really good, but the Warriors kind of fall off a cliff after that (Wiggins has been okay too). The Warriors also spent most of the season starting James Wiseman, who has been one of the biggest net negatives in the league this season, and they've been playing much better since he's been out.  I think Jokic is having a better season than Steph, but I don't think Steph is *that* far behind, and there's an obvious gap between their supporting casts."
Warriors fans how much is James Wiseman and the Minny pick worth if you guys keep it? Could you guys bundle that for a star that could contribute right now to help Steph spend the last few years of his prime contend and would you?
"Yep, replace KAT with James Wiseman.  I'm sure that'll do Ant a lot of good"
"Yeah he got no minutes or a chance to do anything he was good at, and then he did and clearly showed to be one of the better rookies in the NBA and won a prestigious award, so you should put him on the list. Compared to James wiseman who has zero good months, did nothing, and got injured."
James Wiseman per 36: 19/10/1 on 52% shooting. Not the greatest numbers but he was still productive while clearly being misused in a role in Kerr’s system. This sub’s fascination with proclaiming him as a bust brings out one of the worst things about r/nba.   &gt;This is why you never draft project big men in the lottery  I can understand criticizing the Warriors for taking him because they’re in more of a win-now timeline but this take is just ridiculous. I don’t think the sixers regret taking Embiid.
James Wiseman is a 20 year old rookie  Shut the fuck up
"I just don't see it, and I hope you're right!   James honestly looks like he just started playing *organized* basketball a year ago. The decision-making in the half court as well as trying to playing any assemblance of defense, it honestly seems like his agent was being driven through the city one day on his way to a client meeting, and at a stoplight out of the corner of his eye saw this physically gifted 7-foot adonis freak of nature dunking on everyone and splashing threes in a playground pickup game. Had his driver pull the limo over and approached the kid, whose backstory was that he works 3 jobs to support his family and never had time to join the high school basketball team. ""Hey kid, how about playing NBA basketball for the Warriors next year? Don't worry about your family, when I'm done they'll all be living in penthouses [points up at the tallest building off in the distance]."" Basically, that one scene in The Mighty Ducks, or common scenario in any other of those clíché but awesome sports flicks, that is literally impossible in this day and age.  In reality, Wiseman has been a part of countless invite-only sponsored top prospect camps, the US National Youth Teams, despite only three games of college. I understood he'd be raw, and factored in the narrative that big men take longer to get a feel for the NBA, but he still looks ""2 years from being 2 years away."" Steph will be 47 by then.  Again, I 100% hope you and others who see this unmatched potential in the kid are absolutely right!"
"Kevin Love, James Wiseman, and Andre Drummond come to mind"
James Wiseman or Kelly Oubre
Are we just forgetting that you guys have a developing James Wiseman? Sure he didn't have a great rookie year but he's still a 2nd overall pick.
Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman at #2 and Saddiq is a stud
Andrew Wiggins + James Wiseman for KP + ... Josh Richardson? The money works.
"Wiggins was also a member of team DespiteTheLoss until we traded for him. Maybe Sabonis could make things work in yellow and blue...  James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre Jr, Minny 1st, another 1st?"
Yeah but James Wiseman was supposed to be HoF-worthy by now
"I mean shit, it might be James Wiseman too if we throwing names out there, let alone Ayton"
"Don’t worry, I’m in 2026 in MyLeague on 2K and James Wiseman is a 25/11 all-star for GS. LaMelo is also an all-star, but he signed in Miami, and we all know 2K is accurate, so you win in the end."
20 year old James Wiseman is on that program LMFAO
James Wiseman is (20) is older than JT (19)
Their *premium* asset is James Wiseman.   The Wolves pick we don't really know until the digital ping pong balls take their bounces.
"End point is absolutely true, but Jokic is basically the most extreme example of an elite player being passed over in NBA draft history.  You've got Warriors flair so you should probably remember that there was a lot of presumption that Fuller was a bad pick. Yet another stubborn insistence on drafting presumed best big man available.   Before Fuller at #11, the Warriors had picked:  * Tyrone Hill at #11. * Chris Gatling at #16 and Victor Alexander at #17.  * Cliff Rozier at #16.  And even Joe Smith at #1 was a bad use of the #1.   And it didn't stop with Fuller, because then there was..  * Adonal Foyle at #8. * Antawn Jamison at #4 (in exchange for Vince Carter at #5). * Andris Biedrins at #11. * Ike Diogu at #9. * Patrick O'Bryant at #9. * Anthony Randolph at #14. * Ekpe Udoh at #6.  Shit, going further back in history, the Warriors and drafting big men is just fraught with lulz:  * Chris Washburn at #3 in 1986. * Russell Cross at #6 in 1983.  The one time in the past 50 years that they actually drafted the best true big available was way back in 1976. And then they quickly fucked that up in spectacular fashion, trading Chief *and the pick that became Kevin McHale*...for Joe Barry Carroll.  Expand definition of ""drafted"" and ""true big"" so that we include them getting Chris Webber...and we know how that went.  And now we have this whole anxiety over James Wiseman. I'm not worried. I think Wiseman will pan out to be a star.  But keep in mind that I tried to be optimistic about Todd Fuller, too."
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.   Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining. If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
The James Wiseman situation?
"My understanding/memory of it, and something like this: the  player with the most hype going for the high school class  was  supposed to be James wiseman who didn’t play a lot with the ncaa.   Lamelo wasn’t taken seriously pre-growth spurt, and we still didn’t know how much of a serious prospect he was, especially considering the possible supposed  media circus.  Haliburton was kinda an advanced stats/coach’s favorite player  type, but he was also polarizing.   Anthony edwards was basically the safest dice roll at the end of the day.  I was a huge fan of Vassell personally."
Damn they went hard asf on James Wiseman
"I looked for you hoping to find what you reference, but somehow you guys didn’t make the cut over James Wiseman being terrible and the Bulls trading for Vuc only to get worse."
The only team there is the blazers it’s mostly just complaining about stupid shit like how we can’t watch the nets big three or the pelicans defense or James wiseman
His name is James Wiseman
James Wiseman
considering how much the warriors struggled today it makes me wonder. is James wiseman the mvp?
Who woulda thought that James wiseman was a bust
"Or James Wiseman ""The Big Ticket"". Why are they stealing KGs nickname?"
I still can’t believe James Wiseman tried to steal The Big Ticket
Warriors to sacrifice James Wiseman for healthy Klay Thompson
"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"
Andrew Wiggins James Wiseman
He’s awful right now. I don’t get why people think they can get a star for him.  Nobody is trading their star player for James fucking Wiseman
"Embiid is traded to Golden State for James Wiseman, filler and the Minny pick, after which fans riot and drive the Sixers out of town, resulting in the team moving to Seattle."
Dude just say you hate James Wiseman
bro just say you hate james wiseman no need for the pleasantries
Undrafted Draymond's son already has higher BBIQ than James Wiseman.
I mean you say that now. But look at the tools he has and how many players in the NBA are late bloomers. James Wiseman is going to be really fucking good one day. He just doesn't match with our timeline.
"Gentle reminder that the Warriors are missing: Klay Thompson, Marquese Chriss, James Wiseman, Eric Paschall, Kent Bazemore and Damion Lee."
We can send you one James Wiseman for him
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
Thought this was james wiseman highlights in low quality for a second /s
James Monteinez Wiseman
"James Wiseman has played at most a total of thirty games because of injury and suspension the last two years. He had a wrist fracture and meniscus injuries in a shortened season. He has played basketball for maybe four or five years. He had a hard time catching the 🏀. Golden State knew he was a long-term project, and drafted him anyway.   With all these things, if the number one pick isn't the Rookie of the Year, I would be disappointed if I was Minnesota. Anthony Edwards is a fully developed man with some basketball skills. The difference between playing forty and eighty games with the most skilled players in the world, there will be a learning curve for all rookies. Not everyone can dominate the first year like Micheal Jordan did.  If Wiseman hasn't developed a zero +-  player rating by the third year, I would be disappointed if I were the Warriors."
James wiseman is considered a bad pick because LaMelo and Halliburton are clearly better and would’ve filled a immediate need.   Him being bad at winning basketball for the moment is just icing on the cake.
"great work. Rudy is lowkey my favorite defender in the league (after Dray). His teammates just have to protect the perimeter, cause its sure as heck that no one is going to the rim. He is the perfect example of what our rookie James Wiseman need to learn from. Although he does have good lateral quickness, Gobert seems to not play guard-style defense in a 1v1 on the perimeter (unlike Wiseman). Rudy even lets his defender beat him, just to recover and block him in a crazy fashion. His timing is perfect. As a defensive purist, it is incredibly good to see. Reminds me of how the spurs used to push the offense towards Duncan who would just eat everything thrown at him.  Gobert is also a very underrated defender on the perimeter: Sure as OP said, a guy Steph will make him look ike a fool at times by crossing him around the 3 point line and making a contested shot (he does this to majority of the league lol), but don't think Rudy will be afraid of stepping up. I've seen him contest and even block Steph's all time quick release (*cough cough\* Embiid)*.  If I'd give anybody consideration for MVP, it's gotta be Gobert. I hope they go deep in the playoffs: if defense wins championship, it's time they unleash Rudy and win it all. My fellow frenchie is a baller and I wish him the best. ""Vas-y Rudy !"""
"So Kelly oubre, Draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kevon looney, Jordan Poole and James wiseman are all suddenly g-leaguers? I'll give you Jordan pool, Kevon looney and James wiseman playing like dog shit but the other 3? C'mon.   And Andre Robertson is as g-leaguer as you can get. That season was 5v4 at all times because he literally can't shoot. He made it up with his defense but like....wow his offense sucked."
"if Steph and Klay are healthy they have a great chance. that's the two greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen. they always have a chance. James Wiseman and Jordan Poole should be much improved as well, not saying they're gonna be all-stars but they should be solid contributors. Andrew Wiggins is much better suited to being a third option, and Kelly Oubre is much better suited to a 6th man role if they decide to resign him. the Dubs 2nd round pick from this year Justinian Jessup is doing really well in the Australian league averaging 15 ppg and shooting 40% from 3 on high volume, he'll be coming over next season and could be a decent bench player.   all that said the Dubs can potentially have two lottery picks to add to the bench as well. if they added a backup wing and backup pg in the lotto like Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell they could have a deep bench."
"i mean you think isaiah stewart is worse than james wiseman so you've never watched basketball in your life. Edwards' numbers last few months have been around LeVert/Grant/Hayward level which is just about top 65 range.  Thank you for your consistently awful takes presented so confidently/rudely in the sub. Really makes it fun for ppl to have low hanging fruit to refute  ps: qualification-dropping isn't very sneaky, just silly. he's averaging 23.6 since the break. at no point did I argue anything about the first half of the season, where he wasn't playing good."
"Exactly. You get me. Not saying you absolutely must bow to my logic, but I think it's fair to say people shouldn't act like giving the MVP to a lower seeded player is insane. I mean, if the Warriors were in the East, are they the 5-6 seed? Isn't it weird that we're saying that one of the best players ever at his absolute peak (or quite near it) with almost no offensive help should have NO CHANCE to win MVP because of a few wins? This isn't some upcoming hotshot with an untested style of play. This is a proven champion. It's very, very rare to have a player of this caliber on a team this mediocre and ill-fitting, especially when they had James Wiseman as their starting center. Even LeBron struggled with the Lakers a few years ago and they were arguably better than this squad.   I will say that watching Steph this year has made me appreciate WB's 2016-17 campaign more. I'm kind of infamous among my friends for being a Westbrook hater, and I'd agree with that. In 16-17, I dismissed his insane clutch record too quickly. That team's final record made me do a double take when I checked it the other night. That's like a 3 seed in the East in any given year. They won so many close games because of his heroics. It's hard to win when you have such an ill-fitting team and a coach that doesn't really know what he's doing half the time.   Funnily enough, even after all that thinking and complaining and typing, I'd say Jokic is probably still the MVP. The 9 extra games in this crazy season is absolutely critical. Either he has to miss time or Steph has to make this stretch last another three weeks to really give him a chance. I'm just that kind of loser who likes to make sure we aren't prematurely throwing out arguments based on social convention.   Thanks for listening and being patient with me &lt;3"
"I watched Kevon Looney play his 1 year at UCLA.  I thought he was a lottery pick after that season.  Kevon Looney was a McDonald's All-American coming out of High School and a five star recruit.  He was one of the top 12 players in his High School class.    I remember watching the 2015 draft, the warriors are on the clock at pick #30, and honestly, I didn't even think about drafting Looney there.  Why?  I was certain he had been taken by someone at least 15 picks ago.  The warriors took him.    Then, we found out why he was available at the last pick of the first round: the medical evaluations had found hip issues.  He would probably need surgery.  He played a bit his rookie year, before having surgery and being shut down.    Hip issues followed him into year 2.  Kevon Looney was a bust.  A 30th overall pick who had barely played at all through 2 full seasons due to hip issues that meant he was never healthy.  If you look at pictures of him in year 2, he put on a lot of weight over that offseason; hip injuries, not being able to work, and adding weight due to bad eating habits.    He came into year 3, and people were calling for his head.  He looked well below average the first month of that third season, but he played some.  The warriors wanted him on the court to figure out if they would pick up his fourth year option.  They didn't see enough, and they declined the option.  It was worth $2.3 million.    Looney had a decent year 3, and he got better as the year wore on.  His defense and high basketball IQ proved pivotal in the WCF against Houston.  I remember thinking Looney was gone as a free agent that offseason, declining the option year was a bad move for the warriors.  Looney re-signed with the warriors, 1 year, $1.7 million.  The warriors declining his option saved them $600k.  I didn't understand why no one else offered him more.    After year 4, where he broke a bone in the NBA finals because Kawhi Leonrad rammed into him, missed 1 finals game, and then came back and played with a broken collarbone, I was impressed.  When the KD-Dlo sign-and-trade went through, I felt sure Looney would be lost in free agency as a result of the hard cap.  Surprising, he re-signed with the warriors again, at 3 years / $15 million.  I still didn't get it.    That's two times I thought he was gone, but that he came back.  Kevon Looney made one of the hardest mental leaps there is to make: he was a High School and college star, who transitioned into an NBA role player.  He also just turned 25 years old 2 months ago.  He has two championship rings in his career already, and he was a high level role player on the 2018 title squad.    In the playoffs, rotations shrink to a team's top 8 players, there's a lot to be said for knowing that Kevon Looney can be one of those 8 players on a title winning team.    It's also a cautionary tale for James Wiseman.  Wiseman's rookie year was much, much better than Looney's in the sense that Wiseman actually played as a rookie.  Most of Looney's first two and a half seasons were wiped out by injuries.  The warriors stood by him, and never gave up on him, and when he could have left as a free agent, more than once, he always came back.  Wiseman might not get it together right away, and it might take some time, but he is immensely talented.  People on reddit were calling for Looney's roster spot literally for years, and now, he's a foundational part of the organization.  He's so damned useful that re-signing him has to be the top free agent priority for the dubs this offseason.  You lose Kevon Looney and the instant you do, you begin the search for someone else just like him.    Don't give up on young players so fast.  When it comes to players on rookie scale deals, I'd rather give up a year too late, than a year too early."
"&gt;**The roster changed.** Unless you think adding Curry is what changed the 26th best defense into the 7th best defense?  It's more so that they quit tanking and, as such, Kerr started holding the team accountable on that end again. After all, Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, and a rookie James Wiseman—their only new starters from the get-go—aren't known as elite defenders. :P"
ya but james wiseman should be in there
"Eric Snow was never a scorer, he was a great defender. The entire Cavs was built around as a defensive core around LeBron, they were ranked 14th in the NBA in defense rating.   &gt; THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN  Lmao at a Cavs fan calling Draymond the best defender in history in 2021, yall weren't saying shit when you begged for his suspension in game 5 and said it made no differene. Wiggins was RoY and still plays like a rookie. Wiseman has the worst net rating of any starter in the NBA and you're selling the shit out of everyone else.   &gt; Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.    Seriously? What shit are you smoking because none of those guys except Bazemore are even NBA ready players.   &gt; Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   Look at starting lineups not involving Wiseman and Steph's on/off is in reality more like +15.   &gt; LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   We still looking at BPM and VORP in 2021? It's a box based stat that awards people who fill out the box stats, it literally measures defense as an accumulation of steals, blocks, and rebounds and thinks Westbrook is a historically good defender.   Also funny how that works doesn't it, LeBron finished 4th in the weak Eastern conference and came 2nd in mvp voting."
"That roster was better IMHO, Warriors' has the best second fiddle but overall the construction is a fucking mess when you consider how long Steph played with James Wiseman, arguably the worst player in the NBA this year, in a starting role. The fact we have Smailagic tho is OP."
"larry hughes got hurt and played 30 games, calling Z an all-star in the center depleted eastern conference is just malpractice, Brad Miller was an all star that year too, eric snow was 34 years old in 2006 averaging 4.0(!) ppg as a starter, and drew gooden is the epitome of replacement level big   THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN, oubre who just scored 20 a game last year, eric paschal who was first team rookie last year, and kevon looney has minutes as a starter in the NBA finals  really, Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.   warriors have other guys averaging 18.5, 15.2, 1..7, and 10.2    Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   curry really isn’t even close"
"uh... yeah. that's the problem. running a high-IQ motion offense with a bunch of BBIQ morons and a rookie big man who looks completely overwhelmed. Fit your system to your personnel. It doesn't take 60 games. In fact, he's been blasted non-stop all year for not developing players by insisting they play completely differently. He wanted James Wiseman to be Bogut ffs."
He just would deserve it. Give this man a fucking team a pls GSW front office ship as far as possible shitty Kelly Oubre and James Wiseman 🙏🙏 Steph need smarter teammates there is no coincidence that with a benched/absent Oubre and without Wiseman he literally exploded.
Difference between the second and third best players on the team and James Wiseman.
"Honestly I'm on the KP is not a good fit for us train but if you think the minny pick and Wiggins are better than KP in your tiiiny ass chip window, well then I have a James Wiseman for you to draft over Lamelo lol. You guys have 3 years tops before a total retool, I hope you don't waste it like we wasted the end of Dirk's career."
No I would try to trade SGA for whatever pick golden state gets and James Wiseman.  Go Sixers full tank.  Only chance.  And if I was Presti I would pull a John Paxson and resign for the good of the team.   The only team in the league that has gotten worse every year the past 10 years.
"I think James Wiseman will be the best of three. He's only played twenty games in the last three seasons, he has the most potential."
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."
"&gt;Kobe put up one of the best offensive seasons in history, all while earning 1st Team All Defense honors.  In 2006, Kobe wasnt locking down anyone on a nightly basis. He was playing free safety and conserving his energy for offense.   It was smart too, because a) he was playing 41 MPG and setting a new league record for usage rate; and B) he was transcendent. The best offensive player of 2006, and the best offensive season of his career. But it wasn’t on Steph’s level.  So, I got some stats.  ###2006 Kobe vs 2021 Steph  ||PTS/100|r/TS%|BPM|ORPM|OEPM|ORAPTOR| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |2006 Kobe|45.6|+2.3|7.6|+6.5 (1st)|+6.8 (1st)|6.7 (1st)| |2021 Steph|42.9|+9.3|8.3|+10.5 (1st)|+7.4 (1st)|+8.8 (2nd)|  I used PTS/100 to normalize for pace and r/TS to compare each to their peers, not each other.  I gathered a mix of box score (BPM), +\- (RPM), and all-in-one (EPM, RAPTOR) analytics. I put league ranking next to some of the numbers, to illustrate that these really are two dominant offensive seasons.  The only place where Kobe has a (slight) advantage is raw points. And Kobe’s +2.7 points/100 possessions comes at the expense of roughly *9 more shooting possessions.*   If all this is a lot of advanced stats for you, here’s some old-school numbers: Steph also is dishing out more APG(6.0 to 4.5) and even *grabbing more rebounds (5.6 to 5.3)* than 2006 Kobe.   Kobe’s only offensive advantage is his scoring, and once you look into the numbers at all, it’s pretty easy to debunk that too.  ### Kobe vs Perimeter Shaq  Kobe fans will rightly push back against claims Kobe was “inefficient” by pointing out his TS% was always good for his era.  This is true. It was not, however, good compared to the other best scorers of all time. This is true for his career, and it was true in 2006.   * Of the 47 qualifying players who scored at least 15 ppg in 2006, Kobe’s TS efficiency ranked 25th. Not bad, but among scorers, basically right in the middle. For comparison, 25th in 2021 would be someone like Luka or Beal.  * Of the 63 qualifying 15ppg players in 2021, Steph ranks first. There is no 2006 comparison, because Steph’s combination of volume and efficiency is only matched by peak Shaq and Durant.   This is tough for some people to accept, but peak Steph is simply a better scorer than Kobe. And not just because he’s better at threes. He also scores more efficiently in the midrange. He finishes at the hoop better.  ||0-3 Feet|3-10 Feet|10-16 Feet|16-23 Feet|3PT| :-:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |2006 Kobe|.598|.494|..455|.421|.347| |2021 Steph|.655|.568|.532|.486|.427|  This isn't as fair as the previous chart, but it's fairer than leaking your accuser's name into the press to force her into a settlement. Point is, there is *no place* on the court where 2021 Steph doesn’t have—at least—a 5 percentage point efficiency advantage over 2006 Kobe Bryant.  And then from three, it's immense.   The scoring efficiency isn't a gimmick, or era-dependent--Steph is just better.  ### All-Time Carry Jobs  &gt;If you think Steph's 2021 team is worse than Kobe's 2006 team, then you don't know basketball in the slightest. That is comically way off.  I probably overstated my case here a bit. I do agree that Kobe's 2006 team had less talent. The Warriors problem, otoh, was that they refused to put their best lineups on the court. For both the Lakers and 2021 Warriors, the worst player on the roster was a teenage big man. Andrew Bynum played 7 mpg, entirely off the bench. James Wiseman played 25 MPG, the vast majority of it with the starters, like an anchor around the neck of the offense.   Steph Curry lineups are over *17 points better* per 100 without Wiseman on the court. And yet he was starting for the majority of the season. Kobe had worse talent, but he also wasnt forced to carry Andrew Bynum. The end result, is roughly the same:   * 2021 Warriors W/o Steph: 102.2 Off Rating (30th, -10 rORTG), -8.9 Net   * 2006 Lakers W/o Kobe: 90.9 Off Rating (30th, -15.3 rORTG), -8.7 Net   These are both pretty terrible teams without their best player. Finally, we can look at who is carrying harder.  ||BPM|MPG|Games Missed|VoRP (projected)|Non-Kobe/Steph Team VoRP|Total VoRP Share (Hard-carry %)| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |2006 Kobe|7.6|41|2|8|5.4|60%| |2021 Steph|8.3|34|8*|6.1 (projected)|1.8 (projected)|77%|  Here you do see one huge, inarguable advantage for Kobe. Workload and durability. Steph may be more productive *when he plays*, but 2006 Kobe was an iron man, playing 80 out of 82 games and at a minutes-load that would make Thibs proud. But Steph's missed games have the opposite effect that one might expect: instead of reducing his share of VoRP, everyone is useless without him and it widens the gap.  Despite playing less games and less minutes, Steph has a significantly higher % of his team's total VoRP--77% to 60%.  Kobe at least had Lamar Odom, whose 3.9 VoRP is more than double what all non-Steph Warriors would project to have, combined, over an 82 game season.  60% of your team's VoRP is still an incredibly high number. 77% is astronomical.   The 77% hard carry share should decrease now that they're no longer playing wiseman, but even with regression it's still going to add up to one of the all-time carry-jobs.  #### Closing Paragraph  &gt;If Kobe didn't win MVP during the 2005-2006 year, carrying a g-league squad to a 45-37 record while putting up 35.4/5.5/4.5, then curry has even less of a claim to the MVP.  I was annoyed at this post indicating that there was no comparison between 2006 Kobe and 2021 Steph. I think I've pretty clearly laid out that there are a *lot* of comparisons, and they both go into the pantheon of all-time great player/bad team seasons. Not MVP seasons, because again, it's Nash and Jokic"
"For me I've always thought of him as underrated even though he is very highly regarded. I looked at all the advanced stats that showed his insane on/off impact metrics and they were just mind-blowing. That, in addition to the eye test, which shows me this guy obviously makes shots and does things that nobody else can do.     To me, he is the best player in the league right now, and has been second only to Lebron James for his career. I was a little worried with how he would play coming into this season but he's surpassed mine and everyone else's expectations as he's often one to do. Anyone that's watched the warriors this season knows they would be absolutely trash if it wasn't for Steph. Probably the worst shooting team in the league with low IQ players like Oubre Wiggins and Wiseman and Draymond being absolutely void as a scoring threat.     It seemed like everyone picked Durant as the consensus player on that Warriors team but I always disagreed. Durant played amazing in their playoff runs but he benefited from the spacing A LOT and was playing Richard Jefferson 1 on 1. Meanwhile we saw what happened when Durant went up against an injured Steph head to head. Yet the talking heads on ESPN and even most people on this sub seemed to think that Durant is just better and it's a foregone conclusion. Like there isn't even a debate to be had. That, and Iguodala winning finals MVP in 2015, all contributed to me thinking this dude is actually underrated.     In addition, people always just call him the best shooter of all time. Which he obviously is, but it does him a disservice. This dude is one of the best scorers of all time and is the most efficient volume scorer of all time. Also a fantastic playmaker, decision maker, floor spacer and everything else. There are plenty of offensive metrics that show he is the best offensive player of all time.   I rank Steph way higher on the ATG list than most people do. I value modern players more because I feel quality of play and overall competition has increased a lot in the past couple of decades and I value the off-ball movement and spacing and things that don't show up on the stat sheet. For me I have him over Magic which is blasphemous for some people and I understand there's plenty of strong arguments to be made - but at this rate if Steph can stay healthy and play up until his 40's he can surpass Magic in Longevity.  I personally think he will end up a top 5 player of all time. He transformed the game and is the most unselfish volume scorer of all time. Obviously the best shooter and the best off-ball player of all time. He took volume scoring efficiency to new heights and really has no weaknesses. Was a very competent passer and ball-handler and grew into a decent defender. Also has good size for the point guard position.      I know plenty of people will disagree with me on this and this is really the only truly ""outlandish"" theory on the ATG lists that I have (unless Lebron over Jordan is still considered outlandish) but yeah I can't think of too many people I'd rather have on my team outside of a prime Steph Curry. It's really only Lebron and MJ. I don't think anybody really impacted or impacts winning more than healthy Steph Curry - and I believe things would look very different if he never suffered that injury in the playoffs in 2016."
We have a big man. James 'Garnett' Wiseman
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"I hate to say it, but James Wiseman looks like a pretty big bust."
"By FiveThirtyEight's metric, it's James Wiseman: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  Conceptually that seems plausible - he pretty much single-handedly tanks Steph Curry from a #1 to a #30 offense."
Except James Wiseman :(
"&gt; if they can't handle the reality of possibly being traded then they probably aren't strong enough mentally to be in the league.  This is the reality. If Wiseman is going to make it in the league, and I hope he does because he seems like a great person and hard worker, he's got to be focusing on himself right now despite the injury. Every successful player is playing to be the best they can and give as much as they can to win and avoid being tradeable, but, when push comes to shove, there's very few players who are untradeable when it comes to getting players like Harden or AD.  &gt;People are so worried about James Wiseman psyche. This is the life he chose, the fans shouldn't be asking him to be pampered like a child. He may be young but he is no child  He's definitely not a child. Above all his struggles and adaptation to the NBA, he's been incredibly mature about everything. Some people point out clips of Dray being a bit harsh on him as reasons why he won't grow but every indication from him says that he's working hard to become better, adapt his play to the NBA and absorb as much as he can. As much as I've hoped he would grow to become a huge contributor for this iteration of the Warriors it would be fairly dumb to pass up a reasonable trade for him in hopes of him recovering fast and contributing immediately. He'll make it in the league, whether it be with the Warriors or someone else, he just needs to continue working hard."
"Kerr is an ex-GM.  He is very open that trades are a normal part of the nba. He tells stories about the times he's been traded and how crappy it was but understood that's how the game works.  I'm confident that every player in the locker room knows that they can be traded at a moment's notice, so why should the coach be fluffing them up with lies.  Those are grown men in the locker room (and women in the WNBA), if they can't handle the reality of possibly being traded then they probably aren't strong enough mentally to be in the league.   People are so worried about James Wiseman psyche.  This is the life he chose, the fans shouldn't be asking him to be pampered like a child.  He may be young but he is no child, and he needs to understand that anybody can be traded at any time.  So he should play his heart out to win as much as he can no matter who he plays for. Today is the Warriors, tomorrow it could be anyone, including the Warriors."
"James Wiseman is Javelle McGee.  If he ever puts up 40 it will he playing for the Twolves vs the Cavs third stringers in April  Javelle if you are reading this I’m sorry.   He is not you yet, that is just his potential."
James Wiseman  At least he has potential
Probably generational talent James Wiseman
I don’t see James Wiseman on there. Light years
Hawks need the generational bust James wiseman to handle embiid rn
If only the hawks had James Wiseman. He could handle embiid as a generational bust
James wiseman would clamp embiid so bad
James Wiseman having the best NBA rookie season of all time
"&gt; LaMelo had some great highlight and games, it is good to have two young players with such talent.  At the end of the day, both teams should just be happy that they didn't draft James Wiseman. /s  (Seriously, though, I hope that Wiseman also ends up being a stud.)"
James Wiseman is trash
"Kyrie during the regular season, Harden, AD, Jamal, James Wiseman, John Wall, Kawhi (It was contact but not enough to warrant being the sole reason of the injury) Conley, this is are all players who I think have all just gotten hurt playing, not because someone hit them or a bad landing."
"Doncic has clearly reached his ceiling. Best to move him for some draft picks and a high potential player like James Wiseman. You know what you're getting with Luka, but Wiseman could turn out to be anything, even the next Luka Doncic!"
"Because Kevin Durant would HUMILIATE Giannis, over and over again. And when Giannis is taken off of KD after giving up too many buckets it makes him look like a chump. Giannis is explosive going forward but lateral quickness reminds me of James Wiseman. KD just crosses him over with his eyes closed.  Giannis does good on KD when he comes in as a help defender. Yeah his length is nice, but imagine guarding KD on the perimeter, it's not going to be pretty."
"I might get castrated by the fan base for this, but maybe you take a gamble and do Embiid and Danny Green for Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, Minny 1st this year (probably 4th overall) and the Warriors pick (probably 14th overall)?"

Technically Mavericks offseason drama. I wonder if we’ll see something similar in regards to James Wiseman. So far it seems like Joe Lacob was exclusively responsible for drafting him whereas Myers has on the record said he wasn’t impressed from his college game he saw and it’d be unlikely kerr wanted him as he doesn’t fit his system
james wiseman
"I agree that the remaining games will be far more informative than was the part of Game 4 sans Kyrie.    That said, KD has Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Shamet, and probably one or two others that I'm forgetting (in addition to Mike James).  That's an infinitely better supporting offensive cast than what Curry had this season.    Wiggins TS% the year before he was traded was *sub-50*.  And he was their 2nd leading scorer this year.  You also had Stone Hands Wiseman &amp; Draymond making Ben Wallace seem like Hakeem.    We also have one good data point from Game 3 of the 2019 Finals, when Curry didn't have Klay or KD and he hung 47 on an all-time defense.    KD doesn't have to win another game, but he does need to show that he can be an unstoppable offensive force even without another superstar."
"No, Kyrie retires to become the president of the Flat Earth Society and KD trades himself to Golden State for James Wiseman and the original recipe for Rice-A-Roni."
"Why are you acting like I started talking about other seasons for no reason? lol.   I brought up Steph's on/off to show that it was in line with his other prime seasons. If this is the case, his impact metrics in a more normal season would probably reflect that. Therefore there's no reason to believe that Dame is better than Steph right now because of this fact.   You would have to believe that Dame legitimately levelled up to an all-time great player, which is very likely not the case.   And again, we can just use the all-in-ones for this season and see that Steph still out-performed Dame in every single one. Yes, Dame might actually underperform in some of them because of lineup issues. This is the same case for Steph! He was starting with James Wiseman LOL  EDIT: and these lineup issues would affect Steph a lot more because he was playing with a rookie who had no prior data."
Mip  1.Ant(Anfernee)   2. Poole  3. MPJ  Lip  1. Lonzo Ball(Sorry)  2. James Wiseman  3. Green (Sorry)
"I'm not sure what you're getting at. Steph's on/off is basically GOAT level. If you compare [Draymond's](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1373/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) on/off and [Steph's](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/787/onoff#tab-team_efficiency), you see that Draymond's is much more volatile.   If the on/off was so biased, the derived metrics would probably not perform as well. Yet they consistently do.   Are we also forgetting that Steph started with James Wiseman this season? I'd wager that if this never happened Steph's on/off would be astronomical. There's a reason his impact metric performance skyrocketed when Wiseman got injured. He also was playing with a tailbone injury."
Homie. What the fuck did James Wiseman do to you?
Jaxson Hayes is a better prospect than James Wiseman.
Why didnt warriors draft lamelo over james wiseman?   Why didnt the sixers re sign butler   Why didnt the heat trade for harden

James Wiseman for Steph
Looks like james wiseman disguised as Ayton tonight
James Wiseman: James Wiseman
Curry: James Wiseman
Steph curry is the best player on the g-league warriors. James wiseman is the worst
You can thank james wiseman
I see james wiseman making a 2nd year leap..to a different team
"Hey it’s this shithole who claims to be a warriors fan, but has never posted a single positive statement about the Warriors or ever even been to r/warriors!   Also they hate James Wiseman and has Grayson Allen’s dick very very deep down their throat. So this person is either Grayson Allen or Grayson Allen doppelgänger Ted Cruz."
"famous G Leaguers Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Jordan Poole(he WAS a GLeague player, he's a very good NBA level talent now), Kent Bazemore"
"So? We still have better assets than your team. You're stuck with an aging LeBron, Anthony Day-to-Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroeder, with no picks. We have Wiggins who turned into a 2-way player, James Wiseman with potential still, the Minnesota pick and the 14 pick this draft. 😆"
Tbh I didn't watch many games of the warriors till the end of the year where draymond was playing really good defense but since James Wiseman was hurt if he played a good amount of minutes than sure.
James Wiseman. Now people think he’ll be Ayton next year in the warriors sub
Deandre Ayton is prime example of not giving up on developing big man like James Wiseman
James wiseman will never come close to Giannis
James Wiseman + Minnesota Pick for Porzingis... who says no?
we're comparing him to luka's team and it's true. literally what is the argument against that. kent bazemore and james wiseman were getting consistent minutes
"James wiseman. He needs a different system, not the read and react one we run. I also can’t stand him being on our team as Curry deserves better.   Imagine developing rookies next to Lebron, KD, and Giannis. It’s ridiculous."
"I’m the same age as James Wiseman, but I’m 5’8, skinny, and have a baby face"
"I mean James Wiseman is just a rookie, he wasn’t that bad"
They will take Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman and our FRP in a sign and trade for Kawhi and they will like it  But in all seriousness they need to make big moves since the last two years clearly prove they won't win a chip with the roster if this happens
James “Steph’s Kryptonite” Wiseman
"I like this hot take...yeah....Curry, Thompson, Green, James, and Wiseman...Let's go!!!"
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
yeah James Wiseman will help them get Gordon Hayward who is going to win them some games next year.
He's gonna trade Wiseman + Picks for James Harden?
"I don't think [Myers](https://theathletic.com/2610671/2021/05/24/bob-myers-on-the-warriors-offseason-veteran-help-needed-no-plan-to-trade-james-wiseman/) would disagree.  &gt; But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up. &gt;  &gt; “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”"
Yeah they should trade more picks for dudes like Tsunami papi instead of drafting James Wiseman
It was about how they got injured. Saying Joel Embiid is more important to his team than James Wiseman isn't a big shocking secret.
James “dumb as a fuck” Wiseman
"I'll tell ya one thing, and I'm not ashamed to say it. My estimation of James Wiseman as a man, just fucking plummeted."
When he makes an all star then he can take the mantle of James Wiseman
"his new nickname's Not So... James ""Not So"" Wiseman"
"I mean, that's not exactly how Bob worded it, James lol.  He actually said ""we don't want to trade"" Wiseman. Implicit in that is the ""...unless some team offers us a deal we can't refuse"".  I'm going to assume that most players know that it's a business and almost anyone can be traded at any time. If not, that's unfortunate naivete, and in any case, his agent knows better."
"""Should Warriors have traded James Wiseman or picked someone else""  would be a good one if Wiseman turns into a 22/12/5 two-way player and helps Curry win another ring or two."
"Their future is bleak. Butler is on the wrong side of 30, their top two options can't shoot, and new contract extensions are due to key players like Robinson, Nunn, and Oladipo.   Who are they gonna develop and pick up? The market is dry and they have no cap space if they sign the players due for extensions on the team. Also, they have no talent that can really elevate their game outside of Herro (who hasn't taken that step forward this season) and maybe Achiuwa.  Additionally, they don't have any picks that could make any sort of tangible impact in the reasonable future to any playoff roster.  The Heat shouldn't let delusions of repeating last year's playoff run in a much improved Eastern Conference interfere with the cold reality that they just don't have the talent to take it to the next level. Assets from a potential Butler trade to a team like the Warriors could set the franchise up nicely, with James Wiseman slotting into the backcourt with Bam."
How about James wiseman?
"That James Wiseman would be a perfect fit for the warriors right now, and would have an immediate (positive) impact this season"
My sources tell me James Wiseman will be a Warrior next year
"James ""Thon Maker"" Wiseman."
"Wrong on:  * Anthony Edwards. I thought he was a really good prospect, but the shot making he showed in the second half of the season was really impressive and ahead of schedule IMO. * Sekou Doumbouya. He's still a very young prospect, but after two years he hasn't improved as much as I would have hoped. I thought he had super high potential coming out of the draft but so far he hasn't shown much.  * Grant Williams. I wasn't as high on him as some other draft people were, but I didn't expect to just be flat out terrible.  Right on:  * Jarrett Culver. Great college player but I never understood why he was such a high pick. He's an inefficient jump shooter and he's not athletic/explosive enough to be a great finisher. His offensive strengths (passing/ball handling) aren't very valuable unless his scoring is good enough to be an on-ball threat. By all accounts, he sounds like a great dude and hard worker so I do hope he proves me wrong in year three though. * James Wiseman. He looked really raw which I expected. I still think he has high potential moving forward, but I was not surprised that he was a net negative as a rookie. This one is a major TBD though because he could make huge leaps moving forward. * Desmond Bane. I'm a biased Grizzlies fan, but Bane has been really damn good this season. He's older so his potential is lower than most picks, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's someone who averages like 19/4/4 in his prime."
I wonder if they consider putting some package together around:  * Sign and trade Kelly Oubre Jr * James Wiseman  * The 2021 Minnesota pick if it goes to them  * Their 2021 pick  * Eric Paschall
"he definitely isn’t. i still believe james wiseman will be a great player, but he’s incredibly raw rn and needs serious development to improve his overall game. golden state will still try to compete for a championship with klay coming back which is not going to be an ideal situation to try to develop a player in james who needs serious development. unless he comes out the offseason a totally different player i just don’t see him being a good fit for the warriors rn assuming they’re trying to compete for a championship."
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
I hear that James Wiseman is the next David Robinson....  one Myles Turner plz.
Even worse than Anthony Bennett? Or James Wiseman?
Seeing how Ayton’s developed gives me hope for James Wiseman. Even if Wiseman will be half a year to a year behind Ayton’s trajectory.
This is what james wiseman was supposed to be year 1
What James wiseman was supposed to be year 1
"If Marquese Chriss didn't go down, James Wiseman could have gone to the G league to get his reps and this team would have had another 5+ wins. Trying to develop that kid in the NBA was painful to watch. Our net rating was 11.4(!) points higher when he did not play this year."
He wears James wiseman s jersey… that’s pretty funny
That's what happens when the rest of the team ranges from trash to mediocre and they play in the Western Conference. Crazy to think that even then they were a few games of James Wiseman shittery away from possibly grabbing the fifth seed.
"Totally agree with the assessment, Melton is crazily only 22, hopefully he will get stronger and get more of the Tony Allen infusion.  The maximum potential closing defensive line up could be Ja, Melton, Chad, Justice/SloMo , X.  I really think we should get James Wiseman from the Warriors, I think the guy can turn it around, is a local kid, and we can probably get him for cheap now he doesn't match the Warriors timeline."
It's definitely possible for him to get there. It will largely depend on how good James Wiseman and Minnesota pick are.
Best I can do is a slightly used James Wiseman + two 1sts for Jaylen Brown.   Plus if you want Nico Mannion you can have him.
MVP - Klay Thompson  DPOY - Trae Young  6MOTY - Aron Baynes  ROY - James Wiseman  MIP - Kelly Oubre  COY - Luke Walton  JWK Citizenship Award - Meyers Leonard
"James Wiseman? i mean it is completely understandable because he is a rookie who played like 3 games in college, but he was actively bad for a team that ended up as the 8th seed. Do the warriors get to the second round if they dodge the play-in?"
James wiseman has to be on this list. Was a negative MVP on the floor for over 20 min a game.
"&gt; --- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet.    damn no james wiseman mention"
"It's not a huge team accomplishment but have you seen how bad the team around him was? They figured some stuff out this last stretch of the season but it was god awful. They went 1-7 or something without him. James Wiseman was more negative than Steph was positive. Kerr benched Poole and JTA for Wanamaker and Oubre. Meanwhile averaged 32 points on 65.5 TS% while being double and triple teamed constantly. He literally had 2016-like numbers with Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole as his two next best offensive players. And he LITERALLY carried them to the playoffs, so how could you say he can't?"
"Have you heard of Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee and Marquee Chriss. All hurt this season."

So I except Willie Cauley Stein and James Wiseman to just be these defensive monsters? What happened
tore his achilles hours before James Wiseman got drafted :'(
question:  if the volume was too low to say hes a bad shooter by this same argument isnt the volume too low to say hes a good shooter.  he also shot poorely from the ft line in highschool - ft% is often used as  metric to measure someone's shooting and shooting potential.  &amp;#x200B;  he shot .585 from ft during highschool  https://basketball.realgm.com/player/James-Wiseman/Summary/107990  &amp;#x200B;  edit: included his AAU ft%
*Bob Myers has traded James Wiseman out of the chat.*
"Yeah nah, I'm good with keeping James and signing back Chriss, signing K-Love and moving Looney to the 4. Batum as our backup 4 also. That's my ideal front court. You could start Wise and arrange his minutes so he plays the first 6m of the first quarter with the starters, plays all of the 2nd with the bench, and the first half of the 4th with the bench. You could close with a variety of lineups such as JTA/Dray, Batum/Dray, Dray/K-Love in the playoffs.  We don't need to trade away such a high potential piece for Wood.  PG: Steph/Mills/(Giddey and one of Lee and Baze at SG, or Lee and Ziare)  SG: Klay/Poole/(Lee and Ziare or Giddey and Bazemore or Lee)  SF: Wiggins/Moody/JTA  PF: Dray/Batum/Looney  C: Wiseman/K-Love/Chriss  &amp;#x200B;  The 3rd string PG/SG combinations got complex lmao, but it's not too important, none will play in the playoffs, just reg season depth."

"i copied it if anybody wants it:  #I like to fall asleep to Bill Simmon’s podcasts only for his s\*\*t takes to send me into a spiral the following day.  I live downtown in a major city right by a large highway and god damn does it get noisy. One night I notice that as I’m listening to a Bill Simmon’s podcast, I start to get ridiculously tired. It’s like Bill Simmon’s takes are so awful that they somehow don’t register in my mind. My brain just ops into replacing the I-405 background noise with how the Celtics should have won the championship in 11 out of the last 10 years.  All of a sudden instead of hearing semis and the homeless guy outside my window using my patio as a toilet, I hear these sweet unrealistic lullabies about how the Trail Blazers actually have a shot, and that Dame can be the #1 option on a title contender.  Cool cool.  So anyways, I wake up feeling great and later in the day I’m talking to my co-workers about how Dame is the guy and we’re going to the finals (obviously this ended up being SO wrong). Life’s good and I start poppin my nightly 9PM melatonin with a healthy dose of Bill and maybe a sprinkle of Kevin O’Connor here and there.   Fast forward a couple weeks and I notice that hot takes are starting to intrusively enter my thoughts without a moments notice. One minute I’m on the job talking with a patient, and boom! I can’t stop thinking about how Bill said he would trade Embiid for Lauri Markkanen and WCJ straight up. HE REALLY SAID THAT. All of a sudden I’m sweating and can’t think straight. I end up taking an early lunch.  Then the other night, I’m out on a date. Everything’s going well and we’re having a great time over drinks. Then about two hours in, I blurt out that Maya Moore could have been the 8th man on an NBA team. All I can think is “what am I saying, that’s the worst take ever”. Luckily she has no idea who Maya is and I explain to her that’s she’s one of the greatest WNBA players of all time. She ends up loving it and goes on about the gender inequalities occurring in sports, all of which are true. But we all know there’s no way Maya could have kept up with anyone in the league. The White Mamba would have made her look like a middle school bench player. Anyways, I’m thinking nice, great recovery dude. But then I blurt out that James Wiseman for JJJ is a fair trade. WHAT! At this point I can’t control myself, and she’s looking at me all confused like “how did this become the topic”. I tell her I need to use the restroom. After 30 minutes in there, I return and tell her I’m not feeling well. What a waste of a perfectly good night!  Heather if you’re reading this, I apologize. I meant it when I said that your Watermelon blazer was cute af and I really wish we could have gone on a date to that Storm game. Bill if you’re reading this, I need you to know that I fully understand why you need to say such ridiculous takes. Business is business. But PLEASE, put up a disclaimer or warning in your videos. The people need to know the ramifications of listening to such burning hot garbage takes."

"Let's not revise the truth. James Wiseman is a long-term project, and every team in that area of the lottery knew this last year. He has talent, but it takes time to develop a player like him. In a microwave era of the NBA world, it would be foolish to trade him after a year. Ask how many teams foolishly traded on Chauncey Billups early in his career, and he later became a borderline All Star point guard."
"this is actually a win for everyone involved.  warriors get Lillard, Harris and Nurk   6rs get Klay, CJ and covington   Blazers get Ben Simmons, James Wiseman, Wiggins, the 7th, 14th picks, future warriors and 76rs picks…   I legit don’t understand the hate. i honestly think it’s a good trade for everyone"

"Steve Kerr: “To me, the most interesting thing has been watching Kelvin Benjamin at chow down. I talked to James (Wiseman) and texted him, and I’m just so inspired by what Benjamin has been able to do at the buffet table, and I think there’s no reason why James can’t follow that same path.”"

But haven't you heard? James Wiseman is the next David Robinson! He speaks Chinese! Does Christian Wood speak Chinese?
"Which side hates this trade more?   Warriors get:   * OG Anunoby   * 4 overall   Raptors get:   * James Wiseman  * Paschall  * Mulder, Smailagic (money filler, expected to get cut)  * 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st"

"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre…. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also…. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc…."

"This deal would be arguably be more than what we got in that deal from the Nets, assuming we are considering Dame equal to Pierce, KG, and Jason Terry, which I think is fair. It was 4 picks (went on to be James Young, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Colin Sexton) along with Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, MarShon Brooks (waived), and Keith Bogans (refused to come to Boston) Wiseman and Wiggins are significantly better than Humphries and Wallace."
"""there aren’t many better rebuilding trade packages dangling out there right now than James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.""  LMAO. This trade package just kills me. If Portland is trading Dame - and, therefore, completely tanking - why in any sort of fuck would they want to pay Wiggins almost $100 mil for the next three seasons? Wiseman may become a decent fourth or fifth starter on a fringe playoff contender. And, due to the current salary structure of the NBA, any team that traded for him would essentially be committing another $80+ million - at least - to him. So, to give up your all-star who draws money, Portland would be committing $200 million to two guys who would not make up a playoff contender if they were anywhere near your two best players. Unless Dame flat out refuses to ever play for Portland again, the Blazers would be better off keeping Lillard and just putting four cardboard cutouts of players on the court with him."
"&gt;James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.  Blazers laugh and hang up the phone"
Warriors front office seem to not be making high quality decisions these days (setting aside trade rumors/speculation). like forcing James Wiseman on Kerr and basically wasting one of Steph's best individual seasons
"&gt;there aren’t many better rebuilding trade packages dangling out there right now than James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.  😂 there has got to be a better rebuilding package than this. You're telling me that the Celts, 76ers, or Heat can't put together something better than this garbage? Imagine you're a Blazer fan and your team just traded a fringe MVP-caliber player to rebuild around Wiseman, Wiggins, and shitty picks."
"&gt; James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts, attached to Andrew Wiggins as salary match filler.   That seems like a lot."
"If Lilliard is traded, then it would have to be for some players with very high potential. I'd rather trade CJ and Nurk before him. And if you trade Dame, then they should fire sale the team because it wouldn't make any sense to keep our best three players by dumping Dame unless you get another superstar, and why would another team trade theirs for him?   It would have to be substantial draft capital. And I have no interest in James Wiseman, nor Wiggins at his contract."
watch james wiseman turn into an mvp or something
"That’s a *much* better offer. You’re getting 3 proven prospects and 4 picks, compared to James “Bust” Wiseman and 2 FRPs."
"I don't think I'm out on a limb to suggest that 99% of Blazer fans would prefer the latter. Watching Dame play is special, and I'll drop dead if we trade him for late lotto picks and James \*\*\*\*ing Wiseman. Olshey is very dumb but he's not that dumb."
James Wiseman: the wisest path.
"&gt;  there aren’t many better rebuilding trade packages dangling out there right now than James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th pick in the upcoming draft, plus more future firsts,  Pels can do better. I'd hate losing NAW and Jax, but them and Lonzo S&amp;T, with Bledsoe for salary filler, pick 10, and like 4 more FRPs? Then they can also move McCollum to someone else for at least another FRP.   They'd be set in the rebuilding assets department, with 2 young, promising guards and loads of picks"
"But Portland doesn’t want that. They want to win with Dame or at the very least, a guy that he can be traded for where it makes sense. They don’t want James freaking Wiseman, who is a negative asset right now"
"Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, and rookies is a mediocre team. They can get a better offer for Dame than that  That’s the kind of team where Portland fans turn on the team for taking that trade and attendance drops."
So James wiseman commits offensive fouls?
I've seen my boy James wiseman get called for this same type of play like 5 times
James wiseman is 19. They can develop him and have someone who can carry the franchise till they find another superstar or at least look for another superstar.
"Lmao no he would not. Harden has brought worse teams than what Curry had to higher seeds. You guys are just gonna have to accept that people like Lebron/Harden can carry more than Steph Curry. Wiseman also would not have looked like ass with James Harden, I can guarantee that."
"What you just described is true, but its not worth james wiseman and a first round pick in my opinion. I’d much rather keep wiggins if it means keeping wiseman and our draft picks. Wiggins as the third option is going to be fantastic when he’s out there with steph and klay. It would just be unnecessary to mortgage our future for someone like siakam."
&gt;James Wiseman   The only way for him is up at this point lol.

"Personally i would prefer for a dominant big PF/C, who doesn't stretch but lives and dies by the paint, to cover up for our paint presence and create space for the jay's outside (We got Horford back but dunno if his roleplayer stats and experience will be enough).   Also, in the modern star driven basketball, a point guard is practically kinda not that important since [insert_star_name_here] will most of the times get the ball and 1) either take it up on himself to finish the attack or 2) pass -&gt; pass -&gt; ... -&gt; pass till someone is open to shoot. Smart will be a good choice for the first squad as a unit, not a star, not a scrub, has chemistry with the team and won't fuck up the hierarchy on FGA's and passes. Also more than likely he will perform better that what he had till now, since psychologically that would be the equivalent of a promotion, psuhing someone to become sth more than what he already is. After that, get a backup PG like George Hil, who has experience and 3PT pressence, and we are stacked.  Now as for the big man, someone like Deandre Ayton, Miles Turner or a more developed James Wiseman, would be pretty nice. Another hard option to get would be Zion, who however i doubt how much use he can have on halfcourt basketball."

Anthony Edward's or James Wiseman
Ben Simmons  Or James Wiseman. I think the expectations for him were too high. He wasn’t drafted to be rookie of the year but the center piece of the future in the middle
"James Wiseman. His biggest game weaknesses can be boiled down to ignorance and not knowing the Warriors system. The injury sucks but it won't stop him from watching film. If he starts, expect a rough start but for him to go on a great run midway through the season. With a much more improved team in the Warriors with Klay + some new additions, he should be much better."
"Wait, what? Wiseman is NOT better than Zaza/JaVale/West were. Are you conflating ceiling with current level? Kevon Looney completely outplayed him this past season, as well.   James showed flashes on offense, but was borderline unplayable for much of his rookie season, mostly having to do with poor decision making and woeful defensive instincts. He’s incredibly raw"
That means 2028 belongs to James Wiseman.
"James Wiseman. Why? Because Doc's not gonna insist on putting the kid in at crunch time, so the Sixers get better through addition by subtraction."
"James Wiseman everytime he dunks he stuffs it with maximum velocity and it spikes through, there was a clip somewhere of him dunking and the ball spiked on a defender's head"
"James Wiseman wasn’t exceptional, it’s not a hot take to say he’ll never hit that next level. There’ve also been plenty of busts so no one knows what Evan Mobley can do or not. It’s not a hot take to say if someone who’s not even in the league won’t be an all star at all."
***This*** is the type of content you're here for? Lazy predictions about who won't be an all star? Then you're gonna *love* this:  * James Wiseman will never be an all star  * Mikal Bridges will never be an star  * Miles Bridges will never be an all star  * Evan Mobley will never be an all star  * Mike Conley will never be a two time all star  Enjoy! I have hundreds more
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
James Wiseman is going to be one of the best center in the NBA...give him a couple of years
Warriors fans were hyped for James Wiseman at the beginning of the year but I always knew he would not make a positive impact this year.  He started the year as a 19 year who pretty much hadn't even played college ball. If he can stay healthy he has a chance to be a great player if he can become more consistent on offense and learn how to play defense at a top level. You can't really be considered a good big if you can't play great defense
\*James Wiseman never returned\*
James “Big Pussy Bonpensiero” Wiseman
Kevon Looney BBIQ + James Wiseman body and athleticism will be one of the best centers in the NBA
James Wiseman worried about becoming a splash bro.
James Wiseman is about to become the third splash brother after this.
They have a decent amount of assets with James as well so yeah I think they will capitalize on stephs last few years. If they can keep wiseman and get someone good that would be great for their future.
"They also aren't done next year. Klay should come back at least before the playoffs, Steph still playing at the top of his game. For all the talk about how poor Draymond has played this year, his FG % is over his career high and around where it was during the Championship seasons while averaging the most assists of his career.  Add on to that James Wiseman, Anthony Wiggins and two Lottery picks this year. I wouldn't call the Warriors the favorites but they should be competitive."
"&gt; Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Yeah, no."

Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.

Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"

Warriors get:  * Kristaps Porzingis  Mavericks get:  * James Wiseman * 7th overall * 2022 1st * filler (Klay Thompson)  Fair trade imo.
"Also what people don't realize is that he gave Wiseman the 11.5K to move from Nashville to Memphis to play for East.  At the time we thought we were miles away from Penny taking the HC job at Memphis because we knew there was no way that U of M would actually buy out Tubby.  We don't have as much money laying around as P5 schools.  Also James was most likely going to UK.  Funny enough U of M unironically bought out Tubby and hired Penny.  No one, not even Penny thought that was gonna happen."
"There have been plenty of athletic freaks in the NBA who flamed out because while they were supremely gifted physically/athletically, they were also dumb as fuck on the court. Some found a niche playing limited off-bench-roles, many others washed out of the NBA entirely.  Making poor decisions with the ball (both passing &amp; shooting), making poor decisions off the ball (movement, defensive rotations etc.) and generally looking lost on the court.   There is a reason why Draymond Green despite his glaring limitations as a player is still so valuable to the Warriors, because more often than not he makes the right decisions when he on the court. Kerr's motion offense needs players who have at least a passable degree of basketball IQ to function, we all saw the difficulties Kelly Oubre &amp; James Wiseman had trying to fit into the Warriors."
James Wiseman is not a bust yet 🤷‍♂️
He was part of a recruiting scandal that prevented James Wiseman from playing in college. Been a short but interesting tenure so far lol
Penny Hardaway was told Orlando would not offer the 5th pick for James Wiseman
"Warriors get:   * Gordon Hayward   * Terry Rozier   Hornets get:   * Andrew Wiggins   * James Wiseman   * 7th overall   * 2022 1st   Warriors get a minor upgrade at SF as well as a dude who would be 6MOY or could start while Klay works back into shape. Hornets get a good SF, a center prospect, a high lotto pick to add another young guy to the Lamelo/Graham/PJ/Wiseman core, and a 2022 pick as sweetener."
"It’s actually not that long I just told everyone at the beginning of the draft that James Wiseman was going to be a top 50 player of all time. I told my close friends watch, if he doesn’t pan out no one will even remember I said that... but if he does, everyone will always remember me as the basketball guru that predicted Wiseman’s success."
James Wiseman will legitimately be a top 5 center in this league. If I’m the Spurs I offer Derozan and a future first.
"**James Wiseman**  He didn’t get a chance to develop in college. He was drafted into a win-now situation with a ton of pressure. He got injured in between   If he was on a rebuilding team like the Raptors, he would have a better shot. I think he could be a Ayton/Capela level player, not KG"
"Bulls get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman   * 7, 14 picks this year   Warriors get:  * Nikola Vucevic   * Thad Young  The Warriors do it to go win now, swapping project players for established contributors. We re-sign Oubre in this scenario and run Steph/Klay/Oubre/Dray/Vucevic with Poole/Juan/Thad/Looney off the bench. Just need one more guard in free agency and we’re set to contend. Austin rivers with the MLE maybe?  The Bulls do it to rapidly build around Lavine. I think a team with Lavine/Vucevic as it’s core isn’t going to do anything, so they need to pivot to really take a step forward. The Warriors assets move them in that direction. Let’s say they sign and trade Markkanen for a PG, maybe Rubio. They can compete with Rubio/Zach/Wiggins/PatWil/Theis while developing Coby, Wiseman, and the 7th/14th picks"
"&gt;Shaq was undeniably a better player.  I'm pretty sure you're judging every after 1992 instead of 92 itself when you say this. That's what the first pick in the draft is doing too. They definitely made the right pick but that's not what I'm talking about.   &gt;Was Trey Burkes the better college player than Victor Oladipo in 2013? Was Buddy Hield a better player in 2016 than Simmons or Ingram?  Haven't followed college basketball in a awhile but I would assume so, yes. If I was picking someone for a 2020 Olympic team I'd take Toppin and not James Wiseman."
"Lakers get Wiseman, Beal, #7 2021 pick  Warriors get James, Gasol  Wizards get Wiggins, Paschal, #14 2021 pick, 2023 GS FRP (top 3 protected)  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yhxuvvhu"
"Honestly, I support players. Being a diehard fan of a franchise can be rewarding when they are winning, but torturous otherwise. When I was a kid, I loved the Pistons because of Ben Wallace. I became a Warriors fan after Klay Thompson was drafted. Recently, I’ve become a big James Wiseman fan. I hope that he remains with the Warriors, but I doubt that he will based on how the front office talks about him. Wherever he goes, I will be a fan of that team too. Same goes for Steph and Klay."
"No one is putting Siakam on a pedestal, but it’s an undeniable fact that today and for the foreseeable future he is a better player than James Wiseman. Siakam won a title as the 2nd option, you don’t think the Warriors could win another one or at least compete for one with him as the 3rd?"
All hypothetical. No one wants my guy James Wiseman anyway :(
I’m not sure if the money would work but wouldn’t a good idea for Houston to trade Wood for James Wiseman and like the 14th pick or something?
[They were 21-12 without him.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/warriors-record-without-james-wiseman) By difference maker they probably meant that he was a main reason they were losing.
"They were a bad team with him. Once he got injured, they started winning games and made the play-in. Did you forget?  Edit: [21-12 without Wiseman](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/warriors-record-without-james-wiseman)"
I think James Wiseman has potential to be a solid big man to match with the splash bros. I don’t understand the move.
"In order for this trade to work, Andrew Wiggins would have to be in the deal to make salaries line up. Why would the Warriors trade Wiggins, a lottery pick, and James Wiseman for Siakam?   Siakam is nice, he's a slight upgrade over Wiggins, but not nearly worth giving up James Wiseman and the number 7 pick on top of the deal.   Maybe a sign and trade with Oubre + #7 and #14 for Siakam but then the Warriors are paying a crazy luxury tax again.  I think the Warriors are hunting for bigger game than Pascal Siakam."
"This is why people are sleeping on James Wiseman. Lots of people are acting like he's a bust and some minor asset that the Warriors should have been willing to dump for instant help.   Dude played 4 college games and then was immediately tossed into the NBA against the best bigs in the world. You go from being able to dominate based solely on physical traits to suddenly having to *learn how to actually play*, and now you're doing it while playing against guys as big/athletic/strong as you, who have been professionals for years.   It's interesting because Mobley at USC looked special. Rare size and length, and very athletic for his frame. Yet you watch him here and he looks thin, underdeveloped, and not particularly big.   It's a big leap to the pro level and I like Mobley's long-term outlook, but it's a huge ask for a rookie big to come in and just dominate grown ass men who know all the tricks and tools to maximize their talent.    He is probably going to get punked a lot this season like Wiseman last year. If you look 2-3 years down the road, these guys could really be something special."
Somebody picked James Wiseman with the second overall pick and he was about as bad as Josh Hall.
James Wiseman did better in his first year in the NBA than Evan Mobley did in the PAC12 (at roughly the same age) and probably would have been a top 3 pick in this years draft.
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"People have been so hard on James Wiseman, but he came into the NBA and immediately was matched up against the best bigs on the planet like AD, Jokic, Gobert, KAT, etc.  I feel like with an extended run in the NCAA he would've been eating people for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Probably would've just owned the entire paint area. Nobody at that level can contend with the size + athleticism, so the lack of polish would be largely moot.  He's a good example to prove your point."
Are you serious or trolling?   Capela is 27 and Wiseman is 19. James is 100x better than Clint was at 19.
"I think Gobert is a great player, and a lot of the coverage of him and his value is incredibly unfair. However, as someone who likes to pretend to know about basketball, I just can’t see him as the second most contributing player in the nba. He is incredibly valuable, but are you even taking him top ten in a draft of players currently in the league if you’re trying to win? My whole point here is raptor may not be the best actual determination for how good someone is, i.e. James wiseman"

Onyeka Okungwu (injury concern made me put him lower than I’d like). 10. Cole Anthony 11. Desmond Bane 12. Tyrese Maxsey 13. Kira Lewis Jr. 14. Killian Hayes
James Wiseman
James Wiseman - Just because I have such a gut feeling  Tyrese Maxey- he sparkles in my eyes
Jordan poole/james wiseman
"James Wiseman. He's mature, has the drive, obviously has the genetics, has the organization (hopefully). Just needs reps and time."
James Wiseman
"James Wiseman.   I think he will surprise a lot of people if the warriors can develop him. Now with 2 new good prospects this year also, their development should become a team of pros and not just draymond shouting.  edit: the people from the steph, klay, etc. development days are long gone..."
James Wiseman.  People already calling him a bust are ridiculous.
Sure call me a homer but RJ Barrett.  The growth he had from his rookie to sophomore season is astounding and gets you hyped for what he could do in the future.  For someone not on the Knicks I'm going with James Wiseman to spite all you who say that he's a bust.
"James Wiseman.   Most people already wrote him off, but come on, his biggest flaw was severe lack of experience, dude is 7'1 with a 7'6 wingspan, runs the floor like a gazelle, can jump out of the gym, and he already has a nice jumper and signs of a dribble"
"As a Warriors fan, Mychal Mulder and James Wiseman.  Mulder actually has 3 games with 6 or more 3s, that's pretty good. Problem is he hits those when the pressure is off. It's not a coincidence that all but 3 of his 11 games where he made 3 or more 3s, the game was decided by 20+ points, and that he's a 63.6% free throw shooter despite shooting a respectable 39.7% from 3. He has a good stroke and does take a lot of contested 3s in the corner, which makes his percentages pretty impressive.  Wiseman has huge promise, he's 7-foot-1 with a 7-foot-6 wingspan, with a pretty absurd mobility for a player in his size. He's only 1 of 3 centers to shoot better than 75% from the restricted area (given that they played 40+ games), but the problem is he only shoots 31.3% from anywhere else in the paint which he'll definitely be able to improve by working on his touch. Wiseman was at his best when he killed his mid-range attempts and if the Warriors can start utilizing him as a lot threat more often then he can be big time."
James Wiseman if he catches the ball on the play
"He's always done pretty well with the resources at his disposal. Bear in mind that the Warriors never had a top 20 pick between Harrison Barnes and James Wiseman. The price of success is low draft picks (and tight cap room).  In the 90s you just knew the Warriors were going to blow it every time, but now I feel like the FO is going to make a smart decision 90% of the time. Even when it doesn't quite click like Wanamaker or Oubre, you can at least understand the reasoning."
"Deni was f'ing terrible and I have zero faith in that changing anytime soon.    [James Wiseman was flat-out terrible last season](https://kellyroldan.substack.com/p/the-warriors-season-in-review-james) - nobody thinks he's a future superstar, and no team in the league is trading 'future superstar' value for him."
James wiseman got picked third off of highschool tape. It doesn’t mean shit who you play against if you’re a skilled physical beast. There are guys who get drafted like anfernee Simmons who just stayed at a highschool academy for a year.
"The Lakers barely even could win that play in game. Steph carried that team so hard all year, and ended the season with such a historical tear he deserved to win MVP. The team is good defensively, top 5, but is literal fucking trash on offense outside of Curry. Andrew Wiggins was the was the 2nd option all year and is at best a 4th offensive player on a team. He's a purely volume offensive player. Draymond Green is a human boat anchor on offense. If you think Simmons is bad, oh boy, wait till you watch this guy. I guarantee you weren't watching Draymond games without Steph though, so you wouldn't know. Oubre and Bazemore are nice energy guys, but both have low IQs, are bad teammates, inconsistent, and also volume scorers. Again, better on defense than people give them credit for purely by their athletic ability, as they also struggle helping on defense. James Wiseman is great prospect on offense, but was simply unproductive last season. The only two real other offensive threats on the team were Poole down the stretch and JTA who showed out as a bit of a sniper. That team has no business being a middle of the road offense. The fact that Curry was able to lead them to a middle of the road offense instead of dead last with that squad, and the amount of injuries they sustained throughout the season, is truly incredible."
If the Warriors let James Wiseman stop them from getting Beal they’re pretty much admitting they’re done competing for championships in Steph’s prime
"James Wiseman played three games at Memphis and went #2. I won't mention the G-League draft picks since its a direct NBA funnel, but its becoming more and more obvious that college basketball is going to become the realm of players who need to prove themselves draftable, as opposed to players who already are."
"&gt;No  You're misusing the usage. I am simply disagreeing with your statement, if you take that so personally that you have to suppress my disagreement, you aren't worth talking to.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I literally did not, we've gone over this.     Yes, we have gone over this, no you did not say that. You didn't say ""I think Zion can close games in the future."" You said ""I think Zion can close games."" Saying ""I think Steph Curry can shoot a half court shot"" means you think he can do it NOW, not in the future on some random hypothetical.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;He is 21 years old.  Yes.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If you think he can't start the season improved as a player, you're crazy lmaooo  I never said that.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;He is ten months older than James Wiseman.  Yes."
"1. No 2. I literally did not, we've gone over this.  He is 21 years old. If you think he can't start the season improved as a player, you're crazy lmaooo. He is ten months older than James Wiseman."
This guy's has watched some James wiseman!
James Wiseman is trash. He’ll never pan out.  Warriors front office fucked up and should have taken LaMelo over this sorry ass bum.
Jordan Poole and James Wiseman.
I think James Wiseman hella fainted in the background!  Holy shit. Hahahahaha
Already in this thread but Looney over Wiseman. I’d love for James to beat out Kevon for the starting position by ASB but I’m not going to hold my breath.
"You think James Wiseman would be drafted ahead of Jalen Suggs? I was low on Wiseman pre draft. He doesn’t have good defensive awareness and doesn’t move well in short spaces. He’s supposed to be a great defensive prospect, but he has a bunch of deficiencies. He doesn’t have good hands and I don’t see how he contributes to a good offense."
"The creators of that list did a [""4-years-later"" podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-25-best-players-in-the-nba-in-2025/id1513185617?i=1000501914533) in December 2020 where they discuss the old list and make a new one for 2025.

Kmj blocked James wiseman on the play he tore his meniscus
Morey is not going to sell Simmons at a discount when there is a chance Lillard becomes available.  I am talking about when Warriors fans act like James Wiseman or Andrew Wiggins are more coveted players than Simmons.  There are still plenty of teams that are interested in Simmons and he is not getting traded for a bag of beans like this sub thinks he is
James Wiseman talked about how much he liked it
James Wiseman is permanently ineligible - regardless of future accolades
"James Wiseman other than warriors players, Killian Hayes. Besides those guys maybe Brandon Clarke"
"they (or lacob, which is what counts in the end) always wanted james, presumably they would have picked him anyway.  the question is more if they would have used the andre TPE on some other type of player.  didn't have to be someone who cost as much as oubre, either.  also, they presumably would have gotten some better-quality vet min signings than they did, so i don't think they would have traded wiseman."
"AKSHULLY If James Wiseman plays significant minutes this year, I bet it will be in Toronto or something and the Warriors will absolutely be in the playoffs."
"If James Wiseman plays significant minutes this year, the Warriors aren't making the playoffs."
That was some sketchy basketball played by some freakshow amazing athletes. If you put that together with James Wiseman they will be an unstoppable mess
"&gt;Idk why people went so hard against the raptors picking Scottie in the draft   This is r/nba kid, we determine if you’re a bust before you even step onto the court. If we do, pack your bags, you’ll never make it. Most improved player award? More like “empty stats” award. First time making an all-Star team in your 3rd year? More like “late bloomer who’s too old to become a superstar”. We decide your future, not your skill level, your production, or this bullshit trait called “potential”. James Wiseman? More like perennial draft bust. He’s the worst player in nba history according to these advanced stats that nobody brings up unless we’re talking about James Wiseman. My left toe could average 12ppg! Warriors should cut him right away!"
"We gotta develop Jarrett Allen, James Wiseman, Evan Mobley, etc. we need some good bigs next Olympics"
You have James wiseman and looney. We already know Dray is going be playing at center when it matters too.
"They should’ve played together last season, but JAMES WISEMAN"
James Wiseman last year
"I think for his first year back he's going to be 70% and that doesn't make them a contender, especially if they're going to be relying on James Wiseman to play any significant amount of time at center."
"The NBA’s Chinese Ambassador James Wiseman will save us all with his superb mandarin, and his message will be seen by all of the Chinese netizens alike through his weibo show."
Warriors G Stephen Curry has signed a two-way contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  In other news James Wiseman goes scoreless for the Beijing Ducks in CBA debut.
"It's basically Wiggins, Wiseman and Kuminga for Ben. It's a lot less than the rumored Morey asking price of  James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, 2021 draft picks No. 7 /No. 14 and two future first-round picks."
"I’m high on James Wiseman because he’s a 19-year old who had to play more than 10 times the number of games he played in high school in his first year as a starting center for a playoff team with Steph. I won’t deny that it was a tad disappointing year for him but a top 3 pick has never been asked to contribute so immediately in the last decade or so other than Tatum and that’s largely because Hayward’s first season as a Celtic didn’t last 10 minutes. I think he’s shown a lot of promise especially right before his second injury so I’m pretty high on him for now. Not saying he’s gonna be All-NBA or an elite starting center in year 2 but he’s gonna be better than what most people make out to be. He already seems to have bulked up and he’s gonna be having training camp now.  I’m low on Clint Capela particularly because his offense is just so limited. We’ve seen that when he played against the Warriors and more clever teams that try to take away his post ups and force him to be a decision maker while also hacking him. People don’t realize it but Capela hasn’t cracked 50% from the free throw line since 2016-17 and that’s not likely to change, meaning a Hack-a-Capela is more than possible, except teams don’t really try it. Once the Hawks get stuffed with cap space by virtue of paying out their young core Capela is gonna be asked to do a lot more, and I don’t think that’s necessarily gonna change. He’s only 26 so there’s room for inprovement, but he hasn’t developed a whole lot offensively."
Why didn't they get a Mitchell Robinson type player for this team? I feel like even a James Wiseman would've been good.
james wiseman was popping off too in summer league I think. Wait till they actually play. lol
He going to the warriors it shouldn’t take him this long to sign this contract the Lakers stacked and he won’t win with the Clippers he’s on the move again   STEPH KLAY KAWHI DRAYMOND  BEJELICA   KAWHI  FOR  JAMES WISEMAN  ANDREW WIGGINS  And a second round pick
"This has always been my mindset, even with the number 2 pick James Wiseman. I'm sure he'll eventually be great but the Warriors should be going all in while they have an all-time great in Steph still playing MVP level basketball."
"I actually don’t agree with this at all. When Steph was playing without James Wiseman, the Warriors were winning at a rate that would’ve breezed them into the playoffs no problem. The Warriors missed the playoffs because 1. They got killed while Steph was injured and 2. They got killed when Kerr had to play losing lineups to give his new pieces reps and 3. They did a weird play-in thing.   Curry did drag this team into the 8 seed and would’ve comfortably had them in the playoffs without the injury or the ‘let’s accept losing for development’ lineups."
"This my ""Spurs-like"" wet dream. Curry winning FMVP at age 38 with multi-time all star Jonathan Kuminga, all-NBA James Wiseman, and 2xAll Star Moses Moody with 6MOY winning Jordan Poole to get Curry his 6th championship."
"Wiggins homecoming? Raptors get Wiggs and Paschall. Warriors get Dragic, Baynes and second round pick(s)  Warriors depth chart:  |[](/GSW)|Starters|Reserves|3rd string| |:-:|:-|:-|:-| |**C**|James Wiseman|Kevon Looney|Aron Baynes |**F**|Draymond Green|Nemanja Bjelica| |**F**|Otto Porter Jr.|Jonathan Kuminga|Juan Toscano-Anderson| |**G**|Klay Thompson|Modey Moosy|Jordan Poole| |**G**|Stephen Curry|Goran Dragic|  edit: Raptors just waived Baynes. Nevermind"
"Yeah, come on now. Of course we would've liked for his salary to be at least closer to what HB has now, but you gotta deal with what was dealt.   He's never gonna be as good as his contract suggests, but if we can get him to be a good defensive player and an okay offensive player with great games here and there, then that's alright.   I'm convinced this new warriors lineup has some better offensive edge to them than last year had. At least now we're not playing Brad Wanamaker substantial minutes. Nor do we need to integrate players like Kelly Oubre and James Wiseman (or at least not immediately. We can always ship off Wiseman and Kuminga off to Santa Cruz if we need to)"
"The best AD defender the Warriors have is James Wiseman.  Jk, it's Dray."
"James ""The Watchtower"" Wiseman (JW, like Jehovah's witnesses)."
don't forget James Wiseman son of Deandre Ayton.  Warriors fan's and coaches are hoping he follows in his dad's footsteps defensively.
bro are you really this hurt over james wiseman
"The Golden State Warriors are the perfect team for a Leeds United fan. First of all, both teams have gold and blue as their colors. This means you can be aesthetically consistent in the clubs you support. Also Leeds United gear can double as Warriors gear because they’re the same colors.     Theres also an interesting San Francisco connection between the clubs. The San Francisco 49ers (NFL) own 37% of Leeds United and the Warriors are also based in San Francisco. This would be an interesting thread of continuity between teams you support.    In terms of basketball, the Warriors have one of the most entertaining players of all time in Steph Curry. This is a great time to become a Warriors fan because they’re coming off a disappointing season where they missed the playoffs (so you wouldn’t be glory chasing), but are in a solid position to bounce back with one of their best players in Klay Thompson returning after missing two entire seasons with injuries.    Speaking of Klay, he’s also a very exciting player to watch and has one of the hottest hands in the league. He holds the NBA record for most points in a quarter with 37. Make sure to watch a video of that if you haven’t seen it already. He’s also an interesting personality off the court (look up Klay on a boat).    Finally, the Warriors are a solid team to root for because they have a mix of veteran players and young promising players. Their core is getting up there in age and has a few more seasons to contend for a championship before they pass the torch to guys like James Wiseman and Jonathan Kuminga. This mix of talent means that the Warriors can be competitive for many years to come."
James Wiseman
"I think this would actually be a moronic attitude if Lacob were telling the truth - but I don’t think he is, I think it’s public posturing for a trade.   They aren’t faced with the choice of “their future” vs. a contributor today. They have a choice between James Wiseman + a couple mid to late lottery picks vs. a contributor today. Do we really think that even 15 years of James Wiseman as a key piece offers comparable Championship odds to even just two more years with a Curry and Klay?  If GSW trades their young guys for a Jrue Holliday-quality player (a la Milwaukee last year), they aren’t giving away “their future”. They’re giving away three assets that they would easily be able to re-accumulate with a year or two of being bad. The Clippers gave up their future to get Kawhi, the Nets gave up their future to get Harden - if you drop 7 years of picks and swaps, that’s “giving up your future”. Here we’re talking about trading a young high potential player who, to-date, has looked like dogshit every time he’s been on the court and has no good tape since high school. Trading that guy and/or a couple other young players for someone that is a good fit is the smart, Championship-maximizing move. Holding onto assets that will peak at useless times (if they peak at all) is foolish"
James Wiseman
"**Colby White** \- when he's moved off of PG and can just focus on his game as a scoring guard, I think he will surprise some folks.  **Collin Sexton** \- not 'given up' on, persay. People know he's talented. I think he'll be on the up and up though.  **Obi Toppin** \- I know he's a little raw right now, but he's athletic as hell and with a little more development time could be a very solid player.  **James Wiseman** \- bigs take long to develop. He's a raw prospect, he gotta brew. Has a lot of physical tools though. And even as a raw prospect, I've seen him drain threes and go coast-to-coast.  Other sleeper possibilities: Marvin Bagley, Luke Kennard."
"A lot of people are way too far out on James Wiseman.  Is it a guarantee he'll be a good player? No. But if you go back and look at the rookie seasons of big men, especially those with minimal college experience, you'll find that having really bad rookie seasons is the rule rather than the exception."
"""TLDR: Unless a player at the level of a Beal, Dame, PG, Kawhi, etc, requests a trade and says the Warriors are one of their preferred destination, we will be keeping James Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga, and Mody Mooses""   I'm not a big fan of Lacob, but this doesn't seem like an unreasonable position to have."
Let’s get James wiseman and start the full rebuild 😊

"Warriors should trad both picks, andrew wiggins, james wiseman and future first picks for a tictac. I mean if there is no super star available what can you do"
"Im not even a Raptors fan. I think I just worded that bad. For example one possible trade could be Andrew Wiggins+James Wiseman+ 1 or 2 FRP. Another could be Wiggins+Wiseman+Kuminga.   I also have no fucking clue about how cap works and trades, could be that Im just very bad at trading"
Per Anthony Slater  Age of Warriors first round picks:  Jonathan Kuminga: 18  Moses Moody: 19  James Wiseman: 20
The golden state projects featuring James wiseman and Jonathan kuminga!
"&gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight’s NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons  I’m struggling to think of 10 current NBA players that are worth that trade package.   Ben Simmons is not one of them."
Warriors were a top defense playing dudes like damion lee and james wiseman. I think theyll be fine lol
"[Mayo] The Wizards asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight’s NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Davis Bertans, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer."
Ben Simmons BPM last year: 2.7  James wiseman BPM: -5.4  There’s no way you would agree with someone saying Wiseman&gt;Simmons lmao
"&gt; NEW YORK — The Golden State Warriors basically assumed the 76ers’ offer as a joke.  &gt; The Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight’s NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Warriors quickly turned down the offer.  &gt; This comes after a source confirmed The Ringer report that the Sixers asked the San Antonio Spurs for four first-round picks, three first-round pick swaps and a young player in exchange for Simmons.  &gt; According to The Action Network, the Toronto Raptors rejected the Sixers’ asking price of Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and the fourth pick in tonight’s draft for a package that included Simmons.   &gt; One league executive said the Sixers are making “totally outlandish offers.”"
I mean - it obviously depends on the rebuild package? But it’s not obvious to me. In a dream case scenario James Wiseman is as good as current Ben Simmons (as an example).
Is this the European version of James Wiseman
"Alright here’s a fun, never gonna happen but would be cool hot take: The Bulls, no matter what off-season they have, will not come out of the east this year with the nets, bucks, 6ers, heat, etc built the way they are this year. I love em but it’s just not happening. Knowing and accepting this opens a crazy door.   Bulls receive:  4th OVR (TOR)  7th OVR (GSW)  James Wiseman  Gary Trent (S&amp;T)  Raptors receive:  Zach Lavine Andrew Wiggins 14th OVR (GSW)  Warriors receive: OG Anunoby Nicola Vucevic  This gives the bulls the perfect opportunity to start a super charged rebuild featuring White, Trent jr, PAW and wiseman + the 4th and 7th pick  This gives the Raptors a bonafide chance to compete in the east (this is where I’ll take the most hate), but FVV, Lavine, Wiggins, Siakam coached by Nick Nurse has a chance to compete in the east IMO. 14 is also a nice compensation all considered.   For the warriors it is the perfect last chance at the classic dynasty to compete. OG is the perfect wing in that offence and VUC is the perfect centre. They’d be well over the luxury tax but that team will still make money if competing.   Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
Better because james wiseman will get into foul trouble less klay has more breathing room defensively next year wiggins can use his ridiculous athleticism more and steph ..... Well we don't talk about steph defensively
Why does this sub believe Kevin O’Connor. I’m still waiting for the Bulls to trade up for James Wiseman.
Ask James Wiseman
"&gt; The Warriors can trade Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th pick in 2021 draft... they can also trade a 2022 and 2028 first round pick unprotected, and a conditional unprotected pick in 2026   WTF, why are the Warriors completely dismantling their team like this?"
"The Warriors can trade Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th pick in 2021 draft. If they make the selections for the other team during the draft and execute the trade afterwards then they can also trade a 2022 and 2028 first round pick unprotected, and a conditional unprotected pick in 2026 that only conveys if their 2024 pick conveys to Memphis.   Teams shouldn’t be able to outbid the Warriors easily, and teams are smoking crack if they don’t work on taking a Warriors package pre-draft.   It shouldn’t take Dame or Beal demanding a trade for you to move them if you’re the GM when the Warriors have so much goodies to be had and you know the guys will ask out after next season at the latest anyways."
I remember the game he was killing James wiseman vs the warriors. Then he got traded
Not James Wiseman. Man is alway sulking on the bench
James Wiseman

He’s talking about James wiseman clogging the lane
"How does no illegal defense favor 1 on 1 play? Having illegal defense forces teams to respect isolations despite non shooters spacing the court.  And you say international teams get to play a full zone as if the NBA can’t? Removing the illegal defense rules is specifically what allows zone defense. The effectiveness of that zone defense is what led to the increase in 3s to combat the paint denial. The def 3 second really is NOT pulling that much weight here. If a big is parked in the paint in this coveted “full zone” of yours, and a team calls for a high ball screen, and the big just stays there because it’s zone, it still functions the same as drop coverage, and the ball handler shoots a three or a pull up mid range off of the screen. His defender can fight over it all he wants, he still gets caught enough times that with no help, it’s a losing proposition.  This zone praise doesn’t account for when a team can run 5 out like the Clippers did to the Jazz either. Your favorite international center can sit in the paint for the whole shot clock if they so please, and that won’t stop Terrence Mann or whoever from shooting open corner 3s if they keep swinging the ball and penetrate with space.  Blaming it ALL on the rules and acting as if player skill sets haven’t changed is a bit shortsighted. Especially since you treat it as if this other rule set is objectively better.  Lastly, why would the NBA “take a long hard look at itself” over this? If you could measure one playstyle vs the other in terms of revenue, I promise some Olympic result isn’t going to make the nba choose the one making the less money. It matters 0. The same goes for the players. Sure, they’d love to win for their country, but they’d also prefer 100 million dollars to that gold medal, so whatever increases the value of the next CBA they are okay with. It is a business.  Also, America has “reaped what it’s sown” lmao, as if Anthony Davis, Jaren Jackson Jr, Marvin Bagley, James Wiseman, and Evan Mobley haven’t all been quality big men in the pipeline. That’s not to mention all of the quality international big men that have become so good and are considered superstars because they’re thriving AS big men…..in the current NBA ruleset lmao. Not sure what you’re on about. The USA Team lost this last game because it couldn’t hit its shots to close the game out, but make no mistake, they were open shots. The defense wasn’t so special that it stopped the goal of the offense."
James Wiseman averages 18 and 12.
"The Sixers asked for Wiggins in the trade deal that fell through just before the Draft. So maybe some new variation of that trade is now in the works. When a teams says that a player won't be availably that usually means that a trade is immanent   Pre-Draft trade offer:  The **Philadelphia 76ers** offered **Ben Simmons** to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for former first overall pick **Andrew Wiggins**, 2020 second overall selection James Wiseman, and four first-rounders, including this year's No. 7 and No. 14 picks."
"You’re right, it’s easy enough to work around though. Either Charlotte could send a large salary back (like Plumlee, given they’d then have a young big man rotation of Kai Jones and wiseman), or some assets could be swapped around. Like this  Pacers: Wiggins, Kuminga, moody   Hornets: TJ Warren, James wiseman, Jeremy Lamb  Warriors: Hayward, Myles"
"Zach Lavine. Think they got some got some decent guys in the off season, wanna see him lead a team to the post season.   Ja Morant. I want to see Ja develop on consistent jumper, he’d be nasty.  James Wiseman. Wanna see him be the piece to help the warriors back into the playoffs. He has potential."
KAT is old and clearly isn't going to get any better. But you know who's got loads of potential? James Wiseman!
"You didn't even consider the asking price of Simmons. I'm sure the Warriors would love to have him for free. But according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ou5lhj/pompey_the_sixers_asked_for_andrew_wiggins_james/), ""the Sixers asked for Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in tonight’s NBA draft along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons"""
"And James Wiseman, He still has Time"
James Wiseman!!!! Increase.
"Everything goes down to ""hes white and european"" he must be unathletic and not good.  Athleticism and size is overrated cause u have dudes like James Wiseman who is completely lost on the court"
"Warriors fans are elite at pumping up their mediocre role players.  See also: James Wiseman, who is apparently an alluring centerpiece for a star"
Immediately thought of James Wiseman
"All I’m saying is, building your team around James Wiseman and picks is a good way to be the magic.  If you can’t get a good team in five years, that’s on you."
My boy James Wiseman
"PG: John Wall, SG: Kelly Oubre, PF: Julius Randle, SF: Jimmy Butler, C: James Wiseman.  Opinion based on current contracts."
James Wiseman becomes the next Wilt
"James Wiseman definitely. His biggest problem was on the defensive side, as raw as he was he still got buckets on the back of his physical gifts and he also shows the potential to have a real jump shot.   Jordan Poole, the Warriors 2019 28th pick, took a massive leap from his terrible rookie season. In his rookie season injuries forced him into heavy playing time he wasn't ready for and he put up some of the worst numbers in the league for any player getting regular minutes.   His shooting splits his rookie year were 33/28/80, contributing 8.8 points a game. He reportedly is one of the hardest workers on the roster and the next season, especially in the back half, he was a really effective NBA player and a much needed offensive outlet next to Curry.  That 2nd year his splits improved dramatically, 43/35/88, scoring went up to 12ppg while playing (slightly) less minutes. He had some great games and some great highlights. In the 2nd to last game of the season the Warriors sat Curry, Draymond and Wiggins. [Poole dropped 38 on the Pelicans.](https://youtu.be/xAGf5WjekW8)  Then this season they drafted probably the most athletic young player in the 2021 draft, Jonathan Kuminga. He doesn't have a jump shot (though the form looks OK), he's pretty raw but he has tremendous upside. He also has shown a little bit of an ability to pass, which for a guy like him who will likely be drawing help defenders, is an important ability.   [This was the Summer League highlight that probably shows off his potential the best.](https://youtu.be/mYdEFa95r2I) Crosses up his defender, takes off from right inside the free throw line, launches, hangs, and throws down a monster jam.   Finally there is Moses Moody, who the Warriors selected with the 14th pick. A young player with good length, Moody projects to be a good to elite shooter in the league, has the length to defend multiple positions, and most importantly for the Dubs right now has a natural feel for the game. He's only got average athleticism but he's no Duncan Robinson. Last season showed the Warriors how important it is to have guys who are feared outside the 3pt line, that early season lineup was barely middle of the pack **offensively** when Curry was on the floor (which is crazy) and historically bad when Curry was off the floor.  Poole, Wiseman, Kuminga, and Moody can become great players. I think the Warriors *nailed* the 2021 draft. A great high ceiling player and a more win now player who still has a good ceiling. They brought on some of the best player development coaches in the world this off season, including Kenny Atkins, Jama Mahlalela  and DeJan Milojević.   These young players are all on long rookie deals and those kinds of high upside cost controlled contracts are so important for a team like the Warriors who already have a veteran core making big money.   People are severely underestimating what the Warriors can accomplish over the next several season."
"Wiggins, Gobert, Simmons (prior to the playoffs), Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, Matisse Thybulle, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal, Butler, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton, Westbrook,"
Any really good roll big who can defend. Like the idea of James Wiseman would be really good. Giannis too but idk I feel like thats cheating he's like a t5 player at worst
"Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Simmons/Wiseman, with Wiggins eventually being replaced by Kuminga, that's the path forward for the Warriors to compete, the Warriors will only be a championship contender if/when James Wiseman becomes a Top 5-7 center in the league.   If he doesn't, they're screwed.   This team as presently constituted is not a championship contender, not even close."
"The Spurs had a pipeline of developing star talent with obviously an aging Duncan, Tony + Manu being stars, and Kawhi emerging.   Maybe this could be the warriors if Andrew Wiggins takes another step and James Wiseman and the other young guys develop quicker than the core declines."
Watching Giannis has been amazing. If he keeps on this trajectory he has a legit chance at eventually being almost as good as James Wiseman.
They’re about to enter their second year.  Don’t you think it’s a little early to compare Lamelo Ball to Steph Curry and James Wiseman to Ricky Rubio/Jonny Flynn?
"&gt;If Andrew Wiggins went back as the best current player and the money to make the deal work, the reward for Philly would, or could, be some combination of 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman, and 2021 lottery picks Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.  lmao?!"
"“He (Morey) asked for a package of Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders. There was never bargaining. There was only a decline and a hang up.” Anthony Slater from the Athletic"
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn’t playing well."
If Giannis works really hard he has potential to be as good as James Wiseman one day
"James Wiseman, and the person overrating him the most seems to be Joe Lacob :("
https://gyazo.com/8f3285b74cdb389b5f2c683f5d2d5c14  you're not really understanding how bad a first year james wiseman had lol.  he was a literal negative MVP on the floor.
"\&gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders.  &amp;#x200B;  Lol, What!?"
James Wiseman
"&gt;As has been reported, he asked for a package of Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders  Fucking lol."
"Trade makes no sense for the Warriors, nor would they be willing to part with the assets needed to get Ben Simmons.  I'm sorry, but we're not giving him up for James fucking Wiseman and filler.  The only chance he ends up on the Warriors is with a third team hopping into the mix."
"&gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders.  Omegalul"
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"I agree with you, except for the part about making them better in the short term, because at this point, Draymond is still a better player than Simmons.   BUT, this move does make the Warriors better in 2-3 years when Draymond starts declining, and a player like him is going to have a pretty steep decline.   This move also makes sense from the standpoint that the Warriors are really committed to James Wiseman and developing him, so Simmons not being able to play center and protect the rim like Draymond does, doesn't matter as much. It would force Wiseman to become more of a 3-point shooter though, but that's an area he did show some promise in early on last year."
"&gt; in late July that the Sixers asked Golden State for Andrew Wiggins, former No. 2 pick James Wiseman, the No. 7 and No. 14 picks in this year’s draft and two additional future first rounders."
James wiseman
James Wiseman
"I feel really good about the Warriors draft picks. Kuminga may be raw but he has probably the most NBA ready body in the draft and is still only 18.  Moody is not the same type of explosive athlete but he's got a great feel for the game, good length, looks like he has a pure stroke and can be a good, switchable defender.  Jordan Poole has rapidly improved his game and is looking like a future 6MOY type bench scorer who might also be able to become a capable NBA backup point guard.  Finally James Wiseman did struggle a little his rookie season but his offensive flashes were great, his defense can improve with training and experience, and he has the physical tools to be one of the best centers in the league eventually.  I kind of can't believe how the Warriors still have a great core of vets, Curry, Draymond and Klay, while in two short years loading up on future talent.   It's crazy. Has any other team done something like that?"
James Wiseman for PJ Washington?
"Penny Hardaway, James Wiseman Head Basketball coach at the University of Memphis."
James Wiseman lmfao  There are def better players from the Nashville metro area like Corey Brewer but the only one in Nashville proper is probably Wiseman
"1) James Wiseman will be a multi time All NBA player, starting a few times. He has the tools, he has the opportunity, and it's circumstances holding him back.  2) If the Lakers win the finals, AD will be the best player on the court."
"Its clear that Morey values Simmons more than 3 high level starters, look at the trade proposals that have been leaked  &gt;Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the Nos. 7 and 14 picks in the 2021 NBA Draft, and two future first-round picks.  &gt;Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and the No. 4 pick.  Both of these should indicate the trade value Morey's ranks Simmons.   &gt;The Knicks could have traded Randle, RJ, Mitch and 4 FRPs to the Rockets  If the Knicks were offered that then they would be dumb to pass that up. Harden is perennial MVP candidate and future HOFer in his prime even with the possibility that he would get upset any team would trade for Harden because he changes your team to a contender with just him on the roster.   Harden is not comparable because Simmons is clearly not the level of player he is, and his trade (and outcome of trade) should not be seen as a comparable situation given how the context of the two teams are so different."
"CJ McCollum or a player of his caliber is very fair. Anything more is an overpay. Shoot they asked for . Andrew Wiggins, 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman, Golden State’s 2021 No. 7 and No. 14 picks and two future firsts which is insane."
"I was waiting to add this. I'm not sure if this is even a casual thing, it seems like a lot of hardcore fans gloss over this.  Draymond is an *elite* screener, and this is huge for his offensive impacts. Screening isn't sexy, it isn't fun or flashy, and it doesn't look all that hard on TV, so I think most watchers don't think about screening even if they are avid fans who pay close attention to the league.  But screening is crucial for any offense, and for a team like the Warriors who screen more than anyone else, having elite screeners can be the difference between a shot for one of their all time shooters and a shot clock violation because no one can get open.  You can see this difference in screening skill by looking at GS players like Kelly Oubre, James Wiseman, Kevin Durant. For all his offensive skill, KD sucks at screening. People were so high on the potential of a Steph/KD PnR but over their 3 year run, we rarely saw it. And it wasn't because Kerr didn't want to ""show his hand"" (another ridiculous some fans say), it's because KD could not set a decent screen to save his life. It's probably an aversion to contact, he slipped the screen every. single. time. Now obviously that PnR did was  effective because both guys are all offensive talents, but it really never got close to the potential it could have been.  Screen positioning is also critical and this is where guys like Oubre and Wiseman fell short. Draymond has elite positioning.   There is also an art to the moving screen in the same way there's an art to drawing fouls. Draymond is *extremely* adept at toeing the line and that bit of extra space can be the difference between a wide open 3 and a good contest by a trailing defender."
Well I love James Wiseman and Jordan Poole now.
You’re just like James Wiseman!
I'm a James Wiseman fan now
"to an extent, Jaden McDaniels, he's known for having a bit of a toxic streak on the court (Called James Wiseman ""sewer trash"" during a high school game, got T'd up a ton in college), meanwhile he's very soft spoken and shy during interviews, ending some of his summer league ones with ""thanks, have a nice day,"" prompting aww's from the broadcast team"
"Underrated Take: Golden State drafts James Wiseman and Jonathan Kuminga on back-to-back years.  I think it would come as a surprise to many that Golden State would get a top 2 high school recruit then a top 3~4 high school recruit in back-to-back drafts because that would mean that they’d have to be really, really bad despite having Steph and Dray. Even Klay was expected to come back last season."
I woulda used one of the three wisemen for james wiseman
How is James wiseman not the representative for the Wizards?
James wiseman had a high gpa (by any standard) so quite literally a wise man
"He actually used to be one of my favorites when he first started at ESPN. But for years now it feels like he has tried to be Stephen A lite, and honestly a lot of times I feel like his takes are even worse than SAS.   He has his guys that he will refuse to criticize (a good recent example is Kyrie, he was talking about how Kyries IG live was eloquent and really explained his side of things, when literally everyone else is talking about how nonsensical it was).  There’s just a lot of other bizarre things he’s said and done, another one that comes to mind is him trying to start a GoFundme for James Wiseman while he was going through the eligibility issues, making some contrived video about how it’s wrong what the NCAA is doing to him and that he’s starting a gofundme to pay the money back that wiseman supposedly received, an obvious violation that was never going to be allowed but hey at least he got the attention for the video.  I personally think he’s probably the worst ESPN basketball analyst at this point, with Paul Pierce gone"
"It’s a guard, scoring-driven league and Duarte came in flying with a 27 point debut and scored in bunches every game since.   There’s also 0 point to be mad about this since it’s a weekly ladder, lol it’ll change next week  For an example of how meaningless this shit is: James Wiseman was #1 in a rookie ladder last year."
"Yeah I like James and I still think he has plenty of time to become a solid player, but given that they're the same age (LaMelo is half a year younger) and LaMelo is *this* much better now, makes it hard for me to imagine Wiseman catching up. Again, there's plenty of time for JW to become an impactful player, but LaMelo's already years ahead of him developmentally. Him and Edwards are head and shoulders above anyone else in the class."
"And they’re not playing James wiseman right now.  I know he’s young and there’s still potential, but he was unthinkably bad last year."
"People pay to watch the 1%ers.  Most people aren't showing up to games in Jordan Poole jerseys or buying James Wiseman shoes, they are their going crazy to watch Steph drain threes and score 25 points in the first quarter. Without these guys the league would be worth half of what it is."
"Move Klay to the three then and take out Wiggins. At this point klay will have lost a lot of mobility and his best bet will be moving to the 3 much like Khris Middleton after his hamstring injury.   I don’t exactly know what the future for 20 year old James wiseman holds. I think he has the physical tools and the potential to become an all star one day. The thing is if he ever does reach that potential or start to reach that potential it will most likely be in a few years. A few years where curry will be fast approaching 40 and green and Thompson will be in their mid 30s. I.e when the warriors window is pretty much shut.   Instead of wiseman, who’s absolutely a net negative right now you could have Lamelo who’s not only bursting at the seams with potential, but who is also producing at or close to an all star caliber level."
Bro is every top pick in the last couple years gonna work out EXCEPT James Wiseman? I sure hope he pops off this year.
"I’ll take a different tack and say Kwame Brown.  Yes he was ultimately a bust, but the Wizards did him no favors but throwing him into the deep end with a perfectionist bully in Michael Jordan and a franchise in win-now mode with no interest in developing a teenager.   Imagine if he’d had an environment like DeAndre Ayton had or James Wiseman has now.  Maybe things could have ended better."
you mean you don’t want james wiseman on your team?
The league needs James Wiseman to come back and play rotation minutes.
"Bro, Morey wanted James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, the 7th and 14th pick from the last draft and 2 future first rounds picks from the Warriors. There’s no damn way Morey hasn’t been offered a decent trade yet, he’s just expecting way too much from a trade for Ben. And just leaving Ben on the books while he creates more stink everyday is doing nothing but harm. Morey making constant mistakes during this entire thing."
"Just going to go with cities with 4 C's for reference.  San Francisco: James Wiseman, Alex Mack, Buster Posey, Logan Couture  Los Angeles: Anthony Davis, Corey Linsley, Will Smith, Anze Kopitar  Arizona: DeAndre Ayton, Max Garcia, Carson Kelly, Johan Larsson  Denver: Nikola Jokic, Lloyd Cushenberry III, Elias Diaz, Nathan MacKinnon  Dallas: Kristaps Porzingis, Tyler Biadasz, Jose Trevino, Tyler Seguin  Minnesota: Karl Anthony-Town, Garrett Bradbury, Mitch Garver, Joel Eriksson Ek  Chicago: Nikola Vucevic, Sam Mustipher, Yasmani Grandal, Johnathan Toews  Miami: Bam Adebayo, Greg Mancz, Nick Fortes, Alexsander Barkov  Washington D.C: Daniel Gafford, Chase Roullier, Keibert Ruiz, Evgeny Kuznetsov  Cleveland: Jarrett Allen, JC Tretter, Roberto Perez, Boone Jenner  Detroit: Isaiah Stewart, Evan Brown, Jake Rogers, Dylan Larkin  Philadelphia: Joel Embiid, Jason Kelce, JT Realmuto, Claude Giroux  New York: Mitchell Robinson, Billy Price, Gary Sanchez, Mathew Barzal  Boston: Robert Williams III, David Andrews, Christian Vazquez, Patrice Bergeron"
…James Wiseman 😭🙏🏾
James wiseman is a bust screen shot this
James wiseman lmao
I can't believe the Dubs passed on him for James fucking Wiseman.
Jordan Poole / Moses Moody / Jonathon Kuminga / James Wiseman
"I mean, you can't except him to go down there and bang against *checks notes* James Wiseman"
"Lemme guess. Curry has another MVP season, Jordan Poole becomes an All-Star, James Wiseman undergoes incredible development, Klay Thompson is better than what he was 2 years ago, Draymond in DPOY form, Iggy 2015 Finals MVP form, Kuminga and Moody start contributing as soon as they touch the court. Warriors are the best amirite?"
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
James Wiseman? bro he’s not even going to play enough to get better lmao
"Andrew Wiggins, and James Wiseman are backing then up now, I'm not too worried about it."
Shut up you and your Center of the future James Wiseman
Yeah but very few pure 5s can guard Embiid either. Can James Wiseman guard Embiid?
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
James wiseman is
James Wiseman you disappointed me!
"Steph 28-31ppg  Klay 15ppg-16ppg (considering his injury)  Wiggins 18-20ppg  Poole 18-23ppg (avg 18.1 in 29 games &gt;20mins (26.5mins)) Hes improved yet again, and is going to play a bigger role   OPJ 14-16ppg if healthy  James Wiseman 12-14ppg  Bjelica 8-10ppg  Warriors have 5 players who can score &gt;15ppg and 7 players who can score in double digit with Steph leading the way at 28-31. 7-8 players who shoot ~0.400 from 3. Elite perimeter and interior defenders. Only thinf lacking is rebounding. But people be calling them trash because of last season when they dont have any depth lol"
"I'm only going to do top 5 picks, because if you are *expecting* a 6-14 pick to be a HOFer you are in for a let down, historically and statistically those picks are solid role players on average so it's hard to call them a bust for not being an All Star.   2019: Zion is the most injury prone but has already peaked higher than a lot of #1 picks. Ja Morant is overrated IMO but still not anywhere close to a bust, Barret has grown a lot and Garland can score. That leaves Hunter as the odd one out, but I really like his game. Hard to pick a top bust here, if I absolutely had to, maybe Hunter, theres a chance he falls in the rotation with Atlanta having a lot of great or young wings/forwards fighting for minutes (Bogdan, Huerter, Reddish, Collins Danillo) if Hunter is injured again maybe he falls in the rotation.   2020: James Wiseman, I don't have a ton of faith in him and bigs are very boom/bust likely compared to guards who are easier to hide IMO.   2021: hard to predict but maybe Evan Mobely, he has the most boom or bust potential IMO."
Always go with the center.   James Wiseman
"&gt;I don't know how many Warriors games you watched, but they were piss poor at center when facing bigger teams.   I know. But the point of a #2 pick is to draft a generational talent or someone ready to produce now. I'm not pissed at Wiseman being shit, I'm pissed at the decisionmakers double-guessing themselves when they already had the right choice. Just basing it on the fact that dude only played 3 games in college, they pretty much decided he's the safer pick because LaMelo Ball might end up like his brother who sucked at the start and wasn't worthy of the 2nd pick.  We don't know how long this team can keep playing at this level, we don't even know how good Klay will be when he gets back. I'm pissed at the fact that they knew who to pick yet they eventually had second thoughts and then picked the wrong guy.   You always pick BPA. Especially if you're already a contender. If we still were like the Jamison days sure go ahead and pick James, he's perfect for that.  I'm not trying to change your mind, and you damn sure won't change mine. I don't want Steph's last years to be wasted on a project that never pans out. It's frustrating to see how well Ball is playing, exceeding his initial draft projections and how good of a fit he would have been in this system"
"We're comparing them as they were drafted, not any other period. Saying Ball got here because ""his daddy sending him around the world to gain experience for the league"" is disingenuous because Wiseman could have done the same thing. Shit, LaMelo even tried playing in college but the NCAA cockblocked him. Besides, anyone watching basketball knew LaMelo was way better than his brother who was a high lotto pick as well...while Wiseman only had 3 games under his belt  Right now it's painfully obvious that the Warriors chose wrong. LaMelo Ball is the present and the future of the PG position in Charlotte, while James Wiseman has shown he can be a decent contributor, he's yet to get there, and even if he did, it isn't worth the 2nd pick that was used on him. Again, this team is contending for a championship so he'll be useless if he won't be a contributor. This pick was supposed to be the highlight of the DLo deal, or are we already forgetting that?  &gt;Wiseman was expected to be a 2-3 year project with the most upside out of anyone in the draft  talk about moving the goalposts. He was expected to be the starting center for a team that has championship aspirations. And he was for a while...until he showed that he's not ready. Instead he showed that he was slow, lacking in BBIQ, and not even close to being a threat with his jumper."
TIL that James Wiseman is fluent in Chinese.
James Wiseman better be David Robinson 2.0
"Joe Lacob, 2 days after the draft:   &gt; To be honest with you, he was my No. 1 forever, basically. I just think he’s a once-in-a-decade kind of guy. I would argue that, other than Embiid, I don’t know that there’s another center prospect that’s come along in the last decade that you would put in the same category. Different players, maybe. But this guy is immensely talented.  James Wiseman better be Joel Embiid 2.0"
put me down for a james wiseman in like 4 years.
"&gt; Also Ayton was the much safer pick. 7 footer with no injury history and athletically blessed. Luka was just such a wildcard, similar to James Harden and.. LaMelo  Bro you just made the argument as to why Wiseman was picked.  Ayton and Wiseman were both safe picks. I think Luka was a sure thing ngl and LaMelo might have shooting issues from the get go.  But if Lonzo can become a respectable shooter, what more for his brother who is better than him in every part of the game except for maybe passing (even this is a stretch)  Luka I think should be #1. He was just really good in the Euroleague and had skills that would translate to the NBA. Suns were lucky Ayton panned out, jury's still out on us although I'm leaning on us ending up like Sac with Bagley. Fuck."
"Lol. The heat are always so overrated in this shit. How many playoff series have the won since Lebron left (probably just the ones in the bubble?).   They’re just given a lot of love because they never really tanked after Lebron left and remained competitive but that doesn’t mean they’re the most poised to win a championship. Even the warriors tanked to get wiseman. Masai saw that they weren’t champion material and tanked for Barnes. The heat have also given out a bunch of bad contracts to guys like Whiteside, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, etc."
Honestly we have both elite shooting and perimeter defense. Draymond can hold his own in the paint but an improved James Wiseman on defense will benefit us greatly
James Wiseman
"He didn't, the box score is a mess.  James Wiseman also did not randomly wander onto the floor when he's not even jumping in training yet."
"What exactly is Simmons' perceived value? For reference, here are 3 offers that other GMs rejected from Morey:  1. OG Anunoby, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, 4th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft  2. Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, 7th and 14th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft, and 2 future first round picks  3. CJ, three first round picks, and three swaps  I'm not entirely sure what dangerous precedent is hanging in the balance here but it seems that other GMs cant see eye to eye with Morey's perception of Simmons' perceived value."
"James ""Boy George"" Wiseman"
"I really don't like how some people talk about wiseman in public. First there was penny calling him a momma's boy, Kerr saying he might be traded, now this shit. Not that anything anyone has said is false but I would be kinda pissed if I kept hearing this shit if I was James"
"Well it's interesting.  He's clearly intelligent when he puts in effort.  Our offense is hard to fit into, and he figured it out immediately.  He's never out of position on offense or defense for us.  Watching him succeed with this intellectual challenge while people like Brad Wanamaker, Kelly Oubre, James Wiseman etc fail is strange.  LeBron and and Draymond might be the two smartest players in the NBA, both in terms of basketball IQ and off the court.  But they are failing a fairly simple logical exercise on the issue of this vaccine.  It just shows that intelligence isn't as simple as being right on an issue.  Misinformation, emotions and all sorts of other things get in the way."
James Wiseman doesn’t really speak Mandarin imo.
"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
1. Darius Garland 2. Jaren Jackson Jr 3. KPJ 4. Tyler Herro 5. Rui Hachimura 6. James Wiseman  7. Bol Bol
Ha! James wiseman
"I understand holding out for a better deal-but is it worth sacrificing this season for? Surely Embiid won't be happy with that. I guess the difficulty is deciding what a shitty deal is. Hearing some of Moreys expectations for a trade sound pretty far fetched. I understand starting high and them agreeing to a middle ground...but he's been asking more than the AD or Harden trade...for a guy who's offence has basically regressed every year after his rookie season.    What was his request of the Warriors-  Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, the seventh and 14th picks and two future first-rounders...   I just don't think this is a realistic asking price. If he's holding out for 4 years to get this kind of return? Jesus. Can't be good for the team spirit."
"Yeah Poole was hands down the worst player in the league, he just showed a few flashes here and there, Wiseman was solid in comparison lol   I've heard James has great work ethic too, so I'm hoping for the best"
If anyone has ever said James wiseman can be the next David Robinson they need to be taken out back and shot
"You don't draft for fit. You take the best player available.   If Indiana sees James Wiseman as having David Robinson potential, you take that risk."
James Wiseman. Man is too good to play like what he did last year for an extended period of time.
He averaged fewer blocks per game than James Wiseman.
"James Wiseman.  Needs to prove he can rebound, score in the paint and stay out of the way of steph in the motion offense.  He’s been meditating a lot in the off season to bolster the mental side of his game.  He was incredibly hard on himself in his rookie year and the pressure of being the #2 pick right ahead of Lamelo was crushing.  I think he can do it!"
Celtics are the 1 seed in the east   Bulls are the 4th seed   Rockets make the playoffs   James Wiseman MIP
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
*sad james wiseman noises*
James Wiseman catching a fat break
GSW  Damion Jones -&gt; Deyonta Davis  Jacob Evans -&gt; Dzanan Musa  Jordan Poole -&gt; Keldon Johnson   James Wiseman -&gt; Lamelo Ball    I guess better with ball and worse/no change with the others?
2016: Damian Jones becomes Deyonta Davis. This is a wash.  2017: Jordan Bell technically becomes Jawun Evans. This is probably a downgrade.  2018: Jacob Evans becomes Dzanan Musa. This is probably a wash  2019: Jordan Poole becomes Keldon Johnson. This is probably a downgrade.  2020: James Wiseman becomes Lamelo Ball. This is definitely an upgrade at this point in their respective careers.
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough… seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I’d say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he’s already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
Or James Wiseman...     ...One can hope
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
"What if he shows up and plays like fat suit James Harden before he was traded to Brooklyn? Now what? Not only is Simmons playing in games, but his value will plummet even more due to the fact that he’s not even trying.  Morey thought he could shoot for the stars (ex.  When Morey asked the warriors for Wiggins + Wiseman + Kuminga + Moody + Two first round picks).  That kind of deal making can hurt the sixers and has… which is why we are here in the first place"
"I’m optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
"I'm a huge Ayton Stan but I don't think he's the most athletic.... I think James Wiseman is actually a bit more athletic, definitely more fluid. Same for Bam."
Yeah might have turned out differently if   ****Checks notes****  Klay Thompson and James Wiseman were healthy
This game is a prime example of why the warriors need James Wiseman to 1. Get healthy and 2. Realize some of his potential and actually play well.
Cmon man james wiseman is good enough to be on that list.
James Wiseman. No idea why
SLATER SCOOP: James Wiseman is Santa at the warriors Christmas party confirmed.
"Cole Anthony   #2 ranked in his HS class behind James Wiseman  His only season at UNC was underwhelming overall and he was injured and out for a month. He was one of the best players on the team, if not the best, but the lackluster season and injury hurt his stock.   Magic got lucky he fell to us. He's showing up in a big way for us whlile Suggs figures things out and Fultz is making his way back."
It would be absolutely insane to say no to Wiggins and Wiseman for LeBron James!  The front office would do that in less than an instant. Good chance Wiggins probably won't even be on this team next year and Wiseman is a huge unknown that could turn into a roll player or not hit his prime until after Steph.  We're talking about LeBron James.
"Lakers front office might, Warriors front office won't. They're trying to build for win-now-and-in-the-future-as-well and 37-year-old LeBron is *not* a future piece.  26-year-old Andrew Wiggins and 20-year-old James Wiseman are."
 James Wiseman for Golden State Warriors
James Wiseman.
James Wiseman was also ranked above LaMelo.
"Nah I think James Wiseman was just shell shocked with NBA game speed + what the warriors offense was trying to do. He played like 2 games at Memphis and then got dumped on a Warriors roster with Draymond and Curry trying to implement the same motion offense Kerr is doing today. As an avid Warriors fan, JTA, Poole, DLee, Looney have all gotten so much better this season at cutting/getting open off ball and passing to cutters. That stuff takes time. Wiseman never did any of that stuff as a dominant big man in high school and then he got hurt last season and shut down. Jury’s still out for Wiseman"
"Answer might be James Wiseman, if only by a very limited portion of the fanbase"
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
Jaden McDaniels literally looks like a psychopath all game. 0 emotion at all times.  He was known for just keeping a straight face and talking too much shit in high school. He called James Wiseman sewer trash for an entire game. But he never complains or talks.
I think the suns are better and younger than warriors and steph curry can outplay CP3 all day but DA will eat their front court and James wiseman is dollar tree mo Bamba
"&gt; Then it’s a rather pointless discussion isn’t it?   I made that clear in a comment down below that is rather pointless, but certain players have certain skill sets that they can or cannot develop due to some limitation. Not everyone is equal.  &gt; Nothing was stopping Thabeet from reaching the potential than a second overall pick except himself.  Agreed, but his ceiling is higher/lower than other players in his class based on specific skill sets, physical limitations, ability to read the game etc.  James Wiseman might be a guy who can be a positive impact player, but there are reasons why he was taken 2 and Vernon Carey Jr was a 2nd round pick. I would say Wiseman’s ceiling is significantly higher than Carey even if they both end up as busts.  Kawhi shot 7 ppg on 25% from 3 in 24 min the first 20 games of his rookie year, and no one here would have told you he has superstar potential from the first 20 games."
"Yes, and anyone who says no is a liar or James Wiseman on a burner account. Could that change in the future if Wiseman pans out? Sure. But for the moment, passing on Ball was a huge mistake."
"Jalen Rose confirmed that the Warriors did indeed promise to pick LaMelo 2nd, then went back on their word and picked James.  Whatever happens with Wiseman, we deserve it."
"These comparisons are hard because defense is much, much harder today.   At the end of his career, you started seeing the strong-side overload defense (which Thibs really pioneered as an assistant in Boston), but before that, KG just played straight-up man defense or was the weakside rim protector. Even the strong-side overload can be pretty straightforward compared to what modern teams throw out there.  KG also didn't have to spend whole games covering from the 3-pt line to the 3-pt line. Now, I think young KG would have been able to do that just fine, because he was so mobile, but he never had to. KG's clearly a better athlete.   The thing that there's really no comparison for, though, is the complexity of stuff that Draymond does on defense. Pre switching, captaining the defense, orchestrating the team defense to stop plays before they start, etc. I think there's a strong case to be made that Draymond is the *smartest* defender the league has ever seen, and he's smart in a way that we just really haven't seen before. He's transformational. Draymond was the key to a switching defense that terrorized the league - using switching as a weapon to attack the offense, rather than reactively. As much as KG was great, did you really want him switched on to zippy little point guards?   I believe that Draymond belongs on the short list of the greatest defenders in the history of the league - and that's not something you usually hear said of KG.   And look, before the advent of modern defensive stats (which are still often quite inadequate) the simple truth is that nobody in the media was really any good at talking about defense. You got all-defense votes from scoring a lot (yes, scoring, see Dave Berry's ""The Wages of Wins"") and from emphatic blocks and highlight plays. KG did very well by those metrics which *probably* means he was somewhat over-rated defensively during much of that time.  It's also worth pointing out that the vast majority of his defenses in Minnesota were average, none of them were particularly good. Never better than 10th and on a few occasions worse than 20th.   Yes, he was on a great defensive team in Boston, but that was a team that had solid defenders up and down the roster including generally-recognized as great defenders in Rondo and Tony Allen, as well as Kendrick Perkins (very very good before injuries slowed him down), Paul Pierce (one of those frustrating guys who seemed like he should be bad at defense but actually wasn't), and, more importantly, unleashed a revolutionary defensive scheme that took the league completely by surprise. Thib's strong-side overload defense just completely bamboozled teams, as the dominant offensive ethos of the era was ""clear out and let your best guy go to work one-on-one"" which the overload rendered ineffective. Even a year or two later, teams just flat-out had more tools and understanding about how to attack it.  Meanwhile, Draymond led the scrap head of the 2021 Warriors to a top-five defense on a team that gave major minutes to guys like Kelly Oubre (who otherwise has generally otherwise only been a part of bottom-10 defenses), James Wiseman (who was completely lost on defense all year), Kent Bazemore (currently scrapping for minutes on a team that has significant injuries and DESPERATELY needs wing defense).  And, look, we all have to be humble about this. But none of the people posting that KG was clearly better, I'm betting, broke down game film during his prime. (The kind of video analysis we all now take for granted was simply flat-out unavailable!). But I've got to say, given that, the number of people who are so confident that KG was better ... how much are you going on highlights and reputation?   Can I see a show of hands from people who actually watched more than 10 complete games at the time from his years in Minnesota?"
And the Warriors were without Klay Thompson and James Wiseman. Damion Lee was also out for the Bulls game
1-2 years James Wiseman
James Wiseman (according to our sub) and a first😤😤
"if my team passed on Lamelo for James Wiseman  I would’ve thought of a million excuses and reasons to why Lamelo wouldn’t ball out on the dubs, I don’t blame you dude."
James Wiseman is an NBA player.
James Wiseman
Out for Golden State  * Steph Curry  * Draymond Green  * Andre Iguodala  * Klay Thompson  * Otto Porter  * James Wiseman
James Wiseman was NOT a starter when last healthy
"- Both Kyrie Irving &amp; Ben Simmons will return to play before the All-Star break.   - The Grizzlies will go on a fire sale at the trade deadline.  - Either the Celtics or Knicks will miss the play-in tournament.  - Klay Thompson and James Wiseman will make the Warriors slightly worse in the short term but both will be starters by the start of the playoffs.  - Lakers will look fine after LeBron comes back, but will inevitably be upset in the 2nd Round."
"&gt; What we saw last year showed that steph and James wiseman pnr was shit, whereas steph and draymond pnr was godly. They're a match made in heaven.  Yes. Steph when surrounded by Draymond, Klay, Iggy and KD is godly. But that's the exact opposite of versatile."
"Stephs best attributes are unlocked by playing off ball, so that means you need another guy to be primary ball handler. Steph is also an amazing pnr player so someone who could set screens would be great.  What we saw last year showed that steph and James wiseman pnr was shit, whereas steph and draymond pnr was godly. They're a match made in heaven.  Altho to he sure steph ain't a negative player without draymond or anything insane like that but he's not portable the way KD is."
James Wiseman is great granddaddy
"No I'm not saying that you're just wrongfully concluding on that. You're mad if you think Wiseman is going to be a good enough defender to guard Jokic better than anyone we have at the 5 atm. The logic that height is everything on defense is flawed. Yes James has the height advantage but Draymond is literally a top 3 playoff defender in this league and elite as a free safety rim protector and help defender.  Even the argument that Wiseman could be useful in specific matchups is complete BS. With the play he showed there is no matchup where he's an advantage over Dray or Loon. Coming of a meniscus tear? No way.  And to your first point, about GS not being at their peak with Draymond at the 5. That's also wrong. Whilst Draymond may have disadvantages in regards to height, the upside the brings in regards to the ability to switch everything, be the free safety rim protector, better offense with him at the 5 (one more shooter) etc etc  Trust me, Draymond playing center doesn't stand in the way of a realistic Warriors peak this season. Other things do, this is not one of those things."
"Looney is leaving the door wide open for James to start offensively, Wiseman just can’t be lost on def which is hard for a young C"
"The entire premise is flawed because it assumes that the people who criticize a team after losses are the ones who are fair-weather. No, usually it's the people who think everything is always perfect and that the 29th pick will save their defense or something or that James Wiseman is a guaranteed future All-Star that are fair-weather because they haven't watched enough basketball or know how shitty a team can get."
Maybe.  I am having a hard time seeing how James Wiseman gets minutes   The best lineups have Draymond at the 5 and before year end I see a lot more Kuminga minutes.  Loon is solid for what they need and then Beli gets his?  I think some night though Beli is run off the floor though and James plays
"Top 5 by minutes, Lakers 2006:      Kobe   Lamar Odom   Smush Parker   Kwame Brown   Chris Mihm       Top 5 by minutes, Warriors 2021:       Steph Curry   Andrew Wiggins   Draymond Green   Kelly Oubre Jr   James Wiseman            just dropping in for comparison"
"Anthony Edwards efficiency issues have existed his entire career back to college and AAU and can't just be handwaved away by saying ""he's 20 and barely played a full season"" and he genuinely needs someone to coach that out, and I haven't seen it yet.  Handwaving away his efficiency issues on a lack of gametime, is like handwaving away James Wiseman not having Evan Mobley's ability to pick up guards on defense due to a lack of gametime - it's a genuine flaw in their game, not just ""a lack of experience"" issue.   While there have been players who have had inefficient first few years and developed, there has never been someone with as big of a BBIQ red flag ***pre-NBA*** as Edwards who has developed into an efficient star primary option on a team. And he's shooting like he's the primary option on a team.   Maybe he'll be the first who knows, but the laws of thermodynamics tell you you can't make matter of nothing, so i dont see how Edwards is going to develop this out of nothing when he can barely let genuinely the greating shooting big man ever take more shots than him.  My 2c but this opinion gets jumped everytime people bring it up - even the thread that showed a highlight of Edwards refusing to pass to a wide open KAT had more people shitting on KAT than blaming Edwards lmao."
"- Warriors played 12 players tonight - Klay Thompson and James Wiseman are at home - Every single night will be a challenge when they return  Warriors will collapse, miss playoffs presumably"
Kuminga (kumbucket) Poole (poole party) wiseman(king James)is a great young core for the future too
"Their postgame thread is pretty salty too. ""Injury-riddled Nets"", as if we weren't missing Klay Thompson (multi-year All-Star, top 5 shooter all-time, all-NBA defender) and James Wiseman (#2 overall pick, and literally 50% of our center presence). That easily outweights Joe Harris, Paul Millsap, and Nic Claxton. Unless you're counting Kyrie, but he's not out due to injury. He's out due to being a woke idiot, which their front office knew full well when they signed him."
True! But then getting James wiseman sheshhh
James Wiseman is out for tonight's game
"with James wiseman back, they are literally unbeatable."
James Wiseman.
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23. Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"There's lots of pictures of him on the internet, just google ""James Wiseman"""
"Injuries, other top players eventually adjusting to the new ball / officiating over the course of the 82 game season, integrating James Wiseman and Klay Thompson into their lineup while ensuring that their role-player wings get consistent minutes, other teams game-planning exploiting their weaknesses around their center rotation."
Oubre's net rating was negative but nowhere near as bad as whatever these numbers are pointing out. Wiggins barely ended the season positive at +0.1 in the regular season. In fact most of the season their net ratings were about the same.   Oubre's stats were also very good in certain lineups. They're a +13.68 when Oubre/Green/Curry are playing with Wiggins and Wiseman off. Even the infamous Wiseman lineups have a +11.05 net rating when Wiggins is off the floor but with Oubre/Green/Curry/Wiseman.   James Wiseman also had a good +/- when he WASN'T playing in the starting lineup (+15 without Green/Curry/Oubre/Wiggins). Something no Warriors fans will point out because they don't pay attention and follow narratives.  Chriss would have been excellent but spend most of his minutes in the disastrous early season.
James Wiseman *cough*
There is one player who can stop them and his name is &gt;!James Wiseman!&lt;.
"this is absolutely correct lol. sure, a lot of it was injury and questionable fits brought in by the FO (oubre, baze, wanamaker, wiseman), but Kerr didn’t adjust his offense at all to fit the personnel. He had dudes out there who barely knew how to set a screen running double cross hopscotch Horns read and react plays.   As you mentioned, fans were begging him to run Wiseman PNRs with Curry or Poole, and guess what? [That’s exactly the limited role they’re planning to drop him into](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steve-kerr-explains-what-warriors-miss-james-wiseman-out?amp)"
"Calm down.  James Wiseman was AWFUL last year. I think people are making a mistake to think that means he's going to be awful forever, but he wasn't good, and people shouldn't act like his absence is hurting this team.   The Warriors have had an easy schedule and while they've won the games they're supposed to win (which most teams can't say) let's wait and see how they travel before making any big assumptions.   The look really good. They look like a better-than-the-sum-of-their-parts team (like 2015!) that is going to have people doubting them all season long.   But let's not pencil them in for looking this good all season long quite so fast."
"Wiseman takes longer because his position is so difficult defensively. But offensively Wiseman arrives this season. Will get 12-16 points off of the spacing alone. It’s simple James just dunk or pass or screen, zero jump shots."
The fact that this is all before Klay Thompson comes back is crazy. James Wiseman coming back should be a good boost for them also. That team is scary.
"Comparing Grayson Allen to an All star is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. There weren’t any available.   Since Klay was out there wasn’t a realistic trade that would have made them a title contender or even a playoff contender more than they were and since Wiseman had talent he really was the best #2 option and hope he could turn it on like Edwards did. He was looking good in his last few games so maybe he could’ve but he got hurt so you don’t know. You always heard how they needed to get him going. Again there was no all-star you’re making him up and It’s not like a role player like Vucevic would make them a playoff team, they were playing 8 deep to end the year and he DEFINITELY wouldn’t be a better piece in the future. Draymond was talking about the Wizards. He literally told Myers who to draft this year and there’s a big difference between James Wiseman and Deni Avidja in potential."
"I've been told that James Wiseman is a lost cause, Bagley 2.0.  I'm so sad for him.   Easily the worst rookie for GSW since some guy named Draymond Green averaged 2.9 ppg on 32.7% shooting.  Sometimes I wonder what happened to Draymond. Probably playing in the Philippines or something."
Evan Mobley vs James Wiseman let's GOOOOOOOOO
Could I interest you in 1 x Klay and 1 x James Wiseman? Can't wait till this team is fully healthy
when james wiseman starts doing well we're going to have to go through the same song and dance we went through with poole   been reading r/nba for years now and its crazy that shit just never changes
"Ant Man attended the same Curry camp that James Wiseman attended a few years ago.  This is more of a student/teacher relationship than a rivalry.  It's like me telling my college professor ""hey I'm going to ace this test"" and them replying ""good for you. Show me what you got"""
"Joe Lacob on James Wiseman after the draft: ""He was my No. 1 forever, basically. I just think he’s a once-in-a-decade kind of guy… other than Embiid, I don’t know that there’s another center prospect that’s come along in the last decade that you would put in the same category."""
What’s with everyone talking about James Wiseman coming back being noteworthy? Pretty sure he had a really bad rookie season.
"James Wiseman will see pretty good rotational minutes, and it’s not because of developmental prioritization over winning.  Here’s the reality; the Warriors second unit isn’t scoring well enough. It’s pretty true that Poole can struggle to drive past defenders in isolations and thus the need for pick-and-rolls arises a bit but Warriors centers in general are either not traditional PnR players or aren’t good enough scorers to be his PnR partner (also Draymond tends to sit on the bench during a good portion of second unit minutes). Wiseman is pretty much a given option with how he can score the ball and is a 7-foot big who can act as a roll-man.   Also, the Warriors centers are too undersized or aren’t traditional bigs. They need bodies for their current guys (Draymond, Looney, Bjelica and even JTA to an extent) to hold up physically come playoff time. Hence the need for Wiseman in this regard."
who knew gary was the perfect replacement for james wiseman?
"Kelly Oubre, Brad Wannamaker, James Wiseman."
"No. I've long said he's far more polished than draft pundits and Sixers fans believed. Before this season it was ""he can't take care of the ball. He doesn't have good handles. He's not that fast (this one is from the draft pundits). He's not really a point guard. He can't shoot."" I watched him at Kentucky and back then, I believed he was right up there with the top players of his draft, Anthony Edwards, LaMelo Ball, and James Wiseman."
"That statistic only includes the whole games, in which he played only a small part of.  If you only count minutes Wiseman was really on court, then they were outscored by almost 200 points in 800 minutes, which is more like an equivalent of a 20 win pace or whatever happens when you're so bad.  I find it rather absurd that people in this thread consider... James Wiseman vindicated because Warriors are winning. He's not playing now! That is absolutely not a proof that people saying that Wiseman is currently a negative were wrong and stupid!"
James Wiseman
"Brad Wannamaker, Kelly Oubre, James Wiseman"
"Everyone knows the All Star votes were meant to troll. So I'll be voting for him daily, just for the lulz. Along with James Wiseman, Udonis Haslem, Russell Westbrook, Tim Hardaway (Sr), LiAngelo Ball, Hasheem Thabeet, Anthony Bennett, Ben Simmons and DeMarcus Cousins."
I'll pull the low hanging fruit before someone else does   James Wiseman could never-
"Warriors development staff really did a great job helping Jordan work, but the man himself is just a grinder. It's so interesting, a draft pick's work ethic is almost more important than how good they start off. This is kind of why I'm high on James Wiseman, considering all the coaches say he works hard, plus just his physicality combined with better positioning he could average 15 points and 10 rebounds on like 65% shooting, mostly dunks. Shit, thinking about it, last year he was 11.5 points and 5.8 rebounds a game in 20 minutes, if he just maintains his production and gets to like 24 minutes per game when he comes back with a little improvement it could easily happen."
"He's a solid backup center. If James can be starter caliber on either said of the ball I'm 100% against moving Loon and Kerr should go back to using him how he was during the KD years. But if Wiseman isn't competent on offense or defense and struggles with both then we need to try and get a starting caliber center   I like Loon, but BBIQ isn't enough to start on a playoff team with championship goals anymore"
Who needs James Wiseman if they have Steph the rim protector
James Fuckin Wiseman
"Prediction  A few of years from now in Draymond's FA season, on a potentially game winning final possession:  James Wiseman is going to steal a rebound from Draymond, ignore his clapping for the ball while dribbling up court himself, then fumble the ball without getting a shot up before the buzzer."
"You never get to pick your own nickname. Just like james wiseman is big jim, gp2 is the mitten"
"This game is a perfect reminder that the Warriors should have Lamelo Ball instead of James Wiseman. His shot form was too weird though, right reddit? And his efficiency too low. Glad I still listen to what reddit has to say though."
Maybe James Wiseman will be the next great American center…
"Is there any universe where this goes through?   Warriors get:  * Dejounte Murray   * Jakob Poeltl   Spurs get:  * Jordan Poole  * James Wiseman  * Jon Kuminga   * Moses Moody  The Warriors get two fantastic players for their youth. Spurs get an injection of young talent. I know the Spurs want to try to compete while Pop is around, but is this a good trade on paper in your opinion?"
"From the recent [M.Poole article](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/why-james-wiseman-lamelo-ball-debate-cant-be-concluded-yet):  &gt;[Big] men almost always require the longest adjustment period. The last five players named Rookie of the Year are point guards or primary ballhandlers, and 13 of the last 20 fall into that category.  &gt;In the 22 years since Tim Duncan – a four-year collegian – earned the award (1998), only two centers, Amaré Stoudemire and Emeka Okafor, have gotten it."
"Draymond is under contract for two years and then has a player option worth about $27.6 million, which is probably more than what Draymond would be getting by then. Draymond will be 34 years old by the end of his current contract + player option.  The Warriors do however have a lot of FA decisions at the end of 2023-24 which includes the end of Draymond’s player option year, as well as the end of Klay Thompson and James Wiseman’s contracts. But Klay and Draymond will both turn 34 by then, which probably enables the Warriors to pay both him and Klay an amount they’ll be okay with. (And could also enable Poole and Wiseman’s new extensions)  The fact that Andrew Wiggins and Klay’s new contracts (if it happens) will most likely be less than their current ones also enables the Warriors to further pay Draymond a sufficient amount. Even if the Warriors decide to extend Jordan Poole and Wiseman, add in the fact that the new TV deal is probably going to extend the salary cap and Lacob is capable of paying a ridiculous amount of luxury tax. Draymond will probably get the money he desires unless he wants $30+ million a year."
"Not really. Other than Ja, and that one great year from Dipo, the last 10 years of second picks have been about 50% bust and 50% good but not great.   2020 James Wiseman  2019 Ja Morant  2018 Marvin Bagley  2017 Lonzo Ball  2016 Brandon Ingram  2015 D’Angelo Russell  2014 Jabari Parker  2013 Victor Oladipo  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2011 Derrick Williams  2010 Evan Turner"
"He may have been injury prone, but after his first couple of months in the league it was very clear what kind of player he was. If James Wiseman had shown half as much as first year, no one would be having this conversation."
"A Wiseman once said: ""Hey I'm James"""
You can still work on your upper body right? James Wiseman tore his Meniscus and he didn’t get fat he got stronger.
"Referencing his trade value is only to prove a point, which is that 30 out of 30 front offices would rather have LaMelo Ball than James Wiseman. So yes, if Bob Myers could get a mulligan you can bet your ass he'd take LaMelo the second time around.  You can admit you've never seen LaMelo Ball play before."
"&gt; going by on off data.  Which is a fucking stupid way to judge him. When he was off the court, the Warriors played basketball as best they could. When he was on the court, the entire team was oriented around running everything as a training drill for Wiseman, presumably because he'd had literally no preseason and had played three games since high school.  That was not the Warriors' best efforts at playing good basketball with James Wiseman. That was the Warriors using another season in which it turned out there'd be no Klay to give Wiseman as much development as possible.  He showed rapid improvement and didn't make the same mistakes repeatedly. He looked very promising. Raw as hell, but you expect that in a 19-year-old big who's played 3 games since high school.  The Warriors playing their best basketball with Wiseman at the 5 is not the same thing as the Warriors playing ""Let's Train James Wiseman On The Floor In Games Because That's The Best Use Of Our Time Right Now"". By the time he got injured Wiseman was looking at least as good as fucking Zaza Pachulia and less likely to break his teammates."
"You can't make a 2020 redraft until we see what James Wiseman can do over a full season. Writing him out of the top 5 just because of 30 games with no summer league, no training camp is pretty stupid and premature."
James Wiseman also seems responsible enough to not drive recklessly on 17 also
Bay Area sports is basically: Jimmy Garoppolo and James Wiseman are locked in a room together in some type of SAW scenario and we only have 1 bullet. Who is getting shot?
Green has been pretty much James Wiseman tier so far lol
This deep ass team is adding Klay Thompson and James Wiseman
Heard James wiseman can block shots with his cock
I’d trust James Wiseman taking the last shot of a game more than Wardell Stephen Curry II in the playoffs.   Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn’t born with the clutch gene. Kevin Durant can’t carry that team in crunch time anymore because he joined the Brooklyn Nets.
they call hella fouls on james wiseman but he doesn’t get any calls lmao
Would be hilarious if wiseman came in next game with full braids a shooting sleeve. James Wisemerson
"You’re just too focused on his misses. Nate Duncan is a smart dude.   He’s just ignorant and arrogant sometimes and cant admit when he’s wrong. If you know the players he has a bias to he can offer some good analysis but there are some players he just doesn’t like    One of the new ones is James wiseman, he didn’t like him pre draft and still basically just focuses on the negatives of wiseman"
"The best take i heard pre draft on Hali was from Johnathan Tjarks, who was all in early and highlighted his off court demeanor as being presidential/brogdon-esque.  Any PG who has that sorta mindset I feel like is a solid, solid bet in the NBA, but especially if they're long and multi dimensional.  Woulda been totally happy with dubs taking him at 2, although I'm sure an *avalanche* of fucking value jockeys woulda descended had that happened.  Also james wiseman."
What good is a James Wiseman to this current Warriors team? He's nearly always gonna end up in a trade.
Steph Curry is AN MVP CANDIDATE  Draymond Green is A DEFENSIVE JUGGERNAUT  Andrew Wiggins is FINALLY KIND OF GOOD I GUESS  Kelly Oubre  James Wiseman is A FUTURE ALL-STAR
I fully endorse James Wiseman driving for the dunk whenever FVV is in front of him
Basically James Wiseman
"So much for James Wiseman being a ""runaway favourite"" so early in the year"
"The James Wiseman pick is great dude. He’s developing well and GSW needed a big.   Although having LaMelo would mean potentially having a successor to Curry &amp; Klay after they retire, that’s still a few years away and it might stunt Lamelo’s development due to limited playing time + pressure.   If James Wiseman at least turns out to be a big that is smart and complements Curry and Klay, I would say that’s good enough. Being another Embiid or Giannis would be fascinating to watch tho I agree.   It’s really amazing how Lamelo’s offensive and playmaking skillset translated to the NBA so easily, so being on the Hornets is also the best outcome for him development wise. Just that the lack of a strong mentor might be an issue."
"That’s so fucking insane. He’s 19 and a half years old dropping 20, 10 and 10 in an NBA game. Him and James wiseman are both 19 and are both the future of the league."
I think Wiseman needs a pep talk from Charles Barkley. It helped James Harden and I think it can help Wiseman too.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KWuspZzU0I
"Anyone who has The Athletic should read [this fantastic piece](https://theathletic.com/2297714/2021/01/06/warriors-james-wiseman-penny-hardaway/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=james%20wiseman) about James Wiseman by Anthony Slater. Some good insight on how Penny Hardaway basically helped shape his early bball career. This kid is tough already and is going to keep getting better, I'm stoked."
"Here to post that this is the best draft in a while . This sub will need a few years to agree with me but I see it . There are at least two MVPs in this draft . I’ve said before all top 3 picks are generational talents .   James Wiseman is going to be a problem , The Warriors don’t have to worry about their franchise after Steph retires . They are set .   Lamelo Ball is a once in a lifetime player. Charlotte has their franchise piece , he’s the most electric player of the draft .   Ant man is special special . I haven’t watched a lot of him be he’s going to be a fan favorite . Considering the Wolves organization I’m worried about him , but he’s going to be fine   Everyone else in the draft seems to be doing alright , you already see rookies having high impacts on their team (Maxey, Haliburton, Pritchard, Williams). I think at least 8 players from this draft will average 15+ points in their careers , which is statistically very rare for draft classes ."
"James Wiseman has freakish athleticism, length, and Size.  Anthony Edwards has size and explode with great athleticism to get buckets  Lamelo Ball has the height with good lead ball handling, and his passing is elite level  Tyrese Haliburton is just good at everything, and she showed drastic improvement from freshman to sophomore year. He is older than James Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, and Lamelo Ball with extra time to improve his skills against good competition.  Tyrese Haliburton talented but those 3 have potential to be top 10 player in the league be the main guy on the team, but they have a lot of work to do to get there. I am not sure if they are going to reach that level. Whatever happen from his freshman to sophomore year Tyrese Haliburton gets it, and know what to do on the court with his abilities with almost any situation. To me his potential is Malcolm Brogden."
I figured Warriors would trade Curry and Wiseman for James
1. Payton Pritchard  2. James Wiseman  3. Patrick Williams
He doesn't play for big market teams so he doesn't get the same exposure as someone like James Wiseman...who to his credit has been playing well
How is Anthony Edwards so far? Any buyer's remorse? James Wiseman has been a revelation.

James Wiseman is what Marvin Bagley thinks he is
"This is now a James Wiseman sub.  /s  There’s just a lot of exciting players in the game, and now 29 fanbases have to come to terms with the fact that they’re not getting Giannis.  Plus a 4-3 start after the 2nd round exit isn’t much to get excited about."
James Wiseman is the second coming of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
"IDK if you watch basketball in 2021, but Kelly Oubre has been very limited (might be starting to improve, but until tonight he was on the all-time historical worst shooting start ever), James Wiseman had played 3 basketball games since college, and the Warriors are giving real minutes to Kent Bazemore, Brad Wanamaker and Mychal Mulder."
Marvin Bagley plays one on one against shadows and pretends to be James Wiseman
"Wiseman: Hey coach, I’m sorry I bit on that.  I understand why you’re taking me out, I will learn from this.    Kerr: Wait wha-I mean yeah.  Yeah, use this as a learning opportunity Kev-I mean Marq-I mean James."
"Fun fact, James Wiseman is shooting a significantly higher percentage from 3 point range and the free throw line than Yawnis antekompo. 45% vs 24% from 3 and 65% vs 60% from the free throw line. Wiseman also averages more than twice as many blocks in 10 less minutes (DPOTY btw 😂😂). And r/nba thinks this dude, who is less skilled than a rookie center with no offseason, is better than Steph 😂😂😂😂😂"
HOLY SHIT JAMES WISEMAN
Whiteside is James Wiseman without Directv
I'm here for rebounding leader James Wiseman
I’m just watching to see James Wiseman play. His story is so inspirational. Man is finally playing games.
James Wiseman is THE NEXT WIELDER OF ONE FOR ALL
"Outside of the players you mentioned, I think Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, John Collins and Brandon Ingram would play. Myles Tuner or James Wiseman would be solid if USA needed more depth at Center."
no offense to jordan bell but james wiseman and jordan bell are not in the same league. It's alot easier to teach a talented player that is a sponge then someone with an iq of 60
"James Wiseman and Stephen Curry turning into Michael Jordan now, they took that personal"

"In this subreddit, there were posts asking if Steph was the guy who could make everyone on his team better for GSW, right below videos of Draymond Green teaching James Wiseman how to be better on defense.  Steph does help his teammates, but Draymond seems like he takes a lot of pride in coaching the people around him. It also seems like he is going to be in Wiseman's life a lonnnng time as a mentor and a dude Wiseman can text and ask BB questions even when he's no longer a rook. Draymond Green seems like he takes pride in being that dude for his team."
James Wiseman ain't no transition dunker he aint gotta run to the basket to dunk like hes some no-jumper bitch this aint clint cappella this is a fuckin god human giannis antentokoumpo come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"One of my predictions was that James Wiseman was going to be really really good, and I'm pretty confident in that one."
James Wiseman is really good. I think he might be ROTY for real
"James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, and the Timberwolves 1st"
ESPN is always useful to test. Especially when it comes to their Ball obsession:  Boban Marjanovic: About 2.490 results  Shai Gilgeous Alexander: About 3.040 results Alex Caruso: About 7.880 results Ja Morant: About 35.000 results   Lamelo Ball: About 80.900 results  Tyrese Haliburton: About 2.820 results Anthony Edwards: About 43.100 results James Wiseman: About 34.800 results Theo Maledon: About 422 results Killian Hayes: About 1.150 results
"&gt;	Wiggins, Wiseman, and 2021 Wolves pick. Maybe throw in another GS pick.  Such a terrible package. Where is the young star in that group? Plus they have to take on a negative contract. The 2021 wolves pick is nice but it’s nowhere near enough. Warriors need to give at least 2 or 3 more picks. We’re talking about James harden here."
James Wiseman better be David Robinson 2.0
That's the classic triangle-and-two defense. A triangle of 3 players around the ball handler and 2 other guys to defend James Wiseman and the 3 crappy players on the court.
We’ve already done the trade. We traded Steph for Andrew Wiggins + James Wiseman + Minnesota 1st round pick + 4 future Warrior picks. You guys just don’t know about it.
I only its only 5 games but i believe James Wiseman is future HOF
"&gt; But the rebuild is gonna take longer than Steph has to wait.   There is no reason to trade Steph, or Klay, or Draymond.  None.  You rebuild with them on your team.  Why?  Look at the phoenix suns.  How did they go from a good, young nucleus of talent to translating that into wins?  There are other teams, like the Timberwolves, the Bulls, the Pelicans, and etc. that have good, young nucleuses that have not been able to translate that talent into wins and losses.  Why?    The biggest difference I see on the Suns is Chris Paul.  The Suns were a good story in the bubble, but they are a good team right now.  Bringing in Chris Paul, a guy who knows what to do and where to be to win close games, and who has played in and won many close games in his career, is having a big effect on the suns.    Young players need mentors, and not from coaches all the time.  Locker room leadership is a real thing.  The wolves have tons of talent, and they can't win.  Why?  The Bulls do, why?  There's no adult in the locker room.  The Bulls starting lineup is younger than the University of Wisconsin's starting lineup.  That doesn't work.    These young players keep going down this path, they will pick up bad habits that they will not be able to break out of even later in their careers.  At a point, a player's career hardens, and you are what you are.  For most normal people, that switch happens at age 24 (according to behavioral psychology).  It is absolutely crucial that you get good mentorship before the age of 24, or you're sunk.    Now, look at the Spurs.  They never had a plethora of top 10 draft picks.  After Duncan, Genobili and Parker, they had one top prospect for a period of about 20 years: Kawhi Leonard.  One top prospect was enough.  Why?  Because Kawhi had the fortune of starting his career in a place with absolutely the strongest locker room ever, he was surrounded by guys with championship rings.  He was a young rookie who learned to do it the right way.  The reason why the Spurs must rebuild now is because they've lost that locker room.    Having that veteran locker room, of players who have won rings in the past, can massively increase the probability that your draft picks pan out and become stars.    The best argument for NOT trading Curry, Thompson or Green is James Wiseman.  Do you want to give him the BEST chance to harness all of that freakish natural talent he has into becoming a generational talent?    Let him learn the RIGHT habits when he's 19 years old, from Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Kevon Looney.  Let him learn from 4 other players in the same locker room who have 11 championship rings between them.    You want to maximize the chances that those two top 20 overall selections in a loaded draft the warriors will have in the summer of 2021 pan out into terrific, foundational players?  Give them the right MENTORS early in their careers.    Most of us, in this life, never had a mentor when we were young, so our lives become a series of distractions and we spend much of our existence running in place, always trying hard, without ever getting anywhere.  That's due to our habits.  Young players learn by mimicking the habits of their older peers.  If you have a locker room full of young players who care about their social media standing and their brand, guess what those young players will pick up on?  If you have one dedicated to being unselfish and to winning, guess how those young players will grow up?    If the objective is to get the warriors back to contention as quickly as possible, trading Steph, Klay, and Draymond is about the worst thing you could do.    Meyers did the right thing in 2019, he kept the four foundational locker room players, and swapped out everyone else."
The first thing Lebron woulda done is trade James Wiseman and next years Min pick for some shooters. He don’t got time for 19 y/o raw rookie centers. And if Kerr doesn’t give up his motion offense he’s gone too mid season.  I wonder if at some point this season Steph is gonna start putting pressure on the front office.
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
"probably im not to knowledgeable on how salary for trades work, but a trade of james wiseman kelly Kelly Oubre draymond green  and a couple of picks could probably get it done"
"Love people arguing that our shit roster last year is worse than this years Warriors.   Steph is thought to be better than Harden.   Green is better than Tucker.  Oubre last year was much better than Gordon.   Wiggins was comparable to inefficient stat padding Russ.  Paschall and GR3 are equal to House and Covington.   We didn't have a James Wiseman.  Kerr is better than MDA.  Our waiver pickups of Green, Rivers, and Bmac are similar to their fringe players."
"They need to run that James Harden offense. There's zero reason to really let anyone else shoot more than like 6-7 times a game. They're all bad at shooting, even worse at thinking. Give Steph the ball, and use everyone else not named Draymond or Wiseman as the traffic cones that they are.  Or better yet, trade him so that I don't have to watch the greatest shooter in the world waste the remaining prime years of his career on a team with Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre."
Flashes of James Wiseman! Sky is his ceiling!
"Coming from the future, I’m here to tell ya’ll it’s James Wiseman"
"James ""Foul Trouble"" Wiseman"
Where's James Wiseman??
Didn’t want to face the legend James Wiseman
"Guy...committing to building around Zion means keeping the 23 year old all star that fits him offensively and matches his timeline perfectly lol. This trade is heavily in the Warriors favour in every way. Like I said in my previous comment, there are a ton of moves they can make to shore up their defence before selling Ingram for pennies on the dollar. Swing a trade for Myles Turner for instance. Wiseman isn’t been a good defender ffs and it isn’t even remotely guaranteed that he becomes a defensive anchor.  Wiseman does not space the floor in any way, shape or form. Shooting a good percentage on very small volume isn’t spacing the floor. No player in the NBA is leaving Zion Williamson, the most dominant paint scorer in the league, to close out on James Wiseman at the 3 point line."
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"Would rather meme their whole bench lineup instead. We've got Nico ""Ginger Mamba"" Mannion, Damion ""Nepotism/Splash Step Bro."" Lee, Wannabricker, James ""Big Jim"" Wiseman, and Juan ""Steph's Teammate"" Toscano-Anderson."
"Look at James Wiseman, so inspirational"
james wiseman is hasheem thabeet 2.0
Hey bud James Wiseman was not picked #1. That was Anthony Edwards.
the difference between lamelo and wiseman right now is the difference between lebron james and brad wanamaker right now.
I thought we aren't allowed to rank prospects until 10 years after the draft.   At least that's what James Wiseman supporters tell me.
OP hates James Wiseman more than anyone. It’s so weird. He could put up 100 in a game and OP would still hate him.

"This is the difference between a team mentality and a franchise mentality. The team mentality says go out and win as many games as you can always, the franchise mentality says this isn’t about the 2020-21 season, or the next couple for that matter, its about the long-term health of the franchise.   The Inside guys seem to think the warriors have one more run in them, I don’t see it that way. With or without Klay Thompson, none of those guys who were part of the 2015-2019 teams are the same. They have two choices here  1. Mortgage the future of the franchise (Wiseman, T-Wolves pick, Wiggins) to try to bring in a player to help them win now against the likes of the Lakers, Nets, Sixers, and Bucks  2. Trade Steph and Klay for talented young players and picks, building the team around James Wiseman and possibly a Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green with an eye toward returning to the top of the top of the mountain in 3 years or so when the Nets and Lakers are no longer as dominant"
James Wiseman was really the only player with a positive +/- lmao
"1. Why would the pelicans trade two elite floor spacers and elite young prospects for Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.  Wiggins is not even in the same realm of value of BI and Wiseman still has a chance to be bust. Even then both would fail at defense-as they would be relied more on offense and wouldn’t have the system in Golden State along with draymond   2. Steph Curry is putting up his 2016 stats and this warriors team still gets blown out due to the supporting cast, why would the pelicans want that.  3. There’s a portionable chance that the pick doesn’t convert and honestly the wolves have been fucked over by injuries. If they stay healthy and add a 2021 top 3 prospect I don’t know how valuable that pick is."
Is James Wiseman the greatest center of this generation?
"Yes, correct, the Warriors FO are probably the only people on earth who wouldn't take Lamelo over Sam Bow -- I mean, James Wiseman."
"Joe Lacob:  &gt;To be honest with you, he was my No. 1 forever, basically. I just think he's a once-in-a-decade kind of guy.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2918981-joe-lacob-calls-warriors-draft-pick-james-wiseman-once-in-a-decade-kind-of-guy"
"An idea I had that gained some traction yesterday was this. It assumes the Clippers flame out in the playoffs and Kawhi doesn't want to re-sign.   Warriors get:   * Kawhi Leonard  * Ivika Zubac  Clippers get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman  * Minnesota 2021 1st  * Warriors 2023, 2025 1sts  * Warriors 2022, 2024 pick swaps  Clippers could trade PG and other pieces for loads of pick and jump start a rebuild overnight.   Meanwhile the Warriors run Curry/Klay/Kawhi/Draymond/Zubac with Lee, Oubre, Paschall, JTA, and Looney off the bench. That's a great 10 man rotation and an easy finals contender  I don't have the 2027 1st or a 2026 pick swap in the Warriors offer since it would be a situation where Kawhi/Warriors have leverage over the Clippers, so I don't know if giving that extra value would be needed. But they could be included if need be"
"**TEAM TRIMMED GOLDEN STATE**  Prized rookie James Wiseman heads down to the team bus, only to see it roll off without him. New coach Shoddy Collection has decided to roll with Kevon Looney and not look back, leaving Wiseman on the sidelines.  Right away, there appears to be a method to the madness. With Looney working as a garage man glue guy, Steph Curry is able to shine even more. Curry averages 33 points per game through midseason, earning some MVP buzz in the process. Wings Oubre and Wiggins have some good games here and there, but still show their inconsistency from time to time.  The Warriors end the regular season with the 5th seed out West, and some lingering hopes of a deep playoff run. However, that won't be easy in the Western Conference, as they draw Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets in round one.  There, Looney and Draymond Green have a big test on their hands, as they try to cage up the Honey Bear. Jokic has a big series regardless, roaring to 25 points per game with 8 assists to boot. Curry does his part to fight back, scoring 37 points in Game 2 and 35 points in Game 4 to keep the series even at 2-2. Still, the lack of a signature and reliable second scorer leads to some gaps in their offense. The Warriors fall 4-2."
Fine I can give you James Wiseman
"Maybe Lebron really was recruiting, he was suspiciously close with Curry. They both appreciated each other’s game, and Lebrons getting older, so is Curry. Lakers should have cap space, maybe they add Curry to Lebron, and AD  Also Curry can retire a warrior, but he probably knows with Klay getting an ACL and Achilles injury his chances to contend are over and james wiseman I think will be good he’s just young to be a star on a contending team"
"I wasn’t calling him a clown for thinking the kid would be good, he’s allowed to have that opinion. I’m calling KOC a clown because of the way he went about it and now it’s biting him in the ass. He literally called hayes James Harden during pre-draft , he was a contrarian against LaMelo, Wiseman and Edwards the entire time just to be one, and to bolster his opinion he LITERALLY made up fake stories about LaMelo and his stock dropping to the point that guys like Givony, Schmitz and Lowe had to call him out on it.   Another reaction the dude could of had is actually asking why I have the opinion i do/why I said what I said instead of getting over protective and accusing me of calling the kid a bust, insinuating that, and “unfairly criticizing him”."
Definitely more talented than your hero James Wiseman
"A nickname he has had since HS and also a group of kids in that consisted of him, Jalen Suggs, James Wiseman, Zion Harmon, RJ Hampton, Vernon Carey, etc"
"James is already miles ahead of Thabeet.   Thabeet was 7'2 but the man tipped over at the slightest breeze. Dude might have been 250+ pounds but he could not cut it strength wise. Guy was just too lanky.   Also despite being lighter for a big man the guys feet were slow as FUCK. Took him a second or two just to gather for a dunk and by that time he was getting stripped.  Hibbert actually had a solid career, as others said he dropped off right quick though.  Wiseman has mobility, coordination, and actual ball skills.  Guys like 19 lol give him a break."
I mean plenty of people were putting money on him:  https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/james-wiseman-surges-nba-rookie-of-the-year-odds-01ev4jqc09jy
James Wiseman
"Okoro, Jaden McDaniels, Payton Pritchard, Xavier Tillman have all also been better defensively in my opinion. That also doesn't include players I think are more arguable but are there is also Desmond Bane, James Wiseman, Patrick Williams, and Saddiq Bey."
"Most people aren't trying to make the argument that James is better overall but that he was a better pick for the warriors.  Warriors have the greatest shooter ever to play in Curry and the number 2 in Klay. Neither of them are expected to really decline anytime soon despite Klay's injuries because he's a spot up shooter. Where the warriors have had issues is the 5 and while Wiseman is rough around the edges he's already playing well at that spot and has huge upside as someone who basically went from playing highschool ball to the NBA.  Ball would be on limited minutes behind Curry and only the primary ball handler for max 12 minutes a game. I honestly think he wouldn't have enough reps to actually shine on the warriors making this the best outcome for both him, the hornets, and the warriors."
You have some pretty high expectations. Young centers generally take longer to develop. Wiseman is currently averaging 11.8 ppg/5.9 reb. For comparison to some previous big men rookie seasons:  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/how-james-wisemans-stats-compare-all-star-big-mens-age-19-seasons
"&gt;Fair enough, from my point of view: Yes Lamelo would eventually start alongside Curry this season and could potentially be Curry’s understudy but at the end of the day GSW’s bread and butter will always be the Steph-Dray PnR. I think Lamelo’s development would be greatly accelerated when given the reins to run his own team and I don’t think GSW will be in the position to give him that opportunity.  The Warriors are 1st in cuts, 1st in off screens, 5th in transition, 9th in handoffs, 21st in isolation, and dead last in pick and roll plays. GS runs the type of offense Lamelo plays in under James Borrego.   The Warriors are 1st in points per possession on the pick and roll plays they do run, but it is not a staple of their offense. In fact, [Steve Kerr is quite averse to running a bunch of pick and roll](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steve-kerr-says-warriors-arent-going-to-turn-into-the-rockets-and-run-pick-and-roll-70-times-a-game/amp/), and they didn’t run a pnr a bunch even when KD was on the roster.   I definitely think there is room for Melo in their offense, and he has shown himself to be even better in the pick and roll than what was thought when he was drafted.   Although he is flashy and makes highlight plays, Lamelo is not a ball dominant pg and knows how to play in the flow of an offense. Even in the scenario of a Steph-Dray pnr, Lamelo is an excellent spot up shooter and can still be involved in plays.  Having a bunch of smart playmakers with vision is really not that complicated as y’all make it out to be. The beauty of having pass first playmakers is that they prefer the right shot over the last shot and have the vision to make reads that other players (Oubre and Wiggins) can’t.  &gt;Wiseman would thrive as a rim runner and his skillset compliments Steph and Dray’s game better. Not to mention no better mentor on the defensive end than Draymond.   Lamelo has quick hands and preternatural awareness on defense (his focus and effort oscillate), combined with the length and quick feet of a wing player. I think he’s going to be a good pg defender if he puts on weight and is serious about it, and that alleviates Klay of guarding pgs when he comes back. The skill set GS needs at center (rim runner &amp; plus defender), is something you can get on the market.   &gt;That being said, when rebuilding you draft for talent but when contending you draft for fit so I think both teams turn out happy.  The Warriors aren’t contenders this year &amp; they knew about Klay’s injury before the draft. I don’t think Wiseman will be what they need next year (true center who can stay on the floor 30+ minutes a night against the best teams in the NBA &amp; during the playoffs) to be contenders."
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."
"Bruh the offense is complete ass, playing with James Wiseman and Kelly Oubre tanks his offensive rating. Dude's getting double and triple teamed but is shooting the best percentages in the league, scoring more points than anyone else, and still doing all that off-ball creation that makes his teammates much, much better like everyone else. The Warriors are within three wins of those other three teams, and they've gone 1-8 without him. This is a carry job. Literally playing like his 2016 MVP season, only then, he had some more help."
"Warriors strategy is notoriously centered around Steph but it isn't centered around him taking a billion shots. If anything, it drives me insane how Kerr uses the best shooter of all time to get G-Leaguers open for midrange J's. His stubborn refusal to run P&amp;R is even more baffling to me. They had Steph and KD in their primes for 3 years and they ran P&amp;R with those two guys maybe a handful of times each game. Why? Because of Kerr's stupid insistence on his offensive philosophy. Even in 2019 when it was clear that KD was going to leave, they didn't use it. It doesn't end there, Kerr tried to turn James Wiseman into Andrew Bogut ffs. It's just awful, he's completely stuck in 2015 when they had a bunch of unselfish, high-IQ guys and is just so inflexible it makes my brain hurt. I think you are really overrating Kerr's system. Curry is the system. They look worse when Steph's off the court because he's, statistically, far and away the best at raising his teammates' level of play since they started tracking that stuff, even better than LeBron. I mean the Warriors barely broke .500 when they didn't have Steph in the past; they went 1-8 this year. That's crazy. Yet when they don't have other stars, Steph is still amazing. So all the evidence points to Steph being the cause and not the beneficiary.  &gt; just saying those on/offs just aren't really fair to use because those other guys wouldn't see the same dropoff since the scheme would be going from Curry to Harden, who is arguably better at creating for others.  You could argue he's better at creating for others but all advanced stats show that not only is Steph better at Harden at creating for others, but he's arguably the best ever. When Harden doesn't have the ball, he can't create. When Steph doesn't have the ball, he gets double teamed anyways. If you mean pure creation in terms of having the ball in your hands, then maybe, but the off-ball stuff is just a world of difference."
"Honestly, no. I WAS at Oracle when he dropped that halfcourt game winner though, that was fucking crazy. I have nothing but respect for Harden's scoring ability, but IMHO he had a better coach and GM who actually looked for players to compliment him instead of sticking him in a motion offense next to Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, and James Wiseman.  Harden is a fucking killer tho, people love to hate because of the ft's but they forget that's how Kobe and MJ and all ISO scorers since the dawn of basketball have feasted. I also fucking love Harden's shot profile, too. The fact that we got to see arguably the two best scoring backcourt players since MJ go head to head year after year is truly a blessing."
[are you James wiseman](https://youtu.be/hi_f866IhPQ)
You drafted James wiseman   You sucked an entire season for him
"I'm glad. I didn't attempt to break any grounds with my insightful commentary. I just have something to screenshot when James Wiseman pops off and NBA Twitter is hounding everyone for bashing him. Happened with Jordan Clarkson when he was on the Cavs then to the Jazz. I also did it with porzingis on draft night. It's fun, sorry I didnt teach you anything new. You did give me some good insight on Wisemans game, gonna watch some film now have a good Friday my man"
"Idk I've been good about randomly predicting if a player will be good. Watch out in 2 years James Wiseman will be the best center of the guys listed and it wont be close. Capela right now would be about where his value would be though, and I hope the warriors dont end up flipping the top pick for a B tier center"
Not like James Wiseman was gonna stand in Embiid's way anyhow.
"Last decade:  **2020:** James Wiseman (TBC)  **2019:** Ja Morant (potential All Star)  **2018:** Marvin Bagley (bust)  **2017:** Lonzo Ball (solid player but not #2 worthy)  **2016:** Brandon Ingram (All Star)  **2015:** D'Angelo Russell (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2014:** Jabari Parker (bust)  **2013:** Victor Oladipo (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2012:** Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bust)  **2011:** Derrick Williams (bust)"
Do you guys think Luguentz Dort for james wiseman is a good trade now?
"Warriors have won championships with worse Cs than James Wiseman is right now.  Trading him now would be a stupid-ass move. He doesn't get paid enough to carry the possibility of really adding bench depth, because every player in the NBA who's even *slightly* good gets overpaid by desperate teams with the exception of Kevon Looney, who we already have."
"The problem on their team is not Draymond Green, it's James Wiseman. Green is still really good. Wiseman has been singlehandedly tanking the Warriors almost every single minute he's on the court."
"And if they had signed like Robin Lopez instead of drafting James Wiseman they'd have a much better record than that.  Doesn't seem like people are appreciating the extra degree of difficulty of winning with a high school center on the roster. None of the recent ""carry jobs"" have had to do anything like that except LeBron who went 28-27 with a lot of young teammates in 2018-2019 in LA (and those guys were a lot more NBA ready than Wiseman)."
"That’s not necessarily true. Guys that are drafted high need to have the build to develop into NBA players, they aren’t necessarily the best players in that moment against college competition. Like, Markus Howard and Bol Bol aren’t NBA bodies right now and their draft position reflects that, but they’d be more dominant against a team of NCAA players than Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman were before they came to the NBA, IMO. It’s just that wiseman and Edwards have higher ceilings than a guy like Markus Howard or skinny Bol"
James Wiseman: [Prime FMVP Hakeem + Prime MVP/DPOY David Robinson]  That's my absolute zero bias take
"James Wiseman is way too high, id put Patrick, Stewart, and maybe McDaniels over him aside from that I think this is pretty good."
PJ Washington &gt; James Wiseman  don’t see why Hornets do the Hayward+Washington for Wiggins+Wiseman trade  that Pels-Wolves trade is straight garbage
"For James Wiseman? I’d pull the trigger, you have him for 6 years and he’s young"
"Idk maybe its cause his 3 starters other than Draymond are Kelly Oubre, Wiggins and James Wiseman... also Steph won more rings in 5 years than yo entire franchise"
James Wiseman is Big Gym.
"""does Steph say obviously a lot?""  James Wiseman: ""most definitely""."
James wiseman plus who ever Indiana wants at the #4 spot will be 16 mill of salary roughly. Throw paschall in and we got a deal    I think Sabonis and dray integrate well
James Wiseman.
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
Now imagine if James Wiseman was good.
I've not been following Warriors all season. What happened James Wiseman? When did he get injured?
"You guys are so dumb lol.  Do you think James Wiseman was the reason players didn't know how to cut? Do you think James Wiseman was crashing practices and preventing mfers from learning how to set screens?  Wiseman isn't the only reason we've picked it up, people. And Steph will be fine without another MVP we have bigger asperations."
"People don’t understand that vets like Batum, Ibaka, Gasol, Howard, and even Crowder all took team friendly contracts in exchange for playing for a contender  In what world is a warriors team that starts James Wiseman gonna be looked like that?"
I may be in the minority cus I know he's young and raw and has played basically 0 high level ball but man James Wiseman was terrible this year. I'd move him way down he has a lot of improvement to make to even be a useful NBA player
&gt;Goaltending Violations - James Wiseman  Surprised this isn't Hassan Whiteside. I guess he didn't play enough this season.
I got James Wiseman... so l feel you.
"TIL that James Wiseman lead us in scoring once. Ahhh, I wish he didn’t get hurt. Poor guy had such a brutal rookie year."
"&gt;Was James Wiseman a disappointment this season?  Yes.  &gt;Should the Warriors have traded their 2020 draft pick?  With perfect hindsight, I think clearly no. LaMelo &gt; a trade.  &gt;Are the Warriors are great fit for Wiseman?  Yes. They have good coaches and veteran leaders to help him develop.  &gt;Should the Warriors trade him this off-season?  No. Simply returning from his injury, and showing good health, will raise his value from where it is now. Which is quite low.  &gt;Why is he regarded as ""terrible""?  His BBIQ needs a lot of work. He's not used to the speed of the NBA game and doesn't know the reads. There are some fundamental skills, like screen setting, that he doesn't have. He is a big negative on defense, and a small negative on offense right now."
"Once James Wiseman was out for the year, GSW became one of the very best teams in the league. It's crazy, but it's true."
James wiseman isnt being drafted in the top half of that redraft
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
James Wiseman getting traded in the off season no? Steph needs someone ready now
"Giannis is traded to Golden State for James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre and the Minny pick. 😁  Seriously, he goes somewhere in a multi-team trade involving OKC and its 20,000 first round picks. Philly, maybe?"
James Wiseman was a consensus top 3 player in a draft where any of the three could have gone no 1
Just stop it man. This same Warriors team went 15-50 last year without him and he had Kelly Oubre and James Wiseman playing like moldy cheese for half this season.
Imagine if James Wiseman could get that...
"Not sure this makes sense, that pick is probably worth more for cheap depth than the upgrade from Wiggins to Siakam coming off a torn labrum. I admit I'm not optimistic that James Wiseman will make leaps and bounds this summer after getting injured, but this doesn't move the needle for me."
"It's not ""the #2 pick"", it's James Wiseman. At this point, where he was drafted doesn't matter.  Golden State has a narrow window to try to contend for a championship since Steph, Klay, and Draymond are all 31 or older. Wiseman and the #7 pick don't have as much value to them because they want to maximize their chance to win next year."
"&gt; Some other thoughts and chatter:  &gt; Golden State assured itself of an additional first-round pick when Minnesota failed to land in the top 3 on lottery night. The Warriors now have the seventh and 14th picks plus last year’s second overall pick, James Wiseman, and there is a widespread expectation that the Warriors will use No. 7 and Wiseman, in particular, to seek more immediate upgrades to the roster. One name to watch: Pascal Siakam.   Siakam trade doesn’t make sense from salary matching. Warriors would have to ship out Wiggins too.    This is just Hollinger opining on what Warriors “should do” instead of actual news."
I just love when players get judged after their first couple of seasons. I’m pretty sure half this sub has already called James Wiseman a bust
"Bro James wiseman is straight up dog shit. He’s ass, no one wants him."
"Andrew Wiggins, James Wiseman, #7, #14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st   Steph/Dame/Klay/Dray/Looney"
James Wiseman for Jonathan Isaac trade is a wrap if this happens.
"His family took $11,500 from University of Memphis [Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28751421/james-wiseman-opens-heartbreaking-memphis-saga)"
He's the entire reason James Wiseman went to Memphis then got ruled ineligible when the NCAA found out Penny dropped the bag for him.
Curry for sure. He was fighting for the 8 seed with Kelly Oubre and James Wiseman. Then they both went down and it was like taking the weights off of Rock Lee.
"Forget ""everything"". Somehow Beverley gets away with playing the way he does and rarely gets called for *anything*.  On paper, Beverley committed one flagrant foul this season (an elbow to Chris Paul in April, assessed as a Flagrant 2, resulting in an ejection). He was charged with one technical foul during the regular season, in a game against the Warriors in March. He has been assessed two more technicals so far in the playoffs, one in the Dallas series and another in Thursday's game against the Suns. He also fouled out of only game this season, against Brooklyn in February.  Patrick. Beverley.  The guy who never misses an opportunity to get in a jab, or quick bump after the whistle, or a cheap shot while looking the other way.  The guy who spends basically the entire game screaming in people's faces and openly taunting his primary defensive assignment (isn't there literally a rule against taunting?).  I'm not even a Beverley hater, really. I grew up watching 90s basketball, I loved Gary Payton, and I genuinely appreciate the strategic/psychological benefits of having someone like Pat Bev playing for your team.  It's just kind of baffling—given refereeing that often favors offense, particularly the primary ball-handlers Beverley typically defends; over-sensitive refs who have handed out techs for genuinely absurd reasons repeatedly this season (see: JJ Redick passing the ball wrong, Kelly Oubre blowing kisses, Draymond yelling at James Wiseman, etc, etc); and the frequency with which we've seen instant replay resulting in what feel like extremely soft flagrant fouls—that Beverley somehow manages to escape all of that."
James Wiseman was probably the worst starter in the league
"Contrast this with a player like James Wiseman, who is out there to go get his, and also doesn't try as hard on defense.   Just night and day difference."
LaMelo Ball on James Wiseman
Let me guess. Simmons + Embiid + Thybulle + 3 firsts for James Wiseman and a second or some dumbass bullshit right
"If he can get James Wiseman for a f—ing shot, why should he shoot??"
James Wiseman and Jordan Poole
James Wiseman
james wiseman to david robinson
"I've been writing longform posts on the Warriors' season that go deep into shot profiles and lineup stats on a Substack account. I've posted some of them on r/Warriors, but I figure this is as good a time as any to post my season-in-review on Wiseman if you want to get an idea why there's significant skepticism about Wiseman's utility/long term potential.  https://kellyroldan.substack.com/p/the-warriors-season-in-review-james  tl;dr: Wiseman was among, if not the single worst player in the NBA to receive rotation minutes last year by most impact metrics. Wiseman's presence tanked the Warriors' offense and his offensive potential is wildly overstated.   If you want a more forgiving view of Wiseman, I'd point to lineup stats showing that he only spent 6% or so of his non-garbage time next to any two of Mulder, Lee, Poole, and Steph, who are really the only credible shooters the Warriors had. Wiseman also spent had to share the court with Oubre 84% of the time that Wiseman played with Steph.   But I think Wiseman is a long way from being useful and my post dives deep into the weeds of why."
"Thought Hasheem thabeet was drafted this year…oh shit, that’s his son James Wiseman"
Ayton is also an athletic freak of nature  The only center who has entered the league since him that is even remotely comparable to him physically is James Wiseman
&gt;Not trading for Wood doesn’t mean they are wasting Steph’s prime. They can use the draft picks to shore up their wing position.   Use the MLE to sign a center.  Playing James Wiseman major minutes next year and expecting him improve enough to be a factor *and* expecting 2 literal rookies to be ready to compete for a championship right off the bat is absolutely going to be a wasted season.  Any suggestions on a specific centre thats available for the MLE that’s even close to as good as Wood? Literally any name  &gt;You seem unusually upset by Wood slander dude.  Upset how? You’re providing discussion points and I’m answering them lol. Someone providing facts to support their point doesn’t make them upset lmao
"&gt;Not for Wood they aren’t.  He’s yet to be put together a full season.  Yeah because James fucking Wiseman has lmao  &gt;Not to mention Warrior owner flat out said they need cheap rookie contracts moving forward due to luxury tax implications.  Wood is making $13.6 mil per year, a measly $4.5 mil more than Wiseman which could easily be sent back the other way to balance out. He’s literally 10 times the player Wiseman is while making barely more than him.   &gt;They will supplement the center position by signing a stretch 5 in free agency and seeing how Wiseman develops this year. They aren’t selling low. They have all of next season to evaluate.  “They will waste another year of the best shooter to ever live’s prime”  Yeah I doubt that. It’s extremely easy to say “sign a stretch 5” like they grow on trees. There’s a reason you didn’t provide a specific player, it’s because one isn’t available and especially not for the minimum."
Uhmmm pending injuries… second round exit they need time together… its not a james harden kyrie kd thing …   Klay and Steph yeah superstars draymond not   Wiseman needs to develop
Eh????? If you really wanted to make the argument that how stars are needed why you chose to include JAMES WISEMAN
LOL gutting their assets and James wiseman for CHRISTIAN WOOD???   This is an offer for Beal.  Jesus Christ some of y’all are the dumbest motherfuckers around
"Warriors say no. That's way too much. Maybe James Wiseman and 14 and I still don't know about that. Besides, the Warriors already said they aren't interested in trading Wiseman."
"James Wiseman, he finally learned how to catch the ball"
"And therein lies the issue. James Wiseman, the number one pick, missed most of the season and when he *was* on the court, he never looked comfortable in my opinion. He's made some questionable decisions and his skillset is entirely different from Stewart's, it is like comparing Jokic to Embiid in that sense and it comes down to what you want out of your center."
"I could see the Warriors going all in.   Warriors get:   * Jerami Grant   * Cade Cunningham  Pistons get:   * James Wiseman   * Jordan Poole   * Eric Paschall  * Filler contracts (Mulder, Smailagic)  * 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st   Warriors go all in on winning. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney, Cade/Oubre/Grant/Juan/Chriss   Pistons turn one pick and one good player into three blue chip prospects and four first round picks, two of which are for sure lotto picks and one (2025) that will likely be a lotto pick as well once Steph, Klay, Dray age out  Look at it as Wiseman, #7, #14 to move up to #1. Then Poole, Paschall, filler, 2 1sts for Grant."
The last top 3 picks that worried about fit over getting the best player got Marvin Bagley and James Wiseman (Still very early but it seems to be cut that Lamelo is the much better player)
"Probably #1 and no way he slips past #2 as he would be better than at least 17/20 (Ja and LMA are toss-ups imo) out of the last 20 years of #2 picks  2020 James Wiseman, Memphis - Golden State Warriors  **2019 Ja Morant, Murray State – Memphis Grizzlies**  2018 Marvin Bagley, Duke – Sacramento Kings  2017 Lonzo Ball, UCLA – Los Angeles Lakers  2016 Brandon Ingram, Duke – Los Angeles Lakers  2015 D’Angelo Russell, Ohio State – Los Angeles Lakers  2014 Jabari Parker, Duke – Milwaukee Bucks  2013 Victor Oladipo, Indiana – Orlando Magic  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kentucky – Charlotte Bobcats  2011 Derrick Williams, Arizona – Minnesota Timberwolves  2010 Evan Turner, Ohio State – Philadelphia 76ers  2009 Hasheem Thabeet, Connecticut – Memphis Grizzlies  2008 Michael Beasley, Kansas State – Miami HEAT  **2007 Kevin Durant, Texas – Seattle Supersonics**  **2006 LaMarcus Aldridge, Texas – Chicago Bulls (Draft rights traded to Portland Trail Blazers)**  2005 Marvin Williams, North Carolina – Atlanta Hawks  2004 Emeka Okafor, Connecticut – Charlotte Bobcats  2003 Darko Milicic, Serbia &amp; Montenegro – Detroit Pistons  2002 Jay Williams, Duke – Chicago Bulls  2001 Tyson Chandler, Dominguez HS (Calif.) – L.A.

"I don't like KOC, but you're taking this out of context.   The conversation is literally about who in this year will trade their pick for James Wiseman. And most likely it's just Sacramento.   Which makes sense because 1-4 are clearly better than Wiseman even if he's in the same draft. And 5-8 can be better than Wiseman, or equal. 🤷‍♂️  Not really a hot take."
"Why is KOC being a dick to James Wiseman for no reason? After Wiseman has a good bounceback season, KOC will start begging to suck his dick."
"If James Wiseman wants to become a star, he should request a work out with Ayton. He's super humble too, might oblige"
You can't go wrong with a defensive center than can shot create.  James Wiseman and Bagley aren't exactly that.
They had it set up before the injury. They’re just going to wait until Wiseman is fully healthy before they unleash KG on him.   [Myers said this in an interview](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/bob-myers-details-possible-james-wiseman-kevin-garnett-workouts)
"You’re massively underestimating the lack of give-a-fuck among NBA players. You don’t think a team with players like Cade Cunningham, Jalens Suggs and Green, Lamelo Ball, Evan Mobley, James Wiseman level players would win every game by 20? France, Australia, Canada etc have NBA-caliber players in the starting lineup. USA at any level has NBA-caliber players at the end of the bench. Give these kids a chance who haven’t won anything of note to compete on the world stage as Olympians and you’ll see something special"
"This is a bad take, I watched every game he played. Despite being so raw and a half step behind pretty much every action his physical tools still allowed him to make some plays happen.   The potential on this kid is huge. It's just a matter of catching his basketball mind up to this level and adding some grown man strength to that lanky frame.  But he's flashing a jump shot, the 3, soft touch around the rim. People don't realize how good he's really going to be.  I remember last season when everyone was calling Jordan Poole trash and worst player in the league (his issues were a little different from Wiseman's) but this last season he's looking like a legit draft night steal and future 6MOY.   James Wiseman is going to be a perennial all star type of player in a few seasons."
"Do you have an article that mentions this? I found [this article](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-ranked-james-wiseman-top-nba-draft-prospect-joe-lacob-says) that refutes what you stated. Also, another [article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/03/how-one-dinner-helped-james-wiseman-win-over-the-warriors/) states that Myers and Kerr grew on Wiseman."
Say my Wiz happened to get top pick every season for 5 straight seasons and having the hindsight of how players turn out…  C: James Wiseman (2020)  PF: Zion Williamson (2019)  SF: Brandon Ingram (2016)  SG: Donovan Mitchell (2017)  PG: Luka Doncic (2018)  Cause looking at what Ernie did to the team…it hurts too much to think on all the Players we missed due to horrible drafting.
Imagine the “Ben Simmons for James Wiseman” type shit posts if 76ers lose this game
"No, the core 3 are our floor and ceiling. Wiggins is more important than James “barely can catch a basketball” wiseman."
I wish James wiseman was this capable or could be this capable next year but I just don’t see it
Boogie out there fouling like hes James Wiseman
&gt;James Wiseman  &gt;Steven Adams  &gt;John Wall  The slander has gotten way outta hand lmao.  &gt;LeMarcus Alderidge  Dude aint even in the league anymore bruh.
&gt;James Wiseman  c'mon bro
Don’t forget James Wiseman
In fairness MPJ played fewer college games than James Wiseman did and was coming off a pretty bad back injury. A lot of people would have made that pick.
trade mitchell to the warriors for james wiseman
James “Most Definitely” Wiseman
James Wiseman too lmao. Dude plays like a Shaq that can shoot
"Just this season, Aldridge was also cooked by a rookie James Wiseman and Andre Drummond when he was matched up against them."
Moses is raw. He can develop his game. Statistically he had a better overall season than James Wiseman. He is a black hole for rebounds and an easy lob bucket. I’d rather have Moses than a random #16 pick. #16 pick could be anything. Maybe a Moses Brown.
This is prob the dumbest take I’ve seen consistently posted on this subreddit in the 7 years since I’ve been reading it.   Who the fuck are we going to get for James Wiseman?
James Wiseman once he comes back from injury and learns how to play defense and work into the offense and not foul out all the time. Pls.
"So the third team is Facu, Peyton Pritchard, Cole Anthony, Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, pretty much"
Where’s James wiseman
Genuinely surprised James Wiseman didn’t make 2nd team at least.
"James Wiseman is so full of himself  “The question posed to Wiseman this week, after a rehab session, was to give himself a grade for his work, and he was ready with an answer.”  “I’d say probably a B-plus, I guess,” he told NBC Sports Bay Area. “Probably a B-plus, just because due to injuries and stuff. We get injured. That’s part of the game.  “But I’d say I did pretty good. I had a lot of ups and downs, but most of them were positive and I actually learned a lot this year.”  I then asked Wiseman what would have been required to give himself an A.  “Just not getting injured,” he said. “Just to play the whole season, and get as much experience (as possible). I’d most definitely say a B-plus.”"
"Four lottery picks for an undersized shooting guard whose 3pt shooting has declined each of the last four years and who is earning a max deal and plays the same position as another player they already have who is himself on a max deal.   Um...   I mean, Beal is a great player, but they give up something in size and defense and take a HUGE cap hit.   So giving up FOUR players who are all lottery picks.  With those picks this year, the Warriors could get two rotation players, even starters and potentially future All-Stars.  And Wiseman is more what the Warriors need right now than Beal. He's rough around the edges, but he's a teenager.   The Warriors are in a unique situation, like the Lakers were when they got to pick James Worthy or the Celtics when they got to draft Len Bias. Adding great young talent to a dynasty to give them a re-charge and extend their window?   That's better than trading for an undersized shooting guard when they already got Klay Thompson."
THT and James wiseman could be traded for basically any player in the league. Didn’t you know??
That's if another GM would take a bet on James Wiseman becoming a star
King James Wiseman
I can assure you no big time player is signing with a team building around James wiseman for the next 3 years. Hell I can’t even remember the last big free agent signing the Wizards have made
Yup just look at James Wiseman. Should be emulating David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Instead he has said he compares himself to KD. He’s shooting 3s and doing euro-steps on fast breaks. Nothing inherently wrong with that approach but in terms of developing centers he’s working on things that most centers have no business wasting time developing.
"Sure, but all it really takes is one or two guys on the floor who don't get it to mess the whole thing up.  So the Warriors example would be James Wiseman and Kelly Oubre Jr."
"My read from the outside is that Joe and Kirk want to build a contender without Steph, so they are going all-in on building around Wiseman for the post-Curry era. This is James Wiseman's franchise now."
"The word around the league is that the Golden State Warriors are prepared to offer their 2 2021 R1 picks, Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman for this guy"
James wiseman so he could teach them Mandarin Chinese and how to use chopsticks
James wiseman thinks he’s Kevin Durant. They text every day and kyrie compliments Wisemans elite ball handling skills.
"Your entire existence is silly. First of all I never claimed Wiseman is immune from a trade package, I'm addressing people who think he's a complete bust. See the difference? Nah it's probably too subtle for you. Second, the big 3 wants to make their goal to ""focus on the pursuit of a championship"" even to ""CONSIDER using their 2 lottery picks"". No mention of Wiseman. Here is more: ""One team source did say the **Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal**. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.""  So read the quotes properly."
"You're not getting a collection, you'd be trading an all NBA player who just turned 27 for the 7th overall pick and James Wiseman."
"So, my cousin works at the airline that charters all of the warriors flights and she recently told me she was asked to have a plane ready for James Wiseman to Dulles Airport this Friday. Not only this, but she told me there was an odd request to have chopsticks served instead of traditional utensils and have a specific intermediate textbook of mandarin in the seats pocket, alongside a GoPro so he could capture his journey to the Washington wizards, and share it first on his weibo show"
"Yes they will. My cousin works at the airline that charters all of the warriors flights and she recently told me she was asked to have a plane ready for James Wiseman to Dulles Airport this Friday.

James wiseman
"Maybe 10 years ago. In today’s game there’s like 5 impactful team-leading centers. James wiseman very well could be Clint capela . The odds are more in favor of the wings.  As far as Wiggins, in a hypothetical trade to the wizards he has no value whatsoever.  He doesnt make others better, he’s 25 so he’d be too old for their new group.   It really is amazing how much he’s changed his perception based on  1 year. This sub LOVES Andrew Wiggins. It’s ridiculous"
I agree that James Wiseman is a car.
"""I have to make a decision before the draft."" - Sounds like someone who talked to Draymond about the Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, and 14th package.   Draft picks are a lot more attractive when you're the team making the call, and the Wizards probably could even send Wiseman, 7th, and 14th to another team to move into the Top 4 to get someone they really like if they're not in love with Wiseman or the options at 7.  This trade just makes too much sense not to happen. The salaries also work out in a way that allows the Warriors to take back another player in addition to Beal, removing the depth problem that Wiggins trades present.  If the trade is executed after the Warriors make their selections, with the Warriors picking for the Wizards (as most draft trades are executed) it also opens up Golden State trading another first round pick without having to redo the protections on the pick owed to Memphis.  Final trade should be   **Wizards Trade**  * Bradley Beal * Davis Bertans  **Warriors Trade**  * Andrew Wiggins * James Wiseman * 7th pick in 2021 draft * 14th pick in 2021 draft * Unprotected 2028 first round pick  That's a heck of a package, and Golden State gets to go all in on the last years of Curry's prime."
"James Wiseman, Jordan Poole, 6th and 13th picks"
"Correct me if I'm wrong. Pick 7, 14 this year, James wiseman, some picks and pick swaps going in to 2030 when Steph and Klay and Dray will for sure be out of the team will be a hell of a haul. Why the warriors would do that for Dame doesn't make sense to me, but definitely for Beal."
james wiseman has not even played a full season of NBA basketball
"Wiseman+7+14 for 2028 James Wiseman, who says no?"
"Well if we keep James wiseman we’d have dibs on China because of his superb mandarin skills, his bolstering audience through his weibo show, and his sneaker deal with Anta"
"There is an idea of a James Wiseman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real Wiseman, only an entity, something illusory."
Pfft overreaction James Wiseman is gonna be the greatest center since Demarcus Cousins you just watch
2028 James Wiseman is the center they've always wanted
Is James Wiseman not the center they've always wanted?
"The Warriors fucked up last season, they really had a chance to the WCF or even the Finals if they had traded Wiseman and not traded for Oubre (just removing those 2 they would have been a playoff team without playing the Play In). The next year would be harder but the West is still relatively open.  Whatever they do, I think they need more dept and someone than when Steph is sit could provide scoring. If I was their GM I will target Melo as a FA with the minimum and Otto Porter for a mid level exception. Also Boogie Cousins could be helpful for the RS (not much in the PO) and he already knows the team and if I remember correctly he was friends with some of the guys there.  Other players they may target are: DRose as Steph backup, Robin Lopez and James Johnson (to add some big bodies too).  If they manage to add some of those guys they then just really need to turn Wiseman+Wiggins in something good, but I will also consider just packing Wiseman and one of the picks for useful guys (maybe Marcus Smart?), in the end they already had star power, and it's probably better to add good specialist."
Wiggins was spotted sitting with James Wiseman sitting at the social outcast table in the warriors cafeteria while Klay Thompson reportedly was handing out invites on a team boat ride without them.
"Google will stop trolling you once we trade Wiggins, James wiseman, 7 &amp; 14 for Beal and show the world that the real warriors culture is championships."
"Yea…kawhi Leonard is totally comparable to guys like James wiseman, Damian Jones, Jacob Evans, Patrick Flynn, etc."
I will personally drive James wiseman to the airport and pay his costs for breaking his apartment lease to leave the warriors.
"&gt;One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal.

But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  Good thing Steph hasn't signed an extension yet. I hope he forces them to trade Wiseman."
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors."
"James wiseman for Cade. Cade is like Luka whereas Wiseman is Giannis M-W, Ayton Th-Sa, and Embiid on Sunday’s."
The only way I would be happy with this is if we trade Westbrook for tht kuz and shrod. Then we would then trade Beal to the warriors for their picks James Wiseman and Wiggins. But if that doesn't happen no other Scenario makes me happy.
"MPJ, Jaylen Brown, Simmons, Fox, Murray, Edwards, hell any of the top 4 guys in this draft are all way better gets than James Wiseman. Y’all seriously think we want a raw big with injury concerns? We’ve done that many times already, thanks.  And we can always get a deal where we get 1sts from multiple teams, you’re right we don’t want GS’s crap 1sts cause they’ll be lower."
