Kelly olynyk  Daniel Theis  Richaun Holmes  Hissan Whiteside  Khem Birch  Bismack Biyombo  These are the best guys available that can get signed under the MLE  I could see a world where they trade for Mason plumlee maybe?
&gt;Richaun Holmes  Always liked him when he was on the Sixers. Has he really been Sacramento's best player?
Drummond is awful. Half his offensive rebounds are from his own layups that he misses. Richaun Holmes is substantially better. The kings have a transition based offense run by fox - Holmes fits in well with that strategy. They don’t want Drummond....
"I guess it's a mix of both. I put underrated because most of the players I listed don't really get that much attention (ex: Richaun Holmes). But yeah, surprising performances seems better."
Richaun Holmes!
"Lotta Raptors fans like Richaun Holmes (including me), but I don't see SAC parting with him."
This dude eating me alive this week.. my richaun Holmes 6 block night looks like Diet Pepsi
I’m more interested in Richaun Holmes moms twitter than what LaVar has to say at this point
Alright here's a list of guys from mid-majors that had at least decent careers.

"Can't think of a 2nd guard for my 2nd round/undrafted Hinkie lineup. McConnell, Covington, Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes. Just a handful of the best role players in the league."
"I can’t speak to games against Richaun Holmes or anybody like that, but what did you think would happen putting him on Embiid? The most dominant player in the NBA and an elite flopper?"
Add Richaun Holmes as their backup center and nobody scoring on them.
"Yeah man, boucher is easily first team all nba this year and not just a longer Richaun Holmes"
"Richaun Holmes had 16 and 7 on like 60% shooting, he was helpful haha"

Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes
Richaun Holmes is having himself a year. He's got comparable counting stats to some of the guys on this list and he's leading the league in FG%.
Richaun Holmes baby.
Richaun holmes?
"Damn, didn't know that about LMA. Last season he was shooting like 39% from 3 and coming off an all-star season. Idk whether his performance is a product of playing with a sub-par Spurs team or his age. Could honestly be a bit of both.   McGee seems like more of a solid backup center, he has asthma and can't play heavy minutes sadly. Drummond would be nice in a simplified role - he should be a pure rim running center but he tries doing extra stuff and gets carried away. Should stick to rebounding and dunks honestly.   Richaun Holmes on the Kings has been really good as well - Kings have a logjam at the 5 so depending on how good the Kings are this season maybe they try to move them."
I had some fucking clown on this sub last year legitimately tell me Zach LaVine is not a better player than Richaun Holmes. Saying zach aint a top 50 player in the league. Too lazy to find that convo and that guy but fuck that guy.
Richaun holmes is so good
"I'm more confident in Richaun Holmes scoring than Bagley. Watch some games, Bagley just isn't good"
He's absolutely booty.   Sit his ass and make him watch Richaun Holmes outplay him the full game.
I'm convinced Richaun Holmes at 5mil is the best contract value in the nba right now
Richaun Holmes
Richaun Holmes is a poor man's Montrezl
"i agree with you, I had hopes he'd fit in as a 3&amp;D big but he got outplayed by Richaun Holmes so he had to go. he wouldn't be too bad as a backup playing 15 min a game for your team."
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, Boban?"
ARGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!! \*takes short deep breath\* AARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!! \*Richaun Holmes says\* UNNNGGGGGGGHHHHHHH! Flex on them!
I need a 60 minute video of Richaun Holmes flexing.
Give Richaun Holmes and the Holmes family a max contract.
Richaun Holmes is automatic with his push shot  Harrison Barnes was also our saviour this game
"Richaun holmes carried. Clutch 3, clutch freethrows, 5 4th quarter blocks, 7 offensive rebounds. Fucking beast"
"My only knock on Ayton is he’s a strength and gather jumper, he’s not a bounce jumper like Marvin Bagley or richaun holmes. But he’s strong as shit"
Richaun Holmes
Richaun Holmes isn't on the Nuggs *or* Sixers though?
Richaun holmes is making 5m averaging 13 points and 8.5 rebounds
Nominating Richaun Holmes
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."

Richaun Holmes is a target I want them to go after.  Maybe San Antonio does a contract dump trade of Norm + filler for LMA?
Add a Richaun Holmes type at centre and that's a good team next season.
Who will stop the vaunted Tyrese Haliburton/Richaun Holmes pick and roll?
I had some fucker a year ago tell me richaun holmes contributes more on a basketball floor than him lmao
Uhhh yeah he's terrible. Get Richaun Holmes if possible
"Since it seems like you have thought about this somewhat, where would you put Richaun Holmes?"
do kings have no set plays with richaun holmes or something
"Richaun Holmes, Dario saric, Jerami grant, Zach Lavine, Markelle Fultz, tj McConnell, kristaps porzingis, devonte graham, Roco, Ja, nerlens noel"
"Is it weird? Everyone’s got parents.   Like the OP brings up with Richaun Holmes having a mother who’s very positive, supportive, and welcoming— there’s a flip side to the shitty NBA parent, you just don’t hear about it because it doesn’t lead to dramatic events."
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
G: Monte Morris G: Paul George F: Got overpaid this summer but Jerami Grant F: Injured but I love Jonathan Isaac C: Richaun Holmes
"To be fair, I thought Walton would undeservedly give Whiteside and Bagley more minutes but good on him to give the superior player, Richaun Holmes, all the minutes he deserves."
Oh. Thought she was Richaun Holmes’
Can tell you’re not a kings fan. They’re sick of his shit too. His defense is dog shit and he’s worse for them than Richaun Holmes. He’s shown very little improvements since coming to the league. He’s a bust.
"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
Wasn’t he on The Process Sixers?  Just like Jerami Grant and Richaun Holmes?
Bro he's getting outplayed by Richaun Holmes.
The world needs more richaun holmes mom's and less bagleys dads
Makes me smile seeing Process era Sixers finding their way around the league.   Christian Wood  Richaun Holmes  Jerami Grant   Others like Tj McConnell and Ish Smith  Put some respect on Sam Hinkie's name.
Richaun Holmes is terrible. He's got bricks as hands. Guy can't catch anything that is not spoonfed to him.
"I was a Brett defender for a long time but I was wearing blinders, he wasn't building the culture he was pretending he was. It wasn't really that crowded. Jah was pretty obviously a bust. Holmes was actually promising. The MO should've been to get rid of Jah and let nerlens and holmes compete. Embiid wasn't playing at this point. Nerlens was our best player for two years and Brett decided to make him a 3rd string center and it infuriated nerlens and the situation got really volatile. We had a hole at backup center for 2 years. One of those years we had richaun holmes who Brett was also committed to burying. How do you go from having too many centers to having a giant hole there and you're playing amir johnson for two years? That's all on Brett brown. Nerlens and embiid were best friends. The situation was obviously salvageable between them. The guy who was committed to not letting it work was Brett."

"that &amp; avoiding the luxury tax this season which gains greater flexibility for the Celtics this summer.  If they're going to go all-in on a trade I would rather see Vucevic or a playmaking/creating guard added, or someone like Bjelica or a very small, peripheral move.

Are you talking about the same Shaq that doesn't know who Richaun Holmes is? A player on a team that he is a minority owner of?
Free Richaun Holmes.
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."

Richaun Holmes has serious hops. And he like never misses that push shot. I have been keeping an eye on him for a little while now. Getting that underrated vibe now. I haven't followed his defensive ability tho...
dogshit defense from the Nets. Getting torn up by richaun holmes
Richaun Holmes push shot from anywhere 😂
"Why is he such a good defender but his team has a middle of the pack DRtg? Gobert is a much better help defender it’s not only about blocking shots. Positioning on the pick and roll, and help defense is very important. Also not fouling. Hassan Whiteside can rack up blocks but that doesn’t make him a better defender than Richaun Holmes."
Lol I hated the love fest for TJ personally but there are plenty of those deep bench players home town fans fall in love with. Mine used to be Richaun Holmes but I think he got a little too established and popular to still be in that category.
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."

Swear to god I had a clown here maybe 2-1.5 years ago trying to tell me Richaun Holmes does more to help a team win than Zach LaVine. And also that Zach LaVine isn’t a top 50 player in the nba. Wish I remembered that accounts name because that guy deserves to be clowned
"It’s been a slow season for him but I think he needed a bit of a regression in order to improve like we’re starting to see. Seems like his role was challenged by Richaun since it turns out Holmes does the things the Kings need more (defense, pick and roll threat, and off ball movement) and enough of what Bagley does to be a more positive player on the court. Luke got harsh with the minutes, only giving him about 25 and then dropping it to about 20-21 a game by cutting all of his 4th quarter minutes. I think reality set in for him that he needs to improve those elements of his game to even get minutes, where before he might have thought his scoring and rebounding was enough on its own.   Since that stretch he’s been far more focused on game, giving a much more consistent energy on defense (even if it’s not always good defense, he’s hustling), being much more active everywhere (keeping a lot of possessions alive with offensive boards), playing within the offense more amd just generally making a more positive impact. Not to mention he’s doubled the number of 3s he takes per game from his rookie year (1.5 to 2.7) and is hitting 39.2% of them. The three point shot was work he put in during the offseason."
"Dame  Marcus Smart  Jerami Grant  RoCo  Bam   Bench: Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Royce O Neale, Richaun Holmes"
Richaun Holmes should start taking notes
i thought it was a glitch when I saw his name still on the waiver list on one of my leagues i instantly snatched him up sorry Richaun Holmes :( ur still a beast
"Role players on non contending teams get underrated.  For example a guy like Richaun Holmes is better than a lot of starting centers in the NBA.  Kyle Anderson is a great defender, a good passer/pnr operator and this year he's even shooting well on decent volume, he'd be a starter on a lot of contenders, but he's on the Grizzlies so nobody cares.  Valanciunas is better than he was on Toronto, but he's not on a contender anymore so nobody cares.  Justin Holiday is an elite 3&amp;D guy, legit one of the best in the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other end role players on elite teams either get overrated/overhyped (Beverley, Caruso, Horton Tucker, DiVincenzo...) Or some often get overscrutinized  (KCP, Danny Green,...)"
"Kings are super fun this year. Fox is breaking out, Haliburton won't go under the radar for much longer, and Richaun Holmes is always a great time."
Richaun Holmes
Bruh look at that Richaun Holmes contract. Trading for Harrison Barnes. Deciding to rebuild from Cousins with Fox as the core. Honestly he's had some pretty good hits.
"Oh what could've been if the Sixers kept Hinkie.  Embiid-Saric-Grant-Covington-Simmons, with Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and TJ McConnell off the bench. Or maybe Redick is still signed then either Saric or Grant can come off the bench.  Also knowing Hinkie, he would've gotten a much better return from trading Noel, Okafor, and Fultz."
We have Richaun Holmes thank you.

"i'd recommend it, and ticket prices have come down.  The funny thing is that players are interacting with the fans there.  Some good like Twolves clapping back at fans ragging on Reid, and Mike Scott dapping up a fan and talking to them for a bit after he spilled his drink on a ball that went out of bounds.    Bad was that Holmes got a fan tossed for no fucking reason b/c he got into his feelings.  I love Richaun, even went to see an 87ers game bc he was down there.  But he was in his feelings and a fan yelled something like ""that's why we traded you"".  which was stupid, but Holmes and he kept jawing.   Around halftime when they went to the tunnel a bunch of kings started talking shit to this guy and eventually security kicked him out.     TL;DR fans can't hide in anonymity and players are still getting used to being heckled"
"7th worst record has a 32% chance to get top 4, that's pretty solid odds. What serviceable big turns this team into a contender? We aren't gonna have cap space after this offseason and the only serviceable big that might make sense is Richaun Holmes. But let's say he does sign here, we are not winning anything with Siakam as our best player, and if the goal is being a contender not just being a playoff team losing maybe 5 extra games down the stretch doesn't suddenly break the will of this team and turn them into losers. We aren't signing max players so that doesn't matter and players who aren't getting the max will go where the money is. I'm fine with throwing 20+ million at Holmes because it's either him or nobody essentially but we need him in addition to a potential pick. You say losing brings out the worst but the best way to not lose next year or the year after is getting a stud in the draft and the best chance is a top 4 pick."
We need an elite rim runner to pair with Luka. Good guard depth and wing in my opinion. Need someone out there who’s job is just to catch lobs from luka (someone like John Collins would be perfect). Additionally a backup center would be nice (moving off of WCS and Dwight Powell). Another potential solution is to sign someone like Richaun Holmes and start him at the 4 alongside KP.
"Yeah everyone has been freaking out about how our centers aren't good as if we'd be contenders with a center. Like obviously we need one but I don't think it changes a whole lot. We aren't gonna have max cap space or anything I just say hope for a top 4 pick, throw a boatload of money at like Richaun Holmes and hope it works out."
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"

"They have two good young guys, Fox and Haliburton. Bagley looks pretty meh, especially for his draft position, and the rest of the team is old. Even Richaun Holmes who seems like a young dude is 27."
"&gt;He isn't shooting efficiently from all over the floor - his eFG% is like 51st in the league, he is efficient at the line and that brings up his TS%.  Ok fine, I will admit from looking at his shooting splits there's a chance he's below average from 3-10 feet. Other than that though he's good at the rim, probably slightly above average from 10-16 feet, maybe one of the best season ever from 16 ft to 3, and very good from 3. His eFG is 51st out of 125 which given his volume is good.  &gt;Elite scorers are guys that have both high eFG% AND TS%. Making FT's does not make someone an elite scorer.  I don't get this argument. If a hypothetical player scored 50 PPG just from free throws I would say they are elite at scoring. Scoring means scoring points, and free throws get you points. If you want to see who the elite scorers in this league are, look at the league leaders in PPG. If you look at guys with high eFG% and TS% then again you think the elite scorers in the league are Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, and Richaun Holmes. Being able to shoot matters of course, but being able to score is more important when we're talking about scoring."
"They have a strong correlation, but they're not the same thing. Take a look at the [league leaders in TS%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) as an example. Do you think that Joe Ingles, Ivica Zubac, Richaun Holmes, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris are elite scorers? No, they're good in a more limited role. If they needed to shoot as much as someone like Embiid their efficiency would likely crater. Being an elite scorer requires being efficient at a high volume. So yes, they're related, but they're not the same thing."
"He looked surprisingly good vs Vuc, had 4 blocks  But yeah a defensive C like Bam is always gonna cause him some problems. I can give him some slack for tonight, problem is when he does this vs Richaun Holmes lol"
" Dude is shooting 52.7% from midrange on 3.5 attempts a game. There's multiple dudes shooting higher percentages and on higher volumes this year alone   https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?sort=Mid-Range%20FGM&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone  He's killing it in the in the paint that isn't the  restricted area, but a lot of those are various hooks and baby floaters etc (and if you're just looking at that, Richaun Holmes is more efficient that Jokic from there)  His midrange jump shooting isn't anything special."

"Depending on how far you wanna go back, I’d go Sixers.   For this exercise, I’m assuming only they get the power of foresight. Just for a quick primer, not getting to deep into late picks and such:  Draft Devin Booker instead of Jahlil Okafor  Draft Tatum at 1, or trade back from 3 with Sacramento for 5 and 10 (was a rumored possibility at the time) and take 2 of Fox/Mitchell/Bam.  And then instead of drafting Zhaire Smith, draft SGA.  Additionally, they’d retain some selection of Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, Covington, Saric, etc. to fill out the team with those new guys, Ben, and Joel."

"And like a bank, they might not know what to do with the money.  The challenge with getting all this draft capital is you only have so many roster spots. Look at the tanking Sixers and all the talent that passed through their doors and walked: TJ McConnell (leads the league in steals per game right now), Richaun Holmes (14/9/2 on SAC right now). Jerami Grant (23PPG right now, at least they got Ilyasova and Maxey for him). Glenn Robinson (traded for some 2nds last year by GSW). JaVale McGee (3 rings since).   If don't consolidate those picks, they're going to have to let a lot of talent walk"

Richaun Holmes

Any talk of trading Richaun Holmes? UFA after this year and you could probably get a mid to late 1st round pick for him.
"8-9 with Wood, 3-17 without him.   Magic are 6-2 with Fultz, 7-24 without him.    Kings are 15-19 with Richaun Holmes, 0-4 without him.  Pacers are 16-18 with Mcconnell, 1-2 without him.

"Yeah, it's why the best shooters/scorers have good floaters.  Also that weird push shot Richaun Holmes has is ridiculously efficient."

"Hawks were in control after a very good 1st quarter from the kings. The kings had a good 4th to bring it close, but in the end it just wasnt enough.   Fan take for 1st game all year of kings I've seen  I hate to say it but I really think the kings may have to tank a few more years to get Fox help. Buddy Hield is stealing a living, he looked washed last night. Fox had an Incredible game, but he just has to get his buckets through 3 guys every possession, it's hard to do that consistently, he needs help. Call me a hater but bagley didnt look good either. Lots of jumps on fakes, fouls, and missed shots. Richaun holmes is a tank of a player and hilarious to watch - I'd hate to play against him. Now that LP has been fired, walton is the worst coach in the nba.   Hawks side - Trae looked fucking great last night. 28 points on 5/10 from three 🤩. Snell is looking like a legit starting option IMO. Hes not a box score champ but he defends well and moves the ball. Kevin Huerter is very hit or miss for me, I like the reads he makes but he has to be more aggressive in the midrange, hes got a great feel around the high post. Capela could've been an all star, and he is still manhandling grown men. He had a great game, the hackapella was lame as fuck from L alton. JC looks like hes let the contract situation get to him - hes not playing calm and collected and seems to be forcing the action quite a bit, disrupting the flow of things. Gallinari has been an integral piece of the hawks current 4 game streak, and is starting to look like the guy who got paid to be the vet. Amazing assists, slo mo drives to the rim, mid range turnarounds, and of course his 3 ball. Still a traffic cone but hes looking more comfortable on a game by game basis and we are reaping the benefits of this. Bogi has been anemic but he will come thru, hes very out of rhythm right now and will get back into the swing of things come playin tournament time.  Skwah on 4 game win streak, first since 2018 and it's a gr8 day to be a hox fan."

"If we're competing, I'd want one of Richaun Holmes, Marvin Bagley, Khem Birch or Mo Bamba. All those guys should be within our price range (Raptors can't really match salaries for Drummond).  But if we're trading Kyle Lowry, then I'd want at least a prospect, 1FRP and expiring salary. Ideally, I'd wanna get an additional pick or some decent role players with the returning salary."
Richaun Holmes and Robert Covington
"I have TJ/Grant/RoCo/Wood/Embiid as my starting 5. My bench would be Richaun as my 6th man, Ish Smith, Okafor, JaKarr Sampson, and Stauskas. The bench after Smith and Holmes is a struggle. But this is a solid 3/4 seed."
He's 19 ffs you fucking inbred donkeys. Chill tf out he's a young dude and made legit one mistake fucking richaun Holmes didn't get hate for breaking bubble rules but Wiseman does one tiny mistake and the whole world is on him
Somebody has to go after Richaun Holmes. That dude is a team player and belongs on a team that's trying to win.
The spirit of the Antawn Jamison big man push shot is alive in Richaun Holmes. Antoine Walker also shot a bunch but missed most of the time as with most of his arsenal.

I think it'll be below 10M a year but some team will take a flier on him (I think Charlotte is a real possibility).  I'm going to be very interested to see how much of a bag some the other free agent centers get such as Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen. They're both fundamentally sound rim runners who fit into their roles with a lot less negative qualities compared to Drummond.
PG: Steph Curry (43 mil)  SG: Malik Beasley (13.3 mil)  SF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (27.6 mil)  PF: Zion Williamson (10.2 mil)  C: Richaun Holmes (5 mil)  For 99.1 million
"Yeah Zion’s volume is incredible so this isn’t at all to take away from him. But Tatum has been pretty incredible in his own right though he’s been doing it “quietly” so it hasn’t been too talked about.   In the restricted area since all star break, Tatum’s scored both more efficiently and on a higher volume on guys such as: Jokic, Embiid, Butler, Bam, Simmons, KAT, Kyrie, Curry, Kanter, and Dame.  He’s actually tied for the eighth most made shots in the restricted area since all star break with Harrell. Out of the top ten, only Giannis, Gobert, and Ayton have better efficiency. Expand that to top 30 guys, and MPJ and Olynyk are the only other guys with better efficiency. They’re scoring on like 15% less volume and by the time you get to number 31, you have Richaun Holmes shooting .2% better on less than 75% the volume."
De'aron Fox/  Tyrese Haliburton/  Luka Doncic/  Harrison Barnes/  Richaun Holmes/   Sheesh that line-up could compete with anyone in the league. Legitimately one BPA away in 2018.  If you're going to pick Bagley at least trade back to pick-up an asset to compensate for your dumb ass pick.
"Issue is that Bagley is a PF, Ayton is a C. I don't think Ayton's *that* much better than Richaun Holmes, and I don't see a two big lineup working for the Kings- the fit would be pretty bad.   As for the Suns, they need Ayton's size, y'all are a relatively small team. Bagley's smaller frame and fragility wouldn't work well."

Package him and the Minny pick for a solid wing defender and sign Nerlens Noel or Richaun Holmes.
imagine if they just had Richaun Holmes..  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   and Luka Doncic
"Dwight, Richaun Holmes and Nerlens Noel all make less than Jax and are better right now."
"wait you mean Grant Williams right? I assume Robert Williams will be starting. if by chance u mean Grant, I don't really see that working out. From what I've seen, he's really not that great of a player. Y'all definitely should try to avoid playing an undersized center rotation for yet another year especially considering you play in the conference with Joel Embiid, Giannis, and Bam all playing on top eastern conference teams... I think you guys need another real big (look how dwight howard has done wonders for the Sixers this year, a backup center that is essentially a starting quality big is extremely important for a successful team IMO). I think you guys should sign someone like Dwight Howard(although, as I Sixers fan, I hope we re-sign him), Javale McGee, Richaun Holmes, or Nerlens Noel"
"PJ Tucker doesnt post as much anymore but he used to post a picture of pancakes like every morning, it was great.  My favorite current twitter follow is Richaun Holmes' mom. She's adorable"
THE Richaun Holmes???? The Mavericks killer????? Godamn
Richaun Holmes floater haunts my dreams
Psh Lakers fans are so spoiled and they’re still trying to recruit Richaun Holmes
"Send CJ to the Celtics in a deal for Marcus Smart. Throw a bag at Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, and Richaun Holmes. Make some other moves with their younger guys.  Starting Lineup would be Dame, Smart, Covington, Holmes and Nurkic with Green, Iggy and Melo on the bench. Are they top contenders? No but defensively they are much improved."
Richaun Holmes and Jerami Grant turned into pretty good players too
Richaun Holmes has the best floater in the NBA.
"Funnily enough between Nerlens, RoCo, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes and Christian Wood we actually had some decent NBA talent (now, at least) on the 10-72 roster"
"How many do.  Detroit has Stewart who has proven to be an intriguing prospect and certainly flashes potential as a starting caliber big.  OKC has Moses Brown and his rebounding is a huge weapon.  We have WCJ with his versatile defense and rim running.  Houston has Christian a wood.  Minny has Towns.  Cleveland has Jarrett Allen in restricted free agency.  Every lottery team has a center prospect that they want to either develop or has proven to be capable of playing 25 minutes a night as a starter.  Most teams downsize anyway so it’s not like they need a big man for 35 minutes as their first,second or third option.  I’d rather pay all of those guys 10 million a year going forward than eventually having to give Evan Mobley his rookie extension if he isn’t going to be able to be the best player on a championship team.  If he can be that guy than frankly he should be the clear cut number one pick because Superstar big men are extremely valuable but starting centers or lower tier all star centers are frankly found everywhere in the league.  A team can sign Richaun Holmes and probably get a decent starting center who can switch and run the pick and roll.  Star guards and wings are steal way more valuable for championship teams these days."
He's only playing 15 mpg because 1. he's been hurt a bit and 2. Richaun Holmes is better and 3. they seem interested in seeing what they have in Chimezie Metu
"I think every fan of a team thinks that window is larger than it actually is, with the bottom end being very team friendly. I agree that in practice it's a much smaller window, because agents know that there's always going to be a team with cap space that will overpay, even if they're just doing it to be an asshole.  I want to cite the LaVine situation where the Kings came in and offered a bunch (I remember Bulls fans being mad about that), but that rings hollow now because he's since proven that even the Kings offer underpaid him. The Kings did manage to keep Buddy Hield before he hit RFA, but his inconsistent play since then makes it seem like an overpay, but I swear someone would've thrown more money at him than the Kings gave him. For Bogdanovic this pass summer, the offer was high enough that the Kings couldn't stomach matching it, and I'm afraid the same is going to happen with Richaun Holmes. I think Otto Porter might be an example where signing with the team for a couple million a year less would've actually mattered for the team since the Wizards already had a couple massive contracts, but that doesn't really apply to the Cavs' situation."
"Of the ones you mentioned, Simmons, Richaun Holmes, and Saric all improved a lot under Brett.  That doesn't mean that Holmes and Saric didn't improve later, tho."
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
"he jokes, but richaun holmes easily makes us a playoff team"
Richaun Holmes 🔫
"They got Adebayo already, he embodies balls to the wall. I'd throw in Myles Turner too, he goes for every block (almost a 1:1 foul and block ratio lmao). Richaun Holmes is pure hustle too."
Jae isn't a big. Giannis is probably the closest comparison for a tall guy. Richaun Holmes overall most hustle from a 5.
"Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, and Richaun Holmes are all better than whoever OKC is rolling out unless Dort plays."
He’s been a terrible defender his entire career. More reps isn’t going to stop Richaun Holmes and Dwight Powell from torching him.
Richaun Holmes is all they need.
"I think part of the confusion is he was 6'8"" in college (https://bgsufalcons.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/richaun-holmes/5020) and came into the NBA listed at 6'9"" in shoes (https://www.nbadraft.net/players/richaun-holmes/). But you are correct that this has been updated."
"They called this on Richaun Holmes down the stretch of the Lakers game, though it wasn’t blocked"
"Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes too. It’s more than 4-5…"
And Richaun Holmes!
It was more so we can’t pick both unless we wanted to cap out with bogi and Richaun Holmes lol and they already signed Buddy under the old front office
"okay. they drafted four quality rotation players after pick 20 in a four year span before 2020. that’s well above average  edit: not to mention Jeremi Grant in 14, and Richaun Holmes in 15"

"Had LAL ML as part of 2 separate 3-leg parlays with other 2 legs locked up (PHO ML, MIL ML and PHO double result, MIL double result).  Also had 2-leg parlay with AD 24+ points and Schroder 8+ assists.  Almost had all those locked up.  AD ended with 22 points and Schroder 7 assists.  Fucking trash LAL, can't even beat a horrible SAC team that is dead last in DRTG and gives up the most ppg in the league.  Oh yeah they were also missing Fox and Barnes, two of their top scores.    Lebron, AD, and company really just lost @ home vs. Tyrese Haliburton, Richaun Holmes, and company.  While up 10 to start the 4th.  LAL managed a measley 18 points in the 4th.  AD is subbed out to start the 4th, doesn't enter back until 6:44 left and lead cut to 3.  LAL scored only 8 points in that 5 minutes and 16 seconds.    In the last 6:44 of the game, Richaun Holmes scores 8 points, 4 of which came via free throws.  Terrence Davis scored 7 points.  Haliburton sealed the game w 2 FT's.  During that same 6:44 remaining, AD scored 4 points, Lebron scored 5 points, and Drummond scored 1 point.  4 turnovers by LAL (2 by Lebron, and those occured within 24 seconds of one another).  4-9 on fg attempts (they only managed two attempts from 6:44 left to 3:11 left, over 3 and a half minutes of game time, and only 2 fg attempts?!?).  Committed 5 fouls which led to 8 SAC points.  Had 5 rebounds which led to a whopping 1 point for LAL.  Had possession for roughly 3:16 in that stretch and managed to only make 4 fg's.  Had 2 blocks which resulted in a whopping 0 points.    I know Lebron just came back tonight and AD is still getting back into rhythm, but my god, what a horrible stretch of the last half of the 4th quarter to lose to the worst defense in the league.  LAL has 3rd best DRTG in the league and SAC had 7 players in double digits.  LAL 7-28 from 3pt!  LAL got outscored by 5 in FT's.  They let a SAC team averaging 79.3% from FT go 90.9% tonight.    4 of the SAC players who scored double digits average under 8 ppg each.  2 of them average 5.2 and 4.3 ppg.    LAL had 21 turnovers.  Their 5th leading scorer in Kuzma managed to score 2 points (!) in 22 minutes.  Only had one starter (Lebron) with a positive +/-.  Had 12 blocks compared to 3 for SAC.    That was a bit therapeutic to write all that.  Sure I'm upset about losing those bets, but it's not like I'm losing my house (say less!).  I know this has been probably one of the weirdest NBA seasons as well due to the shortened, compressed nature of it, and the empty stands and other impacts due to COVID.  I also know LAL is still a title contender, but man, what a loss today.  Vs. the worst defense in the league, a team that had lost 12 of their last 15, and who in their previous game gave up 154 points and lost by 49, a team missing two of their top scorers.    Obviously will take some time for Lebron and AD to get to 100%, but besides them, the team was fully healthy (besides Caruso).  I don't think the Lakers are a team most will want to face in the playoffs, but this game shows how much the injuries to AD and Lebron have affected this team.    Only 9 games left for LAL and 22 days till playoffs start.  I'd be a little bit concerned if I were a LAL fan."
"I watched the entire fucking game. I watched our starting back court brick 3 after 3. I watched Dennis drive into the lane multiple times while turning the ball over. I watched AD get beat off the dribble Richaun Holmes and Terence Davis. I watched LeBron turn the ball over time and time again and take horrible fucking 3 pointers.   Drummond isn't forcing Dennis/KCP to miss wide open looks. He's not forcing Dennis to slip and fall every time he drives into the lane. He's not forcing AD to fail to move guys way smaller than him or turn the ball over the second he gets doubled. He's not forcing LeBron to take dogshit heat checks. Hell the only 3 LeBron made was off a good Drummond screen.   I've said it a billion times now but while Drummond didn't play particularly well by any means, this loss is on LeBron/AD/Dennis/KCP. Not him."
"Just as responsible? Are you fucking high? Sure Drummond's defense was a factor in the loss but it's our starting backcourt shooting 0-9 from 3 and the team as a whole having more turnovers than **the Kings without Fox** that contributed way more. Not to mention our piss poor free throw shooting.   Drummond didn't have a great game by any means but fuck I'll take his 17/7 on 7-11 shooting. At least he contributed *something*. Meanwhile AD can't back down 6'4 guys, is getting beat off the dribble by **RICHAUN HOLMES** and our ""shooters"" can't hit shit (outside of BMac)."
Need richaun Holmes in charlotte immediately
"How is Richaun Holmes destroying a big lineup that consists of AD, Drummond &amp; Marc Gasol"
AD getting beat off the dribble by Richaun fucking Holmes is just so fucking bad
Imagine playing so regular dudes like delon Wright and richaun Holmes are killing you
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
100% this. Signing someone like Richaun Holmes and having Gafford as a backup would be huge for the Wizards.
Where is Richaun Holmes on this list? Man's gonna be getting between more money than Trez.
"Day 1 of free agency if I'm the Wizards, I'm calling Richaun Holmes and saying ""Dinner anywhere my treat. How's starting with a backcourt of Westbrook and Beal sound?"

"I really like what Presti has done in OKC, and I highly approve of his current rebuilding plan (granted, I'm a Hinkie-stan for life).          By maximizing your potential of landing a franchise-changing player, you can also give your young prospects lots of PT to develop and you will discover hidden gems in the Process. For example, the Sixers under Hinkie found Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, and Richaun Holmes, among others, and gave all of them a chance to showcase flashes of talent that eventually blossomed into consistent talent and earned them solid-to-great contracts around the league."
"I would add to the list of people who got time with us to develop when they might not have elsewhere....Korkmaz (26th), TLC (24th), Richaun Holmes (37th). Like it's not always about what was expected from them, as much as it's about how much did they get to see the floor.  Then you also have players that weren't getting time playing elsewhere that did at the 6ers. Like Ish Smith was with 7 teams in his first 4 years averaging about 8 minutes, then goes to 27 minutes a game with the sixers.  It's not a MASSIVE amount (a decent amount over a few years). But it's always great when you see some guy out there that didn't think they'd be in the league necessarily."

Richaun Holmes is massively underrated.
"Richaun Holmes.  DeAaron Fox.  We already had big money tied up in Hield and Barnes as well, unfortunately."
"I was a Hassan defender last season in Portland. He's not a total garbage player and is even useful in certain systems. But nephew, Richaun Holmes is better &amp; it's not close."
"First. Defense metrics aren't something to point to like offensive metrics. Theres a lot of mud in defensive metrics.   Second. The things you listed are all things he has improved upon this season. Clearly indicating you haven't either watched or are being willfully ignorant. Probably both.   Ask anyone who is covering the team, or has spent time watching the Wolves and Towns, outside of highlights, he is having one of his best defensive years. Which has equated to him being average on that end.   I'm not sure why I'm even trying to debate you anymore cuz it's quite obvious you're ignorant in the matter, which is fine in itself. I couldn't tell you how good or bad  Richaun Holmes is on defense because I don't watch the Kings hardly at all. But it's the fact you're pretending to know what you're talking about."
"Are you actually a Heat fan? Game 6 vs Boston, took over the entire 4th quarter.  Just last season, 2nd game of the season vs the Bucks, had a chasedown block on Bledsoe that saved the game.  This year has had game-winning blocks on Jerami Grant &amp; Richaun Holmes.  Tons of other big stops in clutch moments on defense over the past 2 years that I cant pinpoint.  He’s been a very clutch player so far in his young career, you might want to pay more attention"
"I’m not even a big Wiseman guy, you’re just doing that thing every fan of a bad team does where they vastly overrate any young player who isn’t awful, but in 5 years we’ll be viewing Stewart as like Richaun Holmes.  Which isn’t even a knock against Stewart because Holmes is solid, just not a real game changer.       But to answer your question, I would say Wiseman’s perimeter game is generally better if you don’t base your opinion entirely on percentages with an extra small sample size."
1. Embiid gets a fair whistle. 2. Curry is a sub-par midrange shooter for some reason. 3. Richaun Holmes has the best floater in the game.  4. Jokic is the best passer in the NBA. 5. MPJ is a top 3 catch and shoot guy in the league.

"KPs contract + the lack of trade assets make it difficult to move him this offseason, so I wouldnt be shocked if they just stick with him. I'd throw everything at Kyle Lowry, though. A phenomenal secondary playmaker who can defend at a high level sounds like a great fit to me. And if you can't get him, I think pursuing Richaun Holmes would be a pretty good move."
"Our first option should be trying to acquire Myles Turner. If he’s out of reach, Richaun Holmes should be the second option. I also like the idea of getting Derozan in a sign and trade with Porzingis if trading for Turner doesn’t work out. I’ve also heard people mentioning trading for Marcus Smart. Not sure how realistic that is but he’d be a great backcourt parter for Luka."
"They need a PnR partner to pair with Luka and another playmaker that can dribble to relieve the pressure on Luka to generate offense. Looking at the free agency class of 2021, I believe they will(or imo they should) target Austin Rivers and Richaun Holmes."
"By Steph? Sure. Steph will cook anybody. However, Rudy is one of the best iso defenders against guards in the league.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/  “For the 2020-21 season, opponent possessions featuring an isolation with Gobert as the primary defender have yielded 0.779 points per chance. That’s fourth-lowest in the NBA among 66 players who have defended at least 125 isolations, per Second Spectrum data, trailing only Draymond Green, Richaun Holmes and Julius Randle — and a big improvement from earlier in Gobert’s career.   A half-decade-old viral clip of Steph Curry turning a younger Gobert around off the dribble has shown remarkable staying power; once or twice a game, some unsuspecting young guard gets Gobert on a switch and assumes it’s easy pickings, only to be rudely awakened to the reality.  Smarter offenses eschew the iso against Gobert, generally in favor of attempting to stretch him out utilizing modern spacing and shooting themes. A ball-handler who can pull up for three, a stretch big man or even both simultaneously can force contortions away from the Jazz’s preferred drop-big defense.  He’s improved here too, though, both in terms of effectiveness and willingness. Today’s Gobert will often play up higher in pick and rolls against known pullup aficionados like Damian Lillard or Devin Booker — but he also has the mobility to recover all the way back to the rim and put out any fires this increased floor space creates.”  Your narrative is way outdated."
"So many things open up for his game if he has a true roll / lob threat. Dwight Powell is a fine option off the bench I guess, but absolutely cannot be his only target. Richaun Holmes or bust"
"Trae is so good, he might have the best floater in the league with Richaun Holmes &amp; Jokic."
Richaun Holmes push shot.
Richaun Holmes is the most realistic FA center for them imo
"Some fairly straightforward moves to make.  Strongly suggest for Trez to opt out of his player option using the Klutch + Rich Paul family connection. Let Drummond, Marc Gasol, and Morris walk.  Resign THT and Caruso long term for hopefully under $15mil/YR combined. Resign Wes and Benny Mac to another veteran’s minimum.  Re-do the entire front court. Look to sign two defensive minded PF/C that can rebound, rim protect, and not ask for post touches. Nerlen’s Noel and Richaun Holmes both could be affordable and available. Dwight Howard coming back would be fine as well.  See what’s available on the trade market. If POR is down to blow it up and sell off CJ McCollum I would resign Schroder and package him in a S+T with Kuzma and a 2022 FRP to acquire CJ.  If no trade partners are available I’d let Schroder walk and see if I can coax Kyle Lowry to signing a 2+1 deal for $20-$25mil/yr.  That’s about as good as you can do honestly."
"JV, Capela, Richaun Holmes"
Richaun Holmes
You'd prefer Richaun Holmes as a rim runner.
"Yal got Fox and Halliburton + Richaun Holmes, as well as tradeable wing assets like Hield and Barnes. Someone will definitely bite on Bagley.   Or you can do what my Celtics just did and burn it to the ground, maybe move out to Seattle and start fresh. If you do, let us get Fox/Halliburton or Barnes/Bagley &amp; Holmes."
Turner is massively overrated. He's a fringe starting center. I'd much rather have Richaun Holmes on my team.
We gotta throw a ton of money at Richaun Holmes
I wanna see you guys get Derozan. And then maybe like John Collins or Richaun Holmes or somehow magically get Mobley LOL.
"Bit of a cheat because he's been starting, but once Bagley comes back,  Richaun Holmes will probably get relegated to backup big. As a Suns fan, I miss him in Phoenix and I think he'd be a better backup to Ayton than what we have.  Maybe not young enough for this question. I dunno. He's young-ish."
"I think I’d target one of Serge Ibaka, John Collins, or Richaun Holmes.  Despite his age and recent slide, I think I might take a first crack at Ibaka. I think the Celtics are much too young, and need as much championship-proven talent as they can get. I think a frontcourt with Ibaka and Tristan is pretty good. There’s championship experience there.  I’d also try to upgrade at PG. I doubt he’d come to Boston, but Chris Paul would be a big shakeup. I think he could keep Tatum and Brown well fed.  DeRozan might be my second choice. I want someone who has scoring ability, but also a healthy passing/assist game.  Maybe have Jabari be our first wing off the bench. Smart be the first guard. Robert Williams the first big.  A certain segment of Celtics fandom thinks Williams is the next big thing. I’m not convinced, but I certainly wouldn’t complain if he is.   What I fully expect, is that Ainge will run it back with this same group. And I think it would work if Kemba’s knee hadn’t turned into a fucking mortar and pestle the moment he landed at Logan.  Frankly, I think we’d have a better team * right now*, if we had kept IT and Horford around. Kyrie was a mistake that Ainge never should have made. He’s been trying to make up for it ever since, and that strikes me as a general still fighting his previous battle, rather than preparing for the next.  I don’t think Ainge sucks, exactly. But I do think, thanks to the Kyrie experiment, that he’s behind the curve right now, rather than ahead of it.  I also think his almost pathological *need* to ‘fleece’ every potential trade partner has cost him some real opportunities to improve the team.  He’s not acting like 07/08 Ainge. And that’s the guy we need right now.  I don’t know. I think we *could have* beat the Nets if we were at full health. I’ll comfortably pit Tatum and Brown against Durant and Harden. I’ll happily throw a (healthy, admittedly Charlotte-era) Kemba at Kyrie.  But Kemba will never be the guy he was, and that just needs to be addressed.  I think I’m going in circles now…"
"Look up rim running bigs that can defend in FA right now.   Hint, there isn't any.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/center/   Richaun Holmes maybe but I don't watch enough Sacramento to know."
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes and Dwight Howard are all unrestricted free agents this summer. I'd happily take any of them over Drummond."
Richaun Holmes kinda gives me a similar vibe.
Imagine you are Richaun Holmes and winning game will result in your team drafting Evan Mobley. Would you try to win that game?
Richaun Holmes push shot is better
Two players im bummed the Suns let go (in recent years). DeAnthony Melton and Richaun Holmes
"Kawhi (will opt out to secure a bigger contract), CP3 (maybe he opts out his 1 yr 44mill to secure a 2 yr 50-60 mill), Derozan, Lowry, Conley, John Collins (RFA) , Lonzo Ball (RFA), Richaun Holmes, Jarett Allen (RFA), Norman Powell, Oladipo, Lauri Markannen (RFA), D Rose"
"&gt; Richaun Holmes  Eh, I don't think good enough.    Don't get me wrong he's great, but if we get a young top 5-10 player in the league paired with Luka, we are winning 3+ championships..."
"Process OG here.  &amp;#x200B;  Big losses: Fultz, MCW, KJ McDaniels, Sauce Castillo, Wroten  &amp;#x200B;  Big gainzz: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, RoCo, Dario, Thybulle  &amp;#x200B;  I was also high on Nerlens and It's not clear to me if he's a win or not. He is an awesome player defensively, but I think he's more of a HODL"
Richaun Holmes has one of the best floaters I’ve ever seen. Watching him score is so interesting.
I'd trade KP for Barnes and Richaun Holmes no question about it.
Richaun Holmes but he'll be pricey and slightly undersized as a 5.
Richaun Holmes
"Only problem is the Kings are cash strapped. They can't even afford to sign Richaun Holmes and to get Kawhi via trade they don't have the young assets to send back unless it's Haliburton, like 6 picks, and Barnes lol"
"Yeah Dipo was supposed to address some of the perimeter scoring issues. And I'm pretty sure we'd be able to bring him back for cheap after the injury, at least for 1 year as a prove it deal.   &gt;Any thoughts about richaun holmes in FA?  Meh. Couldn't be much worse than what we've used this year"
Any thoughts about richaun holmes in FA? Not a great defender but he would space the floor. Dipo should help with the ball handling assuming you resign him
"Yeah this is my preferred plan as well. Re-sign THJ. Sign Richaun Holmes if possible because Luka needs a better PnR partner than Powell. Then see what you can get in a trade for KP, Richardson, Green, Burke, etc."
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
PG- TJ McConnell  SG- Malcolm Brogdon  SF- Cameron Johnson  PF- Kyle Anderson  C- Richaun Holmes
"Only one 3rd place vote for Richaun Holmes is a letdown, he had a monster career year in his 6th season."
"Sadly, I think Richaun Holmes is gone this year, especially if another team ponies up enough in free agency.  Honestly, the Kings need a legit defensive stopper more than anything. Historically bad defense is inexcusable."
Dont need a traditional #2.  Can get two good starter level players for KP money.  Brogdon and Richaun Holmes as an example.
"I""m hoping the Hornets get Richaun Holmes. He would be such a good fit with their fast-paced, energetic style of play."
"Fox continues progressing  Halliburton puts on 20 pounds of muscle  Richaun Holmes stays and takes a pay cut to build something  Kings draft a solid PF  Our starting lineup of Fox/Hali/Barnes/bestPFever/Holmes is #1 in ORTG  Our team learns how to play defense (at least not the worst DRTG of all time maybe)  Buddy accepts a bench role, brings his 3 pt shooting back from ~39% to ~48%  Buddy/Delon/Harkless/t. Davis all playing starter-quality basketball off the bench  Fox MIP, Hali MVP, Buddy 6MotY, Luke Walton CotY  I mean it’s easy really it’s all right there"
"Yeah, I think that’s because Bryant is really good. Similar to how when Joel was out sixers fans kept talking about how Dwight is terrible, when the reality is that he’s pretty good too. Len can finish in traffic and set solid screens, which is really what you need from a replacement level big with a game plan focused around the backcourt like the wizards have. Len is like a Zeller, unexciting but fully serviceable, while Gafford is like 2017-18 Richaun Holmes, exciting and trending in the right direction but limited and unable to play extended minutes due to chasing blocks instead of positioning for contests"
Just like richaun holmes on the Sixers
"I’m using something called ‘hyperbole’. It’s exaggeration used to illustrate a point, something that is taught in 5th grade or so.   It doesn’t matter if the event was distanced, tested, or required a full colonoscopy and endoscopy before attending. He was not supposed to be there and should be punished just like Lou Williams was when he wanted some Lemon Pepper Lou and like Richaun Holmes was when he took 4 steps out of the bubble to grab a food delivery. All of them were wrong, all should be punished, only 2/3 were."
"Unless we go on an unexpected playoff run I would like to see Brunson and Hardaway brought back, sign Richaun Holmes in FA and see what we can get for KP and Richardson."
"richaun holmes is probably gonna get 20 million a season too, thats what his agent is asking for  and timelord looks better than holmes does  you just have no idea what you're talking about lmao"
I hope they do.  I’d laugh my ass off if the Celtics spent $20mil on a bouncy Richaun Holmes
“I want a star”   “We have a star at home”   “The star at home:”   Richaun Holmes
"The Sixers were an embarrassment and ruined basketball by unearthing players like Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Christian Wood and Richaun Holmes."
The proper list just shows me Richaun Holmes is super underrated. He's surrounded by All Stars in the ranking.
"The Drummond contract was clowned at the time, because he’s a limited center, so the same should be done to this very similar contract. Allen would be *grossly* overpaid. If I were the Cavs I’d just sign+trade him and find someone with his skillset for cheaper (Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, etc). They can’t be giving 25% of their cap to a center that isn’t even that good."
Well after 25 there’s a decent number of guys on sub .500 teams. Richaun Holmes from the Kings is directly ahead of him.
"I mean, at the least you can look at the positives of having a lot of cap space freed up now, and the potential to draft a really exciting center in Sengun. There's the potential that all you have on the books going into next season is:   LaMelo, Rozier, Hayward, Washington, Sengun.  Monk, Bridges.  Martin, Martin, McDaniels, Carey.  The last four are really just roster-filler, but then alongside your two late-seconds, you have a good 30mil or so in cap space.   My guess would be that you try and get a starting center like you've seemingly attempted - say pay Richaun Holmes overs to do so, then maybe try for guys like TJ McConnell and Mo Harkless to provide stability off the bench?   LaMelo, Rozier, Hayward, Washington, Holmes.   McConnell, Monk, Harkless, Bridges, Sengun.   Martin, Martin, McDaniels, Carey."
"No Richaun ""Floater Lord"" Holmes??"
"TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Dario Saric. Those were process guys, not first round picks, but second rounders/undrafted/gleague players/eurostash never coming over players. And they're each putting in work somewhere and earning good minutes. The only reason Silver intervened was because we weren't a small market, we were a big market and we blew up an 8 seed roster which had failure after failure and no obvious way forward to contention, it took us 5 years to go from mediocre to 1 seed. I'd fucking do it again in a heartbeat if we ever got back to that 8-10 seed mediocrity."
"The 2015 Sixer who won 10 games included solid NBA players who without the Process to give them a chance may never have gotten a chance to develop into the players they are now.  This includes TJ McConnell, Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, and Richaun Holmes all of whom are solid role players still even though none of them are stars."
"The Kings have some pieces- Fox averaged 25/7 and is an all star level player (whether he actually makes the ASG in the crowded west aside), Hali has real potential- his ceiling may not quite be what Edwards or Ball's is, but it's turned out to be a helluva lot better than just ""high end role player"". He could become a 20/7/7 type of guy with good defense and great intangibles. Barnes is really solid if he only has to be the 3rd or 4th best guy on the team. Bagley is a giant question mark but one with potential. Richaun Holmes is a very useful player in the right role. And Buddy was a very good player under Dave Joerger- one of the many reasons I dislike Walton is because Buddy has declined so horribly under his coaching. I think a good coach can have this team hovering around the 7/8 seed soon. I don't think Walton can."

"richaun holmes has been playing really well, if bagley was playing up to his potential he would be their frontcourt depth  if they had a good coach everybody on their team would look better.   look at the knicks or the hawks.  rosters are mostly the same but they all look a lot better with a good coach"
"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
How you gonna disrespect my boy Richaun Holmes by not mentioning him
Not to mention Richaun Holmes
"We owed a first round pick thanks to the Bynum trade the year before. Hinkie’s first offseason (2013) we had Jrue, the 11 pick, Thad Young, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, Lavoy Allen, Arnett Moultrie. I think that was it.  Hinkie left three years later and we had Embiid, Covington, the rights to Saric, Noel, Okafor, the upcoming first overall pick (Simmons), a Kings pick, TJ McConnell, a Lakers pick, a Kings pick swap, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Isaiah Canaan, a slew of extra second rounders, two more extra 2016 firsts (TLC and Korkmaz), Jakarr Sampson, Nik Stauskas, Ish Smith, Hollis Thompson. This was mostly from memory so I may have missed some stuff."
You forgot Jerami Grant and Richaun Holmes
"He absolutely focused on project players. TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jakarr Sampson have all signed multiple NBA contracts after being given the chance in Philly.   Most of those guys wouldn’t have gotten a shot in the league otherwise"
"Maybe they can replace him with a high level role player. Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Richaun Holmes, anyone who isn't a pure onball scorer maybe?"
Puttin a word in for  * Jalen Brunson * Richaun Holmes
"It maybe the best comparison, especially considering their size.  I also think Ayton was a good pick but I will say that cp3 really unlocked the roster. I mean I think a starting lineup of Luka, Booker, Mikal Bridges, TJ Warren, Richaun Holmes wins more then 19 games that rookie season.   But yea, I agree Ayton is a good match for Booker."
"Part of me thinks they need to go with a high upside forward - so any of Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson or Josh Giddey.  Kai Jones also makes sense if they think they're going to be out a big with Richaun Holmes potentially leaving. Also Kai Jones is supposed to be a half-decent 3-point shooter which would be nice against Bagley."
"They've been out of the playoffs for a decade and a half and I just don't see their current roster changing that. The West is just too damn competitive. They had a great thing going with Joerger at the helm but they messed that up.   Lakers, Mavs, Warriors, Nuggets, Clippers, Grizzlies, Suns, Blazers, Jazz - there's 9 teams right there and I'd still take the injured Clippers and Nuggets over them.  I'd consider bottoming out - Fox and Hield are the only two pieces that really matter (maybe Bagley if they're still high on him). Barnes has some solid trade value.   Richaun Holmes is a UFA who is probably looking for a bag, but he's not worth overpaying because he's a big reason of why their defense is so miserable. They went through this situation already with Buddy Hield and they shouldn't do it again.   Get what value you can off of your vets and hope you don't mess up this time with your high draft picks because the alternative of doing what you're doing now isn't getting you anywhere."
"The list of available centers this offseason isn't great; Daniel Theis (plenty of teams will be bidding for him), Nerlens Noel (not bad, but is more of a backup than starter), Richaun Holmes (great offensively, poor defender) and from there it gets worse and worse.  They could also draft a center (I'm high on Kai Jones) but centers take a few years to develop and as I mentioned, the clock is already ticking with LaMelo in today's NBA. Sabonis, for all of his flaws, is an All-Star level talent that Charlotte can immediately surround him with."

"• RFAs      Jarrett Allen - Cavs      Lonzo Ball - Bulls      John Collins - Hawks      Duncan Robinson - Heat      Lauri Markkanen - Knicks      …      • UFAs      Kyle Lowry - 76ers      Demar Derozan - Spurs      Richaun Holmes - Hornets :(      Dennis Schroeder - Lakers      Kelly Oubre - Bulls      …      • Possible Trade Targets      Damian Lillard - Blazers      Ben Simmons - Kings      Collin Sexton - Knicks      Andrew Wiggins - Warriors      Kemba Walker - Thunder      …      • 2021 Draft Class      Davion Mitchell - Warriors      Jonathan Kuminga - Magic      Moses Moody - Magic      Alperen Sengun - Hornets      James Bouknight - Pelicans      …"
"Gonna focus on the UFAs here because they're the ones I feel that I have the best bead on  1. Kyle Lowry - I know the Heat and the 76ers are the most commonly linked teams here, and I can definitely see that. However, I'm gonna go a little different here and suggest that **Portland** will end up working a sign-and-trade for him (maybe in a 3 team trade, since they'd likely need to trade CJ in order to make this happen). With all the rumblings that Dame is unhappy coming out, I think it's a foregone conclusion that they're going to try and make *something* happen, and I think this is probably one of the bigger ones that they could realistically swing. While this definitely still leaves the Trailblazers small at guard, this now gives them someone that they can reliably put on elite guards on defense, which I think has shown to be pretty critical at this point.   2. DeMar DeRozan - DeMar's the hardest one here to pinpoint, IMO. He's still a great player, but his skillset isn't something a lot of teams are looking for at his contract expectations, and I'd imagine he wants to go to a legit contender (or as close to a real contender as he can). For here, I think he ends up going to **Dallas**. The Mavs biggest problem (IMO) this playoffs was how much their offense stagnated when Luka wasn't on the floor. No one else was consistently creating their own shot, and no one else really looked great running the offense. DeMar fixes both of those problems, and lets Luka maybe not be on-ball quite so much when they're on the floor together so that he can conserve his energy a bit more.   3. Richaun Holmes - I think Holmes either ends up in **Charlotte** or in **Atlanta** (but if and only if they don't re-sign Collins). Both of those teams have plenty of cap, likely won't be in contention for the tippy-top of the FA class, and (again, presuming Atlanta lets Collins walk) would have great setups with a player like him given how great Ball and Young are at playmaking while having a hole that would certainly need filling.  4. Dennis Schroeder - I don't know why, but I have a distinct feeling that **New York** ends up signing him. I hope I'm wrong because I think their fans have suffered enough and because I like the foundation for the team they have, but overpaying a mediocre player like Schroeder because you have the cap to do so and feel the need to ""improve"" your playoff team is very much something that sounds like a Dolan thing to push for. They also likely need to go for a PG in either the draft or FA, so there's an actual need there as well.   5. Kelly Oubre - Last and arguably least on this list, I think Oubre signs with a team that's willing to make him a focal point on their offense, who in turn will be angling to trade him at the deadline for assets a la Marcus Morris in his stint with the Knicks. Simply put, after how he played with the Warriors this season, I don't see a legitimately good team wanting him at his pricetag now, but that definitely changes if he looks like he did in Phoenix when he was used as a major part of their offense. That being the case, I'm looking for a team with the cap space, no one that's really a clear-cut top option on offense, and most importantly is in full rebuild mode. To that end, I think **Orlando** makes sense as a destination. They have the cap space to sign him, would likely have the possessions to give him to rehabilitate his perception a bit, and would certainly be willing to part with him for draft assets later on in the season if he lives up to that role.   A little unconventional in parts, I admit, but I wanted to avoid going too milquetoast with my predictions here."

AD for Lillard.   Which team says no?   Obviously AD is the better player. But as we know he is brittle and doesn’t possess the “killer” gene that guys like LeBron and Lillard do.   Schroeder and Mathews didn’t live up to expectations. So bringing in another guard is a good move.   Bring back Dwight.    Expand THT role.   Maybe bring in or draft another big man for rebounding. Birch or Richaun Holmes - could LA afford them? Or use Kuzma and their first rounder to move up in the draft or to acquire a decent big man.

"Holy fuck y’all wanna pay a 28 year old Richaun Holmes $21mil/yr???  What the hell did I miss with the Kings this year? Dude averaged 14-8 and every metric I see has him as a negative on defense. How in the hell is an undersized, non-shooting, bad defender about to get paid this much money????  I guess the market is just weak this year."
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"I agree with you, I just think Ben has a tremendous amount of value to the right team. Like Sacramento would be a really good fit, but it would only be a good fit if they kept Buddy and Bagley. Everyone needs to be able to shoot 3s if Ben is on the team. My own dumb idea is Ben to the kings, a bunch of picks and richaun holmes to okc and SGA to Philly."
"i'm not familiar with what he wants to do, article had him included   &gt;The Kings would be looking to put Simmons, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound point guard, in a frontcourt position in a lineup featuring Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and possibly Richaun Holmes, if they are able to keep him in free agency."
"yeah, no experience here watching Ben try to work with rim running centers who can't shoot....such as.....former Sixer Richaun Holmes.   Also, you don't need ""good shooters"".   you need volume shooters like JJ or Curry.  We tried the good shooter route with Horford, Harris and JRich and it gums everything up.   Even with Embiid spacing more than Holmes."
"Van Vleet, Rose, Nunn, Tht, Roco, AD, Richaun Holmes, Sterling Brown, Iguodala, and Kaminsky are probably the 10 best from Illinois."
"Richaun Holmes would have been a perfect fit at center. High motor, sets screens and plays d."
We could prob look at Richaun Holmes
"It was just and example, you can take even Richaun Holmes, as another example..."
"this... not true at all. Seth is good at 8 million. But there's Jokic at 29 million, Sabonis at 18 million, Christian Wood at 13 million, Chris Boucher at 6 million, Richaun Holmes at 4.8 million. Honestly, even some of the big contracts like Bradley Beal at 25 million give significantly more value. Hell, his brother is way better value per dollar at 40 million."
"There’s not that many great American centers, at least guys in the nba who are perceived as stars. Someone like richaun Holmes would be great but then you’d have the whole narrative of him getting picked over better players, etc"
"Passing up a 24 year old mutiple time all star to sign Richaun Holmes to a $20million deal is bad business, even if Simmons is a bit of a reclamation project"
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7.

Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."

"Honestly no fucking clue. Raptors have a tough offseason coming up where they can go a million different ways.  Conservative strat? Draft Green/Mobley/Suggs, try and keep Lowry, if not then sign and trade him to the Sixers, sign a Center like Richaun Holmes, resign Trent to hopefully no more than 4/70, and then try to contend.  Scorched earth mode? Do the Siakam trade for Wiggins Wiseman and the 7th, milk OKC for as many of their picks as I can to trade down (probably an overpay from them, but hoping they fall in love with whoever is left at 4 and trade one of their FIVE draft picks) sign and trade Lowry, retain GTJ, and roll out a super young revamped team with the entire core under 23."
"If Lowry leaves, use the cap space created to pursue Jarrett Allen or Richaun Holmes.  If Lowry stays, use an exception to pursue a cheaper option, like Nerlens Noel.  Using our exceptions to sign a shooting wing like OPJ or Bullock would be nice too."
That works great for us. We'll likely be losing Richaun Holmes and we'll need a Center to 0lay some defense and get boards. I think Bagley's time in Sac is done but Bagley as the 4 next to Adams makes sense.
Ahem.  *Seventy-Sixers* ***Legend*** Richaun Holmes
The second round pick we traded for Richaun Holmes
"Just because 20 point leads are blown more often, doesn’t mean it’s an acceptable outcome, *especially* in the playoffs.   And those are just examples. Other “lesser” guys who the fanbase always really appreciated because of their hard work and hustle would be guys like TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Dario Saric. Any time those guys come back to Philly, they still get standing ovations."
"I’d take fox over anyone on our team if not for emotional attachment. Richaun Holmes is really underrated, Halliburton is already good for a rookie, and they have Barnes holding it down as a solid vet. I think their problem is organizational disfunction more than talent"
He’s not even a Richaun Holmes lol.
I’d let Richaun Holmes go to the Dallas Mavericks.
"I know we had Serge pre-Kawhi, but it didn’t make sense to offer him a bag for multiple years when we clearly needed to retool for the future.   In regards to Marc, he wanted to chase a chip with the Lakers. Same thing applies.   I agree though, Masai hasn’t made splashes in free agency otherwise, I just think that it was actually the correct move to let Serge/Danny/Marc walk in FA.   I was hoping for a project like Harry Giles instead of Baynes / Len, but who knows what went down behind closed doors. Really excited to see how this off season plays out, will be interesting to see if we make a run at a guy like Richaun Holmes."
yeah I’m really liking the idea of getting Richaun Holmes. I hadn’t even thought about the idea of nerlens but he would actually be a solid rim protector for us and lob threat
"A backup ball handler, a shooter(or two) if THJ isn't re-signed, and a versatile, athletic rim running center.   My wish list looks something like dinwiddie, nerlens noel/richaun holmes and maybe like a one year deal for danny green or something."
"I think they target and can possibly land Devonte Graham, Richaun Holmes, Bobby Portis, Forbes and David Nwamba in FA. Try and use a S/T w/ lonzo and picks (maybe need 3rd team ~rockets?~) to get CJ away from the blazers"
I liken him to Richaun Holmes with a jumpshot. Jones is more athletic/bouncy than Allen and just plays with an intensity like Holmes while Allen is pretty laid back.
Richaun Holmes with a jumpshot
"It's this one. I saw an article that tries to make guesses on how Hinkie would've ran things if he was forced out and holy shit did Colangelo royally fuck things up.  1) The moment Hinkie finally sees Embiid play, you just know he'll be more aggressive in shopping Noel &amp; Okafor, as well as getting better returns.  2) He definitely doesn't trade Jerami Grant for Ilyasova, nor would he let Richaun Holmes leave for nothing.  3) He wouldn't trade up the draft to take Fultz #1 while giving up the BKN pick; He would draft Fultz at #3 and let the Celtics get their guy Tatum at #1  4) If Fultz still messes up his shoulder, Hinkie handles that better than Colangelo did and probably even trades him ahead of time. He also doesn't trade Mikael Bridges pick for Zhaire Smith.  5) Imagine the Sixers if Hinkie drafts Sexton with that BKN pick, then still trades for Butler and Harris with the same assets, or gets a better return for Fultz. You still get Sexton-Butler-Simmons-Harris-Embiid with Redick, Bridges, McConnell, Holmes, and Jerami Grant off the bench  6) I imagine before the 2019 season, Hinkie moves on from Brett. If not, he definitely chooses Butler over Brett   Colangelo fucked up the Process. Elton Brand put the final nail in the coffin. Morey is now trying to fix the mess they made."
Richaun Holmes honestly
Richaun Holmes in Charlotte would be so fun
"they got richaun holmes and he’s pretty lit, but their fans never SHUT THE FUCK UP with those cowbells.  also you can get seats 3-4 rows back behind visitor’s bench for like $100 on stubhub vs anyone but lakers or warriors, golden 1 center is brand new and beautiful, and there’s a texas roadhouse in fairfield you can get buttery rolls at on the way there. i’d say try it if you want. i’m a grizzlies fan for life so I understand what it’s like supporting small market teams who haven’t won anything"
"Alright so the top from the rest of the pack.  Rozier, Booker, Oubre, Turner, Harrell, Delon Wright, Richaun Holmes, Larry Nance Junior, Norman Powell.  Thats leaving out Osman, Jason Richardson, Tyus Jones, and Portis."
"they clearly did develop talent? see Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood(kind of), Ish Smith, Jerami Grant, Saric, Embiid, TJ McConnell  &amp; i remember point guards Isaiah Canaan, Ish Smith, TJ McConnell, MCW and Tony Wroten.   i understand you don’t like the process but what you just said clearly wasn’t true. Okafor has proven to be a bust on multiple teams, Noel never developed to his potential on multiple teams either. don’t act like this is strictly a sixers thing"
"Lacking: Currently it's any semblance of offensive rhythm, CP has slowed our offensive rhythm down to a crawl since he's been back and suddenly he's taking 2 to 3 more contested 3's a game while shooting a worse % than the regular season. Incredibly frustrating to watch.   Improve: I want a prototypical defensive back-up center to help DA out. Dario absolutely is not cutting it and I'd be happy to move on from him this summer.  Moves to Pursue: I'd love for us to trade Dario/Jevon and clear up some cap space to pay Cam Payne the money he deserves to be our backup PG. Would also like to see us go after a Daniel Theis, Richaun Holmes, Enes Kanter type of player. I think we're pretty set on long, versatile wings with Mikal, Cam, Jae, Torrey, and Abdel."
"It's a bit of stretch with Zac Collins admittedly. I'm about ready to call him a bust, but I sincerely think Richaun Holmes will leave Sacramento in search of a bigger bag so if they could get a potential center prospect in Collins for cheap I could see them being interested."
"you know hinkie had a 5-7 year plan to be contenders right? in 2016-17 the roster included dario, covington, jerami grant, embiid, simmons, TJ, and richaun holmes. and an absolute FUCKTON of capspace. well before colonjello got his hands on it anyways.  that team started 0-7 and then went to 17-27. without ben simmons. all he had to do was bide his time and let his guys develop... you know like he always planned.  &gt;you think hinkie would’ve made the same moves the Colangelos did before that season?  what moves did colangelo make before embiid's rookie season? because he didn't sign JJ until next year. you mean the gerald henderson and jerryd bayless signings? real stroke of genius LMFAO.  seems like you may have no idea what you're talking about."
i think they had richaun holmes on there and shaq couldn’t tell who he was
"Randle, Jarret Allen, and Myles Turner (if healthy) would all be better big man fits for Team USA than washed up KLove and they have all played for Team USA before.   Nerlens Noel and Richaun Holmes were also born in the states, but I couldn’t find any record of them playing for Team USA before at any level."
"Lol I do the same with Richaun Holmes, 2k still doesn’t know how to deal with the changing nature of the PF position going from a rebounding/help defense role to a shooting role."
"Lol I hoped for like a Richaun Holmes or Gafford center that would be Luka’s inside presence and lob threat, but if it’s Ayton? Whoaaaaaaaa. That’s Lebron AD there"
richaun holmes
"I think you're missing the fact that Lowry leaving could create ~$25M in cap space for the Raptors to address their actual needs (i.e. starting C). They're not gonna facilitate a S&amp;T unless they're geting something worthwhile in return.  Trez and Caruso do nothing for us when we already have enough guards and bigs off the bench, I'd rather just let Lowry walk and pursue guys like Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen in free agency."
"That’s a interesting take, it might just depend on the persons perspective on Sacramento as a city and franchise. People like De Aaron Fox Tyrese Halliburton and Richaun Holmes take pride in being able to play for the city and team and there are also others who just see it as a stopping point from their next destination"
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
His dad loves to go on Twitter and badmouth the whole organization and which ever coach we got that isn't giving Bags minutes. Which is hilarious because you compare him to Richaun Holmes' mom who is a polar opposite and Kings nation loves like she's our mom.
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford, DeAndre Jordan were at one time All-NBA centers that are still kinda in the league, its just that ""pure"" big men just don't cut it anymore in the modern NBA.  Jonas Valanciunas, Steven Adams, Richaun Holmes kinda fit the bill, but aren't as dominant as the first group in their primes."
Richaun Holmes if he gets out of SAC
"im not trying to say there isn't luck involved. it's just that when you have a plan in place rather than ""we're gonna compete every ye- OH NO WE SUCK"" like the kings/wolves/whatever then you have to get lucky in a singular moment in order to compete. See Bucks with Giannis. See Jazz with Gobert. it's not impossible as obviously it happens.  if you plan your strategy around having 4-5 top picks then you increase your odds at getting lucky. that is the process. while you do this you go through as many players as you can to see who can stick in the NBA. Roco, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes.  so yes the sixers got lucky with embiid. but they also got SHAFTED with fultz. shafted with okafor. but because their strategy was to have multiple opportunities they've still come out with a competitive team despite making some poor decisions or having bad luck along the way."
"He did alright relative to the sheer volume of the ones they had. You just don't hear about the guys that didn't make it. The guys that did make it didn't make a big impact for the 76ers or net them a lot in trades. RoCo was a big part of the Butler trade, so that's probably the one you'd make an exception for (which wasn't a Hinkie move). That's a big reason 2nd round picks/undrafted players aren't that valuable. Even the ones that do develop are going to take a long time, at which point odds are good they're on a new team already.   Was Jerami Grant a nice pick? Yeah, no doubt. Was he a homerun? Ehh, more like a double, two picks after him the Nuggets drafted the most recent MVP.  Richaun Holmes is a guy in the League... he wasn't always that, by the time the new 76ers regime gave up on him they got Cash Considerations."
If we sign a starting caliber center (I.e. Richaun Holmes) and get any kind of return on a Lowry deal then I think we’re back fighting for a 5/6 seed
"Suggs/Fred/OG/Siakam/Richaun Holmes   Fuck it, let’s go. Lowry I will love you forever and always"
Add Richaun Holmes to the list.
Wait why tf is Richaun Holmes being drafted 6?
"Great work! My only issue would be Myles Turner below Richaun Holmes. Both great bigs, but Turner's the better and much more versatile player."
https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/kings-keeping-richaun-holmes-nba-free-agency-complicated
"He was only here for 2.5 years.    All his picks had value and would have been traded for more value if allowed.  Some were.     Draft 1 Noel - consensus #1.    BC held onto him too long.  Mostly due to elective surgery Nerlens got   MCW- traded for future pick, Mikal Bridges.  Again, subsequent GM couldn’t convert the layup and just take the hometown kid  Draft 2   Embiid - MVP candidate  Dario- half of Butler trade.  Again future GM messed it up.    Also picked up an extra 1st which was later Shamet.  Who also was pissed away by Brand in Tobi deal.   And also selected Jerami grant who in Bryan Colangelo first move was traded for ersan.     Year 3   Okafor - was traded to Boston for the Jaylen brown pick.  Newly installed Advisor Jerry Colangelo cancelled.   Bunch of 2s- one of which was Richaun Holmes who was later given away in a cash dump so we could compete a trade for Mike Muscala  It wasn’t perfect.    But a lot of the mistakes were bc of subsequent GMs.    Put another way, Embiid, Dario, Grant and Holmes isn’t a bad haul for 3 drafts.  Plus UD free agents RoCo and TJ.    If he was allowed to complete the Jaylen trade bad if brown didn’t fuck up Bridges it would be even better.  But those are out of his control."
"This is a more detailed account of his tenure than I can write- https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5w63er/analysis_of_sam_hinkies_tenure_as_unbiased_as/  Hinkie is definitely overrated by some, but saying he only made one good move is also really unfair.  His draft picks don't look great, but he typically went with the consensus BPA.  Sixers had awful lottery luck for years- took them years to get the #1 and the Lakers held onto their own pick for years with their own tanking.  Hinkie also wanted KP over Okafor, for what that's worth.  Hinkie found a ton of diamonds in the rough- RoCo, Jerami Grant, McConnell, Richaun Holmes.  Who knows how much credit he deserves for that, as you'd expect any team with that much roster turnover will stumble upon some gems.  His biggest strength was in his trades.  The Stauskas trade in particular was really strong, but he basically never lost a trade in his time there.  Very similar to how Presti's running the Thunder now, but instead of starting his rebuild with PG &amp; Russ, Hinkie had Jrue Holiday and the corpse of Andrew Bynum.  He wasn't a perfect GM.  He underrated the impact a losing culture would have on his players and their development, and how it would impact the appeal of the team to players in the draft &amp; FA.  We never got to see him go from acquiring assets to consolidating the assets into a contender and making a roster where the players fit together.  I think most Hinkie supporters give him the benefit of the doubt here though since he worked under Daryl Morey."
All Ben Simmons have to do is master a floater/push shot like Bruce Brown and Richaun Holmes
"[i've had this bookmarked forever because it's the best example i've ever seen of a bad team playing their asses off](https://streamable.com/csxp). that's literally what tanking is -- michael carter-williams and isaiah canaan and kj mcdaniels and richaun holmes never lacked heart, they just weren't that good."
"Richaun Holmes. I love that dude, but his camp is expecting 20m a year."
"You just don’t want his awful contract... however, there is a case for the Sixers trading Harris for maybe him, Richaun Holmes (sign and trade), and maybe an end of bench guy like Metu"
Myles Turner might be an interesting fit. Or Richaun Holmes
Respect to Robin Lopez for his hook and respect to richaun Holmes for his floater
Richaun Holmes or even just Bagley. I'll be fine.
"It doesn’t really say anything. Malone is 10x the coach Walton is. Joerger is a better coach, sometimes you have to break things down and then rebuild them and Sacramento never lets good coaches who roll through stay longer enough.  People keep bringing up these Walton wins for the franchise as if it means anything. Still haven’t made the playoffs, they actively look WORSE than they did two years ago when Dave was the HC and have even added Haliburton, found a good center in Richaun Holmes and getting good production out of Barnes.  He fucking sucks and is a bottom 5 coach in this league (before all the recent departures). Name 5 coaches worse than Walton for the 2020-2021 season? Scott Brooks maybe? Stan Van Gundy? Lloyd Pierce possibly?  If Sacramento wants to be good, they have to start with firing this fucking guy. He sucks."
Richaun Holmes
"We love Richaun Holmes too, buddy."
Alex Caruso  Malik Beasley  Josh Jackson  Rodions Kurucs  Richaun Holmes
"I don’t get why they would trade for Moses Brown, who seems like an as good if not better player than Williams and trade him for an aging Josh Richardson, then give Williams basically the contract Richaun Holmes got"
"Richaun Holmes, Richaun Holmes, Richaun Holmes, Richaun Holmes, Richaun Holmes."

More than Richaun Holmes got!
They desperately need wings though. Starting Chimezie Metu or Marvin Bagley alongside Richaun Holmes is not going to be a winning formula nor is 30 minutes a night of Moe Harkless.
"Richaun Holmes is not a good rim protector IMO. He's an aggressive and athletic shot blocker, but this often leaves the rim unprotected as he gets himself out of position. That's what I saw when he was on the Sixers and nothing I've seen from him since then has changed my mind."
Richaun Holmes is a fine rim protector. What they need are some actual positive forwards on the roster outside of Harrison Barnes. I dont disagree that Buddy should get moved
"tyrese haliburton, luka doncic, dillon brooks, michael porter jr., richaun holmes  bench: demond bane, jalen green, terence mann, og anunoby, robert williams"
Luka-Danny Green-Mikal Bridges-OG Anunoby-Myles Turner  Bench: Thad Young-Jordan Clarkson-Richaun Holmes-Jalen Brunson-Otto Porter
Call me weird man but I think Richaun Holmes has some serious all star potential
"Boston - Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Terry Rozier  76ers - Maxey, Thybulle, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, Milton  LOL, you're in a fucking cult"
"Can’t think of just one player  Fox, Isaac (when healthy), Brook Lopez, Jae’Sean tate, Dillon brooks, tj McConnell, richaun Holmes, Larry nance"

"&gt;That's what makes Hinkie such an enigma. He had some amazing draft picks and undrafted free agent signings, but also let a lot of them go so I don't know how much credit to give him.   Yeah the big question mark with Hinkie is his talent evaluation/team-building ability which we never saw. The OP lists players that were part of ""The Process"" at one point or another but apart from the 1st rounders the only players that they identified and actually leveraged for on-court success or asset value are RoCo and TJ. It's not an achievement to have Christian Wood or Ish Smith on your team for two minutes when those guys were being passed around from bad team to bad team at one point.  Plus there was the criticism that you can take tons of fliers on guys like this, but how much are they going to get to show when playing alongside rookies and other fliers/journeymen instead of instilling good habits. It's not a foregone conclusion that Jerami Grant/Christian Wood/Richaun Holmes etc wouldn't become as good as they did on other teams but the fact they did blow up elsewhere doesn't retroactively make Hinkie look better to me"
"I know it's unpopular, but I think they could be a threat to make it if they trade Fox for Simmons. Mitchell, Haliburton, Simmons would be a nasty defensive backcourt, and Richaun Holmes is a legit defensive big.  Their offense would be rough, but they could win a lot of games off their defense alone."
"He badly needs to fire his agent. Even if he only wanted to stay in Phoenix, he still left a ton of money on the table and signed an unfavorable contract for himself. He was eligible to get the same thing Richaun Holmes got in Sacramento, or if he wanted a shorter contract then he could have gotten what Reggie Jackson got with the Clippers. Just like Payne, these were players who were re-signed by their teams using early Bird rights.   Payne could have gotten a bigger contract elsewhere, so he should have used that as leverage to get the Suns to up their offer. It's very cool that he wanted to stay with the Suns, but it's stupid that he would feel like Robert Sarver deserves that money more than he does. At the very least that 3rd year should have been a player option rather than partially guaranteed. It's really like he just accepted whatever the Suns initial offer was without negotiating at all."
"And that list is just the call ups. It doesn't include players like Siakam, Chris Boucher, Richaun Holmes, Paul Reed, JJ Barea, Jeremy Lin, Gerald Green and others who weren't called up, but rather transitioned between seasons."
"Shaq clearly didn't care about the Kings, he didn't even know who Richaun Holmes was."
"Norman Powell, Richaun Holmes, kevon Looney when he isn't injured, Larry Nance Jr,   Yeah the draft not only has several.multi time all stars but a lot of high quality starting level players too."
As if my adoration for Richaun Holmes could grow any more
Is Richaun Holmes considered a great rim runner? He's a better mid post bucket getter from what I've seen than a traditional athletic rim runner.
"It’s so funny but refreshing seeing other fans so confused why a player would want to stay here lol.  We love Richaun and team mom, Dr. Holmes."
Wtf has Richaun Holmes ever made the playoffs? No no his opinion doesn’t count until he can make it to the playoffs.
That’s bs. LeBron’s 2016 ring was the hardest to win. And the 2020 ring. Wgaf what Richaun Holmes a player who can’t stay healthy thinks
Here’s what I think…who’s richaun Holmes
Richaun Holmes *definitely* has threads on new.
"Not going to be a star unless he develops technical skills. He has a high motor and he seems willing to put the work in, but given his size and current rawness I think he'll max out as a starting big or first big off the bench. Might become someone like Richaun Holmes one day. Or could be the next Faried if his skills don't develop."
&gt; Precious in Toronto's development system   Uh why doesn't Maxey in Toronto's development system count for anything.  Precious is an undersized Richaun Holmes if he hits his ceiling.  And Richaun Holmes is already undersized.
"I mean, it makes sense.  They missed out on Jarrett Allen and Richaun Holmes, so who exactly are they going to sign via free agency with that cap space?  I guess Lauri wouldn't be a bad choice as a backup center but he's looking for a payday and I believe the Hornets were in talks to sign him, and they have more cap space than we do currently should it come to a bidding war.  Better to wait and flip him closer to the trade deadline for a future second or the like when some team is looking for a veteran prescience on their team.  As long as he's healthy, it should be too difficult."
&gt; Just tell James Harden that scoring points isn’t the single most important element of being a star in this league.   ah so just go tell fox to be james harden.  btw i'm not bringing up plus minus. i'm bringing up net rating. richaun holmes was a +8.4 last year.   it seems as if you don't know what you're talking about.
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
"We picked him ahead of Norm Powell, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Larry Nance, Josh Richardson, and Pat Connaughton. And now we're trading him for a second rounder *and* uh...some crappy player whose name I already forgot!"
Raptors trying to steal Richaun Holmes
"10000% this. People whining about this free agency because they haven't experienced the futility of Jason Kapono being our biggest free agent signing.  This team is young and promising, its not a title contention team.  Barnes isn't going to win rookie of the year playing 35 minutes a game leading us to 50 wins.  Damian Lillard for Siakam is not going to happen.  Richaun fucking Holmes is not going to bring us a championship.  Even some of the more prominant Raptors analysts seemed to think we were in for a quick turnaround, when I was saying since last season's trade deadline we are 3-5 years away from being good enough to contend. We don't have a Championship level first option guy and none of the rookies are ready to be that within the next few seasons except *maaybe* Cade."
"Hinkie brought in some gems. Guys like RoCo, McConnell, Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, etc benefited from the Process imo. None of those guys were first rounders yet they all got big contracts."
"lets go players by players  Precious is already other than THT at 21. Precious has no offensive game right now outside of rim runs and dunks. He hasnt attemtped at a 3 yet. only played 12mins a game last year avg 5 pts. Some defensive upside due to atheleticsm but rmb he is 21 so not a young rookie. at 6'8 wont be a small ball 5 either so will be a 4 most of his career. a 4 without a 3pt shot is a liability long term in todays game.  Raps didn't have complete control in the season either. Lowry was expiring then.oks like a Richaun Holmes type . Id take Paul Reed over him too but thats my homerism.  THT is still 20, has played deep into the playoffs, 6'4 guard that is jack of all trade master of none kind of guy. but due to youth and athleticism has the potential to be more. Played deep into a finals run. already has 2 years of NBA experience compared to Precious one but is younger.  Thybulle&gt;&gt;&gt; Precious and idk how its even a question lol. 2nd year NBA player. Already made 2nd teall All NBA defense. Has all defensive steals and block metrics. is already a top 15-20 iso defender in the NBA if not top 10. top 10 team defender already. lack of offensive game is true but Precious has no offensive game outside of dunks and an ineffiecient mid range himself. So lack of offensive game is a wash and Thybulle is a elite NBA defender already. No potential or projection but already 2nd team All nba defense good.  Caruso, reddits darling speaks for himself and i dont gotta explain him.  Raps didn't have complete control in the season either. Lowry was an expiring then.  Herro was never offered idk why raps fans believe that. Herro and Precious are no where the same level in terms of assets or worth. Precious is a projection potential pick. Herro has shown his value already in NBA games, and the NBA playoffs."

"I know I been kind of hating on the mavs lately but imo its really bad they couldn't secure neither richaun Holmes, nerlens noel, or another solid center. The mavs are so thin at that spot they can't afford to lose Willie cauley stein but they got both Reggie bullock and Hardaway Jr."
We went all in on signing...Richaun Holmes and immediately struck out. Now we lost our 3 best performers by net rating and only have Bouknight and Mason fucking Plumlee to show for it
just wait until the big surprise of Richaun Holmes sign and trade to Boston gets revealed.
"We are now receiving reports that Richaun Holmes is heading for Boston in exchange for someone, and it could be Jayson Tatum."
How is he making almost as much as Richaun Holmes? What in tarnation
"No, signing Richaun Holmes does not a fucking thing for this franchise. They are going to lose games regardless, might as well not get stuck with paying a bench player 60 mill."
Why in the fuck are you guys losing your shit over signing Richaun fucking Holmes. I don’t see how he helps us in the future whatsoever. Treadmill move. Our fanbase makes no fucking sense sometimes

"keeping simmons is the best option so hopefully no bridges have been burned fully.  The regular season still has value you just have to not have the worst choke in franchise history in the playoffs, they were set up to have a legitimate chance to win this year and Simmons was still a big part of that.  Adding was always a better option, having someone to run the offense when Ben turns into a lemon is something we've needed for years.  We had jimmy butler for like 2 months and then decided tobias was a better option...  We really got screwed by the league office when they installed the Colangelos.  Even with everything that has gone wrong you could argue they had chances to win in 2019 and 2021.  From Hinkie getting ousted, Fultz forgetting how to shoot, Colangelo doing nothing for 4 years, Brand lighting everything on fire for 2, to Simmons in the playoffs to Okafor, Colangelo, Brand, Tobias, Butler walking for no return.   I mean you can see all the Hinkie guys getting paid this offseason and even some last offseason.  TJ, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Covington, Saric.  It is insanity that he may have left us with a better roster in 2015 than we have now (that being Roco/Grant/Saric/Embiid and the first pick being either Simmons or Ingram since he wasnt there to draft).  Then you have so many valuable picks, Nerlens and Jah when they still had value in trades, and room for two maxes.  The way the Sixers fucked this up is absolutely legendary."
"Ya, I don't know what's up with our fairweather fans, have no idea how the team is actually built.  Raps are fine, Richaun Holmes was not the center we needed."

Dont watch enough kings to really speak on his role in the actual team, but he's been my steal of the draft a few years in a row now."
"imo Richaun Holmes is the best player on that list, but he assuredly won't get the biggest contract. He is a really good player, but he doesn't get the attention he deserves because he plays in Sacramento and is coming off a cheap deal. Very efficient (excellent FT shooter too), excellent roll man, has this automatic little floater, can move his feet out on the perimeter and hold down the paint. He impacts the game in so many ways, he is just a winning player. Also a great locker room guy and instant fan favourite.  I think if he goes to a more high visibilty team he will get the Christian Wood treatment ""wow where did this guy come from??"" - Detroit fans will tell you Christian Wood was doing those exact things post-All Star break in Detroit. I think Kings fans will tell you the same about Holmes."
"And Jeremai Grant, Richaun Holmes, and Point GOD JaKarr Sampson."
"Super happy for Richaun Holmes, man"
"Agreed. This might be the last time the Raps have cap space in a few years. Even grabbing a Richaun Holmes or Lonzo Ball would make more sense than taking back middling prospects and contracts, but if the Raptors strike out on all the attractive free agents I guess the calculations change"
"I look at the salaries, I look at Richaun Holmes apparently wanting 4 years/80 million, I look at the coach, and I can't help but feel extremely underwhelmed. That's without mentioning Bagley or the likelihood of a potential 3 guard line up propelling this team up the standings in the West. Atleast they have all their picks, but I doubt they actually bottom out either.  Maybe all this changes with a series of winning trades, but I genuinely don't see what there is to be optimistic about for Sacramento at the moment."
"Christian wood, embiid, richaun holmes and jerami grant were all good draft picks, and he signed undrafted players like covington and tj mcconell"
"I mean, if you're gonna name them you should also name all the 2nd round picks and undrafted FA's we signed and developed. Namely: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc."
"&gt; I don't think you understand how cap works.   No you're not understanding what I'm saying. I'm saying it's possible to sign GTJ on bird rights after spending FA money, what i'm saying is that its possible that MLSE might not want to because GTJ + say Richaun Holmes could be 35-40m together and that on top of your active roster cap of 102. That 35-40m + 102 is over the tax apron.  Just listen to what i'm saying here."
"Every single draft has some big guy who is pretty decent that goes late. Claxton was pick 31. Mitchell Robinson was 36. Timelord, 27 in the same draft. Thomas Bryant went 42. Jarrett Allen went 22 the same draft. Zubac, 32nd.  2015 had Nance 27, Portis 22, Hernangomez 35, Richaun Holmes 37, Montrezl Harrell 32. The year before was Jokic at 41, Dwight Powell at 45, and Capela at 25. The year before that? Dieng was 21, Plumlee 22, Gobert 27. Before that? Draymond at 35.   Every year, there's perfectly serviceable 5s available between pick 20 and pick 45. Every year."
That’s richaun Holmes actually. Mans gonna get like 18 a year for being a Montrezl clone
"Free agency moves fast. Let's say a big is on your wishlist as a team, and you make a play for John Collins when Free Agency starts. Hawks have 3 days to match that, and that's 3 days you can't make a play for Lauri Markkanen, Jarrett Allen, Richaun Holmes, Serge Ibaka, PJ Tucker, Paul Milsap or Blake Griffin. That's not even considering the other free agents at other positions. You're probably the man out and have to settle with your 3rd, 4th option or worse if the Hawks match.   Hawks are in a position where they can afford to match max for John Collins and still extend Trae Young for max. Going after Collins is risky. Even if you're the Spurs or Thunder and you've got the cap to extend a max offer sheet, who's to say Collins would want to leave Atlanta where they just finished a rebuild, and go to a rebuilding team again for maybe $2m more a year?"
"I think if we stay over the cap we get the non-taxpayer exception, so 9.2M to start in the first year. Won't get Richaun Holmes or Jarrett Allen, but Olynyk or Theis maybe, and we will need the shooting for damn sure.  Also, it's possible we could do something like Jarrett Allen sign and trade for Hood, Boucher and Malachi Flynn, that would get us up to being able to offer low 20s a year with max increases."
Richaun Holmes insurance?
Marc Stein and Zach Lowe both are on record saying they expect Holmes to re-sign. Richaun isn’t 100% gone.
After all the dumb things we've done in the past decade that's a strange breaking point haha. He was just a league min big body to throw at the big centers cause Richaun Holmes is a bit undersized. Seemed like a funny guy to have in the locker room too.
Richaun Holmes dropped 19-17 on you sit this one out
"It's an interesting hypothetical but it's hard to imagine he gets too much more on the open market. Two years in a row now it's been proven he's not a playoff player. That being said he's great in the regular season and will absolutely fetch some wins for a team should they sign him.  I'm obviously biased but I think opting in and getting traded to the Kings might do good for him. Richaun Holmes, a similar player, is now looking to get $20 million a year from somebody after his stint in Sacramento. Imo Trez can ball out in Sac Town and get paid next offseason."
"I think it actually helped those guys on an individual level. They gave a lot of players actual minutes to grow and develop against top talent, rather than sit on the back of the bench and only play 3-on-3 at the end of practice. And look at Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, even Nerlens Noel now as well. They're all doing awesome around the league"
What type of contract do you believe Richaun Holmes will receive?
"The ways for Trez to make the most money are either by a team signing him to a huge contract as a free agent using cap space (highly unlikely, especially this summer), or a team who sees him as a long term piece trading for him and inheriting his Bird rights.   If he signed a 4 year deal with someone for the MLE this summer the most he could get is $43 million, and only if that team was willing to hard cap themselves and pay him that much. If the Kings actually saw him as part of their future, not only would he make more this season ($9.7 million vs $9.5 million), but using early Bird rights next summer they could sign him to a 4 year deal worth up to $73 million.   So you can see why Trez would probably rather be traded to a team that sees him as a part of their future than just opting out and seeing what free agency has for him. After all, the Kings were really wanting to bring back Richaun Holmes but probably can't afford him, so Trez as another undersized center is probably pretty appealing to them."
"He's a Klutch client so no doubt Rich Paul and the Lakers are working right now to see if they can find him a landing spot of his preference. Harrell can get far more money by opting in and being traded than he can by opting out and playing the free agency market this summer. If he opts in and is traded to a team that wants to keep him long term, then next summer they'll have his early Bird rights and will be able to offer him a 4 year deal for $73 million.   Trez isn't trying to help the Lakers, he's just looking at what's best for his career. If some team out there is letting Rich Paul know that they've got the bag for him right now then he'll opt out and take it, but the odds of that happening are small. This is a bad summer for him to be a free agent, and any team looking to spend on an undersized center will probably prefer to give that money to Richaun Holmes than Trez."
"true, i sat behind the Sac bench this year when they came to Philly.   And Buddy just carries himself like he thinks he's the man.    Was very animated with teammates and coaches.   Seems like a prick.   Also Holmes had the guy in front of me thrown out for no reason.   Guy yelled at Richaun ""that's why we traded you"" and he was in his feelings so he started yelling back.   Covid crowd at 25% so it was easy to see who was talking to him.    At halftime, Richaun, Fox and someone else starting giving the fan shit on their way to the tunnel and a few minutes later the fan was ejected."
"Kuzma fits the 3/4 for us very well, and Harrell will be replacing Richaun Holmes who is looking for a bigger contract in the FA."
"Yeah, **I’m** the emotional one. He’s virtually identical defensively to Richaun Holmes, and a better on ball defender than Fox or Hali. Your emotions don’t change that.   &gt;	joe Harris is on a bad contract  It’s almost like shooters get paid and Buddy is elite at that  &gt;can’t and can’t say  Really slayed me with this one  &gt;	cry about it  Which one of us is crying lmfao"
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn’t be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"If I'm the Mavs I'm doing everything in my power to get two of Lonzo Ball, Gary Trent Jr, or Richaun Holmes this off season."
"Hawks moving back and signing a free agent big would probably be the best bet with the Okongwu injury, although Noel is probably out of the price range. Maybe Richaun Holmes? You're losing a bit on defense but he's more polished offensively."
"I can guarantee you the Suns and Hawks are more desirable free agent destinations now then they were a season ago. The best free agent signing the Kings ever had in the past 15 years was Richaun Holmes, which is beyond sad. We need all the help we can get with attracting free agents, but we also need help retaining our own talent. You think Webber would have resigned with the Kings if they decided to go the opposite direction, or if Fox will stay when his contract is up when our playoff drought record is past the 20 year mark?"
"The Lakers *could* have offered Markieff the same contract that Richaun Holmes got from Sacramento, or even what Reggie Jackson got from the Clippers (they had early Bird rights on him, just like with those other guys and their teams), but instead they just passed on him. He seems like he has the same bitterness that Josh Hart had when the Lakers traded him. Some of these guys must really hate it when the chance to be a Laker is taken away from them. I mean, [just look how happy he was to be a part of the team.](https://youtu.be/EdSRV0D-yiE)"
"I'd say some blame definitely has to fall on the team because those are a lot of top picks not working out, but each of those guys had something individually go wrong that was outside of team control. Fultz and Smith both had injuries go horribly wrong that derailed their development. In Fultz's case if the Sixers got the player they drafted right out of UW he would've been in a better spot than he was by the time we even got our hands on him, by the beginning of his rookie season his jumper was broken. Smith was an upside pick that nearly died due to an allergic reaction, so not only did he miss his rookie season he also lost a ton of his athleticism and strength that he was initially drafted for. In Okafor's case I think it's mostly scouting, no amount of development was going to make him able to defend in space and his offensive game outside of that just wasn't good enough.  If you look around the league you'll see a plethora of guys who were 2nd rounders or UDFA that the Sixers were able to develop into solid contributors. Players like Covington McConnell, and Richaun Holmes were all able to develop into real rotation players. Saric is also an example but he's a late lottery guy so getting that far was kind of expected of him.  There's definitely some blame to fall onto the organization because whiffing on top picks for years in a row is brutal, but I'd say the majority of it was uncontrollable circumstances that the Sixers weren't able to fix before moving on from those players."
No as in Richaun Holmes
"He would play power forward for us, with playmaking attributes offensively. And he really fits anywhere defensively so that won’t be a problem. Yea we’ll be light on shooting but we’ll be deadly in transition and have some really high level slashers. I think he makes richaun Holmes a bit obsolete for us because they would fill somewhat similar roles offensively and Holmes is a below average defender."
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Ben Simmons, Richaun Holmes.   Terence Davis, Louis King, Mo Harkless, Chimezie Metu, Tristan Thompson."
Two words: Richaun Holmes.
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
Richaun Holmes?
"Larry Nance, Thad Young &amp; Richaun Holmes are all better &amp; more underrated."
Richaun Holmes for MVP
I went with two quick examples. My point being players don't suddenly just stop improving at a default age or season. Richaun Holmes is another late bloomer. George Hill had his best year at age 30. Goran Dragic didn't really impact the league until his 6th year. Plenty of instances
"If I told you we once had a GM who compiled a team of: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Dario Saric, TJ McConnell, Covington, Christian Wood, plus a ton of upcoming firsts and pick swaps, only to be pushed out by Big Collar....."
"I like that they have some players you actually want to play. Not a 4th seed or anything, but if by the end of the year Hield is a 6th man and Tristan hasn't been getting any minutes, they have a chance. I guess if they keep Hield and he's coming off that bench that means something is working, meaning Halliburton and Mitchell are balling and Fox is healthy, and Richaun Holmes continues to turn into a good player so Tristan can sit his bum ass down.  If all that happens, they could be a play-in team to me. I'm stupid high on Halliburton, though."
"It was not a half decade. Actually, in the last decade, the sixers only had a 5 year playoff drought compared to the Lakers’ 6.  Hinkie resided over 3 seasons, roughly. Three. His starting assets were: Jrue Holiday, Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, Thad Young. Missing future firsts that the previous regimes had thrown away, too.  They win 19, 18, and 10 games respectively - only the worst team in the league once during that time. Hinkie gets shoved out the door, Big Collar Colangelo comes in, Embiid debuts (in a season in which they lose true rookie Ben Simmons due to a freak foot injury - thanks Shawn Long!), losing years effectively over. 3. Whole. Seasons. In which we discovered gems like Richaun Holmes, TJ, Jerami Grant, Covington, etc."
Wtf you mean Dallas an Toronto crying over not having Richaun Holmes.  Like sure he's a great peace but both teams are in better spots and not a single fan would trade either doncic or the taps success for the past 8 years for Richaun Holmes.  Not to mention ain't a player on the King's better than Pascal or Doncic.
Richaun Holmes is probably a top 10 Center right now. Of all the C's he has the highest TS% and of all the NBA players he's literally like a top 5 TS% or something. He held the #1 spot for TS% for a long time last season and his push shot is automatic. His rim protection is really solid and really his only knock is that he gets pushed around by bigger 5's. But his lateral movement and speed is enough to cover 3-5. He's an absolute bargain and honestly I think that Kings did him dirty with the 4/46 contract he got. He's easily worth more than that.
who tf is richaun holmes  only kings players i know are hield and fox
"Jerami Grant, RoCo, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, TJ McConnell."
Richaun Holmes’ push shot
*Richaun Holmes has entered the chat*
I honestly think that his best fit would be in Sacramento. Send Buddy Hield and someone like HB or Richaun Holmes and *maybe* involve a third team to throw some picks in there. No point in adding anyone under 23 to Embiids team in Philadelphia so I get the sense that reliable role players on decent contracts would do a lot for the Sixers too
Jamal Crawford behind the back crossover thing -  https://youtu.be/rzvIlk6HyYw   And the homer in me likes richaun Holmes push shot
so did richaun Holmes but he has a positive net rating.
"Also brought in Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, and TJ McConnell  The only pick that is straight bad is Jah and word at the time was Hinkie wanted KP and got over ruled by ownership"
"What do opinions of the trade matter to what Hinkie theoretically would’ve done?  His M.O. the whole time in Philadelphia was increasing optionality in order to land a star player. Giving up a 1st round pick to move up two spots in the lottery is not a Hinkie move.  Also you say he didn’t draft well outside of embiid; TJ McConnell, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, etc. would have to disagree with you"
Brook Lopez at $12M. Richaun Holmes.
"&gt;He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington.   How is having these guys on your team for a hot minute and trading them/waiving them before they actually develop supposed to be a point in his favor? I do give him credit for the Covington acquisition/contract (see some of my previous posts) and sure McConnell is a fine player for his pedigree, but the fact the Sixers had every opportunity to cycle through 2nd rounders/UDFAs and give them playing time and only got two players out of it who actually stuck around for the team becoming competitive is exactly why I don't think he's some genius GM like his defenders purport. It'd be a bigger issue if NONE of these guys stuck but the absence of complete failure doesn't automatically make Hinkie good.  I don't see anyone giving the Hornets credit just for taking a flier on Wood because their GM doesn't have a cult of personality around them."
"&gt; after your fan base gave up on him anyway.  care to go back and find the thread where we traded jerami grant? because very few people were in favor of that move. you do realize that Hinkie didn't trade Jerami, correct?  Richaun Holmes isn't very good? So he's better or worse than Dwight?  Robert Covington isn't a good player?  You do realize that keeping Jrue means that we likely never get a chance to draft Embiid, correct? Like we didn't have Embiid on the roster before we traded Jrue. You do know that right?"
"&gt; It’s only now after they failed you’re calling them bad.  many people in our sub were calling out the tobias trade when it happened. most of us were fooled with the horford signing.  &gt;Same thing once Doc got fired from the clippers y’all were thirsty as fuck  this is a blanket statement. many many many fans were against the rivers signing. including myself.  Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."
"&gt;moves on the margins for anyone  He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington. That's pretty encouraging foresight. He saw that MCW wasn't going to last and shipped out the ROY-winner.  He whiffed on Okafor and Nerlens, but even those are tough because the only legit players who went close behind them were McCollum and Kristaps, who refused to work out with us.  I agree that he had bad relationships with agents, but he seemed to have a solid eye for talent"
Richaun Holmes?
You guys should have kept Richaun Holmes! He's deadly with his midrange push shot lmao
you really going to rag on the nerlens pick? look at the players chosen around him. you going to shit on him for drafting richaun holmes too?
"He's been getting a chance, he played more and more minutes as the season went on last year and even started a few games at the end of the season.  He's not as good as Richaun Holmes or Bagley though, so he's limited in what he can show."
Richaun Holmes.
"KAT’s definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there’s definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don’t know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who’s better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That’s 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I’d put above him but are debatable"
"/thread  The ultimate eye test versus box score. I also love how much more impactful he is in the playoffs, one of the rare non-top 10 players whose game is elevated in a playoff setting.  Some other candidates:  * Bruce Brown and Jeff Green for the Nets last year  * DFS  * Richaun Holmes  * Nerlens Noel"
Richaun Holmes vs Montrezl Harrell
" I'll list all the guys that I think are really really underrated (of course not the same level of players) :  DeAndre Hunter : A lot of people think he's just a 3&amp;D, but he's shown some mid range stuff that could translate into low all star type of shot creation already  PJ Dozier : I think he's a high end back up, good defender, good ballhandler, good positional versatility, athletic  Eric Gordon (crazy overpaid tho) : still a guy that can switch well, was very solid defensively in the playoffs every year, can shoot, spot up from deep, can shot create a bit still  Kyle Anderson : his shot is crazy slow and he's unathletic, but other than that he basically is decent or good at everything  Richaun Holmes : the Kings were good with him on the court last year, and were basically the worst defense of all time without him  Derrick White : has shown some impressive shot creation in the bubble, think he's underutilized because he shared the floor with 2 guys who can't shoot and therefore had to take a backseat when he came back from injury"
"Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes is on par with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Jonas Valanciunus and Kyle Anderson"

"I'm not saying he should move out of Steph's way either- just that he should stop, which he doesn't do.  However, that play was not from the current season. It was under the old rule.  Under the new rule, in the front page highlight with Richaun Holmes and CP3, Holmes made an incorrect play by not running into CP3. It worked out well because he dribbled it off his foot, but that's an unforced error. Holmes could have won a guaranteed possession by not slowing down."

"He has a few bad matchups (such as against Gobert, Jokic, Richaun Holmes) but he dominates at least half of the matchups.   I think he was a bad fit for the Lakers. Lakers needed a Dwight type backup C. Not a Trez type.   With the right team/coach he can be a beast. There's a reason why he thrived under Doc with Lou as his PNR partner. There's a reason why him and Lou were a top 5 duo in the league (per 4th quarter numbers, they were some of the highest scoring duos with one of the most efficient and highest scoring PNR numbers). Bubble Trez was coming off the death of his grandma who was huge in his life. I love Trez. I do hold a few things against him but I'm still a fan."
The sixers also had:  Jerami Grant  Richaun Holmes  Christian Wood  Alex Caruso  Robert Covington  Nerlens Noel
Richaun Holmes.
"A team that nobody has mentioned yet is the Kings. I didn't realize until the game last night, but they have put together a really awesome lineup.   Fox is awesome to watch, just super quick.  Haliburton &amp; Mitchell are going to be good players in the league for a while  Harrison Barnes used to be on the warriors and he's just continued to get better with SAC. His shot is so much better now and his %'s reflect it  Hield is one of the best shooters in the league, shoots like Steph, big like Klay or whatever  Richaun Holmes seems underrated, good touch around the basket, gets boards, good fit for the team.   Idk, I never really watch the Kings except for when it's vs. the warriors, but I really like their squad this year. Wouldn't be surprised to see them battling for the playoffs this year or next"

"The Kings being behind in the fourth quarter always leads to very frustrating basketball as they seem to rush everything without thinking at that point, leading to both bad offense and bad defense.  I think Richaun Holmes is going to punch a ref one of these games."
oh my god richaun holmes is the biggest fucking cheat code in the nba this fucking push/hookshot is always money
"Oh for sure. I’m not saying he would be what he is in Detroit necessarily (but like you said lots of other factors go into getting better regardless) but to say that it was an okay move is wrong I think. Jermai Grant on the Sixers was worlds better than Christian Wood on the Sixers ever was and was already on the edge of being a valuable role player at the point he was traded. He certainly could have provided as much value as a year of Ersan (on a bad team) over his contract and most likely would have developed at least a little more as well.  And I agree that the Sixers do not have the best development coaching but Jerami Grant was a second round pick process Sixer who stuck on the team for two years (a real sign in those days; we were shuffling anyone and everyone around on 10-day contracts so if you stayed that long it meant something) on teams full of other young developing players. The Sixers have certainly not been close to the player development level of the Raptors or anything but during the Process years they did find/develop a number of late round picks or exiled free agents like Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc. It certainly wasn’t unreasonable for late draft pick young players to develop with the Sixers back then"
Maybe if they weren't calling some of the most bullshit fouls on both sides all game...  Richaun Holmes was actually feasting on gobert until he got fouled out on some bullshit.
"Richaun holmes didnt even play due to injury, Grant wasnt great back then and Wood didnt get minutes. Covington was the only decent player who actually played out of all those guys"
"The 10-72 Sixers had Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Robert Covington"
"yeah it wasn't the best free agent class and obviously the turmoil in your front office didn't help with setting up meetings with agents and stuff  it would have been nice to see the mavs get richaun holmes or lonzo.  valenciunas was apparently available on the market.  being a lottery team for 5 years rarely helps teams rebuild competently, and you did end up with the by far the best player under 25 in the league.  starting with luka is pretty huge  I want luka and the mavs to succeed but unfortunately there's just no forward progress, its the same roster with the same issues as last year only without the benefit of a HOF coach"

Richaun Holmes has more 3 pointers than Dame this season! Go Kings!!!
Smooth +20 from Richaun Holmes.
"Fox for sure...I may make the case for Richaun Holmes, depending on who's available."
He really worth that Richaun Holmes money?
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"Spurs: Probably  Pistons: Probably  Magic: Just signed a center, have Jonathan Isaac.  Thunder: Overwhelmingly likely eying a center in one of the upcoming drafts, just drafted Giddey, signed Shai to a max. Maxing Shai and Ayton would put them in a very awkward rebuild/compete position suddenly which doesn't really make sense with all the long-term moves they've made.   Hornets: Just drafted a center, already have a lot of money to worry about. Hayward, Rozier, going to have to pay Bridges, Lamelo in a couple years.   Knicks: Probably not. Paid but didn't max Randle, going to have to pay Barrett soon, maxing Ayton would pretty much lock them into a Barrett/Randle/Ayton core, which is pretty bad, especially given the draw of the Knicks.   Rockets: Just drafted Sengun and Garuba, who are both bigs that can't shoot. Traded up for Sengun and you can probably never play him and Ayton together. They also already have Christian Wood.   Kings: Just signed Richaun Holmes, paying De'Aaron Fox, you sign Ayton and then try to trade Holmes for? Fox and Ayton also aren't a great fit because Fox can't shoot.   Wizards: Probably  Blazers: Don't have nearly the cap space and not even going to attempt to clear the cap space for Ayton.   Mavericks: Don't think they have the cap space, and, assuming they haven't completely changed how they want to build their team, they want Luka on the floor with 4 shooters as much as possible. Don't see them spending a max slot on a non-shooter.   Celtics: Literally just paid Robert Williams a very team-friendly contract and not worth fucking our cap for Ayton."
"I'm seeing 28th of 30 in defensive ppg, 11th of 30 in ppg, on average 4 points less than opponents. Haliburton sophomore year, Fox continuing to improve, Richaun Holmes with a good follow up season. All the Kings need is defense and some momentum and they're competing imo"
What about Richaun Holmes?
"It is unless you are being intentionally difficult. Most people would say that the natural defensive position of Nerlens Noel and Richaun Holmes is the 5. And yet the can’t defend Embiid effectively. Therefore it is not necessary to be able to defend Embiid effectively for you to be able to defend the 5 in general. Therefore it is reasonable to say Lebron in his prime could defend the 5, even though he could not effectively defend Embiid."
Can Nerlens Noel guard Embiid? Richaun Holmes? I’m just saying that not being able to guard Embiid doesn’t mean you can’t guard most other centers in the league. Embiid and Jokic are pretty much the only dominant physical post players in the whole league
Richaun Holmes
Scrappy hustle players and defensive dogs  AKA richaun Holmes and Davion Mitchell
he got only 4 mil less than richaun holmes...
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
"I feel like we've hit on a lot of non-lottery talent - Roco, Matisse, Maxey, Shake, Korkmaz, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few. For the most part they all developed in Philly with probably the exception of Jerami Grant.   When it comes to Simmons, obviously the development is not what you'd want to see offensively. Fultz is a pretty unique case though."
"&gt; The hard part was turning all those picks into a winning team.  And this is the biggest thing.   1. In the process of Philadelphia trying to figure out how to win, they've had to tear down a lot of the infrastructure that Hinkie built up.    A lot of Hinkie's players had to be let go because they had no place on the team. We can talk about guys like Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood and Jerami Grant but they had no place to succeed in Philadelphia. They were PF/Cs on a team already overloaded with PF/Cs.   A lot of his coaches, trainers and medical staff also had to be let go.   2. We can't say the problems Post-Hinkie GMs had weren't going to avoided or solved by Hinkie, because Hinkie made very similar mistakes during his time.   Post-Hinkie Problems| Hinkie Problems ---|--- Brand and Colangelo spent all their key draft assets and cap space on non-shooting guards, PFs and Cs| Every single top pick Hinkie had he spent on non-shooting PGs, PFs and Cs The 76ers have had no spacing inside and have had no real answer to the constant double teams| He bragged about forcing double teams in the post and argued the case that drafting 3 consecutive top lottery bigs had put the 76ers in a good position The 76ers have only ever had 1 player who could create off the dribble at an elite level (the #1 skill in the modern NBA) and they lost him| He never once found a player who could create off the dribble at an elite level They've had huge issues with coaching and training staff |  Those staff were all Hinkie hires  Was Hinkie, the man of a million PFs/Cs, really going to save them from overloading on PFs and Cs?   Maybe Hinkie could have saved the franchise, or maybe Hinkie was just another David Griffin, good at running a team into the ground and not much else."

"The real Big 3 of Terence Davis, De’Aaron Fox, and Richaun Holmes"
Isn’t Richaun Holmes like 29?
"Richaun Holmes has another breakout year ahead of him but yeah, Kings feel more like a team that could start off strong and fizzle back into bottom of the pack by mid year. I still think they could compete for a play in though, which in this conference right now is by no means easy."
"capella and ayton might seem similar to you, but saying he is easily replaceable means you could get a lower calibre player and be just as successful. like you said, you already have your scoring, playmaking and perimeter defense sorted. If you could get your hands on a jakob poetl or a richaun holmes, those guys give the same defensive impact as ayton for less than half the price, all of them are great rollers and none of them space the floor regardless. then with the extra 15ish mil you would save a year, you can focus on getting another shooter or something"
"The kings probably keep two or Fox/Mitchell/Haliburton and can insert Simmons into a starting lineup of the two remaining guards, Harrison Barnes/Bagley, and Richaun Holmes. They have a weaker bench assuming Hield is in the trade, but I'd argue that team could be better overall than the Blazers and Mavs."
"Is Dillion Brooks, Jonas Valanciunas, and Kyle Anderson really much better than Richaun Holmes, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy Hield?"
Ya he basically jogged past Mitchell but Richaun Holmes helped so so he took a semi-contested fadeaway that is PG's bread and butter. If anything praise Richaun Holmes.
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
"I'm a huge Richaun Holmes fan, so I'm gonna say that against like 27/28 teams in the NBA no, it's no difference lol"
"&gt; Maybe I'm just unfair to centers, but IMO the bar is just super high to give a center a 25+ Millions contract  It should be. It's stupid-easy to find a bargain-bin big man to fill in on an otherwise really solid team. Would Phoenix be drastically different if we swapped out 25-mil Ayton for 16-mil Richaun Holmes?"
Richaun Holmes better than all three tbh
"Hi I’ve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I’m not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that’s assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs— and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I’m expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he’s at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it’s been in like 10 years. Yeah, it’s not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we’ll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we’re gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go “wow we had no idea they were gonna be so good” I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"
"Because Embiids backups have been guys like Richaun Holmes, Amir Johnson, Boban, Greg Monroe, and Dwight Howard. When he did play with the type of center he thinks he’d fit with, Al Horford, he had better net ratings than he did with Embiid that year."
"This is obviously true. As ridiculous as it is for Ben to make it seem like Joel is what’s holding him back, it’s just objectively true that he’d fit better with a center like Horford.   The fact that he also struggles with guys like Richaun Holmes, Amir Johnson, Boban, Greg Monroe, and Dwight Howard doesn’t do anything to refute that."
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
"Awful draft record like finding Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell all in the 2nd round/undrafted…right. Who was an awful pick besides okafor? Noel going 6th in one of the weakest drafts ever is completely reasonable."
"Okay, so he acquired Embiid and Simmons, both obvious picks at the position.   Four seasons later Jerami Grant would break out while playing for a functional team who never tanked and emphasized smart team building, so Grant could focus on a role well-suited for him. He was never an “asset” in Philly.   Wood was barely in the league and had a very good year on a tanking team four seasons later.   Richaun Holmes is the FOURTH center on the roster. Very smart to keep drafting the most archaic position in the league and never trading any of them to devalue all of their worth.   Covington and Saric are overrated role players. Covington, particularly, hasn’t moved the needle for any team who has traded for him. And, in any event, the best trade the Sixers have made in the last decade was Covington and Saric for Jimmy Butler. Even if Butler left, that trade was ballsy and actually imminently put them in position to win the title. Too bad they chose Simmons over Butler. I highly doubt Hinkie makes that trade.   Noel is a slightly better than average journeyman center who Hinkie should have traded for value a year or two earlier. He botched that asset.   Okafor sucks.   Wow, they had a couple mid-to-late firsts and worthless second round picks.   What a war chest."
"Ayton will probably do the heavy lifting. It’s just nice to a have a tall, athletic backup big behind Ayton for once. We really missed Richaun Holmes the last couple of seasons."
"So it’s more logical to go solely off year by year on/ off ..? When determining the playing level of current players? Despite previous years not accounting for circumstance or improvements ? What moronic logic.   Most players in that range of players don’t move the needle anyways... so it’s not like you’d be subbing out those star level players for more impactful star level players. You’re subbing them out for role players that circumstantial to have a more impact. That’s the problem with stat heads like you that don’t understand anything but math. But I mean hey if you wanna argue richaun Holmes is not only better than Sabonis, but substantially better (13+ on/off differential), be my guest. It’ll not only get you laughed out of most basketball discussions but most GM’s  and coaches would value Sabonis 10x more than Holmes. Why? Because while impact is circumstantial, ability is not."
"Because The Process is massively, massively overrated as an example of team building. The 76ers destroyed everything and intentionally tried to be the worst team in the league year after year after year. The plan was to be bad and get high picks, and build the roster out with low-risk fliers. It’s not some revolutionary strategy, every team knows that being bad = higher picks = better prospects- it’s the strategy that Jerry Krause blew up the Bulls in favor of pursuing. What makes team-building is the ability to scout and find players who are under the radar, which the 76ers kind of did with guys like RoCo, but they mostly were bad, got lotto picks, drafted a miss, traded the miss for assets, rinse and repeat. Guys like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes were guys picked up in The Process who were let go, all players who would have been valuable to Philly. Hinkie and Colangelo’s talent evaluation was horrible, and they had no consideration for fit."
Would rather have Booker from PHX and Richaun Holmes from SAC.
"Alternatively, you could’ve picked Booker or CP3 to pair in the backcourt with Steph &amp; get Richaun Holmes to play center, he’d be pretty great in that role"
When they decided to try to corner the market on undersized centers this summer. The Westbrook trade prevented them from completing the set by also adding Montrezl Harrell to go along with TT and Richaun Holmes.
Ok. But then where's the comparison? Fox hasn't had the chance to prove himself because the roster put together for him is total dogshit since he's been on the Kings and he has a hard ceiling of Luke Walton. Richaun Holmes is the first center for the Kings that has done more than run up for lobs and creates and actual defensive presence.
"Richaun Holmes has been doing stuff up this alley, although not quite at the 10 foot range IIRC"
The second best player one the King's has been Buddy Hield and the King's have only had one wing player in Barnes since 2018 and their best center since 2016 has been Richaun Holmes.
"My college team is BGSU.  We haven't been in the field of 64 EVER.  Last time we made it, was before it was 64.  Richaun Holmes came through on a couple of our better squads and never got it done.  I'm no Simmons fan (GOD no) - but that lack of team success doesn't necessarily mean the player does not have pro potential."
Richaun Holmes
How good is Richaun Holmes?
"And a bench of McConnell, Shamet, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood"
"Does anyone else remember that clip where Richaun Holmes, Jahlil Okafor, and some dude who is out of the league we're holding up their new Sixers jerseys (back when they were one of the worst teams in the league)  They smile for a picture and after the picture Okafor immediately drops the jersey and looks super unenthusiastic, granted the era angle made it look worse than it was  Holmes has a genuine ""I'm just happy to be here"" on his face, then he looks over and sees Okafor do that and immediately stops smiling  Ever since then I've rooted for Holmes because I felt kinda bad for him, and now look out how their careers have turned out lol"
Richaun Holmes and the entire late 00s suns team
&gt;Richaun Holmes  looks like it's one player from each team
And without Richaun Holmes
It's why that last year or two of the Richaun Holmes contract has some risk. That sort of player doesn't age well.
No Richaun Holmes or Harrison Barnes either.
Bagely with the Richaun Holmes special
"no harrison barnes and richaun holmes, even"
"They had Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington and Jerami Grant so yes probably. Also an unproven Richaun Holmes coming off the bench!"
That and Richaun Holmes’ push shot
The fuck you talking about? Richaun Holmes is like one of the best big men in the league and was quite literally a top 20 player up until the past 2 weeks where he dropped to like top 40. He has a top 5 highest FG% in the league.
"I wonder if banishing Bagley to the G-league would do anything. Obviously, it would deplete his already minimum trade value, but at least he would get some playing time with lesser competition to work on his craft (if that is a thing he does).  Kings' cap space is limited too. It's difficult to see how they can wiggle to get some second-round picks from absorbing bad contracts. It'd be nice to just take a bunch of stabs at future draft picks and undrafted guys and see what sticks. Considering the gradual increase in talent across the league (almost to the point of expansion), surely there must be some hidden gems just waiting to be given minutes, kind of like TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, and even Richaun Holmes."
"Here are some of the Sixers process era players that weren't considered NBA players (by a long shot, in some cases) at the time..  * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Jerami Grant * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * Ish Smith  All of these guys went from being essentially G-Leaguers to contributing players.  Brett Brown isn't the guy that's going to lead you to a championship, but he's one of the best at getting lower tier players to improve and play hard.  I'd argue that due to his unique experience coaching one of the worst teams of all time, he's one of the most qualified of this particular situation."
I love Richaun Holmes but he's not a rim protector and that really limits the ceiling of whatever team he's on.
"But beyond Fox, Haliburton and maybe Richaun Holmes, no one one should be off the table in negotiations for Simmons."
"“But beyond Fox, Haliburton and maybe Richaun Holmes, no one one should be off the table in negotiations for Simmons.”"
"The actual text  &gt; The last thing we heard regarding the Kings’ interest in Simmons was that they weren’t willing to part ways with De’Aaron Fox or Tyrese Haliburton for Simmons, which is a reasonable line for Monte McNair to draw even in light of the two guards’ struggles. But beyond Fox, Haliburton and maybe Richaun Holmes, no one one should be off the table in negotiations for Simmons.  This is a misleading headline"
"“But beyond Fox, Haliburton and maybe Richaun Holmes, no one one should be off the table in negotiations for Simmons.”🙄"
Didn’t richaun Holmes come voluntarily?
We'll give you guys one gently used Goran Dragic in exchange for one Marvin Bagley and/or Richaun Holmes
"imagine being the kings and thinking richaun holmes, davion mitchell and tyrese haliburton are untouchable  LMFAO"
"They need better wing defender period and they need a C who can anchor a defence. Richaun Holmes should ideally be a PF in the NBA but because he can't shoot they have to play him at C, he also has a lot of bad habits and tendencies that a good coach could fix and help him rebound better which has been a big issue for the Kings.  They also have a lot of roster overlap that they need to fix if they want to be a good team."
Richaun Holmes
Fox even tho Maxey Ballin?  Idk bout money but richaun Holmes + buddy feels like a perfect fit
"since when is richaun holmes not a ""proper center"", he's great"
"eh I dont think fox would really be good for us, rather have tyrese or harrison barnes or richaun holmes"
"and just like that, Richaun Holmes’ Value has doubled."

They need to do whatever they can to get an actual NBA Center. Maybe someone like Richaun Holmes.
I wanted Richaun Holmes so badly
"Suns - it's honestly McGee, although Ayton and Bridges can be close. Pistons - Hami Diallo, even though he doesn't get much playing time. Thunder - Dort lately, but Bazley has the hops no one other on the team has. Wizards - I'd guess Trez, because of his intensity. Cavs - Allen right now, but Mobley can take the crown. Pacers - Isaiah Jackson?? It can't be Kelan Martin or Brogdon, right? Spurs  - Keldon Johnson and it ain't particularly close, even though Lonnie Walker might argue so. Kings - Richaun Holmes. He is a bowling ball. But Harrison Barnes can surprise you with the hops every now and then. Fox can do some mean dunks. Mavs - DFS."
You’re not a real nba fan until you’ve taken a Richaun Holmes push shot up the ass.
Richaun Holmes push shot
Richaun Holmes is literally better than Michael Jordan???????
"Damn. He kinda of fits exactly what the Mavs needs. Take Dwight's Powell position right away   Then again. So did Batum and Richaun Holmes. And both stayed on their current teams than join us, even though both were offered contracts.   Sad small market noise"
I think people here forget that we're a bunch of NBA fans on a subreddit about the NBA  I've never ever seen or heard any discussion of Richaun Holmes' push shot anywhere outside of this sub (and Lowe)
"If you know about Richaun Holmes push shot you're in the club of people who've actually watched a Kings game, which I'd argue, actually puts you below the rest of us."
"I've had Richaun Holmes 3 years in a row in 12-team H2H 9Cat fantasy. From picking him up off waivers in 2019, to drafting him at the end of the 8th round in 2020, to picking him at the end of the 5th round in 2021. He is my rock, and I love his game.  I still can't believe the deal he's on with the Kings. What an underrated player."
unless you’re a pretty big NBA fan…..you probably don’t know who tf Richaun Holmes is
Great you let the secret out. These plebs don’t deserve to know about Richaun Holmes’ push shot
I told my friends that I'd take a Richaun Holmes push shot over an open Jordan or Durant jumpshot
I ALWAYS tell people about the Richaun Holmes and Tyrese Haliburton chemistry. ALWAYS. It's the first thing I bring up when I talk about basketball. I'm glad Zach is finally talking about what I've been thinking for the longest time. /s
I love me some Richaun Holmes but he's not really helping the Kings in their defensive woes
I know about Richaun Holmes’ push shot
"I wish we signed Richaun Holmes, would be so perfect 😩"
"He’s one of those guys I feel like, you give him minutes and he’ll grow fast. Jerami Grant. Richaun Holmes."
"They wouldn't be the best by any means, but you could build a solid team from former sixers. A lot of the process guys turned out to be damn good elsewhere.  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Butler  SF: RoCo  PF: Jerami Grant  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Richaun Holmes, Fultz, Dario, Nerlens Noel, Iguadala, T.J McConnell, Thaddeus Young"
"And Richaun Holmes, and Covington, and Christian Wood"
"Are you getting hate responses in DM or something? Lol nobody even responded aggressively or anything  To answer though yeah we have more talent this year than we have in a while, probably since we have cousins/gay/rondo  Fox (bad season so far), flamethrowa Buddy hield, advanced stat darling Richaun Holmes, smooth and steady Harrison Barnes, future inside the nba member Tyrese Haliburton, thicc boi Davion Mitchell, and seen flashes of talent from bench pieces like Terence Davis or Len  Nothing that’s gonna blow you away or anything but a couple potential All-stars on there, and some depth.

"What was up with Richaun Holmes? He didn't get to play a lot of minutes (haven't seen the game, but was just wondering)."
"I don't think aibwykat's comment was a straw man, though it may have been unclear.  Are the Kings' parts truly even a good product? Up until the last couple of drafts, they were really only riding on Fox, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy. They've had Richaun Holmes, Bjelica, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. They finally hit with Tyrese Haliburton and now Davion Mitchell. But tell me how a roster with those players as the core is supposed to keep up with the other Western juggernauts. Their incredibly lackluster drafting for more than a decade now (with pretty much only Fox and Cousins as hits) and their mishandling of draft assets (see the Stauskas trade) are out of Walton's hands. The best coaches in the NBA may have dragged these rosters to a low playoff seed a few times but they've been devoid of talent for a while.  That said, I agree that Luke should have been fired long ago."
Why tf is Richaun Holmes only playing 18mins?

Richaun Holmes
3rd best shooter of all time behind Donyell Marshall and Richaun Holmes
I remember attending a Kings game at the new arena around the Holidays back in 2019.   I follow the Kings just to see what’s up with them but didn’t know the roster aside from Harrison Barnes.  I remember only two things from that day.    1. Barnes was laying eggs.   2. Richaun Holmes was the one player who stood.  Dude was everywhere and doing very thing and he stood out all the way from the nose bleeds.   I had to keep Googling him just to learn more about this guy and then I asked myself “why do ya need Bagley?”
I thought it was Richaun Holmes talking about having Walton as a coach.
"Is that how it feels as a fan of another team to watch Jokic hoist up some goofy ass bullshit that always goes in? It must be similar, because by god does Richaun Holmes kill my soul every time he makes one of those shots."
"ugh, we're getting to the point where cuban needs to hire a real GM and empower him to actually make decisions rather than just being a figurehead  cuban's way of doing business just looks worse and worse with every passing year.  this style of doing all our business deals and signings in the club like it's one big nonstop frat party down in dallas is probably rubbing some guys the wrong way, guys who take their careers seriously.   all that stuff about chandler parsons wagging the dog gives me the impression that cuban handles his team business in kind of an unprofessional way  like I imagine he pitched richaun holmes and demar derozan and lowry in the same manner that he courted deandre jordan back in the day.    and just nobody ever ever wants to sign in dallas, its clearly not working.   this last offseason was a big chance to bring in talent before luka's supermax kicks in and it was just a total whiff"
"They're not in your shortlist, but an open invitation to get on the Kings train. 5-4, a win over the Suns and Lakers, three of their losses were the Jazz (twice) and the Warriors. Davion Mitchell is the best guard defender in the class and finding his offensive game, they got high level guardplay, Richaun Holmes is one of the coolest people in the NBA and Marvin Bagley isn't stinking up the court."
"Just looking at the title, I thought this was Richaun Holmes talking about Hinkie's ""process"". I almost brought out my pitchfork lol."
At first I thought it was Richaun Holmes talking about the Sixers process.

"Richaun Holmes also had a new personal record of rebounds with 20, to go along with his 23 points."
Thank fucking christ we resigned Richaun Holmes
Richaun Holmes got my fantasy team going off
"We’re talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
Richaun Holmes is playing even better than last year
Retaining Richaun Holmes
"On March 30, 2019, the Suns were home against a short-handed Memphis Grizzlies team. Center Richaun Holmes was out due to a migraine and Ayton had rolled his ankle late in the third quarter. In their absence, Grizzlies center Jonas Valanciunas dominated, scoring 14 of his 34 points in a decisive fourth quarter for a 120-115 Memphis win. The loss dropped the Suns to 17-60. The NBA on ESPN and the ESPN app  Immediately after the game, according to staffers, Sarver marched into the coaches locker room and unloaded, berating head coach Igor Kokoskov and his assistants, demanding answers as to why they didn't ""make any adjustments"" to stop the burly Grizzlies center.  Veteran assistant Joe Prunty, who did not respond to a request for comment, spoke up, saying the short-handed Suns had made several in-game adjustments -- fronting Valanciunas, doubling him on the catch, explaining other basketball minutiae.  ""Joe starts throwing all the s--- at him, [and] the guy has no idea what any of that means,"" said one former coach, details that others in the room confirmed. Sarver, livid, marched toward the door and screamed ""No adjustments!"" on his way out. ----  Holy fuck, the idiocy."
"Durant yeets the ball into the 8th row, no call. Richaun Holmes throws headband, technical foul. Sick."
"I'm looking at numbers from last season due to sample size...looks like Ayton is more efficient but at a much lower volume. Richaun Holmes has him beat on volume but slightly lower efficiency, basically a wash, and Bam is right up there as well at a little lower volume."

"richaun holmes might be one of the biggest contract steals in the league, 4yrs 48m and in my opinion he's an above average center right now.   good defense, eats big minutes, rarely gets injured and AFAIK he's never had a major lower body injury which is a big red flag for big men"
its an underrated nice story that richaun holmes picked loyalty and re-signed with the kings.  he must have had some nice offers on the table this last offseason
"They’re the classic underdog, no one could ever get on you for being a bandwagon, and they have one of the most loyal fan bases out there. They also have some fantastic young players you could watch grow from the start of their careers (Deaaron Fox, Tyrese Haliberton, Richaun Holmes). They haven’t won much of anything any time soon so it could be a rough ride but they’re a hell of a fan base and I think they have a bright future."

I don't know if there is another city that would love Richaun Holmes as much as Sacramento loves that man.
miss that man. we were a Richaun Holmes away from the ECF in 2019 and it haunts me every day
Richaun Homes is so good.  Yea we played against him not too long ago but I've followed his play for a little bit of time now.   It's not a coincidence the Kings are having him as their main center at the moment. He hustles his ASS off. He's a great guy to have as your center honestly.  This man deserves a big payday.  -Not Richaun Holmes Agent
I. Love. Richaun. Holmes.
I was at this game and the kings' bricks were so loud lol. Also richaun holmes is a beast.
Richaun Holmes shooting 100% from 3 and only King to shoot over 25% from 3 today...
Richaun Holmes continues to be so underrated
Richaun Holmes has been amazing to start the season. The fact that they're 2-2 with arguably their 2 best players playing awful is a great sign
"I thought so too when we first traded for KP but I think Luka would actually fit better with a rim rolling big or a true 3&amp;D big like Maxi Kleber. KP is too fragile to do a lot of pick and roll as the roll guy. He can pick &amp; pop but it's not as effective as the roll. And while he can shoot the 3 and space the floor, he clearly prefers to post up and shoot mid range shots off the dribble. So it turns out, they actually aren't as great a fit as you'd think on paper.   I was really hoping we would get Richaun Holmes this past offseason because I desperately want to see Luka with a better rim runner than Dwight Powell. At this point I hope we can just find a way to get rid of KP's contract without giving up too many assets in return and just try again in free agency I suppose."
"I mean the clear 2 best players on the Kings this season have been Barnes and Richaun Holmes (I'm sure Fox and Hali will play themselves into shape tho). Buddy has shot well from 3 as he always does, but he's also shooting 33% on 2s and he's basically the same player. Pretty sure everyone advocating for the Buddy trade is either a Sacramento fan, or isn't following the Kings and doesn't watch their games."

Richaun Holmes but he's playing C now so idk
"&gt;THT wanted to stay and the Lakers wanted the same.   lmaoooooo  If someone else wanted to sign THT they would sign him. The fear was that the Lakers would get poison-pilled. But no, crickets.  Let's see who else is earning around THT's range (9.5). I've put in bold text the ones who signed in the same FA year as THT.  **- Richaun Holmes (10.3)**  **- Devonte Graham (11)**  **- Shmurda (10.3)**  \- Jae Crowder (9.7)  **- Danny Green (10)**  **- Reggie Bullock (9.5)**  \- Seth Curry (8.2)  \- Monte Morris (8.4)  \- **Caruso (8.6)**  Source: [https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  THT is the NBA version of ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know""  I mean it's just the price of dealing with LeBron/Klutch. That's just the way it is. At least you already got a ring out of it."
"That is patently false lol  There been a shitton of guys in the league rn who came through the process, like Richaun Holmes or TJ McConnell"
This is the kind of quality analysis I come to r/NBA for. Setting yourself up for a win/win situation is a bitch move! If Chris Paul wasn't a bitch he would have waited for Richaun Holmes to get into position and thrown a contested pass to Ayton in the paint and let him earn his basket like an alpha male.
Re-signing Richaun Holmes is a major win now move lol no disrespect
Richaun Holmes has done fairly well for himself. He's a cool dude too.
Ah my bad.  They have Richaun Holmes.
"It is shocking. I feel like any idiot would just do this:  leave: K.Johnson, Draymond, Grant  pickup: Trae, Zion, Bridges  There's a reason all our real best players are sitting at home. They already won gold medals when they were young and passionate about facing a new challenge. Anthony Davis played team USA ball before his first NBA game. Instead we have Trae and Zion, the future faces of American basketball, sitting at home.   Not to mention JaVale lmao.  Timelord? Montrezl? Plumlee? Jarrett Allen? Nerlens Noel? Christian Wood? Richaun Holmes?"
"Full text of tweet:   Kings‘ **Richaun Holmes** sits down with Stadium: Emerging as a starting C after being drafted behind Joel Embiid and others in Philly “These were starting centers...I feel like I’m competing against them off rip”, free agency **(Hornets, Mavs expected to pursue, per sources)**, more."
"No way are they giving up 4OA + OG Anunoby for 2 years of Bradley Beal. Let's consider asset management: We have 4 more years of OG Anunoby at $18mil/yr and whoever we draft at 4OA will be locked up for 5 years at $7mil/yr.  That's $25 million for at least 4 years of OG + whoever we get at 4. Then we have Lowry, in all likelihood, coming off the books to provide about 20 million in cap space + whatever assets we recuperate in that.  So we're realistically looking at Suggs/Wiseman/Green, OG Anunoby, and a UFA: Oladipo, Porter Jr, Powell, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, etc.  The roster would look like this: Suggs, FVV, GTJ, OG, Siakam, Holmes + whatever assets we get from Lowry.  Just doesn't make sense to give up *both* the 4OA pick and OG. Probably send a guard back."
Upgrade at the 5 has to be top priorty. Richaun Holmes or Turner would be great fits
Richaun Holmes. Or if they don’t want him continue reuniting the band and grab Theis.
Theis/Zeller/Richaun Holmes/R Lopez are all UFA also.  I'm sure the Suns get get a better backup center then Frank the Tank.
Imagine Steven Adams with a Richaun Holmes floater
He just needs to build muscle because he called for post ups but couldn't even bully richaun holmes in the paint. He also needs to learn to play better defense and smarter offense but luckily draymond will beat his ass if he doesn't
No. They made a mistake in kit keeping Richaun Holmes though.
