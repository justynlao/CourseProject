"The Nets obtained James Harden and gave away Caris LeVert, Jarret Allen, Rodion Kurucs and Taurean Prince, their umprotected first round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, plus a first round pick swap (so if the pick of the other team is lower that that of the Nets they trade those picks) in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.  The Cavaliers obtained Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince and gave away Milwaukee's umprotected first round pick in 2022 and Dante Exum.  The Pacers obtained Caris LeVert and a 2nd round pick in 2023 from Houston and gave away Victor Oladipo.  The Rockets obtained Victor Oladipo, Rodion Kurucs, Dante Exum, the Nets 3 umprotected first round picks, Milwaukee's 1st round pick (via Cleveland), the Nets 4 1st round pick swaps and gave away James Harden and a 2023 2nd round pick."
"Rockets get: Victor Oladipo + A shitload of picks  Nets get: James Harden + some picks  Cleveland gets: Jarett Allen, Taurean Prince + some picks  Pacers get: Caris Levert + some picks"
Exactly. What do you define as being legit for the Grizzlies? We already beat the fully healthy Suns and Spurs(while we were down players). Is it only a win against the Lakers/Clippers/Jazz/Nuggets that would make us legit?  Also just wanted to point out that the Caris LeVert led Nets beat a fully healthy Sixers squad. Those guys weren‚Äôt pushovers. And to beat them without Ja or Jaren has to say something at least.
"I do know, I‚Äôm just saying if we talking about being legit, I‚Äôm thinking like a top 4 team in the west. Y‚Äôall also had like 6 games canceled.I think y‚Äôall are good but you gonna have to beat more than the Cavs, Spurs, Suns, Sixers without Joel, and the Nets led by Caris Levert to be considered legit. We thought this team was legit last year until they got to a tough stretch in their schedule. Won‚Äôt have a real feel until JJJ comes back."
Yea... He's getting a max contract and putting up caris levert numbers lol
Caris levert
I think if Caris Levert and TJ Warren are healthy they can back their way into a conference finals
People were saying they gave up too much for harden when all they traded was Jarret Allen and Caris Levert who sadly has cancer. They easily won that trade. Draft picks are overrated
"Yeah so you guys would rather play against caris levert than james harden, KD, and kyrie? The ""trash package"" that would *never* get james harden trashed ya'll, embarassing."
Yeah Sixers are gonna be in trouble if they run into Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen in the playoffs
"Hear me out, put the pacers.  I think the pacers are sneaky talented and deep with no real gaps at any position.   Brogdon and Sabonis are all stars, Turner is playing crazy, lamb, Warren, and Dougie mcbuckets are doing well, and they haven‚Äôt even added Caris LeVert back to the lineup.   They‚Äôre my sleeper pick to make it out the east."
"dame, christian wood, jamal murray, caris levert, beal, vucevic, the list goes on.  i don't think people realize that underrated means people DONT talk about them, it has nothing to do with all star recognition or anything like that. beal got snubbed last year, but that doesn't make him underrated. people are now calling him the second best SG in the league. if anything, that makes him OVERrated."
"Trade Kyrie for Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and picks so the franchise can have a future."
"Joe Harris, Dinwiddie for pennies. Caris LeVert for Thad Young. Jarrett Allen for Bojan Bogdanovic.  He built a solid core with no lottery picks. Only lottery pick was D'Lo thru the Mozgov dump which worked out great.   So just saying the Nets did nothing and got 3 superstars is a pretty weak take."
The Nets really traded Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert for a bigger bearded Ricky Rubio
"Bruh the sixers got beat down by the Caris Levert, Tauren Prince and Jarrett Allen led nets you guys aren't realistically beating the Nets."
"players from the 2016 draft I would definitely take over Simmons:  Ingram, Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray.  Brogdon &amp; Siakam are in the same tier as Simmons right now (I would put Simmons ahead of them in that tier), and below that is the Caris Levert, Buddy Hield, Dejounte Murray tier.  Simmons is closer to these guys than he is to the top of this class, and if he doesn't figure out a way to impact the game in the half-court I could see more players leap-frogging him."
"Yes, especially with trades, drafting, and signing contracts. You submit to a full health exam and that's why Caris LeVert is currently out. When he was traded to the Pacers, they found a lump on his kidney."
"Apprantly trading an incosistant Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen for one of the best scorers of all time makes us worse and losing in double overtime when a random player on the cavs goes for 45 points is called getting ""destroyed"". You sixers fans are delusional if you even think you're getting close to the finals when your second best player can't make a jumpshot, and your 3rd best player is Tobias Harris. You aren't getting past Milwaukee or Brooklyn. Deal with it second round exits."
Caris Levert with cancer is still more valuable than whatever laker package you can think of.
It‚Äôs a total blanket statement. I feel like efficiency and other areas of impact should be taken into account when saying that. Like actual empty stats are Andrew Wiggins prior to this season or Caris LeVert
Based off last year:  1. Bogdan 2. Fournier 3. Caris Levert 4. Danny Green 5. Eric Gordon 6. Gary Harris
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
1. Eric Gordon  2. Evan Fournier  3. Danny Green  4. Caris LeVert  5. Gary Harris  6. Bogdan Bogdanovic  Downvote me and tell me I‚Äôm wrong. I don‚Äôt care
"The nuggets or Pacers would be my choice today if the Raptors folded tomorrow. Nuggets have a loaded team and will be around for a while. The extra entertainment factor comes in watching the ultra talented and draft steal Michael Porter Jr's rise to superstardom. Pacers are similarly loaded with the smooth as butter Caris Levert about to take the city by storm. As an added bonus, you get to watch the son of Euro GOAT Arvydas Sabonis make up for the time his dad missed thanks to the cold war."
Harden for Allen would be interesting. Maybe involve Indiana and snag a guy like Caris Levert too
"Derrick Rose, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert,"
Damn i had no idea caris levert was from this class. Felt like he‚Äôs been around since forever.   But ironically this draft class has probably more potential for further success than the much hyped 2014 draft class. Aside from Embiid and Jokic of course
"We can‚Äôt even go 5 games without another injury to one of our main guys. 13 games in and we are already down: Victor Oladip: (traded for Caris Levert), Caris Levert: Out for an indefinite amount of time due to a mass on his kidney. TJ Warren: has been out all but I think 3 or 4 games and won‚Äôt be back for the next 2 months or more. Jeremy Lamb: Out since last year with a torn ACL, he should be returning soon. And now the latest one, Myles Turner(leading shot blocker in the league and a top 2-3 candidate for DPOY): fracture in his hand, out anywhere from a couple weeks-?              We literally can‚Äôt EVER stay healthy long enough to see how great we could be. Our top 8-9 guys can stand up to any teams 8-9 guys but we can‚Äôt ever see it because multiple players are hurt at the same time"
"""Yes, I traded Caris Levert. But what you didn't know is that I also saved his life. Guess that's not as grabby"""
"BRUH Caris LeVert can't catch a break. Such a promising young player, yet I always see him plagued w/ unfortunate circumstances üòî rooting for this stud"
"Kemba was coming off of an all nba second team.   Victor oladipo just got traded for caris levert.   He‚Äôs also come out and said he‚Äôd like to play for the heat. He has essentially 0 trade value for any other team.   The heat are not offering the rockets 2 firsts and a second for the right to sign him to a 20 m a year deal. This is because unlike you, pat riley does not have a mental disability that would make him value oladipo that much.   &gt;the Celtics need to sign vuc  The Celtics best players are 22 and 24. They don‚Äôt need to make any sudden moves. If they do, they might end up looking like the rockets now, with no future and not much draft capital.   Ideas like this are why you post comically bad trades on reddit while Danny ainge picks a team with 2 U25 all nba players"
The story 5 years from now James Harden trade saves Caris LeVert life.
"It‚Äôs more of a product of the ‚Äúheliocentric‚Äù nature of the league today. Let‚Äôs say I have KD, Joe Harris, and Caris LeVert. Based on pure talent LeVert starts, but I‚Äôd rather start the shooter to maximize KD *and* let LeVert cook off the bench with Shamet, Prince, and the other guys. Pascall is different, he‚Äôs on the bench bc he‚Äôs the same position as Draymond, who you want next to Steph as much as possible."
"The Nets have been the home for outcast misfits for years now... it's kinda our thing.   DeAngelo Russell was viewed as a rat, Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris were basically out of the league, Caris LeVert was injury plagued, hell even Jarrett Allen dropped in the draft because people thought he didnt care enough about basketball.   In a weird way, KD Harden and Kyrie are the perfect superstars for the Nets"
"They can actually go big and sign someone like Bradley Beal straight up, IF he demanded a trade which i dont think the Washington Wizards would say No to, if Kyrie Irving is made available by the Nets. Or they can be smart about it, get some back up bigs  plus some draft picks. Did i sell low? I dont think so, the nets just gave up Jarret Allen and Caris Levert having some draft picks would serve them well in whatever situation they may be next season. Well Its actually hard to say when execs and front office view Kyrie as a huge distraction on and off the court. But the man can play no doubt so it would be interesting if wherever he might end up."
Houston could have taken Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert if they wanted. Tilman was just cheap and wanted expiring contracts
"Caris LeVert, improved on all parts of his game thus far but was overshadowed in Brooklyn. Hopefully he comes back this season with the Pacers."
Myles Turner and TJ Warren.  Also Caris LeVert.
Sprains sometimes look worse than they are.  Caris Levert looked like he snapped his ankle in half last year but he was back in a few months
"Shit, as a fantasy LeVert owner, I was so happy he got out of Jersey and was going to see his numbers skyrocket. I hope he recovers quickly for my sake. I already have three players on the IL, you're not helping Caris!"
Would you take Caris LeVert for Kyrie?
Trade Kyrie for Caris Levert and Myles Turner
Maybe they can offer him up for something like... Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen lol
"Oladipo's career trajectory as I see it is on a likely downward slope whilst Caris' is improving on an upwards trend. They have the same production on offense and Oladipo is better on defense, but he is older, with an expiring contract, looking to leave to a bigger market and also coming off a huge injury.   Rockets paid LeVert and a 2nd rounder to let Oladipo walk for free because of their cheap owner. They are getting robbed for sure."
"Caris Levert has had the worst injury luck, ever since college. Poor guy, and hope he gets everything all cleared and back healthy soon"
"aren‚Äôt you the guy who traded away caris levert?  sean marks: yes, but did you know i also saved his life? guess that‚Äôs not as grabby"
"Sure, I can get on board with that. In the hospital, pro athletes are still patients first, which means they have full autonomy over their medical decisions. Like any other patient, Caris LeVert would work with his doctors to weigh the pros/cons of pursuing a workup in the context of his family and job.  Your previous comment sounded like doctors may withhold or offer Caris further workup/treatment options based on his net worth/value.  I'm pushing back against that idea. Doctors will offer Caris all the standard options that any patient is offered‚Äîwhat decision Caris makes will be up to him as is true with any patient."
Harden saves the life of Caris Levert.
Harden saves Caris Levert life.
"Random, relatively unknown player bursts onto the scene due to great improvement. Fans get caught up in the improvement and consequently overrate the player relative to more familiar, well-known players of similar skill levels.  Happens all the time. This year it‚Äôs Christian Wood. Caris Levert is a fine player, but claiming the Rockets got ‚Äúrobbed‚Äù is ridiculous."
"Why would an athlete population be different in terms of finding benign things that get worked up and cause more harm than good?  Is it not possible that Caris LeVert gets a biopsy, gets an abdominal infection, and spends weeks in the hospital for something that is benign?"
Its seems to me like the cavs and pacers got a away with theft on this whole ordeal. Surelly houston could have got something better for caris levert and jarret allen.
/Vince McMahon meme  Second round pick  Caris Levert  Cash considerations   But seriously it's nice to have Cash Considerations back after we sent him to Phoenix
huh? since when did the pacers pay a couple of firsts for caris levert?
"You can downvote me all you want, but this exact scenario has happened before causing trades to be adjusted or even killed. If Caris Levert failed his physical, than the Rockets can call the whole trade off if they really want. Doesn't matter that the players reported, they couldn't actually play any minutes.   Again though, this is all speculation. We haven't got confirmation Levert failed his physical. And even if he did, the Rockets can give it a greenlight and it'd go through literally any minute and Harden would be available for tonight for the Nets. That's why they report, so they can be available as soon as it is finalized.   Harden is [literally on the Nets injury report right now](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/injuries/_/name/bkn) for non injury related reasons. That means it's because the trade hasn't been finalized."
"Spencer Dinwiddie responds to a graphic thanking him, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell for making the new Durant, Harden, Harden and Harden era possible."

"It really sucks for long-time Pacers fans. I honestly believe the ""brawl"" Pacers were going to easily win the championship, but the team was destroyed from that event and it took YEARS to recover. Despite that, we must lead the league in player development based on how many ""most improved players"" we have.   It's wild. We've just never drafted a player who was talented enough to carry the team to a championship. And NBA players appear to hate Indy, despite it being a fairly enjoyable downtown area. TBH downtown Indy is a really nice area and I live in one of the top tourist destinations the world (Orlando). Sometimes it feels like we are the farm team for great teams, both in coaches and players.   I think our current team is different. By all accounts, Brogdon *wanted* to be in Indy. Sabonis just wants to ball with his bros, Turner and Warren. Then you add someone younger, cheaper, and on par with Oladipo like Caris LeVert to team? Nice. I think our team might be the most ""stacked"" from starting line-up to backup coach.   Is that enough to win a championship? I doubt it. Only time I've seen that done was those old Piston teams. But maybe we're getting close enough to replicate that."
No no you're right. Caris Levert or a washed up Victor Oladipo will take you MUCH further than a 24 year old all star.
"As of January 11, Caris Levert ranks 5th in defended field goal percentage, minimum 100 attempts at 37.7% on 46/122.  Really shows you watch a lot of both saying he‚Äôs a sieve defender. Go back to bed with the hate. That statement shows you‚Äôre completely lost."
So no ones gonna talk about Caris Levert being on the rockets box score
"This is what I don't understand about player empowerment.  Only star players are being empowered. Everyone else is being depowered.  Do you think Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert, Rodnis Kurucs feel empowered? Why don't they get a say in where they play? The obvious answer is because they aren't as good, but it just shows that the NBA is beholden to like 10 players."
It‚Äôll just happen later when you have the GOAT Caris Levert.
When we add 50+ point scorers TJ Warren and Caris Levert to this team...
"Caris LeVert has been below league average efficiency every year since his rookie season. He just isn‚Äôt that good, and he‚Äôs not a young guy with a ton of upside anymore. Statistically, he a shorter, less efficient Kyle Kuzma with better playmaking."
"Hell no. Nets got Harden for only Caris Levert, Kurucs and Prince."
Bill Simmons doesn‚Äôt count. Mr ‚ÄúCaris LeVert doesn‚Äôt even crack the 10 man rotation on the Celtics‚Äù headass
"I agree. You‚Äôre NBA media, you should be able to name Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert if you‚Äôre the one asking the question about the trade. I‚Äôd be justifiably miffed if I were either of them"
"I've seen a lot of people either misunderstanding what we gave up or blatantly over-exaggerating it.  I've seen people say we gave up 8 first round picks. No, we didn't. Hell we didn't even give up 4 picks. We gave up 3. The other first round pick is coming from Cleveland. We also gave 4 swaps, which aren't the same thing as picks. For some reason a lot of people have trouble understanding this. We still have picks in the years of those swaps, we simply have the worst pick out of ours and Houston's  In total it was: 3 first round picks, 4 swaps, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, and Rodions Kurucs for James Harden and a second round pick. In no conceivable way did we get fleeced"
Considering he mentioned caris levert and Garrett temple as the guys to build around I doubt those comments meant anything.
it makes perfect sense when you consider this as a _cost cutting_ move on the part of Tilman Fertitta. Otherwise they could have kept Jaret Allen and/or Caris LeVert
"*gestures towards Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert, and Rudion Kuruc's empty lockers*  ""We can move you with the swiftness üóø"""
Hear me out:   Three team trade  Send Kyrie to Houston for Caris LeVert and four first rounds  Houston sends Oladipo to Cleveland  Cleveland sends Jaret Allen to Brooklyn  &amp;#x200B;  obligatory /s
This is why I‚Äôm a little confused that they didn‚Äôt keep Caris LeVert. He‚Äôs on a better contract and I bet they‚Äôd receive more assets for LeVert than Dipo on an expiring if they traded him.  But Fetitta is probably so cheap he wants to keep the expiring
Put some respect on Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen's names :(
Exactly. The times I‚Äôve watched Brooklyn this year he‚Äôs impressed me more than Caris Levert. He outplayed Gobert and Embiid in back to back wins. I‚Äôm sure the Cavs see him as a building block
"Pacers won the trade. Sabonis is now the Pacers star &amp; Caris Levert will be a complimentary player doing the dirty laundry, a role that is not fit for Oladipo. Levert is also taller &amp; younger than Oladipo."
"He dropped 50 once. So did Mo Williams. Please don‚Äôt ever say All NBA in the same sentence as Caris LeVert. He will never be an all star, or even get close. Great role player though"
This makes sense for the Pacers.  Caris LeVert will be able to find her place alongside Malcolm Brogdon.
The Caris LeVert for Victor Oladipo trade gotta be the most aesthetically named trade of all time
"Caris leVert and Jarrett Allen for James Harden? They‚Äôre absolutely better. They may not be favorites to win the title over the Lakers, but trading two role players for an MVP in their prime absolutely makes a team better regardless of ‚Äúfit‚Äù concerns"
"2018 Oladipo was a top 20 player in the league. He does not need to be that good today to be better than Caris.  Current day Dipo is producing more than Levert without having the spacing of KD/Kyrie/Harris. This is not a debate, you are wrong."
Summoning u/lemmingpractice  Your thoughts? I liked your write up on r/nbadiscussion on how Caris Levert is kinda average at best. Do you think with how Oladipo has been playing you would make this trade?
Yeah but the Pacers have Caris LeVert
They'll be very good when they get TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb back. Caris Levert is going to fit in nicely. I think Oladipo had some chemistry issues. He still thought he was the man even though he wasn't. Malcolm Brogdon is officially the leader of this team now.
"Imagine turning down a better package of Simmons, Thybulle, and picks for the Caris Levert poo poo platter because you‚Äôre salty over the team‚Äôs new GM"
I don‚Äôt really understand this multi-team trade deals. Why would the Pacers agree to losing Vic just to get Caris Levert
I don‚Äôt really understand this multi-team trade deals. Why would the Pacers agree to losing Vic just to get Caris Levert
Caris Levert is going to be what Victor Oladipo should have been.
"Pacers did better, caris levert is gonna be a lock for 30 a night. And I think Indiana is a perfect team for him too, he can create shots and get buckets"
Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert are my two favorite players   :(
"That honestly doesn't seem like a ton for Harden.  It's obviously a big deal, but I figured they'd need more in the way of players in addition to the picks and swaps. Not taking anything away from Caris Levert (especially since his ass torched us the other night), but I would have thought they'd get a star (Kyrie or a different deal with another team) or the combo of Allen/Levert/Dinwiddie plus picks/swaps.  I guess the offers coming in really weren't anything crazy after all."
"Phew internet just came back on in time for the game, really excited to watch my favorite players Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert ball out tonight against the Knicks!"
I don't know why people in the media kept talking about Caris LeVert centering a package that could get Beal for so long when it turns out he can only get an expiring year of Oladipo post-injury
We basically traded Dipo for Thaddeus Young. Considering we traded Caris Levert for Young.
"Caris ""2021 offseason Danny Green"" LeVert"
instead they took Caris LeVert...
"""The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four-pick swaps, all unprotected.

"Lmao Rockers gave up Jarret Allen Caris LeVert Rodions Kurucs and FOUR PICKS FOR JAMES HARDEN?? forgive me, but this seems significantly worse than the A.D. trade."
"That game was wild lmao, Caris Levert damn near ended our season on a buzzer beater"
"It can definitely bridge the gap. I mean James Harden just went for picks and Caris LeVert lol.  So sure it would take Wiseman, the 4th pick, and possibly some other picks/players but those two assets would be the highlights of the trade package."
Follow the Pacers. Right now they are middle of the East but they are about to get Caris LeVert for the first time and TJ Warren. Should be an interesting team.
"The wording is very confusing in the article to me: &gt; Pacers swingman Caris LeVert is on track to return to the lineup in the second half of the season, sources said, which is a miraculous development given he underwent surgery for kidney cancer in late January. Indiana remains without a definite timetable on LeVert‚Äôs return given the unique hurdle he is overcoming, and the franchise will be patient with his return.  So he's healthy and on track but no timetable from Pacers?"
"Plus Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were both draft picks in the 20+ range, which don't exactly have a very high success rate, and they ended up being the centerpiece of a James Harden deal. Marks did a crazy good job turning minimal resources into this team."

The pacers are missing TJ Warren and Caris levert lol
They really could have used a guy like TJ Warren or Caris LeVert
And caris levert
"I mean, if that‚Äôs what you want, that‚Äôs what you want. I personally don‚Äôt fault you for it, but you‚Äôre getting downvoted because most would disagree with that mentality.   Believe me, I love Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen, and D-Lo and Brook Lopez before them but if the Nets‚Äô best chance of winning is with them on other teams, then so be it. There‚Äôs nothing stopping me from rooting for the old crew while they‚Äôre on other teams."
"It‚Äôs not that Sixers didn‚Äôt want to give up Maxey for Harden, it‚Äôs that they didn‚Äôt want to give up Simmons, Maxey, and multiple 1sts when the next best offer was the Caris Levert poo-poo platter.   Green, one of Thybulle/Maxey, and a 1st is pretty fair for us and the money isn‚Äôt an issue."
The Pacers will be an extremely balanced team when TJ Warren and Caris LeVert actually play some games. The fact the Pacers are in the 4th seed without two of their top 4 scorers and not a single player makes the All Star team is crazy to me
"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
"Dude is averaging 21.5/11.6/5.7 on the 4th seed in the East while the teams 2 best pure scoring options are out with injuries (Caris Levert, TJ Warren). But instead, we sent 2 All-Stars from the 6th seed because they play in big East Coast market."
"The Pacers roster hasn't been much better though, as we haven't had 2 starters for most of the year. (TJ Warren and Caris Levert, who hasn't even played a second for us yet)."
Caris Levert. Some moves just give me MJ flashbacks. Not saying he‚Äôs MJ but it‚Äôs there.
"Brooklyn is beating great teams with only 2 stars and a shit roster, they beat the sixers with their practice squad and caris levert"
Nobody special just two up and coming stars.  Caris levert and Jarret Allen üò©
"I absolutely loved Allen and Caris LeVert, you guys had some really quality players during those ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù years."
"Murray,Hield,Brogdon,FVV, and Caris Levert were still on the board. They definitely fucked up taking him"

Caris Levert
I remember when Bill said if Semi Ojeleye was on the Nets instead of Caris LeVert he'd be getting hyped up just as much and is just as good
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

"Definit Caris LeVert. He can be inconsistent, but he can take over games on his own when given the chance"
"I agree with your assessment on Sabonis. I haven't seen Caris LeVert, so he might have the best chance out of anyone. I think we know Brogdon's potential (all-star, but not more than that), and I don't see Warren or Turner reaching the level of Reggie."
Caris Levert is the most overrated player on this sub lmao. The lengths people go to shit on D'lo just to praise Levert is insane.   Levert isn't that young and his numbers never stand out. He has his moments and he can go off sometimes though
The selection would have gone to Caris LeVert if he didnt get injured
"Maybe if you just go on bball reference and take a quick peek at his stats, instead of considering whether there may be context to the numbers. Like you literally have to have never seen a single minute of Caris Levert play if you think he‚Äôs a bad playmaker  Caris was battling injury/recovery for most of last season. But around the start of February he was finally healthy and really hit his stride. He basically became the first option with Kyrie injured and put the team on his back. Over his final 22 games of the season he averaged 24/5/6 on 45/38/75 splits. He led the nets to a 12-10 record with some really impressive wins along the way. And he dropped a 50 piece against Boston. That 12-10 record includes dragging the corpse of the nets to a 5-3 record in the bubble.   He went into the playoffs with the atrocious bubble nets and ended up averaging a modest 20/6/9.5 on kinda poor shooting (but you have to consider he was the only offensive weapon on a team up against a defensive juggernaut in the raptors) and it ended up being an unsurprising sweep"
That was litterally Caris Levert last year also but people treated him like like a future star because he played for a big market

Oh man I thought the whole Nets roster is showering with Caris LeVert by that title
He definetley misses Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. I hate that the Nets traded for Harden they were perfectly fine without him.
"Not excusing it, but providing better context. Was prior to the Harden trade so Nets still had Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen. Also, Curry got pulled just before the game started due to COVID."
"Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, and Taurean Prince who were all contributing on Defense to various degrees along with Rodions Kurucs who was relegated to the Bench.   They received James Harden who isn‚Äôt known for his Defensive skills and only recently filled up 3 Empty Roster Spots a month after the trade.    Nets essentially lost their entire 2nd Unit between the trade and Dinwiddie‚Äôs injury. Not to mention Sean Marks shitting the bed on the Bey for Shamet trade. Of course their Defense was going to be bad.   How many great high quality Free Agents are available to sign mid season? Nets can only do so much and so far Sean Marks hasn‚Äôt proven himself to be on the level of Morey when it comes to in season roster building.   Sean Marks gets a ton of his shine from hitting on LeVert and Allen back to back in the draft along with finding Dinwiddie and Harris in the trash bin. He‚Äôs been very limited in his drafting skills since 2016-17."
Jamal Murray Caris LeVert Jimmy Butler Robert Covington Clint Capela
"He has modernized the offense, and he has done well utilizing Sabonis as an offensive hub while empowering Myles Turner more as well on the offensive end. He has leaned perhaps too heavily on starters, but it's also forgivable because IND is missing their leading scorer and Bubble God from last season, TJ Warren, and is without who would be the team's, arguably, third best player in Caris LeVert.   Basically, for the Pacers to win most games, they need a consistent outing from Brogdon and Sabonis, a good defensive performance from Turner, and either Justin Holiday or Doug McDoug to go 4-6 from three. IND is missing a lot of offense and a wing defender, so it's been even harder since the Oladipo trade.   LeVert might be back in a month, and Warren might be back in two. The only player to be worse since Nate's takeover has been Aaron Holiday. He has been crazy inconsistent, and I'm not sure how much blame to ascribe to Nate, but the fact Aaron has continually had more playing time than Edmond Sumner is slowly becoming a problem."
"So you think KD and Kyrie joined the Nets because of cap space alone and that's it? Jared Dudley spoke at length at how well he was treated by the Nets and how they have a one of a kind staff. KD said going to the Nets was an extremely easy decision because of how they performed last year and the fact his personal surgeon who did his Achilles is on the Nets staff   The Nets went from having no draft picks in 2016, to a playoff birth in 2018. Do you think that doesn't have value?   The Nets without Harden are still easy favorites coming out of the east because of how well they drafted and developed Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen Joe Harris, Claxton and Dinwiddie"
They almost made me forget Harden isn't even playing....who they got for Caris fucking Levert and Jarret Allen btw  CARIS FUCKING LEVERT AND JARRET FUCKING ALLEN FOR JAMES HARDEN  Adam Silver needs to be assassinated

"&gt;That Nets team was pretty good, the Warriors offense has been pretty bad this year dude.  Caris LeVert missed half the season and D'lo and Spencer picked up a lot of the load. Especially D'lo with that comeback win and averaging 25 ppg to end the season to secure the 6th seed for the Nets.  &gt;But why don‚Äôt you link me those stats? I think I‚Äôve given more than enough evidence to make my case.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russeda01/shooting/2021  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wiggian01/shooting/2021  Especially Wiggins who has 80% of his 3's assisted lol compared to 42.4% for D'lo  &gt;Like I said, no matter how much evidence I give you, you won‚Äôt believe me lol. But you at least have to admit that it isn‚Äôt a lottery pick difference, which still makes it a bad trade.  And no matter what I say to you you have prejudice to D'lo for the last season. He's clearly the better player lol. It took Wiggins playing with the best spacing guard in the league to look average...."
Nah most GMs smarter than Stone would either get Ben Simmons from Philly or Caris Levert or Jarret Allen from the Nets. Stone is relying on the lottery and hoping people can‚Äôt accurately the risk adjusted value of the future unknown.

"Shit the Rockets could have got Jarrett Allen as well who's a young fringe All Star calibre centre  Jarrett Allen, Christian Wood, Caris Levert is a pretty decent core. The Rockets really didn't look too bad when Christian Wood was healthy, a handful of pieces away from being in the Western playoff bubble tier which is a much better position than where they're at now imo."
I stil can't believe we got Caris Levert out of all the trade shenanigans.
"yes, Ben Simmons or Caris LeVert is better than Kelly Olynyk"
Lmao like getting Ben Simmons or Caris Levert is better. Y'all are some dumb mfers.
Caris Levert is not a franchise cornerstone
"Late firsts from contenders, best case scenario, turn into Jarrett Allen or Caris Levert both guys that got moved for Harden and end up on the rockets"
I'm ok with the pick based package and I also understand that we gambled on trying to flip Oladipo for assets that we preferred over Caris LeVert.   We lost the Dipo gamble.   Let's hope we don't mess up the way we use all of the picks we accumulated.
"I honestly forgot who Harden was traded for.   Jarrett Allen? No he‚Äôs on Cleveland. Caris Levert? No, Pacers.   So who the hell did the Rockets get?"
"IMO, even worse than this is they could‚Äôve just held on to Caris Levert who was having a great season before being traded and is a better player than Victor Oladipo who they just shipped off for peanuts."
"I think it‚Äôs pretty clear the 2 max slots were for the star players. Caris Levert, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Jarrett Allen are very enticing surrounding pieces for 2 stars though. But go on trying to exaggerate things and delude yourself more"
Kyrie actually said he wanted to sign with the Nets because he grew up in jersey and wanted to be close to home.  But yeah ignore those details and pretend that Caris LeVert is a star attracting player.
"Because people are dumb and overrating Caris Levert like crazy.  It was never about the players in that deal, it was either Simmons or the future picks, and they knew that with the Wall contract it was completly impossible do build a contender around Wall/Simmons/Wood, they would've been just good enough not to have anyone to draft, until the moment when Simmons ask a trade because he's tired of Tillman/Wall"
They almost did. Caris Levert.  But then they inexplicably flipped him for Oladipo. Who got flipped for Olynyk/Bradley/pick swap.  Good lord.
This is so hilariously wrong. You guys gotta stop following what idiots like Simmons say blindly lol. We‚Äôve (barely) got the second most FRPs in the league coming up. We have a better young core than most teams already without using ANY of them. And we‚Äôre not giving a 52% TS Caris LeVert $52m over the next 3 years. Sure we could get fucked this year (boils down to a 50/50) but we‚Äôre not the fuckin Wolves lmfao
"&gt;LeVert is decent enough to fuck with their tank but historically inefficient and he can't stay healthy. Would you rather LeVert or Cunningham/Mobley?  It‚Äôs not an either or. If the Rockets went on a 20 game losing streak with Wall/Oladipo/Wood, do you seriously think Caris LeVert would‚Äôve effected their tank?"
"Decent pick return, those picks could possibly even turn into someone as good as Ben Simmons, Jarrett Allen, or Caris LeVert!"
"Hard disagree there.   What a lot of people are missing is the pick protections the Rockets are dealing with.    Draft| 1st Round Picks ---|--- 2021| HOU (If top 4, otherwise they get the worst of MIA/OKC) + MIL + POR 2022 | HOU + BRK 2023 | HOU or BRK (Best) + MIL + WAS (If 15-30, otherwise they get a future 1st) 2024| BRK 2025| OKC or BRK (Best)  2024| BRK 2024| HOU or BRK (Best)  If they tank hard this year they can keep all their own picks for the next 3 drafts before OKC comes collecting on the Westbrook trade in 2024. By that time the Brooklyn picks will just start to get juicy.  LeVert is decent enough to fuck with their tank but historically inefficient and he can't stay healthy. Would you rather LeVert or Cunningham/Mobley?  I can see the argument for taking Ben Simmons, but you don't tie your future to Caris LeVert...   Bill Simmons said the Rockets fucked up... He also said the Celtics fucked up trading an ageing Pierce/KG for Tatum + Brown + Sexton (who was traded for Kyrie)."
I actually thought Caris Levert had a brother in the league named Chris. Like Caris was the Pichael to Chris' Michael.
"Hey man, they also didn't get Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, or Nicolas Claxton"
"**2020-2021 Trades**  Jrue Holiday - 3 FRP  James Harden - 4 FRP, Caris LeVert  I‚Äôm skeptical."
"What does any of this have to do with the subject at hand lol this is about buyout players not KD or Kyrie. And apart of this doesn‚Äôt make sense. People hate Kyrie cause he wanted to be the best player , and is now the 3rd best player? The whole ‚ÄúKyrie as the best player‚Äù experience was already tested in Boston and saw how that went.   Also, KD is coming off an Achilles injury, there is no certainty that he will ever be fully healthy for a season again. Trading for a durable Harden was the best decision the nets made(and it also saved Caris Levert) Sean marks is not stupid, we not putting everything on the back of KD when we have chances to get other players to atleast keep the team competitive while he‚Äôs out.   If KD ever wanted to prove he can win without a superteam, he would first have to prove he can even stay healthy for a long period of time. That chapter is closed and I think KD knows it."
His play style is bit similar to Caris LeVert but Shai is better.
JA and caris levert were just traded away lol. Listen i get what you are saying..This nets team is 100% a mercenary team like the lakers. Im just letting people here know that sean marks is very very very exceptional at drafting as well. Its a very well run organization
"&gt; Even the Harden trade was all future draft picks that got that deal done, not assets built up over last few years      Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were 100% built up by the team, what are you talking about dude"
"I think Sean Marks recruited him via 7 first rounders, Jarrett Allen, and Caris LeVert. Nephews are pretending like KD had a direct line to fertitta"
"Drafting (Allen, Claxton), smart signings (Dinwiddie, Harris) or trading for unwanted stars in salary dumps (DLo trade got Mozgov off LA's books) or for rookies (Caris Levert) is exactly how Sean Marks built this team.   &amp;nbsp;   Marks then signed Kyrie and traded DLo for an injured KD that didn't even play for a year. I feel like people keep forgetting nobody knew how KD would come back from tearing his achilles.   &amp;nbsp;   Then he pushed all his chips to the center of the table and traded for Harden.   &amp;nbsp;   Complain all you want,  I completely get it. Even if Blake and LMA are far from the players they used to be. But don't act like Sean Marks didn't make chicken salad out of chicken shit with this nets team."
"Precious, Robinson, Nunn, Herro, whatever picks we had and some other rotation players for salary. We would have been Jimmy, Bam, Harden and the Sioux Falls Skyforce if that trade went through. The problem was that, as we found out today, Harden was only ever going to go to the Nets so the Rockets tried to use us and the Sixers to squeeze more out of the Nets. Both our packages were better but they settled on Caris LeVert and picks because we were never actually a team he was going to go to"
"He should have gone to the Pistons then, just ask Caris LeVert"
Tbis is gonna be in every Caris LeVert discussion isn't it
"Yea, I don't see us beating the caris levert redemption game. If he goes off, that's fine too."
"Why not keep Caris?  I get that Oladipo is exporting and can maybe be traded for an asset, or just use the cap space to sign an asset, but Caris Levert *is already an asset*. A medium to long term one too."
Caris LeVert without a doubt. Young Rudy Gay was my favourite for a while too.
"Rockets: We should get Oladipo for Harden, his trade value will be high, maybe we could even trade him for a package of Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen or something!"
"&gt;Houston, Dallas, Denver and Golden State have also expressed notable interest in Gordon dating back to November's draft. Orlando's asking price appears reasonable, seeking a combination of picks and young players. It's uncertain what youngster the Timberwolves would have sent the Magic, but before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure."
"also did you [see this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2936163-rival-nba-execs-see-major-trade-opportunity-in-orlandos-available-stars), werent you the one who months ago said you would trade Caris LeVert for Aaron Gordon. Apparently the Nets tried! Article says ""before the Nets acquired James Harden in mid-January, Brooklyn first presented an offer involving either Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie for Gordon, sources said, yet the Magic were seeking a higher 2020 draft asset than the Nets were able to secure.""  So it sounds like they wanted LeVert and more than a bottom 2020 first perhaps back then.   Also sounds like he's generating more buzz than Vucevic: ""Vucevic's market does not seem nearly as vast.'"
Gotta be Caris LeVert for me. Dude has already battled through so much in his career and still manages to stay humble and down to earth.
"Caris is 26, only 2 years younger than Oladipo and Oladipo was an all star the same age Caris is right now.  Not saying I fault you but I just find it fascinating this is the take about Caris LeVert when he‚Äôs prohibitively not *young* anymore. There are actual all stars younger than LeVert. My question is why does Indiana want LeVert more than Oladipo i feel like LeVert isn‚Äôt as good as Dipo and hurt more."
"LeVert may not always be the best player on the court, but he was a borderline All-Star prior to getting injured last season and he‚Äôs always worked hard on both ends. Glad to to see him keeping that up in his first game back. Also if you guys rally and make the playoffs, good luck to your first round opponent. Playoff Caris is elite."
"I still have no idea why the rockets wanted Oladipo over LeVert, I feel like Caris has so much more upside"
Levert of Caris ia good player. I feel like he should go to Heat but Pacers not bad
Lakers: Bradley Beal  Nets: Myles Turner and Caris Levert back
"CARIS LEVERT (MORE LIKE CARIS LEGOD AM I RITE????) IS THE GREATEST PACERS PLAYER, NO, THE GREATEST NBA PLAYER OF ALL TIME LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"Something like ""Caris LeVert needs to stop being a thug and act with more class""  ...to one of the nicest and humble guys in the league nonetheless"
CARIS LEVERT
I wish caris levert would drop the thug antics and get a little class
Well that sucks. Good win Lakers. Can't wait to see Caris Levert tomorrow night.
"Saw the words ""Wojnarowski"", ""undergoing surgery"", ""Phoenix"" and panicked. Thank god everyone on the suns roster is okay. Hope Caris LeVert kills it in his return, but in a loss :)"
U guys could have had caris levert and jarett allen together with Christian wood and john wall.
"you:   &gt;He literally was traded for 4 picks and Caris LeVert. You should look at your assets again because you 100% could have made a better offer.  Reply:  &gt;Also Jarrett Allen and four pick swaps lol  you:  &gt;Rockets did not receive Allen in the trade  Clarify if this is incorrect but your point was that allen doesn't count as part of hadens trade value, because he didn't end up on houston. This is wrong because hardens trade value is defined by what the team who got him gave up."
He literally was traded for 4 picks and Caris LeVert.   You should look at your assets again because you 100% could have made a better offer.
Pg: steve nash  Sg: caris levert  Sf: jonathan isaac  Pf: timmy  C: either wilt or ben wallace i dunno
"Big up to Caris LeVert and his amazing recovery speed..Broke a leg, miss a couple of months n came back the same season..Cancer scare, out a couple of months n come back the same season..Stay strong my guy"
Caris LeVert is terrifyingly good at scoring the ball. Pacers fans really in for a treat.
Caris levert !
"TBF, Harris shot 47% from 3 in 2018-19 when he was surrounded by D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Caris LeVert."
"That Golden State would still have been one of the most stacked team in history.  If KD would've 3-peated with just Kyrie, Fro Allen, Caris Levert, DeAndre, Joe Harris, Dinwiddie (no Beard or Blake), they he'd definitely vault right up there."
"Really though? Here are some people on ~20m contracts. Jerami Grant, THJ, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon, Bojan, Caris LeVert, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Gallanari, etc. Given a choice, would you willingly pay 20M for Wiggins over any of these players?"
AND they got Caris LeVert!
Thank God for Caris LeVert
"They got a #1 overall and a #3 overall pick and hit on both of them. they just havent done anything with the rest of the roster. Meanwhile everyone is shitting on the nets for getting lucky meanwhile marks has consistently pulled good players out of thin air. He drafted caris levert and jarrett allen with mid to late first rounders. He developed harris and dinwiddie off the scrap heap. Even this season hes getting solid contributors from a second round pick in claxton, Tyler johnson, and bruce brown who was a virtual nobody that we've turned into a good player.  Boston is sitting with 3 all star players and then complaining about super teams with the nets give me a break."
I expect some type of Caris LeVert last shot to send the Blazers home shit for that last game
Caris Levert game winner
https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Who+does+Caris+LeVert+play+for%3F+
"I can relate to that. My Pavies have Brogdon and Levert, (and TJ Warren next year when healthy). All can get their own shot, they just sometimes try for it too much. Especially in close game situations. Sometimes it works out for the better though. Caris hit a fine game sealing 3 against the Sixers, the other day."
Nets did good work but their current position worked because they are a big market team in Brooklyn. I‚Äôll give marks credit for keeping them afloat and drafting some good players like Caris levert and Allen  If the nets were located in Indiana or a small market they wouldn‚Äôt have kyrie kd and harden
"Let's not forget the Nets trade away Caris Levert, Jarret Allen and Taurean Prince for Harden, then Kyrie switch to the SG role while Harden switch to PG role.  This all happen when Dinwiddie, the only good PG they have left was injured.  After that trade, Nets sign Andre Roberson (defensive SG), Iman Shumpert (another SG), Alize Johnson (wing player) Blake and Lamarcus (big men). None of them are PG. Until the Harden injury which the Nets sign Mike James as a stopgap measure until Harden return.   So yes, it was clear that Nets intend for Harden to be the playmaker."
As in we had to give up two of our best players to get him (Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen) so naturally Harden‚Äôs role in the team becomes even more central and critical.
I still can't believe we got Caris LeVert for him during that Nets/Harden trade.
"Man, that really sucks to see for Vic.  The fact that the Pacers offered him a 4 year $85mil deal, and somehow came out of it with Caris Levert is insanely lucky.  Rockets were out of their minds when they made that trade."
I think Caris LeVert is my favorite comp. Bodies are very different but they play sort of similarly on offense.

"I think it's just Boston and they don't really have room to grow beyond internal development.  Not saying that as an insult to them, they should probably be near the Knicks on this list.  But Butler and Dragic are getting older.  Toronto is probably thinking long term.  Indiana is melting down right now.  I guess the Hawks will continue to grow but their cap is gonna be pretty fucked with Collins this summer.  The whole article is a guess but I think it's fine to guess that a top destination with 60 mil in cap room can marginally improve their standing over the next three years or so.  It's not like KD and Kyrie were drawn to the opportunity to team up with Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie, New York and LA teams will always have a competitive advantage and the Knicks are the only franchise among those cities with cash to spend right now"

Jarrett Allen is a top five center in the league. Caris LeVert was a great playmaker/ facilitator on this team which is something we lack without Harden on the floor. Stop.
You gave up Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. Every other ‚Äúvaluable asset‚Äù you gave up wasn‚Äôt actually helping you win games this year. That‚Äôs not nothing but it‚Äôs not a lot.
"VO: 20/6/4 (with 36% shooting on 7.7 3s/gm) and great defense   vs.   CL: 18.5/4/6 (with 35% shooting on 5.3 3s/gm) and not great defense  At the time of the first trade, LeVert was *clearly and objectively* not as good.  CL: 20/4/4 (32% on 5.4 3s/gm)  vs.  KO: 19/9/4 (38% on 4.7 3s/gm)  Olynyk has clearly been better in Houston than LeVert has been in Indiana  In what world is Caris more valuable? The one where some idiot GM looks forward to paying him $36M over the next couple seasons?"
Wtf I'm Caris LeVert???
I sincerely hope one day he can have a consistent team around him. it sucks that he‚Äôs one of the best bigs in the league and his second best player is Caris Levert (no offense)
Westbeast bringing it to the East Coast.   Clutch game-winning free throws and block on Caris Levert.
Caris Levert / D‚ÄôAngelo Russell / Jarrett Allen
[Dame's reaction](https://streamable.com/oi69ga) when Caris LeVert missed the shot that would've ended our season really says it all. Those bubble games were so stressful and intense.
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
Could‚Äôve also has Jarett Allen and Caris Levert instead of kelly olynk and avery bradley lol
"A lot of trade ideas I've had involve the Pacers, I agree they're the team in that sweet spot of having good assets but needing to blow it up. We'd have to break it up into multiple deals for the S&amp;T to work, but an overall deal like this would be great:   Warriors get:   * TJ McConnell  * Caris LeVert  * Myles Turner  Pacers get:   * Kelly Oubre  * James Wiseman  * Jordan Poole  * Minny 1st   That seems like a fair exchange of value. Pacers get a great pick, a promising young guard, and a blue chip Center prospect, plus a reliable wing. Warriors get a starting C and two fantastic bench guards. Caris becomes sixth man, TJ becomes the bench PG we desperately need.   Curry/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Turner, TJ/Caris/Juan/Paschall/Looney - I really like this rotation for the Warriors. Good mix of pieces that fit well together. Bench could use more shooting, but with Curry/Klay/Wiggins working in with them, it should work.   Brogdon/Lamb/Oubre/Warren/Sabonis, Poole/Holiday/McDermott/[draft pick]/Wiseman   Pacers get younger, gain draft capital, and still have a competitive team."

Caris levert single handedly trying to carry me to a fantasy title
God fucking bless Caris LeVert üôèüôèüôèüôè
Caris Levert is the closest we‚Äôre gonna get to having a professional athlete named Streetlamp Lemoose
"You're overrating their lineup. Sabonis is good offensively but terrible on defense. Turner provides almost nothing offensively, and TJ warren is... well, I have no idea since he hasn't played in months. I really like Brogdon and LeVert though, especially Caris.      A rebuild wouldn't hurt, but it isn't necessary either if the Pacers aspirations are just to make the playoffs."
They could get a huge return for each of there players.  Caris LeVert.  Malcom Brogdon.  TJ Warren.   Sabonis.  Myles Turner.  Jeremy Lamb.
"&gt;""Amid a year of difficulties with players and staff, Indiana Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren's future with the franchise is uncertain as the regular season nears an end, sources tell ESPN. The Pacers are 30-34 and in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.""3 hours ago  The tl;dr of this statement is that the Pacers want a scapegoat despite trading away their 'franchise' player, (albeit for major upside in Levert), being plagued by injuries all season‚ÄîSabonis' back, Turner's hand, Caris' literal cancer, etc.). Their record isn't indicative of the coach or his schemes imo especially with the revolving door of injuries.   I literally had to pick up Goga Bitadze because Sabonis went down, and then Goga went down after one game, so I had to pick up O'shae Brissett in fantasy and almost considered picking up Sampson too.. lol"
"I got chu fam  Nate Bjorkgren, Indiana Pacers (30-34, 9th Seed in Eastern Confernce)  When the Pacers fired McMillan just weeks after giving him a one-year extension in late August, there were two traits that had clearly led to his exit: His hard-nosed style had caused consternation among players, and his unwillingness to embrace analytics was seen as a problem that simply had to be fixed. Bjorkgren, who had worked under Toronto‚Äôs Nick Nurse and made several G League stops along the way, was supposed to represent a change of direction on these two fronts ‚Äî a new-age coach to take over a talented roster.  While he is indeed far more invested when it comes to coaching in accordance with modern-day NBA thinking, Bjorkgren‚Äôs abrasive style has come as a surprise ‚Äî in interactions with players and his own coaching staff members¬†‚Äî¬†and led to the kind of frustration that has caused significant concern. It hasn‚Äôt been reserved merely for the players, either, as several sources cited instances where Bjorkgren‚Äôs personality and tendency to be controlling with assistant coaches and other staff members caused unnecessary tension.  Players throughout the roster have voiced their dissatisfaction with Bjorkgren and their general unhappiness amid a down season, including key star players in Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon, sources said. Those sources¬†say Bjorkgren has implemented an analytics style of coaching that players privately do not find suitable for the roster, and that there have been issues among the coaching staff at times. Bjorkgren has worked to address matters internally, and one source described him as ‚Äúover-communicative‚Äù to make sure he is sharing and receiving messages from the roster. One coaching source predicted that this would have a similar ending to what took place in Charlotte in 2013, when former St. John‚Äôs assistant Mike Dunlap was fired after just one season amid widespread player frustration.  Indiana‚Äôs front office, led by president Kevin Pritchard and general manager Chad Buchanan, has built a players-first culture. After a loss in early April, Pritchard had an emotional message to players: Sources say the longtime executive tried to assure the players that the season would improve and their fortunes would turn.  As always, the contracts of all the involved parties is an important part of the context. Bjorkgren and Sabonis, in particular, both have multiple seasons left on their deals and, for better or worse, are connected when it comes to their successes and failures. Perhaps all of the principal decision-makers need a sit-down to iron out issues.  Across the roster, players are having career seasons under Bjorkgren ‚Äî including Sabonis and Brogdon. The offense has been run through Sabonis throughout the campaign, and he has responded with an excellent season: 20.2 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. The Pacers, like most of the league, have dealt with injuries to key players throughout the season ‚Äî currently Myles Turner being sidelined with a partially torn plantar plate in his right foot. They had to adapt to a blockbuster trade that sent Victor Oladipo out and brought in Caris LeVert. Oladipo had averaged 20 points per game in his nine games to start the season in Indiana, and while LeVert has posted 20 points per game himself since returning from his two-month absence after a procedure to cure kidney cancer.  In many ways, Pacers officials understood growing pains would come with the first-year head coach.¬†Management had a level of comfort with Bjorkgren prior to his hire partly because of their previous history which dates back decades.¬†What this all means going forward remains to be seen. Pacers owner Herb Simon has historically been reluctant to make coaching changes this early in the process, as every coach since he bought the team in 1983 has been given at least two seasons (Dick Versace had parts of three campaigns from 1989 to 1990, but just one complete season). More recently, former Pacers coaches like McMillan, Frank Vogel, Jim O‚ÄôBrien and Rick Carlisle all had at least four seasons at the helm. Still, the level of early frustration here in the Bjorkgren era means this situation is definitely worth monitoring."
"Lmao take Harden out and who you have in? Jarrett Allen, Terrence Prince, and Caris Levert. Those are 3 players that give distribution to rebounding, scoring, and some much needed defensive bodies as well.  The current Nets now lost to the Bucks back to back by a collective 9 pts. I'm not going to even bring up Spender D if he was healthy.  Now I wouldn't say Pre Harden Nets would be guaranteed for a finals appearance but they sure as hell have as good chance and would be my favorite (flair aside)  That being said I'm happy af that we have Harden"
"It was Kd who went after James my guy! And if you don‚Äôt know we had Jarrett Allen, claxton and DJ playing the front court and Dinwiddie or Caris levert coming of the bench to lead the second unit! We would have been fine."
"They literally got rid of the young core, they traded away all the players that made the Nets special sans joe Harris. This is basketball gentrification, it wouldn‚Äôt sit right with me to see the knicks trade Randle, RJ and Mitch for Kawhi, Dame and Lavine. I‚Äôm not saying that would happen anyways but that‚Äôs basically what the Nets did, they traded their identity and culture for the business move of having star appeal. KD and Kyrie didn‚Äôt choose the Nets because they had Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen, they chose them because they had cap space and were willing to also sign their friend deandre Jordan. They literally fired their head coach, the person who sets the tone for a teams work ethic and culture, to appease KD and Kyrie. This was the gentrification of a grass roots team that beat the odds, just to sell more jerseys to Midwest transplant Brooklyn hipsters."
"Lmao what, Caris Levert is pretty damn good"
"I'm sorry if you care enough about ball to post on the internet about it and don't know who Caris Levert is, your opinion is pretty much worthless. I can't even be nicer than that. Like it's not like knowing some 2way guy on the Thunder."
Lets be honest 99% of people don't know or care about Caris LeVert.
‚ÄúCaris Levert (idk who this is)‚Äù  this guy went to the advanced section of basketball reference and drafted this post. Unbelievable.

He should. Caris LeVert went down with an injury and D'lo picked up the slack to get them to the playoffs.   Nobody expected that team to even make it to the playoffs. And he was the replacement for Victor Oladipo iirc
"My only deal is I‚Äôd be adding him to a team that already has Anthony Edwards, Caris LeVert, Andrew Wiggins, Chuma Okeke and Devin Vassell at wing üòÖ"
"that was with jarrett allen, caris levert, and spencer dinwiddie in the picture.  I dont think the nets can win it all without Harden. The record this season without Harden is painfully average. I do think they can win it without Kyrie though. Harden and Durant would be enough"
"Also, if they didn‚Äôt have Harden, they would still have Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert. Nets would absolutely be title contenders without Harden."
You mean how Caris Levert got traded to Indiana  and JA got traded to Cleveland in the Harden trade in order to get enough picks to send to HOU?
"People can say what they want to say, I got nothing but respect for my 26 year old ROTY Malcolm Brodgon, my GOAT white boy Tank Commander of the Process off TJ McConnell, and cancer survivor Caris Levert."
"Imagine if they had competent management that could've paired him with great young guys like, I don't know, Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen."
"I‚Äôm glad you mentioned the 42 win season cause that just proved my point. Marks was responsible for trades that got us Dlo, and trades that landed us Allen/Caris Levert. He also made great pickups with Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris.    Suns did not inherit the Billy king disaster, neither did you turn a historically irrelevant team, only 10 years into a new city, into a team with 3 HOF players. Everything your saying is great, but fails in comparison.   Another reason I‚Äôm glad you mentioned the 42 win season: it shows this was a slow build up. People think we just walked into KD/Kyrie/Harden. No, 2 of them were rumored to go to the Knicks all of that season prior to when they came to us. Marks built a playoff team then a championship favorite   Like idk man, Marks taking the Billy king situation and turning it into this, far outweighs JJ turning around a regular bad team. Quite a few teams were in a similar situation as The Sun. Very few were in Marks situation at all  When marks became GM full time, we won only one game more than the 19 win Suns you keep referring to and you won 34 games last season.."
imagine if they had jarrett allen and caris levert to this team too

"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30724904/indiana-pacers-caris-levert-indefinitely-small-mass-found-kidney  &gt; The mass was found during a physical prior to the Pacers finalizing the trade to acquire LeVert. He will undergo further tests.  &gt; Pritchard noted that as soon as the team found out about the medical issue, ""All eyes were trying to help Caris and making sure that we planned this out."" Pritchard said the team grew comfortable with the decision to go forward with the trade after receiving feedback from its medical personnel, despite there being no timeline set for LeVert's return.  LeVert was lucky he was traded, they found out about his condition when they where doing the routine medical checkup they do to every player to see if teams are not disclosing injuries.  They liked LeVert and they where done with Oladipo after he rejected the contract."
He meant to say Houston fucked up the market by giving away Caris LeVert for scraps
High School teammates with Caris Levert
"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
"Levert played a lot of 3 on Brooklyn next to D‚ÄôLo and Dinwiddie. And I‚Äôm sure they can just move on from TJ, he‚Äôs a good backup but definitely replaceable.  There‚Äôs also the option to bring Levert off the bench for firepower. Start Brogdon-CJ-Warren, then bring in Caris to stagger those guys.  I agree it‚Äôs not a *perfect* fit, but Pacers were trying to trade Turner for Hayward last offseason in a sign and trade so I know he‚Äôs expendable. And top-end talent is the most important thing after all, and CJ is definitely better than Myles, so I think it‚Äôs a win for the Pacers in the end."
"Domas is a given. Brogdon was top 10 in the East votes before slumping so he can easily be All-Star. Warren was our top scorer, and with the new system that emphasises shooters, combined with the question of if Warren decided to break out, means he could be voted as an All-Star. Caris LeVert being given a bigger role, and popping off even after his recovery, means he can easily be an All-Star (Nets fans still love him). If Turner was more consistently aggressive offensively, he's also a lock for All-Star since his defense speaks for itself.  We don't have elite players but we have many good players. That's our culture, stop arguing about it. That mentality carried us to the playoffs year in year out. We are one of the most consistently successful franchises. When franchises have a culture of drafting stars and not developing guys with a chip on their shoulder, they don't understand this.  Yet a-fucking-gain, I'm not knocking the Heat. They were rough against us, this is not arguable. Their guys shot bricks and couldn't shoot 3s aside from the 2nd game, when they shot 51%. I've mentioned how good Spo is already, but nah obviously the Heat are shit and were the worst team. The Magic beat the first seed Bucks, we just wanted one win against the Heat.  When your coach makes the same gameplan 4 games in a row without fail expecting success, it speaks volumes about their unwillingness to adapt. We wouldn't even have cared about losing if we just saw Nate shaking shit up.  You're literally making up narratives to argue against."

"When the Nets traded Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen stuff they did in the community was what popped to my mind.  It's cool to have guys on your team like Jrue, you can be proud to root for."
"Nah, the real thing is the Rockets wanted to send Harden to where he wanted to go and that was Brooklyn. The best pieces of that trade came from Cleveland.   Or are you saying Caris Levert is better than Herro or Ben Simmons. Hell, they asked the Celtics for Tatum lol"
"Like when they said we had a 0% chance to make it in the bubble, and we would‚Äôve made the playin if caris levert hit the game winner"

"They can give him a ring if they win. They could do the same with Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Kurucs, anyone who was on the team for that season."
"I don't think a package of Herro, Duncan and Achiuwa, would have gotten it done for the Rockets without significant draft compensation. That was the big issue with the sixers package too. The Rockets still screwed up by only getting Oladipo. I would have rather had Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle and picks, or Caris LeVert, Jarret Allen and picks then Oladipo."

"Did the Heat have that many picks and pick swaps to trade? Seems like that's what the Rockets wanted... do the Nets even any picks left in the next like 6 years?  By the way everything went down, it seemed like the Rockets were clearly more interested in sending Harden to the Nets, and didn't really want back players. They rerouted Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to Cleveland, Caris LeVert to Indiana, and eventually traded Oladipo to Miami. The only player they actually kept was Kurucs, and he plays like shit. If you look at all that, I don't think they were all that serious about negotiating with parties other than the Nets, unless they were gonna fleece them."
"Well hey, at least you still got Oladipo. But maaaan do I feel bad for Rocket fans. They not only gave up their pick for this horrible year to OKC for Westbrook, a guy who they gave up on after one season basically making their suffering so far for nothing, but they also gave up their 2024 and 2026 picks plus a pick swap in 2025. Those would have hurt a lot later if they didn't trade James freaking Harden for a bunch of late first round picks, Caris LaVert and Jared Allen, who are actually a pretty good gets to build around. Not an amazing deal but they played the hand they were dealt well enough. Only for the front office to trade their center for the future for another late pick and bags of chips. Than, just to really show how incompetent they are without Morrey, they trade LeVert for Victor who they flip for a 29 and 30 year old bench players plus pick swap in 2022. So they basically got a bunch of late first round picks for James Harden. Just typing this all out makes me cringe lol."

"Full transcript, since Streamable doesn't work for everyone and Reddit titles are limited to 300 characters:    ""I was in Miami when Chris Bosh went down with the blood clots. We didn't know a lot about it at the time. At one moment we're in a plane and we're flying to All-Star Weekend. We're celebrating being an All-Star together. Afterwards you go on a little vacation and I watched a chance in Chris on that vacation.  And then the next time I seen him, he was in a hospital with tubes in his chest and his mouth. And at that moment, it's real life man. People don't see that. They look at athletes, they look at the money we make, the lifestyle we're able to live because of it and they think that it's not hard. That life is not hard. In those moments like that man, that's when you say 'listen, basketball is great, but your family, your health, these are the things that are most important. And I'm so glad that this young man [Caris Levert] got an opportunity to come back and play the game he loves because I had a teammate that did not get an opportunity to finish his career because of something, not like this, but as similar in the act. So, I'm just happy for him and hopefully he has a long, healthy career because the boy can go. If he gets you going right, he's going to tear you up, because he used to tear me up going right. But, I'm just happy for him."""

"There is no indication that the GM preferred Philly's offer over what we got from Brooklyn. Simmons (who wouldn't re-sign in Houston) and a couple protected swaps vs 7 or 8 unprotected pics, caris levert, jarrett allen and taurean prince. Pretty easy call in my opinion"
Jarret Allen + Caris Levert is a better duo than we couldve given up without including Simmons tbh  Houston kinda butchered that part of the trade so they didnt actually end up in Houston tho
"add buddy heild, dejountey murry, and caris levert"
"I still don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt test him 2-3 times and say he is good to go. NBA has such stupid rules. For example, the players can be maskless on the court but the minute they sit down (even when there were no fans), they have to wear a mask? How does that make any sense. Pacers got screwed by this protocol with caris levert and I just don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt test someone a few times so they are good to go"
"I'll just say this: Caris Levert, Jarret Allen, Tareaun Prince, or Rodions Kurucs surely would have hit at least one shot in the first half for less than 40 million... and they'd still have a shot a drafting someone before my unborn kid graduates high school."
"These Nets role players suck so much, wow. I'm sure Nets fans miss Jarett Allen and Caris LeVert right now."
Bruh it‚Äôs a miracle the Nets were winning without Harden who‚Äôs arguably their most important (not best before you come at me) player due to his playmaking  Taking away Kyrie too is just plain unfair. He doesn‚Äôt even have Caris LeVert or Jarrett Allen to lean on anymore
we were a Caris Levert midrange jumper away from finding out
If he still had Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen I would agree with you but not with this roster
"If you think a team with KD, Caris LeVert, and Jarrett Allen alone would defeat the Bucks I have a number of bridges to sell you"
Some of these depth arguments wrt the Harden trade are pretty bad.  Caris LeVert isn't some difference maker in a situation like this.  Allen plays a position where frankly they don't really need any more depth than they have.
The ‚Äúsolid assets‚Äù amounted to two late 1sts *if that* (Jarett Allen and Caris Levert)  Besides they don‚Äôt need to trade for a top 5 player like Harden necessarily.
"Exactly, I'm a life long Nets fan since 2004. I've been dying for a meaningful playoff run, but this ain't it. Technically my team are title favorites/contenders, but they're not my team; it's just a core of mercenary superstars that just happened to pick my team. This team is not the Nets, it's just the hollow shell that Kyrie, KD, and Harden chose to play under. Whenever I express this I get downvoted and told that I'll forget about all that once they win, but that's just not true. When operating under these circumstances there is no team culture or team identity, there is literally nothing but the name that identifies the team as the Brooklyn Nets. Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Nenad Krstic, Brook Lopez, Caris Levert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen, and others in the same vein meant something to the identity of the Nets. They may not have all joined the team in the same way, but they put roots down in the organization and tried to build something meaningful. A key component of the joy of winning a championship as a fan is building up to the point where your team can win it all. If the Nets win it all, I won't look at them and say the Nets finally won a title, I'll just say Kyrie, KD, and Harden won a title and that won't mean shit to me."
"Caris Levert? Duncan Robinson? Both completely unheralded guys coming out of high school who Beilein developed and are quality NBA starters today. Jordan Poole is also an up and comer who you‚Äôve conveniently ignored.  Burke was a guy who was not very highly recruited and won the Wooden award under Beilein‚Äôs tutelage. Beilein was a fantastic identifier and developer of talent, moreso than Fisher.   I don‚Äôt really understand how you can try to discredit Beilein‚Äôs ability to develop NBA talent when you can‚Äôt even remember the three most successful NBA guys he coached at Michigan. Regardless, his job wasn‚Äôt to develop NBA talent anyways. His job was to win basketball games at Michigan."
"Even if you don‚Äôt like Simmons, what‚Äôs to have stopped the Rockets from trading Simmons for capital like they did Caris LeVert? Simmons is a way more lucrative asset.   And the Nets will drafting from the bottom of the first round for a long time"
"Well when you‚Äôre the GM you take on the the risk and reward when you sign a player. I don‚Äôt think the problem is Ainge being complacent or looking at offers to move him. I think that Ainge failed to communicate with either Kemba or his agent that a trade was a possibility and that he would actively look at offers. When Sean Marks traded Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince he made it clear to each of those guys that a trade was possible so they wouldn‚Äôt be blindsided when they saw their names in rumors or when ultimately they had to move their entire lives and families to another city. Ainge isn‚Äôt a bad person for that."
"I‚Äôll go contract-by-contract and defend them:  * Brogdon: I can see taking Bogi, they‚Äôre about equal in contract and ability. But Brogdon can match Bogi‚Äôs scoring and defense while also being a better passer. * Turner is a DPOY caliber player and one of the league‚Äôs best shot blockers, he single-handedly carried the Pacers defense this year. Definitely taking him over Bogi. * Capela is also a phenomenal defender, but he‚Äôs also one of the league‚Äôs top rebounders and a menace in the PNR. For me, he‚Äôs easily a top ten C in the league, and this isn‚Äôt even close. * Rose is a 6MOTY caliber guy who massively helped the Knicks go on their run to the four seed. If he and Bogi were on the same contracts, I‚Äôd take Bogi, but $7m a year for what Rose has done is phenomenal. Rose could easily get a $15m-$20m contract in the open market IMO. * Noel should be All-Defense first team. He‚Äôs a really, really good defender. For $5m a year (barely more than the VetMin), that‚Äôs hard to beat. * I could see taking Bogi over Monte Morris because of the talent gap, but $9m a year is just so cheap for a starting-level PG. I could see this one coming down to team need. * O‚ÄôNeal is one of the league‚Äôs best 3 and D guys and a key role player for the Jazz. I could see him being worth Joe Harris money and getting a contract in the $16m-$18m a year range. * Kleber is a good defender, but I can see taking Bogi over him.  * DFS‚Äôs shot seems to come and go, but he‚Äôs a solid defender, decent rebounder, and $4m a year is a pittance. * Ibaka is a solid all-around, decent shooter, good defender, and has slightly improved every year he‚Äôs been in the league. He was on $16m a year with the Raptors and reportedly turned down an extension in that range to go contend in LA.  For me personally, Bogi‚Äôs $18m a year is about what he‚Äôs worth. His scoring hasn‚Äôt been proven consistent, though he‚Äôs been on fire of late- earlier in the season, people were bashing his contract as being on an overpay. If he can keep up this kind of scoring, then he‚Äôs worth more, but, if you look at the contracts of, Terry Rozier, TJ Warren, Caris Levert, or Terrence Ross, I think $18m a year is about right for a good-shooting/streaky scoring second guy."

[Link](https://newsregister.com/article?articleTitle=james-harden-traded-to-nets-in-blockbuster-deal--1611082481--39138--#:~:text=But%20they%20paid%20a%20massive,forward%20Taurean%20Prince%20to%20Cleveland.)  &gt;But they paid a massive price to do it. The Nets sent Caris LeVert and Rodions Kurucs to Houston, along with 2022, 2024 and 2026 first-round picks and the right to swap first-round picks in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.  IIRC you can trade picks up to like 6-7 years out.  So Lakers would be able to trade up til 2027, maybe 2028 by next window, dunno exact details."
"The narrative has shifted dramatically. We went from ""Nets have no defense, Bucks in 6"" to ""they're a super team even without Harden""  Even though currently this is the same team that started the season 9-8 plus a Blake who has one good game every 4-5 and minus Jarrett Allen/Caris Levert, apparently Joe Harris is now the factor that really makes them a super team."
"I think the more impressive think is having none of their own draft picks and building al these assets. Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddle were on their ways out of the league before Marks found them. He also drafted caris levert, jarret Allen who are both now borderline all stars. Now he found Mike James who was in Russia. Lots of credits to him for finding the hidden gems and Kenny Atkinson for developing them. The top 3 players could have joined any team they wanted to and picked the Nets who have been a joke for about a good decade"
"Bucks could have had 4 picks, 4 swaps, Caris Levert, and Jarrett Allen smh"
CARIS LEVERT WOULD NEVER
Literally no one said this. Your GM is a dumbass because he got fleeced for a top 3 offensive talent of all time and all he got in return was caris fucking levert and then didn't even keep the dude. Enjoy being a poverty franchise for the next ten years
"Nah Maxey looks legit and the Nets only had to give up 2 middle schoolers and Caris Levert. We had the better package thinking that gave us leverage, they said no, it what it is."
"Please tell me where the Lakers are going to magically get 3 firsts, 4 swaps, and a Caris LeVert level young player from"
"Harden was literally traded for Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, 3 1sts and 4 swaps. Lakers can't do it straight up but in a 3-4 team trade"
"Caris Levert,Jarrett Allen,Taurean Prince,Rodion Kurucs 3 unprotected first round picks and 4 draft swaps"
"&gt; The Nets had assets to trade.   Yeah, Caris LeVert and a bunch of low first-round picks.  *Such* a haul.  &gt; Also I don't think the Lakers can match contracts.  That's the tricky part, but anything they do this offseason is going to depend on getting Schroder agreeing to do a sign and trade to whatever team he goes to."
To think if Caris Levert could hit a midrange we may have had this result last year.
"The people who are touting the front office arent bandwagoners they're people who actually watched it happen, from being the doormat of the league to signing guys like dinwiddie, Joe Harris for free, drafting caris LeVert and jarett allen on low picks, trading for d'lo with basically nothing. There's absolutely no way they would sign with us if we weren't at least a competent team, and that's what the front office was able to do ever since Sean marks came in. The bandwagoners don't know anything about that they're just along for the ride."
"I'm biased, but I'm with you. Management since Sean Marks and Joe Tsai took over has been top notch, even ignoring free agents wanting to play in NYC.  First off, they drafted Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert back-to-back years in the 20s, traded for players like D'lo and Bruce Brown without giving up assets, signed and developed Dinwiddie and Harris when they were almost out of the league. The reason the Nets had enough draft picks to trade for Harden and the Heat didn't was that the Heat had signed a lot of bad contracts and had to dump assets, something the Nets really never had to do (they did this with Crabbe, but that was only when they knew they were getting Kyrie/KD).  Do they have the advantage of being in NYC? Hell yeah they do. But the Nets had a pathetic reputation a few years after moving to Brooklyn. That only changed when management did."
For one Caris LeVert you can have Ricky Rubio!
"Everybody saying NY is a FA attraction, which it's true. But you still gotta be good and respectable ( ex: knicks the past 20 years). Sean Marks inherited a plethora of problems, he really deserves credit in turning this team around. Built a culture and caught the attention of KD/Kyrie. Then with late first rounders, drafted and developed talent in Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen. Then flipped those 2, with a bunch of draft picks, for James Harden. Wouldn't have seen this coming 3 years ago, but then again, anything can happen"
"Sure thing. I‚Äôll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
"the thing is the other teams had to give up the farm for harden, but the nets didn‚Äôt, they gave up jarrett allen and caris levert plus some picks and swaps, the other teams‚Äô rumored deals included young all stars like ben simmons and jaylen brown"
"The only way it helped the team was that the Russian ownership group realized that they couldn‚Äôt skip steps to build a contender. So they ended up hiring the right people for a turnaround to take place.   The trade itself ended up giving the Nets Caris LeVert (KG for Thad Young, Thad Young for a 1st round pic, which ended up being Caris). Then Caris helped towards netting James Harden (which was all circumstance and luck)"
&gt;so did the Nets  We're just pretending Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert aren't good players now?
"Blazers need to try and trade for a younger PG that can handle the load and create and score to give Lillard more room to rest and play off the ball, and CJ just isn't that guy.  They need to find a way to trade for Caris LeVert."
"If not for John Beilein, Caris LeVert would never be in the league today. Duncan Robinson would have never even left D3 and certainly would never be in the league today. Tim Hardaway, Jr. ""might"" not be in the league today, and we have no idea whether or not someone like Jordan Poole would be in the league today.  John Beilein develops talent, period.  Outside of Mitch McGary or *maybe* Glenn Robinson III, nobody he recruited was ever expected to leave early and not spend four years at The University of Michigan.  The entire starting five from the 2013 national title game, in addition to many others, did just that."
Caris LeVert  Seems like he‚Äôs an elite offensive player until you see his numbers
Yeah Boston gave up Caris Levert to get them
"It's just a rough matchup for him.  He can limit a lot of star players but there are a handful of players who he just doesn't have the athleticism to deal with, namely Donovan and for some reason Caris LeVert"
"The Nets gave up LeVert, JA (two players i love personally) and picks for Harden and they undoubtedly got better so I don‚Äôt see how this logic makes sense. Harden is more than enough to make up for the loss of a couple solid role players and it‚Äôs not like Herro and Robinson and significantly better than Caris or JA"
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
Rockets got Oladipo in exchange for Caris LeVert who was in the Brooklyn trade
We got Caris LeVert in a fleece.
"Yea with a good scouting department and being able to identify talent and hidden gems like Joe Harris, who knows what could happen. Obviously nets would have liked Tatum and Brown but through taking on salary dumps for late firsts and trading away any players that had value to contending teams they got Jarrett Allen, Caris levert, and D'lo and built a winning culture that players wanted to join in free agency."
"Ahhh I got it. I definitely still feel that way about harden, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love him but don‚Äôt have that strong connection to him.   Kd and Kyrie are different. KD is sort of this mythical god that hasn‚Äôt felt real since the day we signed him, and Kyrie completely feels like a net and I think has more of a connection with the fans than any Brooklyn player not named Brook Lopez or Caris Levert."
Caris levert will be or is better than 1/2 of those guys
Remember when Caris LeVert was your best player? Man things changes fast lol. That's not a shot at Caris either I freakin love that dude.
"&gt;  Portland, on the other hand, was the hottest team in the bubble up to that point.  Portland wasn't Dame was.  They literally rode the back of Dame to the playoffs. Needed Caris Levert to miss a game tying jumper to beat the bubble Nets (who are not this years nets lol).  Portland literally had the 2nd worst defense in the league."
"Well that's sorta my question here too. If the Mavs have crossed the 85% vaccination threshold then are they allowed to do as they please despite potentially still carrying/contracting COVID or are they still punished for not adhering to the health and safety protocols? Caris LeVert would've had to miss 10-14 days and it was never made clear if he caught COVID or not. Hell, even Durant himself was pulled out 5 minutes into a game for ""contact tracing."""
Because caris levert was suspended last week. And indiana needed him. Double standards
Caris Levert got suspended last week
"Lol  Caris ""Michael Jeffery Jordan"" LeVert"
If I‚Äôm caris levert i would be fucking pissed
nice bucket from Caris LeVert
"Lmao. I would say people violating the same rules should be punished the same way. It doesn‚Äôt matter to the magnitude, this is pretty straightforward. You‚Äôre either following health and safety protocol, or not. Talk to Caris LeVert!"
"Warriors should've never had to play the Grizzlies, Lebron should've been in Covid protocol like Caris LeVert."
"What about the case for the Warriors? The game winner was made by a player that shouldn't have been on the floor. If Lebron doesn't play the Play-in games, which he shouldn't have played in just like Caris LeVert didn't, the Lakers are not in the playoffs and the Warriors are the 7th seed.   The play in tournament is scorched earth now, it wasn't a fair tournament, the NBA cheated for ratings. 0% chance they didn't know Lebron was at that event."
Legit asking is this the same as Caris LeVert or did he do something worse lol
Pacers had to play 2 games without Caris LeVert for the play-in. The Warriors should be placed in the 7 seed with the Lakers missing the playoffs.
&gt;Of course LBJ gets preferential treatment over Chris LeVert lmaoooo  LeBron might even get preferential treatment over Caris LeVert.
"&gt;Indiana gives up its second rounder to Brooklyn as a result of their loss to Washington. The pick had been acquired (but protected) in Marks first trade, the 2016 Draft Night deal that brought Caris LeVert to Brooklyn for Thaddeus Young. Under terms of the deal, if the Pacers fell out of the playoffs in any year from 2017 through 2022, the pick would convey to the Nets. The protection would have ended in 2023.  &gt;So, the Nets will now have their own first rounder, the 27th pick, as well as three seconds: the Pacers at No. 44, the Hawks at No. 49 and the Suns at No. 59. The latter two were acquired in salary dumps, Atlanta‚Äôs as part of the Allen Crabbe trade in June 2019 and Phoenix‚Äôs as part of the trade that brought Jared Dudley to Brooklyn in 2018."
"Ah yes, NBA Superstar Caris LeVert who has been competing for the title of best player in the league against the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard."
"I mean you can handwave it all away because of KD, Kyrie and Harden but the Nets absolutely made some great moves in the past few seasons. D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen just off the top of my head are/were awesome players for them and helped get them to where they are today."
caris levert?
No. Caris Levert had to sit out the play in because of health and safety protocols. The Rockets had half their team out bc they went to a club. Lebron should be treated the same way
"No Caris Levert and Sabonis hasn‚Äôt scored that much and they‚Äôre up 29, maybe Indy was the real dark horse of the East"
"well the pacers are missing tj warren, myles turner, jeremy lamb, and caris levert. Theres no sugarcoating it we just suck and we choked hard."
without Myles Turner and Caris LeVert though? definitely a shot at winning
"Caris LeVert, out for the season lol"
"Indiana may be without Brogdon, Sumner, and Aaron Holiday--three strong guards with different skillsets. If they do play, they may be rusty with the time off. Charlotte will be without a Martin, but Jaden McDaniels is a solid defensive wing who won't be asked to do much more than contest shots and rebound.   Without Myles Turner, the Indiana defense is absolute dog doo-doo. This game will be close. Sabonis is too much for PJ Washington, and if PJ isn't making Sabonis work on the defensive end, Sabonis could be in for a big game. The Hornets enter this game on a losing slide, but they've been playing teams better than the Pacers. I expect the Hornets to win this game. If they don't, Caris LeVert or Sabonis shoot over 60% and Charlotte turns the ball over too much."
"Can we all just sit back for a moment and talk about how Caris LeVert lex the Nets twice in scoring, was traded, diagnosed and recovered from cancer, and then led the Indians Pacers in scoring 13 times? That was all in one season? Sheeeesh"

"Surprises for me were Josh Jackson, Malik Beasley, and Caris Levert (filling in his role so quickly in IND)."
"Obviously there was a lot of luck involved getting their stars, but let's not forget the 18-19 season where they were 6th in the East with All-Star D'Angelo Russell and supplemented by dudes they drafted late like Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert, or traded for like Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.  Yes the FO massively fucked up the Celtics trade, but it's not like they've been totally sitting on their ass since"

Pacers with the all time fleece once again     Gave up Paul George and got 2 all stars in Oladipo and Sabonis.     Gave up Oladipo in a borderline allstar in Caris Levert
"You're right , at least you ended up with Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen. It's better than nothing"
"Houston would still have got all the picks from the Nets but it's crazy how they didn't add Nic Claxton, Jarrett Allen or Caris LeVert. All three have all-star potential. LeVert's on a great value contract.  The Houston GM will probably be fired by the time the unprotected picks from the Nets come into play. But for whoever is GM for the Rockets when those picks convey it'll be a bonus."
"Agreed. Might've misinterpreted your point a bit.      I'm a Nets fan, and Caris Levert ironically went through the mirror opposite of Dipo when Caris signed his contract.     Many thought his contract was somewhat low balled and surprised he didn't fight for more. The whole process went quickly and his agent literally immediately quit being an agent all together upon the signing."
"&gt;inherently more fragile  no, they just happened to be injured  are you forgetting caris levert was out after getting a tumor removed?  so basically harden/blake vs caris/jarrett  and on top of that kyrie out in a freak incident  so that‚Äôs another third of the salary cap the minimum that‚Äôs out even if you never traded for JH"
It really depends on the situation though.   Nets were in a similar situation during the tenure of Brook Lopez.   Dude was making Max $ when he wasn‚Äôt really worth it just because of the team history and the fact that Brooklyn wasn‚Äôt attracting Free Agents before the Sean Marks rebuilt recently.   Back in like 2015 after the Nets imploded w/ Billy King and D.Will era they gave Lopez a 3yr/$60m Max Deal because they were over the cap and had to give Boston all their picks. So it was either sign him or lose him with no real option to replace the production.   Think at the same time Thad Young got a 4yr/$50m deal for the same reason.    This was also right before the massive 2016 cap spike so that $20m that Lopez got was big money at the time.   Luckily after the cap spike it didn‚Äôt look as bad and Sean Marks flipped Thad Young for Caris LeVert and Brook Lopez for D‚ÄôLo and Mozgov which helped turn the tide and eventually help Brooklyn to sign Kyrie and KD.
"They had shitloads of draft picks, the Lakers do not. The only picks the Lakers have are the 22nd pick in this year's draft and the 2027 pick. That's it. Brooklyn traded three 1st round picks and 4 pick swaps for Harden along with Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Rodions Kurucs."
"&gt; Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Josh Richardson, Caris LeVert, Lonzo Ball  That team would be damn good as a player controlled 2k team."
I hear you but that‚Äôs not accurate. The Harden trade also included Caris Levert (Houston was just to idiotic to hold onto him). There‚Äôs no one in what you proposed above even approaching Levert.   But I agree with you the knicks can‚Äôt trade everything for him just to finish 5th in the east.
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"I think he‚Äôs talking more about the D‚ÄôLo version of the Nets vs signing KD and Kyrie as Free Agents.   Sean Marks creating a Playoff team in Brooklyn is what lured Free Agents.    Even if the Nets didn‚Äôt get Kyrie and Durant I fully believe that the Nets would still be in that 5-8 seed range even without the Play In stuff they added.   Sean Marks flipped Thad Young to the Pacers for a 1st that became Caris LeVert and Pacers owe Nets their 2nd round pick  this year as part of it.   Traded Bojan Bogdanovic to the Wizards at the deadline for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen. Had to take on Andrew Nicholson‚Äôs $ that was later traded for Allen Crabbe.   Traded away Brook Lopez to the Lakers and got back D‚ÄôLo for taking on Mozgov‚Äôs terrible contract.    Even though Marks did make a boneheaded move in taking on Allen Crabbe‚Äôs contract without getting ‚ÄúDraft Capital‚Äù when Portland didn‚Äôt want to pay him anymore. He was still able to dump Andrew Nicholson‚Äôs contract to help mitigate the $ since Crabbe was a solid player for the Nets before his knee gave out. Just overpaid because of the massive 2016 Cap bump.   Sean Marks with no control over Brooklyns picks created the Nets core of D‚ÄôLo, LeVert, and Allen out of Thad Young, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Brook Lopez. That‚Äôs a pretty solid return considering Wizards let Bojan walk after a few months, Lakers let Lopez walk to chase ‚ÄúStars‚Äù, and Thad Young left Indiana for Chicago.   Not to mention hitting on Dinwiddie and Harris who were in the scrap heap."
"No you can't. The best player included in the AD trade was Brandon Ingram. Best player included in the Harden trade was Caris Levert. Best player included in the PG trade was SGA. When you trade a star player, you're mostly getting picks back plus one or two good but not great young players."

"Brook is one of the few guys that they actually drafted too.   The majority of notable players in Nets franchise history were either traded to the team (Dr. J, Kidd, VC, Petrovic) or signed there as a FA like their present day  crop of stars.  Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson are kind of what ifs stories. So are their 80s Teams with Michael Ray Richardson &amp; Buck Williams where they scared half the league to death.   They traded Kenyon Martin &amp; Caris LeVert right as they were hitting their stride. And I guarantee that K-Mart's career would have been different if he stuck with Kidd. He admitted that too.  I am happy that Brook is finally getting a chance to play for a winner. It shows that good things do come to those who wait."
Would he be their best player? Caris Levert is damn good by next year we may be talking about him as the best player on that team over Sabonis
"Wouldn‚Äôt the Nets have Jarrett Allen in this case? I feel like a healthy team of Kyrie, Caris Levert, Joe Harris, KD, and Jarrett Allen (or put Bruce brown as PG and let Levert play 6th man) would be able to take it, even have a guy like Jeff Green who wouldn‚Äôt have to play as major of a role on defense if Allen was there.  Dunno, i guess i might still take the Cavs in that series but it‚Äôs a little closer than i thought."
"&gt; Not sure I‚Äôve ever seen anything quite like it.  Well, not as fast, but Caris Levert coming back after a couple months when his foot was bent the wrong way counts, I think.  Looked awful and everyone first thought it was Paul George/Nurkic type of situation, and it winds up ""just"" being a dislocation with minimal damage."
What if the Nets did not trade for Harden and kept Caris Levert. . .
Caris Levert/Sabonis + the 13th pick in this draft for Ben Simmons if I was Pritchard
He can be a 50/40/90 guy when he‚Äôs not asked to be the primary ball handler.   I think Caris + Brogdon could work as long as Carlisle is smart enough to realize LeVert is the #1. Which I think he is.   That being said I would definitely rather move Brogdon before the season starts than run it all back.
"Good thing we have Caris LeVert and TJ ‚ÄúBubble God‚Äù Warren to carry the offense then?  Whatever our 2022 roster looks like, Caris should be the primary ball handler anyway."
DLo hasn‚Äôt done shit in the Playoffs either.  His one series vs the 76ers was super underwhelming  Caris LeVert was by far the nets best player that post season
"76ers could have given just as many draft picks with better young players like Thybulle and Simmons. They could have flipped Simmons and Thybulle for more picks too. All-defense players have value even if they don't want to shoot the ball.   Even if they thought that Nets had a better deal, you can get more from Jarett Allen than just a single FRP. They also opted not to take Caris LeVert, opting to get Oladipo in the trade instead while sending a 2nd rounder to Pacers. And what did they get back for Oladipo? Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and a pick swap?   Just take a page from Sam Presti on how to get picks from teams."
As far as I'm concerned we are one Caris Levert jumpshot away from the Suns being on the verge of repeating
"Brook Lopez, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen for the Nets. None of them left on their own though so no reason at all not to like them. They were all traded."
"I mean other than the Harden trade (which is obviously a unique situation) Marks has never really ""fleeced"" anyone in a trade. I mean for the first few years of being a GM he was never really in position to anyway but overall, I think the majority of his trades have been mutually beneficial.  -Trading Thaddeus Young for the pick that became Caris LeVert. He traded a good starter with 3 years left on a very good value contract for a 20th overall pick. Far from a fleecing, if anything its him who got the low end of the bargain (you'd expect at least some random young guy on the roster who doesnt get many minutes to be thrown in for the sake of it but that didnt happen).  -Trading Bogdanovic for Nicholson+the pick that becomes Allen. Bogdanovic was an expiring so getting a 1st for him was great (even better that we got Allen out of it) but we still had to take on Nicholson's contract (dude was playing in China only a few months later with 3 years left on his contract) and its still only a late 1st for a very good starter. Looks worse with Bogdan not staying but they were still 1 game away from the ECF which is the farthest they'd been in nearly 40 years.   -DLo. Sure in hindsight getting DLo for the 27th pick+Lopez seems like a fleece but DLo's value was at his lowest then and the Nets had to take on probably the worst contract in the league to get him. And  we know with hindsight that the pick was used for Kuzma (who for all we clown him for, getting him at 27 is amazing value) and the cap space was used for LeBron.  -Carroll trade. Got a 1st (used on Musa who was traded for Brown) and 2nd (Kurucs who was a throw-in in the Harden trade) to take on Carroll's contract. Sure he was good for us once he got here but again, his value was at an all-time low when we got him and the picks were not great. The Raps got the cap space needed to finish off their championship roster so far from a fleece there.  -Crabbe. Traded Crabbe+2 1sts for Prince and the cap space needed to get KD+Kyrie.   Not really surprising Marks isnt getting the same treatment. Yea the poison pill contracts were pretty crazy but I think most teams acknowledge that they were an act of desperation to try and bring more talent in when he had limited resources and that screwing over the other team was the side effect not the original intention."
"I had Jerami Grant there before, but took him out when because I already had Malcolm Brogdon and Lonzo.   Dragic is a fine point guard imo unless he fell off a cliff and I didn‚Äôt notice.  Caris Levert is a great offensive player and is solid on defense.  Bobby portis was just there for spacing and defense, but I‚Äôd probably have Jerami Grant there instead.   Turner is there for his elite rim protection that would allow the rest of the team to be aggressive on defense. After watching how bad the Pacers were without him, it made me realize how much he elevates a defense.   I think it would make the playoffs, but I understand if you think it couldn‚Äôt. I disagree that BI couldn‚Äôt be the best player on a playoff team though."
"If your talking about Malcolm Bronson and Lonzo, replace them with Goran Dragic and Caris Levert"
"Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. The NBA is a little weird with draft picks and unless you get a top pick in a good draft class, their value is very small. Compare that to the NFL, who value top 15 picks like gold and you can many times find a franchise changing player. The NBA is just strange that way, and many times, you need 2-3 firsts as well as a decent player or two to trade for a all star.   Look at the Harden trade, for example. The Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, Rodions Kurucs as well as three unprotected 1st rounders (2022,  2024, 2026) and four first-round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027). With two young promising players they still had to just throw in 4 firsts and 4 swaps to get Harden. If the Nets team goes bust any time soon (which, can happen with Kyrie.. just sayin), they are fucked. Even if they tank down to the bottom of the league, they either gave their pick away, or another team will swap their pick away.  I'd imagine the same kind of firepower in a trade for Dame will be needed, likely with a 4 team trade as well, so even with a young a promising Anthony Edwards, I would expect a TON of picks to be going Portland's way as well as at least another decent starter."
"Nets traded Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, three 1st round picks and four 1st round pick swaps. If we had something comparable to offer I‚Äôd be way more optimistic about landing a big fish this summer. But we are currently strapped for assets, particularly 1st round picks.  And look, I‚Äôd love nothing more than to be totally wrong here lol."
No offense but why would Dame want to go to Indiana to play with Myles Turner and Caris Levert?
"You‚Äôre forgetting Caris LeVert. And I have faith that Turner can take a leap forward this year without having to share the ball with Sabonis, a superior offensive player. Additionally, Carlisle seems to really like Turner. This team is clearly better than the Blazers assuming they can stay relatively healthy."
Caris LeVert All-Star and MIP incoming.
"So the only season Dinwidde actually played on a good team the was tearing it up from the 3 point line for about 4 [months](https://www.bball-index.com/spencer-dinwiddie-is-an-absolute-bargain/) he did come back down by the end of the season but he immediately picked up the slack in the only playoff series hes ever played in, he shot 38% from 3 on nearly 5 attempts a game vs an elite defensive team in Philly   So that does indicate 3 point ability   Again this is the only season he ever played on a good team, and he was likely getting better opportunities and shot quality due to the emergence of Dlo and Caris Levert.   Swap that with Lebron and AD   Anyways i was curious about his shot quality data and i tweeted cranjis( analytics guy) asking if he can give it to me from bballindex. Just waiting on a response"
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it‚Äôs not the league‚Äôs fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here‚Äôs a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there‚Äôs a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
Caris LeVert
had a dude on here trying to tell me how everyone in America has the same level of health care that 26 year old Caris LeVert had when his MRI showed him he had early stage cancer.    He said we are all just too lazy to use it.
"&gt; get this level of screening for cancer or tumors motherfucker  dude... do you even know Caris Lavert's story? He didn't have advanced cancer screenings.. he found it on an MRI as part of a sports physical.    There is nothing advanced about the level of care Lavert had when they found the tumor. An MRI is a relatively standard procedure, and a sports physical is too.  Nobody is restricted from getting those two things.  &gt;Not a single doctor in any low tier to mid tier insurance plan would authorize an MRI for a physical  depends on the situation. You're acting like Lavert got some sort of advanced procedure, but he got something that is perfectly accessible to people that might get if their situation depends on it.  This is all a ridiculous strawman though because your initial argument (before you edited it) was that our country doesn't have much coverage for preventive medicine.  However, I showed you it's legally required to have a pretty comprehensive list of preventive screenings, etc.  Now of course there are outliers, and the Levert situation is an outlier that we are chasing down.  But the overall point of mine stands, that there is plenty of preventive coverage in America, but people tend to just not use their available benefits.  For a multitude of reasons.  That's why the edit was a snake move. Completely changed the conversation."
Damn how y‚Äôall go from malcom brogdon and tj warren to malcom brogdon and caris levert. That‚Äôs highway robbery
"Sure, if you ignore Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie. Asume the Harden trade is never even made and Brooklyn beats the Bucks if they have Allen and LeVert, even if Dinwiddie and Kyrie are hurt. And would for better or worse be favored over Atlanta. But the trade did happen, and KD Kyrie and Harden are likely going to be title favorites for years to come"
"Sorry Rockets for clowning you for trading 1x MVP James Harden for ~~Caris Levert,~~ no wait ~~Victor Oladipo~~, Kelly Olynyk and some late first round picks."
"Does he still have Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen or do we mean literally *these* nets?   Lebron, Harris, Green, Griffin, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Mike James, and Deandre Jordan doesn't seem like it could possibly make the finals."
"It was 4 first round picks (2022, 2024 (2), 2026) and 4 first round pick swaps with the nets in 2021, 2023, 2025, and 2027. Not exactly 8 picks as the pick swaps will probably be worthless for 2021 and 2023 but a good haul for Harden nonetheless. I still wish the Rockets kept Caris Levert instead of dishing him out for Oladipo(???)"
"when has anyone ever said that nate was the only problem lol. just because it was time to move on from nate doesn't mean he was the only problem  we literally had the oladipo problem too, which the whole fanbase was very very aware of, and when we solved that by trading for an excellent player in Caris LeVert, he literally had cancer. this season was never going to be a good one for us after that.   next season will be interesting for us and i'm looking forward to it tho"
"a) the players all year were begging for more modern offence. nate was saying no.   b) we didn't make the playoffs this year because of injuries. TJ Warren played 4 games. we were playing excellent modern offensive basketball basketball at the start of the year before we traded Victor Oladipo for Caris LeVert, who missed plenty of games because he literally had cancer. we'll be back in the playoffs next year."
Jeff Green and Mike James and Spencer Dinwiddie. Jarret Allen and Caris Levert were also super likeable during their nets stints.
The Jazz were rewarded? The Nets built quite a bit of that team organically. They developed very good assets in players like Jarrett Allen &amp; Caris LeVert and were able to leverage that into a highly-coveted asset. It's not like they got Harden for free...
"I wonder what Caris LeVert, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen, and all the other Nets who were traded away for this super team are thinking now."
"&gt;then they still got an all-star, a young role player, who's now one of their better players, and a pick  I just disagree  DeRozan hasn't been an all star since he arrived with the Spurs. Harden also only has one year left on his contract, he has a PO after that  Compare that to the return the Rockets got for Harden, which is the rights to 8 draft picks + Caris Levert. While the Spurs have nothing from that trade that will be part of their next good/great team except maybe Poetl  &gt;SEVERELY disagree with this. Firstly, they also got Dunn who was seen as a productive high potential guy, but Lavine definitely had a lot of value. No one thought he'd be THIS good, but he had value  I think you're overrating the value that Lavine had at the time. People at the time thought this was a terrible return, it was just what the market offered during this period of time  &gt;So yeah they wanted to tank, but Simmons wouldn't have ruined that. Just would've brought them from best odds at the #1 pick to maybe 6th or 7th, which is still over 30% chance at a top 4 pick  So they would reduce their chances, not by that much as you said, but still by some and in a historic draft. While still not raising them far enough to be actually competitive"
Don't forget Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert.  The Rockets probably left the best deal on the table because they didn't want to trade with Morey.
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It‚Äôs one of the better drafts we‚Äôve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"You seriously think in 2-4 years Malcolm Brogdon, DeJounte Murray, and Caris LeVert could be considered better than Ben Simmons? This is ridiculous, sorry.  People are criticizing Ben Simmons bc he can't be the second best guy on a finals team. A Sabonis, Brogdon, and LeVert core couldn't even make the playoffs."
"Stay the course for a season.  Run it back.  Why not?  Your core is, what?  25, 25, 28, and 24 years old?  With a good balanced collection of vets around them.  You didnt get to see Caris LeVert fully last year.  Let's see what they can do.  Granted, Sabonis and Turner were a little questionable of a combo last year.  Both good on their own, but sharing the floor was a little tough.  Maybe with a little more spacing it will be better?  You have time to find out if they're going to make some noise before you have to panic."
"&gt;On Nov. 14‚Äîtwo months before the trade was officially announced‚Äîearly talks between Houston and Brooklyn included Harden for Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen. The picks weren't finalized at that point, but a verbal agreement was made, according to sources close to Harden and Durant. (A Nets spokesperson denies a verbal agreement was made at that time.) Harden and Durant believed the deal was done and celebrated the occasion together.  &gt;By Nov. 17, news of the potential deal had spread across the league. Harden and Durant thought it would be finalized on Nov. 22, when trades could officially be announced. But Rockets management changed its tune. Harden, Durant and the Nets had underestimated the Rockets' capacity to posture for a better deal.  &gt;""Houston was being difficult,"" a front-office executive familiar with the Rockets' negotiating tactics at the time told Bleacher Report.  Ah yes I'm sure Harden and KD celebrated the trade based off of nothing. Fuck outta here"
"""How much do you have to gameplan against them"" ""How much do they stress your defense by how they operate"" are getting at the same things which is what he means and which matter alot.  It's a big part of why you get so many players where the idea of the player exceeds the actual reality of them. Lonzo Ball/Aaron Gordon/Caris LeVert syndrome. Sound good on paper but you just dont ever feel their presence and they do nothing that actually stresses an opponent or makes you really account for them."
"I could have phrased that better. My main point is that neither of them are all that special as scorers relative to the league. FVV is a better scorer than Smart but he isn‚Äôt a good scorer. By saying it‚Äôs not so large a gap, I mean that FVV isn‚Äôt far enough ahead of Smart as a scorer for his scoring to move the needle much.  If FVV had slightly below average efficiency, it would be one thing. But it‚Äôs bad enough, and has historically been bad enough except for brief periods of time, that his value as a volume scorer is pretty low because there are tons of players on at least as high volume who are actually efficient. When a player has such low efficiency, you want other players to be taking those shots and the player in question to bring value in other ways.  FVV‚Äôs never had a season with above league average ts%, not even the years he averaged 2.9, 8.6, and 11 ppg. He averaged 19.6 ppg this year. Of 53 players who averaged at least 19 ppg last year, only Westbrook, Anthony Edwards, John Wall, and Caris LeVert were as inefficient. So if a team is looking for a scorer, there‚Äôs at least 49 players out there who would be a better fit for the role and way more than that if you lower the ppg requirement just a point or 2."

"I will never forgive the Celtics doctors that misdiagnosed his injury. Shows how whacky and self serving people in that line of work can be. Picking a good physician can be hard to do.  This man is 31-32 years old and walking around with an artificial hip and no job because some doctor didn't want to tell him how severe his injury was. Case in point that whole team was fired while the Celtics playoff run was still going.  He should have had a huge contract from some team after the way he played. Props to the Lakers and their team for saving his long term health. Only thing close to this Caris LeVert finding out that he had cancer after getting traded to the Pacers. These guys take physicals before the season, how the hell do you miss that of all things?"
"Mate, they took Stanley Johnson ahead of Devin Booker, Henry Ellenson ahead of Caris LeVert and Pascal Siakam and Luke Kennard ahead of Mitchell and Adebayo.   That's three straight where they made picks that were obviously the wrong decision in a row. That's why the problem is scouting."

I was picking between them and the Pacers but i really like Caris Levert.
Brooklyn got Harden for Caris LeVert and Jarett Allen. I already puked
What about 4 picks and 3 swaps?  I‚Äôm being facetious but we heard this exact same discussion around how Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen were just role players and thus not enough for a star like Harden and yet that‚Äôs exactly what ended up happening
"The late firsts will really turn that franchise around  What they missed was getting a cornerstone young player back. To make it worse, out of a deal that had Jarret Allen / Caris Levert, they decided on Oladipo lol"
Drummond was good in 2016 and 2018. Dont let revisionist history or hate blind you from that.  That being said...  D'Angelo Russell was never really that good and gets overhyped due to that 1 underserved All Star selection which he basically got on behalf of the entire Nets and would have gone to Caris LeVert had he not got injured.
PRIMO IS THAT GUY I WILL GO DOWN SWINGING ON THIS. I compared him to Caris levert and he‚Äôs come into summer league extremely comfortable
Caris Levert and Ja Morant
1. Ingram 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Jamal Murray 4. Ben Simmons 5. Pascal Siakam 6. Dejounte Murray 7. Sabonis 8. Caris Levert 9. Buddy Hield
Caris LeVert plays for the spurs??
"Of course your ignoring the fact TJ Warren missed the whole year, Caris missed tons, Malcom and Myles missed tons.  Myles and Levert both missed the play in as well.  Caris averaged 25/5/5 for 15 games prior just before landing in covid protocol.   Making blanket statements without context is lazy. But go ahead."
"I don‚Äôt know how that draft compares to other drafts, but it looks pretty good to me. Simmons, Ingram, Brown, Murray, Sabonis, Caris Levert, Siakam, Brogdon and Dejountae Murray. Obviously not as good as the Luka and Trae draft but compared to other drafts from recent memory, it looks pretty damn good"
"Lakers traded Lonzo, Ingram, Hart and a lotta picks for AD. Nets traded Jarrett Allen, Caris Levert and a lotta picks for Harden. Sounds like they did the same thing the Celtics did"
"really?  I think it is quite good for his level of production  he's more productive than tim hardaway jr who just got signed for about the same amount of money but this one is more team-friendly with a 4th year team option  don't know why boston didn't re-sign him since a deal like this can be packaged as part of a big deal for a superstar.   nets only had to give up caris levert and jarrett allen + picks and they got harden.  even if he just stays at the level he's been at the last few years this is a very moveable contract that makes it less likely we would have to include RJ barrett as part of a big package for a superstar  I see boston fans didn't like his defense but hey thibs seems to get the best out of everyone on that end so I'm not really sweating it, our guys played great defense last year and almost all of them are coming back"
Actual answer: trading Caris Levert for Oladipo.
I want this to happen so the Rockets Front Office looks even dumber for passing on Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert
1. Yea wolves make it into at least the play in 2. Tatum scoring champ (mvp?) 3. Knicks miss playoffs 4. Caris levert is an all star 5. Lakers run through everyone again when healthy
It was Caris LeVert you casual
"I love Caris LeVert, ALMOST as much as his cousin Eddie LeVert, singer in the O'Jays"
Josh Primo will be Caris Levert level of impact   Tre Mann will be an all star level player    Bones Hyland is going to be at least a 15 ppg scorer in the league. I genuinely think you take him top 20 and wouldn‚Äôt be mad at anyone in the back half of the lotto   Jeremiah Robinson Earl will slip and be such an immediate impact people will be like how could we let another villanova guy slip.   I agree with your Santi Aldama pick but I‚Äôm going to one up it and say Sandro Mamukelishvili is going to be an impact offensive player off the bench immediately. The guy is an NBA player hands down. He‚Äôs Bobby Portis with slightly more playmaking flare
https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/07/08/why-ben-simmons-caris-levert-and-jarrett-allen-werent-fits-in-houston/
caris levert is 27 next month. is he really part of a young core?
Houston really chose Avery bradley and Kelly Olynyk who can both walk this offseason over Caris Levert and Jarett Allen lmao dumbass front office
I‚Äôm going to say Caris Levert. He really started getting into a rhythm near late in the year.   Averaged 25/6/5 in his last 15 games. I think he takes a next step for us.   No bias of course.
"I was at the game when Levert, while with the nets, dropped 51 on the Celtics, with like 40 of those points coming in the fourth quarter/overtime. This made me irrationally high on him, but caris levert plus warren coming back could lead to a much improved roster."
"This is still in the ""if"" phase, which it has been since literally the beginning of this past season. Also, the Wiz would be dumb to take any package they doesn't involve Jaylen Brown, which defeats the purpose. I'm still very skeptical this could actually happen even if Beal wanted it.   And before anyone says ""reeee Brooklyn!"", the Celtics don't have anywhere near the package of picks and young upside players that Brooklyn used in that deal. Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen are not Romeo Langford and Robert Williams."
Indiana could make a solid offer based around Caris Levert and Myles Turner. They are proven young players that will fit positions of need. Washington may not be able to go into full tank mode while they still have Westbrook and I'm not sure they'll be able to move his contract so fielding a young team he might be able to carry to the playoffs is a viable option.
"It wasn‚Äôt directly to Houston, but the harden trade involved Jarrett Allen (who is probably getting a hefty offer in RFA, good player) and Caris Levert (I was at the Celtics nets game that he dropped 50, this dude is a baller). For Levert, the pacers had Oladipo (former all star with injury question marks) going to Houston. The picks were obviously the biggest factor, but the nets had to give up two very very very solid starting young players that have more room to develop and grow. It takes a lot to trade for a harden/Lillard type."
There not gonna get as good as an offer because dame isn‚Äôt harden. All I‚Äôm saying is I expect the blazers to hold out for better then caris levert compared to James harden.
Kemba Walker for Terry Rozier?  Victor Oladipo for Caris LeVert?  Kyle Korver for Copy Machine?  PG13 for SGA?
"Some of the better pieces of the trade Houston spun off to other teams for worse assets.  Jarret Allen went for a 2022 bucks first lol.  Caris Levert  + a future 2nd got spun into a broken down Oladipo.  There was a degree of mismanagement down the board there, but on paper the haul wasn't bad before they started trying to have their cake and eat it too."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
Caris Levert
It is quite literally the same group as when they had oladipo instead of Levert. If anything Oladipo at that time was better than the latest we‚Äôve seen of Caris in Brooklyn
"would love more insight on your comment, and those like it:      1) are we sure Morey is the source on these ""hes asking for the moon"" reports and not other teams?      2) if Morey said ""yeah I just want Malcolm Brogdon but would settle for Caris Levert"" does *that* then drive a bidding war? I personally don't think so      3) the Sixers aren't contenders with a role player replacing Ben Simmons. In fact we just saw a playoff series where Ben's decision making effectively made him not a star but a role player, so idk why people want Morey to just seek a non-star and expect success"
"Starters:  steph (superstar)  klay (all-star)  og anunoby  giannis (superstar)  deandre ayton (all-star)  Bench: fred vanvleet, seth curry, caris levert, michael porter jr, aaron gordon, chris boucher, brook lopez   Good combination of offense, defense, play-making, and fit imo"

Who tf puts these together and do they watch/like basketball? Forget Simmons still going #1 over players like Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown where their GMs would hang up if Morey called with a straight swap‚Ä¶‚Ä¶But they have Zubac AND Poeltl going over Caris Levert this with the benefit of hindsight. What a pointless exercise. They zero credibility so it doesn‚Äôt even spark a real debate.
I'd probably go:  1.  Brown  2.  Ingram  3.  Sarongs  4.  Murray  5.  Siakam  6.  Simmons  Overall this draft wasn't really good.  Only decent name left is Caris LeVert.
It's Caris LeVert time.
"And ultimately wound up with Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and nets draft picks which they converted into Victor Oladipo and Cavs 2022 pick and Nets draft picks."
"Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Caris LeVert, Kawhi Leonard and Brook Lopez.  Edit: I didn‚Äôt read the post correct and they‚Äôre not in order"
Literally not true lol caris levert was their best player before kyrie and then even with kyrie they missed the playoffs
"They could have come for the culture, but are you really teeling me you wouldn't trade Jarett Allen, Caris LeVert and Taurean Prince for a chance to sign James Fucking Harden?  Even Jarett Allen said he would trade himself because the chance of trading for a superstar like Harden is so slim.   Now ofc they asked KD &amp; Kyrie their opinion, but what are they supposed to do?  Tell them ""Oh sorry we don't want to play with Harden""?"
"They did they slow rebuild and made the playoffs before getting kyrie and kd, with none of their own first round picks to boot. They turned Dlo from a joke to an all star, and found a ton of great players - caris levert, dinwiddie, joe Harris, etc. Showing that they had a great front office def played a big role in getting the stars to come (see: knicks)  Also the Spurs just made the playoffs for 20 straight years lmfao idk why you feel like you need to trash nets fans for feeling good about their squad. You keep saying you just asking questions but it reads super passive aggressively"
"We traded so much for so little it still pisses me off. Jarrett Allen is a great young piece, Caris LeVert is a great young piece when healthy, going down the list.      At first I was like ""yes, this is how you rebuild.""      Then when it sunk in I was like ""fuckin' Fertita."""
"They at minimum, could have taken Caris Levert instead of Oladipo‚Ä¶"
"Sure, I bet they could do 5-8 years of alternative picks+swaps however the Stiepen rule or whatever works and I guess that makes it, but it also seems so silly for th Wolves, specifically. You're potentially sacrificing a half decade-near decade worth of potential high ranking assets for a player who by all accounts might get you to the second round.  Like I'm not happy with the Simon's, but I gotta imagine it's cheaper/easier to spend on mid priced undervalued assets like TJ Warren, Caris Levert, and Domantas Sabonis, if the goal is to fill seats and make a profit, and if the goal is to compete well, I don't see this doing it either."
"Harden got traded for literally the same package and you cannot tell me that Nets' Picks are as valuable as our since we still kinda suck while the Nets have KD, Kyrie, Harden locked for years to come while we would be bad. And Dejounte Murray is a better player with more potential than Caris LeVert. So basically the Sixers asked for more than what the Nets traded for James Harden. CRAZY"
"Almost every player in that range has had an All Star appearance or looks like a future All Star (i.e. Murray, Fox).  Wiggins is more suited in that 16M-20M range imo, with guys like Jerami Grant, Caris Levert, OG Anunoby, etc."
"Again, look at the harden trade and look at the kyrie trade. Look at the best player(s). How does your proposed offer rank. Which of those guys do you think is better than Caris Levert or Isaiah Thomas?"
Caris LeVert? Really?
"Right, so just as I said, ""defense"", ""shooting"", etc., - are arbitrary terms that are more intended to be unrefutable than to actually make a positive argument.  RJ Barrett is a better defender, but LeVert's lead over Barrett offensively is significantly higher than Barrett's lead defensively. Barrett has little ability to playmake or create his own shot, where LeVert does. RJ Barrett was assisted on 52% of his shots, LeVert was only assisted on 42%.  Which leads directly to shooting. The fact that they have the same true shooting (so I'm not sure why you're calling Barrett a better shooter to begin with) is not great for Barrett considering the degree of difficulty on assisted shots is much lower, so he should make more of them than LeVert makes off his own creation - but he doesn't, outside of spot-up threes, which LeVert doesn't really take.  As for playing in a system, Caris LeVert was the leading scorer on *two* playoff teams, whereas Barrett scored 14 points on 38% shooting and 28% from three in his playoff system debut. Regardless, ""playing in a system"" is more contingent on having a coach with a good system than anything to do with the players. Kevin Garnett never played in a good system the whole time he was on the Wolves, but they never had a functional system, so we don't hold it against him.  As for potential, that's just not really relevant. Evan Mobley has more ""room to grow"" than say Bam Adebayo right now because Bam is approaching his prime and Mobley isn't. That doesn't mean you give Mobley some prima facie credit for improvements he hasn't yet made.  All in all, to believe Barrett is better, you have to have a reason why ""defense"" and ""spot up shooting"" are sufficiently more important categories for a shooting guard than shot creation and playmaking, which are generally the go-to skills at that position. After all, in all the categories you value, Barrett is better than Devin Booker (better defender, higher 3pt%). But I'm skeptical you would use that to argue Barrett&gt;Booker."
"All this thread's comments is telling me is that no one in r/nba has ever heard of Caris LeVert. I like the list in general, though I probs value Bogdan Bkgdanovic over Barrett for the last spot and would put Booker just slightly behind Mitchell and LaVine."
Caris Levert guarding Kyrie too.
"Maybe maybe not. Who had superstar potential in the Harden trade? I mean look, I'm not banking on us getting a star without having to trade RJ. I'm just saying it wouldn't be all that unprecedented considering we just saw a former MVP get traded for a package headlined by Caris Levert.  In any case, I'm pretty pessimistic about the Knicks getting a seriously contending team together in the next 3-5 years. All the stars are locked up and either under 25 or over 30. We don't really have enough to spend ALL our assets on someone AND be in a position to compete. Our best bet is if Beal or Lavine walk in free agency (I wouldn't hold my breath on Beal, Lavine I think is a real possibility IF the Bulls don't want to pay him $200m+). Otherwise, I think the best thing the Knicks could do is just be a perennial playoff, first/second round exit team and wait for this generation of stars to finish out their rookie extensions."
"Ok how about the Harden trade then. Who was the centrepiece for the rockets? Caris Levert?   We can offer picks years down the track well after Dame/Embiid will have declined and the team won't be good so they wouldn't be picks in the 20's. We have basically all of our 1sts.  Yeah I would, but Embiid is also under contract for 6 years, much younger and isn't clearly laying the groundwork to leave his team."
Caris LeVert on August 25 which is today üòÅ
I think KPJ is heavily overrated by Rockets fans tbh. A lot of believe he will be a franchise player but I think hes gonna be like caris levert level player tbh
"Sometimes an injury just is much less severe than it looked when it happened  Back in that fun 2018-2019 Nets season Caris LeVert had a foot injury where his entire foot rolled and stayed in that bent position (shudders). It looked like he was going to be done for at least a year, it seemed like not only an ankle sprain but a broken foot with some ligament damage as well.  Turns out it was miraculously somehow just a dislocated foot and although he missed a bit of the season to help stabilize and heal the foot, he was able to come back before the playoffs!"
"Failed as a first option in Cle? He left before Lebron. He was never the first option.   In Boston the team went 41-19 in 60 games he played his first season and 37-30 in his games the second season. .611 win percentage or ~50 wins per season pace. Averaging 24 points, about 6 assists on very good shooting percentages. He definitely bailed on the team, but it seems like that locker room and front office have issues/secrets that the media just isn‚Äôt writing about.   With the Nets while KD was out rehabbing his first season he averaged 27 points and 6.4 assists while shooting .478/.394/.922 but I guess that superstar Caris Levert was keeping defenses off of him.   I don‚Äôt see evidence of anything other than his injury history that could handicap him. He‚Äôs an all-time efficient scorer at volume. Best handles in the league. Unselfish and smart enough to hand the offense over to Harden who is clearly the better playmaker. Since losing weight his health and athleticism have improved considerably (freak ankle injury aside‚Äîno pun intended)."
"You're complaining about things that TS isn't meant to do.  It's meant to be an improvement on FG% which also contains all of the exact same flaws you're complaining about.  By your same logic, we just shouldn't compare any stats between players who hold different roles. Everything you wrote applies to PPG as well. DeAndre Jordan gets his points through easier shots than Caris Levert. Welp, there's no use talking about them."

"Not the absolute worst, but the start of a long line of really poor trades and signings. The last time the Blazers had a bunch of young talent they‚Ä¶  Blazers traded:  - Will Barton and a first round pick that became Malik Beasley (&amp; Thomas Robinson, victor claver)  To Denver for: -Arron Afflalo (&amp; Alonzo gee), to replace injured Wesley Mathews.   Afflalo goes from shooting 50% mid range to 39% and injures his shoulder in 2 months. Leaves blazers a few months later in free agency to the knicks. Out of the league 3 years later.   Matthews after tearing his Achilles leaves blazers in free agency for dallas. Comes back from injury, goes on to be a 3 and D journeyman.   Comparable first round picks (#19 and lower) in 2016 included: - Malik Beasley (Por first round pick to Den) - Caris levert - pascal siakam - dejounte Murray - Malcolm brogdon  Will Barton (who was close with Damian Lillard) while suffering from off and on injuries, has gone on to sign multiple contracts with Denver, whether he has been in the starting lineup or coming off the bench he has averaged approx. 14/3/5 (fg 43%/3fg 36%) with just under a steal a game in his 8 seasons with Denver. While portland has struggled to find a consistent figure to lead a bench unit or fill the sf position."
I still can't believe that the Cavs got Jarrett Allen because Fertita didn't want to extend him LOL.   Fertita's penny pinching is also the reason we ended up with Caris LeVert instead of Oladipo.
"Bro the Harden return for the rockets was pretty good. If you just look at the nets rockets part of the deal. Control of 7 years worth of picks. Picks that will be conveying when 3 guys are on contracts worth 150 million combined with the youngest being 36 and the oldest being 39 when the last pick conveys. That's practically 3 guaranteed lottery selections unless you think KD or Harden will be MVP calibre until 2025 where they are 37 and 36 respectively.  The Rockets also got Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert. Yes they gave up on them the levert for Oladipo was a pretty egregious deal. But for Jarrett Allen they dumped a 3 10 year deal, got a first which they used to get a first and a swap from Tucker (the first being later so when Middleton and Jrue are 32+) and the swap being from a 2nd to a first. Also the deal with cavs let them get KPJ for nothing because he fell out due to Prince and the cavs traded him to rockets because of good will from the Allen trade.   In terms of the pick haul it is pretty legendary. And it meant the rockets now have like 14 firsts over the next 7 years. Second only to the thunder."
"I hope he can get right, all non nets fans are finally realizing how good Jarrett Allen can be while a healthy Caris Levert has an even higher ceiling."
"I think pretty easy to match a $20m player like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Caris Levert, etc.   Obviously, you'd hope to get a player better than that. But I don't think salary matching is that hard for a mid-tier player."
Beal is a more efficient Caris LeVert.  I don't actually believe this but sounds hot takey.
"I mean the Pacers offered Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert, plus whatever picks and that‚Äôs a decent haul for a guy like Simmons. The pipe dream of getting Damian Lillard is just wishful thinking at this point."
Caris Levert and Jarett Allen are garbage now??? what are y'all smoking in Clevland?
"The Sixers‚Äô goal is to maximize their chances of winning a championship, not to get the best average return for Simmons. Maybe the reality is they need a lopsided trade to get there. If you think the way they get there is by locking into a team with Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert, then you‚Äôre just wrong."
[Lavert + Brogdan](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/15/sixers-not-interested-in-pacers-offer-of-malcolm-brogdon-caris-levert/)  There are several articles about the offer. Google is your friend.
2010 Magic  Jamal Murray (Jameer Nelson)  Caris LeVert (Vince Carter)  Torrey Craig (Matt Barnes)  Nicolas Batum (Rashard Lewis)  Clint Capela (Dwight Howard)
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"Man this made me curious as to just how bad this is. My first shot was to go back to 2014.  They picked Jordan Adams 22nd. Rodney Hood and Clint Capela went in the next three picks. Ouch.   In 2015, the Grizzlies selected Jarell Martin 25th. Two picks later Larry Nance Jr. goes. Wow would this have changed history.   2016 is tough, hard to know who they would've taken at the time but Wade Baldwin at 17 surely was not the answer. Two of the next three picks...Malik Beasley and Caris LeVert.   2017 didn't select anybody.  2018 JJJ! A hit! Sure they could have had Trae Young, but I think they are happy with what they have in Ja and JJJ."
"Ben Simmons will win dpoy, tyler herro will average 23 points a game, caris levert will win most improved by averaging 25 7 and 5"
"Duarte is so fun to watch, also cam Thomas has such a nice jumper. Gives me caris levert vibes"
The Nets prob would've won last year if they had Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen in place of a gimpy Harden
Dont forget Caris Levert
Caris levert. I‚Äôve seen him get better every year of his career with still some upside to his game imo.
"""Philadelphia has been unmoved by the Pacers' ability to offer Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert"" Ability to offer..? Lmao  what is this shit. I'm guessing the Pacers didn't even make this offer. This is just the media trying to bump Ben's price and keep him relevant."
5. Immanuel Quickley  4. Caris Levert  3. Wilt 2. George Gervin 1. Ron Artest
"Caris Levert,Malcolm Brogdon,Myles Turner,Domantis Sabonis,Paul George,Reggie Miller, The Indianapolis colts and 8 first round picks  Is that enough for Morey?"
"Uhh‚Ä¶yea, that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening   https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/264327/76ers-Unmoved-By-Indianas-Ability-To-Offer-Malcolm-Brogdon-Caris-LeVert-For-Ben-Simmons"
This didn't list any options. All it said was they can find and develop young guys as they did with Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert while also acknowledging they traded away every pick they could for Harden.  The only option it listed was plugging Cam Thomas into Kyries minutes lol
Even if this is true wouldn't Philly fans have preferred a deep playoff run rather than whatever's happening right now?  Considering a Caris Levert package to get out of your 24 year old Max player who refuses to play?
caris levert
"&gt; The Portland Trail Blazers‚Äô C.J. McCollum is a better player than Brogdon and LeVert.   Bwahahaha!  They're going to trade Simmons for Brogdon, and throw in Caris because trading Simmons for Brogdon instead of CJ is laughable on its face!      &gt; He just doesn‚Äôt fill the bill at the point guard spot like Brogdon.  Yeah, Jordan just didn't fit the bill like Sam Bowie either."
"""the Pacers are now serious players in the trade game and are talking about a deal that would see Indiana send shooting guard Caris Levert to Philadelphia.""  are you serious bro LOL"
Malcolm Brogdon is a toploftical player in the league and Caris Levert is a top banana.
From James Harden to a filler/throw-in of the James Harden trade (Caris Levert)
Lmao Lowry/VanVleet/Anunoby/#4 to Caris LeVert and Malcolm Brogdon.
I heard Pacers with a package of Caris Levert might be the best deal right now.
"Over the likes of D‚Äôlo, Wiggins, and Caris Levert too"
"Exactly lol plus its not even like I compared him to a bad player, Caris Levert is a damn good player and would be a starter on pretty much every team"
Not sure how you can watch KPJ and say his ceiling is Caris LeVert
"The big three of KD, Caris LeVert, and Spencer Dinwiddie"
the fact sixers could have gone all in on harden but didnt want to give up that many assets and now they may need to seattle for caris levert  insane stuff
LeVert might actually be a better fit for Philly than Brogdon anyway. Trading Ben means less of a critical need for elite shooting and LeVert probably has better shot creation and ball handling. It would also allow Indy to keep shooting around Ben. Ben for Caris filler and draft compensation (and maybe a prospect like Bitadze) is the deal I see happening if anything and makes more sense for both teams than the initially rumored trade.  That deal would feel reminiscent of PG to the Thunder for Oladipo and Sabonis. Maybe doesn't feel like a short term win for Philly but could play out well.
Brogdon AND LeVert isn't happening. Sorry for anyone that's getting their hopes up. If a trade happens it's most likely either one of Brogdon and Caris plus filler plus FRP(s). Unless a third team is involved.
"Right but I'm just saying the possiblity of it should be enough to roll the dice on that, unless you think Caris LeVert will net you a better potential superstar within the time of his contract, or think that he and the pieces that would be involved will be a championship caliber team in the near future."
"You have leverage over Ben, but not over other teams. Dude is a diva, hasn‚Äôt improved since his rookie year, and is making max money. He gets played off the court in the playoffs because he can‚Äôt make a free throw.  He has talent don‚Äôt get me wrong, but he has major flaws as well. There‚Äôs a reason the players being floated in trade offers are Malik Beasley, Buddy Hield/Marvin Bagley, and Caris LeVert. Teams just aren‚Äôt going to give up a 85 cents on the dollar offer for Simmons even if he is All NBA. Sixers are more likely looking at a 50-60 cents on the dollar type offer if you want to be realistic"
"Genuinely would make me happy. And a large part of that is the solid fit, but also because I‚Äôm a lowkey Caris LeVert fan. Just a ton of fun to watch, and he‚Äôs always come back from adversity over and over. I adore that kind of mental fortitude."
"Yeah, I view his ceiling is a Caris Levert type (maybe more consistent/less injury prone).   However I don‚Äôt really view him as a high level starter to be honest. I think a realistic projection for him would be more the Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, Jordan Clarkson type role as a spark plug bench scorer.   He could probably be a starter on some teams (bad/lotto teams), but ideally on a good team his role would be a 6th man type role as a bench spark plug.   Who knows though, the guy was a high ceiling prospect who has improved every year so far. So it wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising to me for him to beat my expectations. Easily the best draft pick the Warriors made since they won a ring."
"A package surround Caris Levert for the potential of Ben Simmons improving to what he can be is a deal you take 100% of the time if you're the Pacers.   Increases your potential ceiling. What's the point of being a treadmill, middle of the pack, playoff team that gets bounced in the second round until your best players go elsewhere otherwise?"
Pacers get:  * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum   Blazers get:   * Tobias Harris  Sixers get:   * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris Levert   * Malcom Brogdon
Caris LeVert is an inefficient scorer and a mediocre playmaker. Indiana would be lucky to get Ben Simmons for him.
"The 4 games Simmons has played without Embiid are the Dragic led Heat, Caris Levert led Nets and this year's Wizards...  Yeah I sure hope he won at least 3/4 against them lol. Embiid would do the same if he faced them without Simmons too..."
"Bringing James Harden hasnt helped the Nets at all, the Rockets won the deal massively. You were already a team capable of making the playoffs even without KD and Irving, and with them healthy you can perennial 2nd round team in the playoffs. Now adding on Harden, you were still a 2nd round team last season, I dont see what difference it made other than giving up 6 years of draft picks and valuable assets like Jarret Allen and Caris Levert."
"In Jarrett Allen's own way of charity while with the Nets, for Thanksgiving he would take kids of need to a local market in Brooklyn, give them a budget and let them buy groceries within that budget, teaching those kids important life skills.  Caris LeVert has a similar local program too."
"PG: Cade Cunningham $2  SG: Donovan Mitchell $4  SF: Caris LeVert $2  PF: OG Anunoby $2  C: Joel Embiid $5  --------------------  You have to give up value somewhere, so I think taking Cade for $2 is a worthwhile bet.   Embiid is an obvious choice IMO.   Anunoby for $2 seems like an absolute steal.   Then having to decide between either getting another $5 player and a $1, or taking a $4 and a $2, and IMO I'd rather take a guy like Mitchell and the step up in talent from $1 to $2, than have a $5 talent and have to somehow shoehorn someone like Danny Green into the lineup."
"Malcolm Brogdon, Caris Levert, Tj Warren, Myles Turner"
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
"If I'm the Sixers I go Simmons and a FRP for TJ Warren/Caris LeVert, hope for the best."
Caris levert is really good though. Legit all star potential but keeps getting detailed by injuries
Caris LeVert minus injuries is actually good.
People see Kevin Porter Jr as a future star and franchise player but I think hes gonna be Caris Levert
Yeah if a pacers deal randomly does happen then the sixers should look for other added pieces to go with Brogdon. Just looked up Caris LeVert and Woj reporting  3 days ago he has a stress fracture in his back but supposedly can be back for the start of the season!
"Better coach sure, but continuity? Levert still only has half a season with this squad, Warren didn‚Äôt play with last years squad and they all haven‚Äôt played under carlisles system. Like I‚Äôd agree it‚Äôs more than Chicago but it‚Äôs still not that much.  You can‚Äôt bring up injuries for Chicago after ignoring that for Indy. They‚Äôre from top to bottom one of the most injury prone teams year in and year out. Caris and Brogdon are bandaids especially and the timetable on Warren‚Äôs injury is still up in the air. Also while yes, Lonzo is a bit injury prone, having the reduced pressure of being the fourth guy should help him in that department. And Demar is generally extremely reliable in terms of health.   I didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs an all nba lock, but he‚Äôs all nba caliber. It‚Äôs not like he has to compete with all all of the top guards in the league cause 2-3 are generally omitted due to missed games or bad record or whatever it is. But if guys like Booker and Beal can there‚Äôs no reason Lavine can‚Äôt. He‚Äôs arguably better than both of them, and at the very least is on the same level as em"
If it was all narrative KAT or Caris Levert would have won last year. To be in serious contention for MVP doesn‚Äôt mean nothing.  (don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm responding to such an absurd troll)
Caris levert since his rookie year
"Danny Granger, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Caris Levert...jeez they really have had some terrible injury luck."
"DENVER: Marquese Chriss, Bam Adebayo, Troy Brown Jr., Leandro Bolmaro; other 1st rounders would be Guerschon Yabusele and Caris LeVert"
"go take a look at half the Pacers roster. Sabonis is a two time all star making $18 mil a year, TJ Warren is at $10 mil a year, Caris LeVert is under $20 mil iirc, Brogdon is under $20 mil a year‚Ä¶"
"Caris LeVert and LaMarcus Aldridge have underlying health issues. They could die. There are some other players in the same boat too. Probably some of the league coaches and trainers, refs, statisticians, security, etc. might also have health issues. They could die too.   One of my fully vaccinated friends died from it not long ago. He had a health condition that made him more susceptible to getting more severe symptoms. Does it have to be in the thousands of people dying to just do the right thing?"
Caris levert. Randomly tuned into a nets game his rookie year and he went off. Been rooting for him ever since
Best case scenario you have an unrelated  problem in the same area so when they to a CT scan to check if this problem is alright they catch the cancer. Like it happenes with Caris LeVert. Normal case you just randomly have symthoms that could kill you if they get worse and then they do a cancer screening
Caris LeVert. I just love his funky stutterstep handles.

For KD and Kyrie the Nets opened up two max slots and didn‚Äôt give up much of anything besides the chance to re-sign D‚ÄôLo to a max. For Harden the two really noteworthy players given up were Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert along with picks and depth.
"Sean Marks gets a lot of credit for turning around the Nets but it doesn‚Äôt happen without Kenny. He played a part in turning around the careers of guys like Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and D‚ÄôLo and had Caris LeVert looking like a player who could turn into an all-star (shame he can‚Äôt stay healthy)."
"https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/15/sixers-not-interested-in-pacers-offer-of-malcolm-brogdon-caris-levert/  Even Brogdon plus picks is a good deal. Not sure why everyone is sleeping on Brogdon. He‚Äôs averaging 21/6/6 this season 21/5.3/5.9 last season. Is a former ROTY and member of the 50/40/90 club.  Career 88.6% FT. Am I missing something? No X Factor? Maybe, but that‚Äôs on Jojo."
Caris Levert is torturing the Blazers and scoring repeatedly going to the hoop. Decides to take a midrange pull up for the game winner. Clank. I was livid lol
Levert I think did fine tonight. He made several nice drop off passes to Sabonis and didn't allow the ball to stick and bog the offense down. I think he'll settle in but he needs to do better if we are to win more games. Need him to pass the ball effectively. I still believe in the Levert Brogdon pairing. Brogdon provides the catch and shoot ability while Caris provides the dribble penetration. Need to see continual ball movement tho. Turner on defense is amazing. His timing in the air is legendary just a fucking beast.
What‚Äôs funny to me is Careless Revert sounds like Caris LeVert as well lmao
Caris Levert is playing with a fracture in his back and he looks like it. His shots aren‚Äôt falling. He can‚Äôt get to the rim. He‚Äôs not getting others involved. And he‚Äôs a parking cone on defense.
"Something to watch: Even with the game pretty well in hand, Caris LeVert only played 17 minutes and seemed to get yanked often after possessions that looked bad.  He's had a rough season, shooting pretty terribly across the board and attempting to shoot himself out of the slump, which has meant looking off open teammates. Not a ton of effort defensively. Wonder if this is Carlisle cracking down on him."
"I didn't act like the Nets are the Lakers. I was talking about the city, not the franchise itself. It's a matter of fucking geography. You wouldn't have 3 superstars as the Memphis Nets. Stop twisting my words.  &gt;and picked up Caris Levert Rights via trade And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD  The reality is [this](https://www.sportscasting.com/why-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-decided-brooklyn-nets/) and I don't know why you'd wanna argue against it, but whatever. Kinda tired of this whole discussion tbh. If you guys wanna think Allen and Dinwiddie are the reason you got Kyrie, KD and Harden, so be it. I'm out."
"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player)who helped him turn it around after that Lakers fiasco)and he admitted our franchise changed his life)  when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and picked up Caris Levert Rights via trade And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD. 5 Nets players from that Kenny Atkinson era combined are have 100+ million a year contracts now.  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn‚Äôt even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago  Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all alone‚Äù when he was with the nets  We went to back to back finals and still don‚Äôt have a big fan base, as you saw the other night with Steph curry and the warriors were in Barclays  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East. This franchise has been through it. You small market teams are  becoming annoying with the big market talk, yes being in New York helps, tell me how that has worked for the Knicks or the nets prior to 2019 when both were in the dumpster or mediocre at best? With maybe one good season the past decade for the Knicks? Both laughing stocks."
"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player now only after his stint in Brooklyn) when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and Caris Levert And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn‚Äôt even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago   Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all alone‚Äù when he was with the nets  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East. This franchise has been through it."
"Dude fuck off with your negative energy. The Nets were able to build a playoff team with the fucking scraps left behind by Billy King. Our new-found competence, our market, and our focus on players brought in KD and Kyrie, and we were able to build just enough talent with Jarret Allen (a late pick that we only got from trading Bojan Bogdanavic), and Caris LeVert (another late pick we only had because of trading That Young) to get James Harden.   We turned a team with no draft picks and fucking Isiah Whitehead spinning his ass off into a playoff contender that was enough to convince superstar players it was worth playing for the Nets. I'll call that a monumental achievement.  I'm happy for you guys getting a chip, but fuck right off."
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
"if they kept dinwiddie they'd have the highest tax bill in the league without even being repeaters.  and seeing as they were basically the favorites last year if it weren't for kyrie getting injured in the finals and harden being gimped, they presumably thought they were solid on all fronts until the mandate happened and kyrie blindsided them by just... choosing to not play basketball and getting fined for every nyc game.  also, dinwiddie himself presumably saw that he'd be playing behind harden and kyrie, but he's clearly a starting pg, so why stay to come off the bench?  caris levert was moved in the harden trade, they didn't really have the option to keep him if they wanted harden."
I mean we have no way of knowing if it was actually an offer but it was definitely reported on: https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-unmoved-pacers-malcolm-brogdon-caris-levert-ben-simmons-trade
"Today's shitpost trade  Blazers get: Caris LeVert, Jeremy Lamb  Pacers get: CJ McCollum"
Off-topic - I'd do a CJ trade for Caris LeVert and Jeremy Lamb
They should‚Äôve taken that rumored deal of Brogdon and Caris Levert
"We don‚Äôt need everyone to develop.  Poole already has emerged as a solid NBA piece and should only get better.  So that leaves Wiseman, Kuminga, and Moody.  If even one of them develops into an all-star quality player, then even as Curry, Klay, and Draymond age we should still be very strong as a team and franchise.    And considering how strong the Warriors dev team is, it only makes sense to bet that one or more of them will be solid pieces soon and that at least one will take a leap.  The Warriors went out of their way to get Dejan Milojevic (the coach who taught Jokic his footwork and postmoves), Kenny Atkinson (the coach who got Brooklyn back into the playoffs by developing guys like DLo, Caris Levert, Jaret Allen, and Spencer Dinwiddie), and Jama Mahlalela who helped develop Siakam, OG, and FVF.  That‚Äôs an all-star development team straight up."
Caris levert?
"&gt; we don't have room on the roster for a 12th man making 10mil  ""man we'd really like Malcolm Brogdon, but we can't take on Caris Levert too because we don't can't spare the roster spot of Charles Bassey so we're just gonna let our disgruntled toxic star hang out some more providing 0 value on a max contract""  Lol think this through my guy"

"It actually was a carry job in the middle to latter half of that season. Both Caris LeVert and Dinwiddie were injured, so the offense was 100% orchestrated by him. That being said, he hasn‚Äôt replicated that level of play since"
"carlisle whipped us bad tonight, having caris levert back is pretty big for them"
"Is it a good roster? Without TJ Warren, Caris Levert just got back on a minutes restriction yesterday?"
Caris LeVert looked good in his first game last of the year. Indi could have used him in the second half.
Caris LeVert.
Like this post is about Caris Levert and dude brings up Scottie to talk about how Raptors fans post about Scottie Barnes too much? Lol
What does this have to do with caris levert lol
"Well Philly fans, enjoy Caris Levert"
 pacers gave up Oladipo for Caris Levert and a 2nd rounder?
"I understand GMs have to pull the trigger and it‚Äôs a star driven league,but with Kyrie and harden it could easily be the most toxic set of team mates in the nba. Durant isn‚Äôt a saint either when it comes to issues with team mates so I cannot wait.  Caris LeVert to Indiana is my favourite part of all this though"
Yes I am mad. All season long I joked about how the Rockets could have fun with the Caris Levert poo poo platter instead of Simmons and the mad men actually went and took it.
"Trade him for Jarrett Allen, Rodion Kurucs, Caris Levert, and Taurean Prince. Get a haul of picks, reinvigorate the defense with some youth."
"The Nets sent Houston a package that includes multiple players and draft picks and features guard Caris LeVert, who was then traded to the Pacers for Victor Oladipo, sources tell ESPN.  Center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince are headed from the Nets to the Cavs in the deal, according to sources, while the Rockets receive Cleveland guard Dante Exum and Brooklyn forward Rodions Kurucs  Houston also receives Brooklyn's three unprotected first-round draft picks -- 2022, 2024 and 2026 -- in the deal, plus pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, according to sources. The Rockets also get Cleveland's 2022 first-round pick, via the Milwaukee Bucks.  Wow"
"I'm not sure if this is complete, but from what I gather:  To Brooklyn:  * James Harden (obviously)  To Houston:  * Dante Exum * Victor Oladipo * Rodions Kurucs for some reason * Two 2022 firsts, a 2024 first and a 2026 first  To Cleveland:  * Jarrett Allen * Taurean Prince  To Indy:  * Caris LeVert"
"Maxey, no. Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle, and multiple 1sts, maybe. Lot to give up but I guess it‚Äôs hard to beat Caris Levert and an unprotected Bucks pick."
"Via @ShamsCharania on Twitter  ""Sources: Full current trade:  Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)   Nets: James Harden  Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder  Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"""
Caris levert
"   The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to acquire James Harden from the Houston Rockets.  The Rockets will acquire four first round picks and four pick swaps. Brooklyn will send out Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince as part of the package.¬†  The Cleveland Cavaliers will acquire Allen and Prince while sending a 2022 first round pick from the Milwaukee Bucks, Rodions Kurucs and Dante Exum to the Rockets."
"Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)    Nets: James Harden    Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder    Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"
"Can't help but feel like this is another trade that is going to hurt the nets, losing Levert, Allen and Prince for another ego. Rockets get a big win out of this Caris has been balling and dante is a great back up Point guard (when not injured), not sure why cavs got involved i mean they got something decent for what they offloaded but it seems more temporary than anything"
Not a bad idea the real loser today the pacers trading victor to Houston for caris levert oof
Former rockets great Caris Levert
Rockets legend Caris LeVert
"The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four pick swaps, all of which will come from the Nets except for a 2022 Milwaukee pick currently owned by Cleveland. Houston will also receive Caris LeVert, Dante Exum and Rodions Kurucs. The Cavaliers will get Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince in the deal, according to¬†ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.¬†"
"Per Shams   Full current trade:  Rockets: Victor Oladipo, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, 3 BKN first-rounders (22, 24, 26), 1 MIL first (22, unprotected), 4 BKN 1st round swaps (21, 23, 25, 27)   Nets: James Harden  Pacers: Caris LeVert, 2nd-rounder  Cavs: Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince"
"well yeah i understand that, but the point is that this trade is essentially caris levert and 4 picks. Then like maybe in 5 years they move up a bit in the draft MAYBE but probably not because no matter what the nets wont tank because of the pickswaps. So ultimately it is just for show."
Caris Levert going back to where he started
"That‚Äôs Rockets legend, Caris Levert, to you."
"Harden to Nets. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
"Caris Levert is the most overrated player in the league. That ""young star"" turned out to be Dante Exum btw lmao"
Caris LeVert sucks  Good move by Stone
Rockets legend caris levert
"Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
"At the very least, 2 of those pick swaps are worthless barring catastrophic injury or Caris Levert turning into MJ.   Edit: Lol nvm, unless Oladipo turns into MJ. Still Rockets won‚Äôt be swapping with the nets in ‚Äò21 or ‚Äò23."
Someone please show me some Caris LeVert highlights and walk me off this ledge
"woj with the terms:  Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
Caris Levert is dope. Nobody wants a Kyrie Irving who doesn‚Äôt wanna play
"lavert/allen are moving. no word on kyrie  woj with terms: Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland. Caris LeVert, Dante Exum, Rodions Kurucs, four 1st round picks ‚Äì including Cavs‚Äô 2022 first via Bucks -- and 4 Nets pick swaps to Rockets. Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs."
WTF. They held out only to make Caris Levert their prized jewel? This might be just as bad as the Porzingis trade.
"&gt; Reporting w/  @RamonaShelburne : Brooklyn‚Äôs acquiring James Harden in a three-way deal with Cleveland.

Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince to Cavs.  https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1349464741882814466?s=20"
"Yea why would anyone want to trade for a former MVP in his prime coming off like 3 seasons straight averaging 35+ a game. Better to keep the young guys like Caris LeVert and Tyrese Maxey, they might get a whole all-star vote or 2 once in their careers LMFAO"
Not when the other offer is Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert lol
Yeah good luck getting a better deal lmao enjoy fucking Caris Levert
Bc Simmons and Maxey and a pick is already better than the Caris Levert poo poo platter
"Let me tell you something. If the Rockets end this messy divorce with: Christian Wood, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Caris Levert, Jarret Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie and 5 picks, they would have done a damn good job.  I do not think that is the deal, but even if it ends up being Kyrie and a broken Dinwidde + STILL all those picks? WORTH IT."
"I feel like New York is still a team that would take a chance on Kyrie. What about something like this?:  * HOU receives: Caris LeVert, Julius Randle, Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, Brazdeikis, BKN 2021 1st Rounder, BKN 2023 1st Rounder, BKN 2025 1st Rounder, 2022 Pick Swap with BKN, 2024 Pick Swap with BKN, NYK 2021 1st Rounder  * BKN receives: James Harden, PJ Tucker  * NYK receives: Kyrie Irving  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y4ye7wuc  Brooklyn doesn't completely gut their roster and retains depth but they have no draft picks to trade for 5 years. New York gets a top 8 PG (when he plays) without giving up a core piece like RJ or Robinson. Houston gets younger good upside players who can contribute immediately or can be flipped for more picks.   Thoughts?"
"Long term yes the picks are more valuable than Ben Simmons cause they could be anything, even the next Ben Simmons but short/medium term Ben Simmons plus a weaker pick or two is better value since the Rockets owner only cares about making money and Ben Simmons is a star and will put more butts in seats every night than Caris LeVert will."
Apparently houston views Siakam as Caris LeVert level which is hilarious but if so they might like OG more
Caris LeVert is who Andrew Wiggins thinks he is   For this one both LeVert and Wiggins fans will be furious at comparing each guy to the other pretending their guy is so clearly better which is the hilarious part
Kyrie goes to Houston   Harden to nets   Westbrook to the nets   Caris Levert to the wizards  Cousins to wizards
The nets core in 2018 included Spencer dinwiddie caris levert Jarrett allen and dlo. Everyone under 25 years old were the main contributors.
You won't give up Caris LeVert for James Harden?
You forgot the Caris LeVert interaction
"Only idiots thought his return from injury would be bad. Those that doubt him watch numbers. Or think because mediocre players didn‚Äôt recover well from injury that KD wouldn‚Äôt.   Nobody talks how PG broke his whole leg in a game, playing great now. Or Caris Levert broke his foot and returned same season. KD is a whole different beast.   Better doctors are out there. Players can recover from multiple injuries and play great. See John Wall, D Cousins, V Oladipo."
PG: Kemba Walker SG: Caris LeVert SF: Tobias Harris PF: Robert Covington  C: Jusuf Nurkic
"I think that's what he said later. The first interview happened just 30 minutes after he texted Kyrie, and it seems like Kyrie had only texted at least one of his teammates (Caris LeVert) before the game (not sure how much he told his teammates, and whether they knew full well what he was doing w/ his personal time and didn't tell Nash until after game pressers). I think the next day or the day after, Nash said (or acted like) he knew what the reason was, but said it was personal and didn't want to get into it in more detail."
"Yep. 3 first overall picks, former rebounding leader Andre Drummond on contract szn, and Caris Levert ‚Äîfront running trade piece for superstar James Harden.   Clearly the best group of guys."
[The team says something different](https://sports-yahoo-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/caris-levert-says-kyrie-irving-042919709.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16104068953223&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fcaris-levert-says-kyrie-irving-042919709.html)
Caris LeVert üòé üòé üòé
"I have to disagree there though, I think a big problem with Kyrie is he still has an ego and he wouldn't be okay with coming off the bench even if its better for his mental health. This is a guy who left Lebron to try to carry a team, failed and then came to the nets and made incendiary comments about how KD was the only teammate he could rely on. He's also taken more shots than KD on the court when they've played together this season. All this tells me that Kyrie still believes he's the best player on the court at any time and that would make it hard for any team to convince him to accept a smaller role. I mean if he can't defer to Lebron and KD, there's no way in hell he's deferring to Caris Levert and Spencer Dinwiddie. I hope I'm wrong though because if these antics continue and he doesn't accept a smaller role he might get AI'd or Carmelo'd out the league.  And yeah Kevin Love's story was heartbreaking but hopeful, hopefully kyrie can take inspiration from it"

EXCUSE ME!?  Caris LeVert scored how much on *checks notes* 15 for 23!?? Holy shit!
"Don't let the final score fool you. We choked a 22 pt lead. Brooks kept getting into foul troubles. Two flagrant 1s and a tech. Jonas had to leave. Some of Clarke's shots kept rimming in-and-out. We even choked a 7 pt lead down the 4th with 7 mins to go. But, we kept grinding it out and went clutch mode within the final 3 mins or so. Jenkins made the right rotations tonight.  Caris LeVert was hot today. No Brooks or Jonas to guard him. Kept making 3s like it's nothing.   Seriously, we need healthy Ja and Jaren vs healthy KD and Kyrie.  GG Nets."
Caris Levert literally said he texted them pregame and Joe Vardon reported the team knows why Kyrie is sitting
Damn I didn‚Äôt know Caris Levert was in charge of the rotation and running plays for the night. Must have meant Steve Nash and all the coaches and management were out too.
"No, but it clearly wasn't something silly because Caris LeVert said Kyrie texted the team explaining why and the entire team supported him."

"We may feel as fans we have seen him flip the switch a few times but it doesn‚Äôt matter if he can‚Äôt stay healthy and do it for an entire season.   That‚Äôs my Caris Levert take, not really as crazy as you seemed to be interpreting"
"It was a back to back against a team that was fresh and at home. Also, Caris LeVert does this every damn time."
"I mean lets not pretend Kyrie doesn't bring this kinda scrutiny on himself, with his super-woke, holier than thou, im a genius artist crap. If it was Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, or anyone else on the team taking a ""mental health day"" it wouldn't even be a thing. But third-eye-kyrie must have had his chakra channels mis-aligned, or had a bad reiki session, or something"
Caris ‚Äú10/1 A/TO‚Äù LeVert
"I‚Äôve heard mixed reports on what happened, but it sounds like Caris LeVert was notified. No one knows what he‚Äôs going through except himself. He could be so distressed that he couldn‚Äôt even come to the phone. Who knows"
Gain for caris Levert!
"Nah we‚Äôre just better when Bruce Brown gets minutes, Green/Allen start, and our bench isn‚Äôt just Caris LeVert bricks for 20 minutes.  Harris off the bench has really helped a lot of the flow.  I‚Äôd like to finally see a Kyrie/Brown/KD/Green/Allen full strength lineup with LeVert+Harris as 6th/7th men"
"you just lost to caris ""under 50 ts%"" levert"
Caris LeVert looks exactly like Kenny Anderson.
Bojan Bogdanovic  OG Anunoby   DeMar DeRozan  Kyle Kuzma   Mikal Bridges   Caris LeVert  Joe Harris
"Nets fans after the 1st 2 games  ""Caris Levert is a lock for the 6th MOY!"""
"Not the Bucks? Idk dude Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Giannis can all check KD with some success, and imo they‚Äôd have the best player in that series. Really depends on whether you believe in Caris LeVert, since the starters are sort of a wash."
Caris LeVert?
"What about joe Harris, caris levert, and Landry shamet?"
Jarrett Allen with 19/18 + 3 steals and 2 blocks on 8/9 shooting   Kyrie with 29/6/5 + 3 steals on 12/19 shooting   Caris LeVert with 24/5 + 2 steals on 9-18 shooting in 21 minutes   this game was a wet dream
caris levert heard y'all talking shit
"Absolutely dominated. If the Jazz weren't going to keep Gobert I wanted them to make a trade involving Caris Levert and Jarret Allen, impressive performance by him tonight and I really hope this puts to rest the idea of DJ starting games."
"one day caris levert will get his shot back, today is not that day"
thats the Caris LeVert experience
caris levert has been a straight brick these last few games smh
I died when I saw John wall below Caris levert and andre drummond...
&gt;He was a reason but you can argue some other guys were better on bkn.   Caris Levert was hurt for half the season and D'lo and Spencer picked up the slack but that playoff birth was on their shoulders and their alone.
You‚Äôre gonna love Caris Levert man
Caris levert
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
Better playmaker better operating out of the pick and roll. Jerami Grant also isn‚Äôt someone long term you want on wings defensively even if he‚Äôs ok at it he really should be a 4 defensively over the long run.   I‚Äôm not even a Caris LeVert fan but once Grant regresses offensively and once Derrick Rose is dealt or gone from the team I would rather have LeVerts playmaking and ability to operate out of a pick and roll than Grants for a rebuilding team
Caris LeVert for Jerami Grant once he cools off  This is also where no dinwiddie reallly sucks he was the most direct trade asset   Also they should be badgering Houston‚Äôs phone lines for pj Tucker once James harden is dealt which will still happen
Caris Levert is def a chucker
Cool to see Kyrie talking LeVert down. That was dumb as fuck by Caris
"TS% is a garbage stat Reddit loves. Caris LeVert has 8 FTA this season lol.   Caris LeVert off ball defense has been more concerning. Caris LeVert has been disappointing so far, but he will bounce back."
I wouldn‚Äôt mind the Nets to trade for him. He‚Äôd be an improvement on the role Caris LeVert is playing right now anyway. I‚Äôll gladly trade in the 3s for better efficiency inside the arc considering our roster right now.  The Sixers should also put Tobias and a first on the table for him to see if the Spurs are dumb enough to take on the Tobias contract.
