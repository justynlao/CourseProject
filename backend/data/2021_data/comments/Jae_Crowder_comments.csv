"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
marcus morris jae crowder terry rozier are better now and evan turner was never good.
"Brad Stevens has a reputation for making role players look really, really good. Evan Turner, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, the list goes on and on. His squads also have everyone buy in to the team identity and play hard-nosed defense, while getting everyone involved on offense.  He's a defense-minded coach, which is why the defensive schemes are significantly more complicated than the offense. He's already coached plenty of good offenses so far, of course he has room to improve at that end."
Jae Crowder
"that draft was BAD, there's legit no way Draymond makes it to 7.  He's at worst the 5th pick in retrospect and probably goes 4th.  AD, Lillard, Beal, Draymond &amp; Khris Middleton are the top 5 players.  After that it's Harrison Barnes, Jae Crowder, Drummond, Fournier, Terrence Ross &amp; Austin Rivers.  Oddly enough it seems likely that the Warriors would end up with Harrison Barnes all over again."
Yeah Jae Crowder being gone is what hit them hard. Not half their team being out for most of the season.
"i think the thing with DA is that while he still shows sometimes some fumbling and messing up of passes delivered to him, a lot of his lesser offensive numbers is largely due to passing out to the Suns shooters, namely Cam, Mikal and Jae Crowder owing to the shooters being open due to DA attracting attention down low.   It's smart basketball to a degree, and it's worked more often than not for the Suns although I still sometimes don't like them relying on mostly their 3 - especially in games where the shot just wasn't falling and it cost the Suns like against the Pistons and Grizzlies.  That said, there have been flashes last few games especially of DA being more assertive on offense and CP3 has helped a lot with that. DA has looked better off the pick and roll with CP3 more often than not the last ten or so games, and I imagine it'll continue on as the season goes on.  I like the fact that DA can still contribute to the Suns winning even if he isn't attempting (and scoring) too much, mostly due to his defense (he's a legit defensive QB type player now for the Suns on defense, and to me the most important defensive player for the Suns even ahead of Mikal) and also he's turned into one of the best rebounders in the game."
"&gt;""Don't ever say anything bad (no matter how true) about the Heat or you will face a lot of backlash""   &gt;   &gt; ""Still don't understand why Miami had massive expectations"" ""They massively overachieved last year. They'll still make the playoffs, but that roster is a first round exit.""   &gt;   &gt;""Massively overachieving in a bubble playoffs in your home state, making no improvements to the roster, and watching the rest of the top of the East improve is not a recipe for success""   &gt;   &gt;Butler has been a BAD 3pt shooter for years, but nobody is ever willing to say anything negative about him. Why is that changing now?   &gt;   &gt;Adding KD to Brooklyn wasn't a guaranteed improvement? Bucks obviously improved Anybody who understands basketball knew that Philly would be improved. Heat were always a distant 5th coming into the season.

"&gt;You did not just say that Avery Bradley is a wash for Jae Crowder in 2021  You seemingly overrate Crowder by a large margin.  Last year in the playoffs, the Heat were a net negative of -2.4 pts/100 with Crowder on the floor, and were 11.8/100 better **without** him.  The Suns this year are also 5.5 pts/100 worse when Crowder plays, than without him.  So far this year, the Heat are 7 pts/100 better with Bradley, then they are without him.  Last year, Bradley was also a net positive on the champion Lakers during the regular season, to the tune of +2.8 pts/100 better with him.  So yeah, at best for Crowder, they are a wash.  If you want to get precise, the evidence indicates that Bradley is actually an upgrade."
You did not just say that Avery Bradley is a wash for Jae Crowder in 2021 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Along with a bunch of other nonsense üòÇ
You're not the same team as last year. Jae Crowder is gone for one thing and he was majorly clutch in the playoffs
"&gt;Explain what you value  I don't really understand why people would have a different opinion than me on this.   When you're ranking players currently (obviously accolades *matter* in all-time discussions), NOTHING that happened more than 3-4 years ago has any weight whatsoever.  This year matters. Last year matters. Two years ago matters...three years ago? Starting to not matter.   Second, you have to understand the goals of the team, and the role of the player. Just because somebody's inefficient doesn't mean he's bad *if* the alternative to his inefficient shots is worse.  Low-volume, high-efficiency players are useful, but you can't shoot your wad about Danny Green or Otto Porter or Jae Crowder being ""legitimate all-stars"" or some other nonsense. They're good. They're useful. They're not going to suddenly become go-to guys on good teams. Efficiency doesn't always scale. The somewhat inefficient bench guard taking bad shots in the half-court is still probably better than letting Danny Green dribble, or expecting Otto Porter to create his own shot.  Third, and maybe most importantly, after a certain point, skillsets and potential and all of that stop mattering. At some point, you are basically who you are, and if that trajectory is flat...it's time to stop pretending a guy is an umolded piece of clay. The major exception to this is guys who have never really had a role."
"This is legit why the Heat zone was so good too. Jimmy Butler and Jae Crowder at the point of attack, Bam at the rim, pls ignore Herro / Dragic / Duncan Robinson getting hidden at the corners"
"Uh Giannis isn‚Äôt bad in the playoffs. Career 25 ppg even though he was shit to start his career, and he the only reason Goran Dragic/Tyler Herro/Duncan Robinson/Jae Crowder were killing us rather than Bam or Jimmy on defense."
"it‚Äôs COVID but it‚Äôs also giannis related.  mind you we didn‚Äôt resign Jae Crowder or DJJ because we were clearing space up for Giannis; and when he didn‚Äôt sign here, we replaced them with Avery Bradley and Moe Harkless. arguably our defensive spark plug and one of our premier young talents replaced by a journeyman and (admittedly) a pretty good defender  i feel like we‚Äôve instantly suffered as a result a lil. i miss DJJ."
Wow I love Jae Crowder and CP3 now
Jae Crowder selected all the optional gear during create-a-player
DJ Augustin  Eric Gordon  Danny Green  Jae Crowder  Mason Plumlee  Actually has solid spacing and is solid defensively.
"bubble v Heat last year was hugely on Bud and a little on the players.    Bud - did not adjust his schemes that made Jae Crowder look like Klay Thompson.Dragic was feasting off pull up 3s vs Brook Lopez. Heat got good looks throughout series. Also his infamous regular season rotation load managing the stars' minutes in a damned playoff series.   Players - Giannis was playing below his averages vs Bam, Iggy and Butler defense and exposed his lack of go to moves. Except in that game 4 before getting injured. I hate to say this Im primarily a Giannis stan from abroad.    KMid was inefficient throughout the series even during the sole win when he carried team.    Blednoshow as usual. Brook was most consistent on O but as usual flatfooted liability on defense. Rest of the bench did not make impact."
Worse than Jae Crowder!
"ngl, im p sure budenholzer is the one sending jae crowder death threats"
"Jae Crowder is traded every year, so him."
"Stop being an idiot Crowder was a loss but don‚Äôt act like we‚Äôre 6-12 because of Jae Crowder leaving. If the Pacers had Sabonis, And Brogdon out they‚Äôd be ass too"
"Bucks because Heat don't have Jae Crowder to guard Giannis, and because the Bucks yeeted Bledsoe into the stratosphere."
"Tomas Satoransky   (Healthy) Otto Porter   Avery Bradley   Steven Adams  Jae Crowder   Sato and Otto are generally productive, though they haven't consistently been part of winning teams. That could change this season though, depending on how the Bulls play throughout the season.  Bradley, Adams, and Crowder have each played as starters on good teams. Maybe not as productive this season, but definitely last season and previous ones too."
Jae Crowder turned out to be the most crucial player on their team
Jae Crowder
"He's weird, the flashes are there but he just isnt assertive frequently enough. The stats on the surface look ok but he's just high variance game to game he has like 4 games with at least 24 points and like 5 or 6 in single digits.   Still doesnt have that much of a 1 v1 game just dependent on fadeaway jumpers and cant really pass. Gotten a little better with it this year but he should still get to the free throw line more than he does for someone with his tools. It's weird, outside of putbacks the only way he can really do anything on offense is when Chris Paul passes him the ball. There's just no chemistry with anybody else like Jae Crowder has thrown him more passes this year than Devin Booker."
"Unless you really think Jae Crowder was the difference between the Heat being a finals team and a lottery team, this is an absurdly premature take. The Heat will make the playoffs"
why couldn‚Äôt jordan clarkson do this for Lebron and the Cavs!? him and Jae Crowder both stunk it up with Lebron then left and went back to being good players lmao.
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
or Jae crowder to the heat last season
Out of all people why jae crowder it‚Äôs so fucking random? Also fuck them
"Ok Takeaways:  OKC YESSIRSKI ‚úÖ WE DO NOT LOSE FOLKS DONT FUCKING FORGET IT  That was like watching last years team scrimmage at 100% and CP3 is so good he has the play against all the young guys and Al horford for it to be fair  Abdel Nader - the return, the revenge  Jae crowder is so solid bro  Dort is actually so fucking good pay attention to the man  me telling the refs to T up Chris paul   Poku got some nice run. This is how we make him into the 7 foot sniper guard he will inevitably become ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  Diallo is waaaay too tough  Flacko Roby SZN  CP3 is probably so furious rn hahaha  Awesome Shai  Good work OKC. Let‚Äôs keep competing"
not that death threats are ever rational but who tf is sending death threats to Jae crowder and why?
What are you talking about? If anyone was to blame for that injury it was Jae Crowder.  NSFW: https://youtu.be/PukZHdoFJoA
In last years finals Jae Crowder trued to catch Bron as they both landed awkwardly and all his little fanboys were absolutely mental. How they gonna defend this?
Right but your original argument was that Klay Thompson was replaceable. You‚Äôre telling me that if Draymond was playing his best ball and Jae Crowder was there they‚Äôd be as good as ever?
you gotta have no life to be sending death threats to Jae Crowder of all people
If you‚Äôre betting that much money on Jae crowder you‚Äôve got issues
"Thompson was replaceable on those teams, if you put Jae crowder or Danny green there instead those warriors team still probably wins the finals. Peak draymond was not someone you could remotely replace, not only was he the best defender in the league and the reason their defensive scheme worked, but that team especially pre-Durant needed an additional playmaker to curry, who has never been an elite shot creator for his teammates."

Jae Crowder and hitting clutch OT shots. Name a better duo
I would leave my boyfriend for Jae crowder I‚Äôm not going to lie
I want Jae Crowder
"&gt; He along with Jae Crowder have been passed around this league as players good enough to be desired in a trade, but not elite enough to necessitate holding onto.  Common link between the two is that they just aren't consistent shooters, which kind of shows how much emphasis there is on that skill nowadays.    We loved them both in Utah, but their shooting just wasn't ideal for the system we want to run.  Wish them all the best."
"Utah generates a ton of them, have for years. We just have Mike Conley and Bojan taking them now instead of Ricky Rubio and Jae Crowder (who I love both those guys, but not the best shooters)"
Harkless is the poor man's jae crowder
"He along with Jae Crowder have been passed around this league as players good enough to be desired in a trade, but not elite enough to necessitate holding onto.  The level of class these players exhibit by not whining about their situation is great. Feel a bit for them tho"
"You can actually (kinda) connect this trade as being a continuation of the Kyrie trade. It's not a perfect match but...  Kyrie was traded for IT, Jae Crowder, BKN's pick, etc.  Crowder + Shumpert + D-Rose (free agent pickup) were traded for George Hill &amp; Hood  George Hill was traded to Milwaukee for their first-round pick  Milwaukee's first-round pick was traded for Jarrett Allen &amp; Taurean Prince."
Jae Crowder used spidey sense to deflect that pass.
"I think he could actually work pretty well in place of conley with the current roster construction. Not saying he'd be better but It would work I think. When rubio was on the team mitchell was the only scorer and that was the problem, but now they have bojan and clarkson in place of guys like jae crowder and alec burks. At times their backcourt is weak on defense and gets torched by good guards, rubio would help beef up the defense and would have plenty of other scoring options. That being said I love conley and he's a great fit and a great guy."
Yeah this is Jae crowder and hayward all over again. Shit just happens sometimes.
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
Miami. They badly need a Jae Crowder replacement. He also seems like a Heat culture kinda guy.
I wouldn't give yourself any flack; Jae Crowder was a massive part of your finals run.
It was quite infuriating watching jae crowder shoot wide open 3s against them in the playoffs. Dude was klay thompson that series
"Kyrie trade. Don't need to explain about Kyrie. Also would've let us hang onto Jae Crowder, who was good literally everywhere except Cleveland. And even if we didn't pick Sexton, a lot of really nice players were picked afterwards: both Bridges, SGA, and MPJ were picked soon after."
Well they got almost all star Jae Crowder the way overvalued nets pick (everyone thought it would go number one) and no one knew about Thomas injury. Also this just shows that Isaiah Thomas has little value since they still had to attach the ‚Äúfirst pick‚Äù in next year‚Äôs draft and 3&amp;D Jae Crowder even though Thomas finished 5th in MVP voting
"It's 100% revisionist history. Most people thought Cavs won that trade at the time, including me. No one expected Isaiah to fall off like that after a hip injury. The thought process was that Isaiah would be about 90% of Kyrie, then you got the Nets pick which was supposed to be top 3. Then they also got Jae Crowder who was a solid 3 + D guy to put with LeBron.  Isaiah didn't come back even half of the same player, the Nets overachieved, and the Cavs had crazy chemistry issues."
You clearly don‚Äôt know basketball. He played in Utah under Quinn Snyder. His offense has a lot of movement from both a ball and personnel perspective. It‚Äôs actually funny too cause people talk about Jae Crowder and George Hill struggling on that Cleveland team as well and the common thing is all 3 came from pass heavy team oriented offenses but were forced to become spot up shooters basically with lebron
"They have his bird rights so they can pay him whatever he wants. Kerr did an interview yesterday and said he was coaching Oubre and Wiggins with the mindset of what they‚Äôll look like next season with Klay, take that however you want. Jae Crowder only got 30M for 3 years last offseason and he‚Äôs better than Oubre."
It's weird cause just a few games ago he was going to work against Jae Crowder who couldn't guard him in the post. Idk why he couldn't do the same against Duncan.
"Jrue Holiday is very good, as well as the fact that I don‚Äôt expect the Bucks to make the same mistakes they did last year. Also, Miami lost Jae Crowder who was instrumental in defending Giannis"
https://nesn.com/2015/04/kendrick-perkins-decks-jae-crowder-on-hard-screen-scuffle-ensues-video/
The Jae Crowder of the NBA.
"Dawg. Giannis lost to a team with a best player who is worse than him and a bunch of dudes acquired via trade or developed by the Heat. What are you saying? The reason the Bucks lost to the Heat isn't because the Heat are in a desirable situation -- the Bucks are MORE TALENTED than Miami. They lost because they got outcoached severely and because Giannis woefully underperformed. This woe is me attitude has to stop from small market teams. They secure superstars and then fail to materialize competent enough teams around those stars.   Miami secured their star and he was surrounded by Bam Adebayo (developed all star), Tyler Herro (rookie), Dragic (traded for YEARS ago), Jae Crowder (traded for), and Iguodala (traded for). Jimmy Butler was signed in free agency, but he's a worse player than a lot of the stars on small market teams... Maybe teams should draft their own Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro, trade for their own Jae Crowder and Iguodala, develop their own quality coaching staff that's up to snuff and surround their home grown superstar with that instead of bullshitting around keeping coaches like Budenholzer as the head of their program.  I mean, OKC had Paul George AND Westbrook and couldn't make it out of the first round... Is that because they're a small market? Kawhi and Paul George JUST LOST TO DENVER."
"oh wow haha i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever disliked a player quite like Paul Pierce, although Jae Crowder is close    but i guess our difference is that you enjoy the exploitation of the rules and i enjoy guys just saying ‚Äúi am better than you, deal with it‚Äù and i totally get that. it‚Äôs probably my main reason for watching football. i do wish we had 450 Jokic‚Äôs though, great passing is amazing to watch and seeing finesse players show off their skill is great"
Ahh the Jae Crowder Syndrome
I think the heat have lost a lot without Jae crowder Kelly Olynyk is their pf now.
And skinny - Jae Crowder could take Oubre
I might have hallucinated this but I swear he called DeAndre Jordan Jae Crowder.
"It literally says   &gt;It looks unlikely the Cleveland Cavaliers will pry a better haul than the Boston Celtics' standing offer of Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Nets' unprotected pick in the 2018 draft -- even with Thomas' status so uncertain due to a lingering hip injury.  2 sentences into the article. Everyone thought that was by far the best offer they were gonna get at the time to stay competitive right away in Lebron‚Äôs last year."
Jae Crowder isn't on the Heat anymore
"Depends who you ask. I think Barton has been the same guy for a couple years. He‚Äôs a ball handler who looks to get his own shot. Works great as a 6th man against bench units but not as a starter. Completely disrupts Murray and jokic‚Äôs chemistry.  We need wing depth. And a back up center. I was really hoping we would make a push for Jae crowder, or even a long shot on Gordon Hayward, who I think would literally be perfect in Denver‚Äôs offense. But alas, we only signed jamychal green."
"That's exactly what we've been doing. This FO has been drafting really well, but when it comes to trades and free agency, it's been less than impressive. We traded players that could've been assets at their lowest possible value and lost other guys for nothing. Not that I expect to get Kawhi or some shit, but like maybe try to land an Aron Baynes or a Jae Crowder at least."
"Bro first I didn't trade for shit. Second you are only looking at one aspect of this, very tunnel visioned. We knew we were gonna be over the cap signing Don and rudy to extensions so we traded for a player with multiple years on his contract left so we can still have quality talent over letting players like Jae crowder walk because we don't have the cap room to sign them.  Not every team can just say fuck it we'll just sign LeBron in the off-season"
"A- Lebron delivered a championship to every city he‚Äôs played in. That matters. He left in free agency not by demanding a trade that matters. He left if he was unhappy with the roster moves a team made.  B- The trade you are referring sent out Dwayne wade, Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas Iman shumpert Derrick rose and Jae crowder. They received Jordan Clarkson, Larry nance jr, George Hill, Rodney Hood and the draft rights for an overseas player. This trade made them both younger and healthier.  C- the trade was for 3 picks and two swaps. If it continues to work out and the lakers are better than New Orleans, those swap can be nothing Every trade you referenced is factually incorrect.  And to reiterate, it does matter if it worked out. Ask the fan bases involved. It probably feels a lot better to have made whatever trade(and lebron trades were focused and on what actually makes the team better not who he didn‚Äôt like in the locker room.) and won a chip than make several trades and have harden kick you in the nuts with his trade demands out the door."
*Jae Crowder has entered the chat*
It's Jae Crowder
"Stopped by Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Bam Adabayo, and Jae Crowder vs stopped by Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan"
"jae crowder when he was on the jazz  big meaty boi we loved him. he wasnt great, or even good, but he was passable and he had a lot of passion"
"Avery Bradley, Seth Curry, Robert Covington, Jae Crowder, Shaq"
"&gt; so Cavs just lost their franchise player for nothing  That is false. LeBron was signed and traded to the Miami. Here's the haul.  &gt; July 10, 2010: The Cleveland Cavaliers agreed to a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat to acquire the rights to five future draft picks and receive a traded player exception for free-agent forward LeBron James, Cavaliers General Manager Chris Grant announced today. Per team and league policy, terms of the contract were not released.  &gt; ""This deal provides us with multiple key assets and additional flexibility as we move forward for both the short term and beyond,"" said Cavaliers General Manager Chris Grant.   &gt; 2011 2nd round draft pick (Milan Maƒçvan was later selected), a 2012 2nd round draft pick (Jae Crowder was later selected), a 2013 1st round draft pick (Nemanja Nedoviƒá was later selected) and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot was later selected). Cleveland also received a trade exception from Miami. Cleveland had the option to swap 1st round draft picks with Miami in 2012 but did not do so."
"To clear any confusion and prevent misunderstandings:  &gt; July 10, 2010: **LeBron James was traded by the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat** for a 2011 2nd round draft pick (Milan Maƒçvan was later selected), a 2012 2nd round draft pick (Jae Crowder was later selected), a 2013 1st round draft pick (Nemanja Nedoviƒá was later selected) and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot was later selected). Cleveland also received a trade exception from Miami. Cleveland had the option to swap 1st round draft picks with Miami in 2012 but did not do so."
"Jae Crowder was the main reason, he couldn't miss and was a great body to throw at Giannis. Herro and Duncan were solid/good but they were expected to shoot well so Crowder being the open man and actually hitting threes was the big difference. I wish he could have shot that well against the Lakers but oh well."
"Their strategy is to funnel 3s to the other team's worst shooters lol, people make it sound like Bud is telling them ""yeah just let Herro and Robinson shoot lol""  That's why it ends up being dudes like year 4 FVV and Jae Crowder torching us (and Bud failing to adjust to that lol)"
Cuz his stupid ass coach wanted to put the dpoy on Jae crowder for some reason. And Lebron didn‚Äôt guard jimmy either.
"The same Roster turnover always happens.   Look at the Celtics team with Brad Stevens.    Marcus Smart is the only player left that played in those first 2 Playoff Series under Brad Stevens. Jaylen Brown came in during the 3rd Year of the Celtics making the Playoffs and Tatum after that.   Celtics got rid of Isiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynik, Etc.   Even later on they lost Kyrie, Rozier, Morris, and Horford."
"Vanderbilt is probably the best we have and odds are he might crack the starting lineup soon.   It was a known issue this roster is missing a 4. We tried to get Millsap, JaMychal Green, Derrick Jones Jr, and Jae Crowder in free agency. Some we couldn't afford but others just chose other teams. We've also been rumored to be probing trades for PJ Tucker, Larry Nance Jr, and Aaron Gordon.  Our GM has been trying but not much has come our way."
Jae Crowder claimed on twitter that their defense about to be worse than WSH.
Jae Crowder  I loved when he played for the Celtics that the Jazz equipment team found old shoes of his dad from when he played on the team and gave them to him. Then he came to Utah and I liked watching him play. His all-caps social media messages crack me up. I was sad that he got traded in the Conley deal but was happy he got to Miami and got to play in the Finals.
Injuries during his time with Memphis and Boston. He shares the similar effect as Jae Crowder where that he is particularly good in some aspects of his game but not so great in other aspects which usually has teams (didn't he play for 10 teams?) having him come off the bench.

"Increase in defensive focus and a decrease in usage since CP3 and Jae Crowder joined the crew. He is contributing more to winning basketball now than he did in prior seasons. As a suns fan, I‚Äôm happy with his defensive effort this year and am optimistic that he will figure it out with CP."
"It seems like we have been a lot more focused on getting Mikal Bridges or Jae Crowder the ball. The last 2 years, we have had the idea that we constantly need to feed DA, but this year he has taken a huge leap on defense... and been a much smaller part of the offense as a result. I think he is doing more this year to contribute to winning compared to before."
Promise I didn't cheat:  Rafer Alston  Vlade Divac  Alex Caruso?  Svi Mykhailuk  Jae Crowder  Joel Embiid  Hubie Brown?  Milos Teodosic???

* Rafer Alston * Jae Crowder * Bismarck Biyombo * Chauncey Billups * Zydrunas Ilgalskus * Frank Nitklina * Masai Ujiri * Bam Adebayo   thats all I got.  Not sure if spelled right.  There's another one I recognize in there but can't spell (google says: luc mbah a moute)
"5- Jae Crowder 10- Manu Ginobli  Too Lazy to look at the rest.  I like the post, though. Unfortunately,  NCAAF taking my attention."
"Similarly, I like to think of Jae Crowder as Jake Router"
Lucky Jae Crowder wasn‚Äôt on the other team tonight
"I saw this exact story about Jae Crowder in Utah awhile ago. Can‚Äôt find the comment, but I was super bummed, cause I loved Jae. Seeing this comment and then your reply makes me feel a lot better."
"Giannis won‚Äôt struggle. His problem has never been finishin over packed paints, he does that at a high rate. You can‚Äôt stop him from finishin, but you can inhibit his drives.  That‚Äôs the reason Jae Crowder and Royce O Neal are by far the better options for Giannis than Rudy or Bam"
I remember my first Jae Crowder signing
Moe Harkless was supposed to be our Jae Crowder replacement but he doesn‚Äôt even get PT over literal G-Leaguers.  You could also say that Oubre‚Äôs brick tour at the beginning of the season was just as bad
"Though he absolutely makes up for it with his defensive intensity and gritty play overall, I‚Äôd have to say Jae Crowder. His shot selection is awful and is a huge team negative when he‚Äôs not hitting, and is exacerbated by the fact that he‚Äôll sometimes try to shoot his way out of a slump.   Also negative is his passing when defenders pick up deep beyond the three point line. He has a tendency to just throw the ball up for grabs which sometimes leads to easy transition buckets for the other team."
"That was a really bad bet by your buddy or he doesn't follow NBA super closely. Suns improving from Rubio to CP3, getting Jae Crowder, and dev of their young core/bench. Then everyone KNEW that the Mav's would have to nurse Zinger back to 100%."
"All I know is Refs were trash all night, but if CP3 and Jae Crowder aren‚Äôt arguing the call and Booker isn‚Äôt even contesting it...  Clearly something happened."
"Gary Trent, Jae Crowder"
"we also added jae crowder, shored up the end of our bench which has been huge, dario established himself as the backup 5 only starting in the bubble which was big for us, young guys are another year deeper into their development.   CP3 has absolutely been the biggest piece that pushed us into the next level, but there are definitely other factors."
"Honest question. When both playing at their best, who is the better defender: KCP or Jae Crowder?"
"And Jae fucking hated playing with LeBron in Cleveland because Bron demanded Jae resign himself to standing in the corner every single play in case he needed an outlet pass. He sucked the life and passion out of Crowder, two of the best features of Jae's game, which is why he was a shell of his former Celtic self and future Jazz self.  That shit is 100% on LeBron for mistreating and misusing his teammate."
"What the hell did Devin Booker say that every Laker on the court would look shocked and Jae Crowder would try to claim ""I said that"". Players only say that when they're 100% certain its gonna get their teammate tossed"
"Jae Crowder is really the definition of a team player. He just makes people around him better, and everyone seems to like him. Last year in Miami he really helped bring everyone together, and seems like he's doing a similar thing in Phoenix"
His own teammate Jae Crowder literally said he said something
"When Jae crowder is the voice of reason, someone has deeply fucked up"
I dunno but watch Jae Crowder when he hears it.
"He‚Äôs already been T‚Äôd up and you can see he says something to the other ref as he‚Äôs throwing the bounce pass. Look at Jae Crowder, he heard it too."
Every team that has Jae Crowder makes the finals
"- nah he's not, and he shouldn't unless we're deliberately trying to play 5-out. But not playing Allen/McGee as our Centers just isn't worth it at this point with how well they're both playing.   - We tried Love full time at the 5 to begin the 2017-2018 season, but it was a disaster defensively. Didn't help that IT/Jr Smith/a Jae Crowder that didn't fit/at times unmotivated LeBron shared the court with him.   - Your 5's should be able to defend PnR coverages decently (which he can't), roll to the rim (which he can't) and call out rotations"
That‚Äôs easy to find though.  Nothing you should spend big money on.  Also I don‚Äôt think Oladipo is any good anymore so I wouldn‚Äôt go after him to begin with.  A PF  is certainly important but he only has to be a Jae Crowder level PF really.
"Paul George   ‚ÄúAccording to ESPN.com's Jeff Goodman, the Celtics' draft-night offer included three first-round picks and two starting players, one of whom was Jae Crowder. However, the Celtics reportedly refused to include their 2018 first-round pick from the Brooklyn Nets or the Sacramento Kings/Los Angeles Lakers pick that will land in Boston through the Markelle Fultz trade.‚Äù"
Bradley is huge for us. He was our big off season catch to replace Jae Crowder
Wes Matthews is the dead mans Jae Crowder
"Yes. Murder/suicide as Kyrie drove off the edge of the world on his way to Boston.   Kyrie was traded to Boston in the offseason for Isiah Thomas who was subsequently traded mid season. Love was an absolute shell of himself and injured over a third of the season. George Hill, Jae Crowder, and JR Smith were major starters."
Jae Crowder
Jae crowder
"I mean he got the 76ers too with the fultz trade and also the thybul trade where he took thybul knowing the 76ers wanted him then drafted Williams who he wanted anyways. He also traded for Kyrie for a broken IT4, Jae crowder, anti zizic, a first round pick(Colin sexton) and a second. That in theory was a pretty go trade if Kyrie stays healthy."
"Versatility.  Great example was Jae Crowder in last year's playoffs.  Shot pretty well from 3. Has the size and ability to switch on defense. Would come up with rebounds.  He gave the Heat good effort whenever he was out there by doing several things pretty well.  As much as I love Giannis he's struggled a bit in the playoffs since he is a star but is a bit of a one trick poney on offense. He's worked on it this year, but versatility on offense would go a long way for him come playoff time.  Opposing players and coaching are too good come playoff time. If you have a weakness they will expose it during a 7 game series."
"So Cleveland traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose, and 2 seconds for George Hill and Rodney Hood? In retrospect I wouldn‚Äôt do that"
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúI know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that‚Äôs my mindset.‚Äù  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Art≈´ras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
"A few vet minimums could really help them. Aside from trading for Drummond which to me seems obvious, why not try Boogie Cousins for a bit. He won't cost anything. In the offseason they could have tried for Jae Crowder who would have been a great addition. You don't need stars, just some solid role players (eg. Joe Harris). John Collins clearly wants out of Atlanta, so how about taking him on."
"If you‚Äôre gonna give credit to anyone on the Heat team, direct it to Jae Crowder. That man guarded Giannis better than basically anyone ever, and blazed on the other end"
Jae Crowder
"I‚Äôm not scared if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have Jae Crowder.   Bam, Gasol, Kawhi, Horford, no! It‚Äôs mfing Jae Crowder who‚Äôs the Giannis stopper. AND he shots like 100% from 3"
"Jae Crowder. IT4, Jordan Clarkson, and Dee Wade üòé"
"Lonzos been good but inconsistent, Bledsoe is a fraud that hid behind giannis, and things dont go well when adams is your 2nd/3rd best player most nights. Cp3, mikal, Jae crowder, ayton, the goat 3twuan ...   But yeah I get it, just poking bc now you guys are turning into the ‚Äúhe shouldn‚Äôt be in bc of record‚Äù crowd that you hated. Good luck man"
8-0 in the bubble and would have made the playoffs if Ayton wasn‚Äôt suspended. That team didn‚Äôt have CP3 or Jae crowder yet and didn‚Äôt have Oubre or Baynes in the bubble
"Chris Paul deserves credit for making them home court contenders, but not playoff contenders. A lot of people argue that differential is a better indication of how good or bad a team is and Suns were actually [8th in the west last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/season/2020) having a positive differential for the entire year. Their starters were really good but their biggest problem was their bench and lack off backup PG. They got Cam Payne who played awesome and capped off their season with that 8-0 bubble run. Take this along with the natural progression of young players (Booker, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson) and pretty good veteran additions (Jae Crowder, Galloway, Moore). If they had the same team as last year I think they would have have been fighting for 8-6th range instead of the current 5th-3rd range. Chris Paul turned a borderline playoff team to home court contender."
"Shabazz Napier isn‚Äôt an nba starter and is riding Portland‚Äôs bench, Okogie has the worst catch and shoot 3pt% in the league 2 years in a row and is benched, Wiggins is Wiggins, culver isn‚Äôt an nba starter and had the worst shooting season for a rookie, roco is an nba starter. Compare that to Bam, without butler this year the heat have sucked and are the 11th seed. Last year Bam had: Butler, Jae Crowder who is a starter on the suns, Dragic who‚Äôs a quality starter, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro. Bam was also healthy and has lead the heat to an 11th seed in the east without butler. Your opinion is formed purely on narratives and not acknowledging roster talent.  Shut the fuck upüòÇ"
Thank you for Jae Crowder man
PG: Chris Paul SG: Khris Middleton SF: Jae Crowder PF: Rui Hachimura C: DeAndre Jordan
"Yeah he can kind of shoot, that's correct. We put way too much stock into one number to describe 3pt shooting ability - overall 3pt %. You can look at the [tracking stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628366/shots-dash/) \- he's shooting almost all of his 3's open. That's Jae Crowder/PJ Tucker shooting. Those guys can also kind of shoot and they only hit a decent looking % b/c teams leave them alone. They aren't used to shooting with guys anywhere near them and when good defenses come along (especially playoff defenses), they suddenly regress and we're surprised. We shouldn't be. There's so much more to whether someone's a ""shooter"" than one %.  I do think Lonzo would be good defensively. I just think his offense would hurt. It's another guy teams aren't afraid to leave open and he can't handle the ball effectively in the half court. What's his role in the 35 min he'd need? Just standing in the corner as the outlet for Embiid after he gets double teamed? This team finally, finally found some real shooting (and they're winning with it) and you want to dilute it?"
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."

"""Quote all the stats you want, I have my biases and don't care whether my anecdotal points are based on fact or just narrative and personal preference cause I can't find tangible evidence why Booker is better than Lavine. I also won't accept any other evidence because I have no answer for them and i'll resort to ""shaq tautology"" of ""ringz erneh"" - IsnautIgor that's what you sound like lol  The Suns were 26-39 (13th seed) last season before the bubble hot streak btw lol they were going nowhere until they brought in help in CP3, Deandre Ayton, Jae Crowder and the improvement of Mikal Bridges. Lavine has never played with anyone even close to the caliber of CP3, a guy who brought a team thats supposed to be tanking to the playoffs.... so you tell me who's the main reason the Suns are doing well this season lol"
"Kyrie deal: seemed fine on paper but Kyrie would get injured year one, choke year two and leave. Celtics end up giving up solid role player Jae Crowder and what would be dolin Sexton up for basically nothing. Great trade for them that just completely backfires  Rozier Kemba swap: Kyrie leaves you for the nets and Roziers in line for a pay day, what do you do, go get the clear upgrade and allstar kemba Walker. Now Walker has injury issues, and has been pretty bad while Rozier has blossomed into a better player than kemba and a star on the Hornets with a much cheaper contract. Meanwhile kemba now has one of the worst unreadable contracts making it even harder to get a better talent  Two obvious trades both backfire"
we have a completely different roster than last year. not resigning jae crowder did a number on us
"So our team with half the roster gone half the time, no suitable point guard, no suitable power forward, losing, proves that our team when healthy (when no one in the league has COVID) with all-star caliber Dragic and complementary piece Jae Crowder winning is just a fluke.   You guys fell on your head as babies."
"You have a good question.  I read a about sports psychology and development from time to time. This is an interesting ass topic to me.  I think the small improvements in handles requires the proper specific training, and a lot of work for smaller improvements. As you get better at something, smaller and more minute improvements are what you need to get to the next level but they still take a lot of hard work and dedication to learn.   I feel as if some athletes honestly are fine with capping off their skill level at something if they still are good at other things and will get paid regardless of how hard they work to improve on something small. Especially with age. Some players are fine with playing within their archetype. Why would Jae Crowder suddenly want to be an elite ball handler when he still makes money and has a comfortable amount of free time just doing what he does right now?   Or, some athletes never get proper training and don‚Äôt have that skill click with them as well as other athletes. Handles are gonna be hard to learn because everybody has their own specific body. Proper coaches and training staff which will help a player consistently develop is probably hard."
[2012 draft](https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2012.html) Had Draymond and Middleton both in the 2nd. That‚Äôs a couple all-stars.  Not much else apart from Jae Crowder and Will Barton.
Love Jae Crowder
Miami Heat misses Jae Crowder for sure.
You can‚Äôt do anything when Jae crowder is playing like that
Jae Crowder is a bonafide winner. A lot of dudes popped off in that quarter (here's looking at CP3 and DA and Cam Johnson) but Jae Crowder was huge
Jae Crowder was +29
"Wouldn‚Äôt say singlehandedly, Jae Crowder and Ayton played perfectly for parts of the 4th too"
Im actually gonna say Jae Crowder did just as much as CP3 in this comeback! Great game from CP though.
"Jae Crowder dropping 99 points tomorrow, confirmed"
Jae Crowder and Derrick Jones Jr. But that‚Äôs not the sole reason we suck this year
"They would have been better if they just payed brogdon who is better than Jrue at this point, Giannas is also the most overrated superstar in history, and the East got represented by a Miami team that is 11-17 right now with their only real roster attrition being Jae Crowder so the bucks again not impressive at all"
"I really don‚Äôt see them missing it, still. The pieces from last year‚Äôs team are still mostly there, the loss of Jae Crowder is big but not unfixable with a trade or two like they did last year. I predict they will eventually rip off like a 10 game winning streak and settle into a bottom 4 seed"
No but the biggest player acquisition between pre deadline and post deadline was Jae crowder. They‚Äôre probably missing him more than they expected Harkless is dust and the lack of real 4 is hurting them. Especially the Jae crowder who had that hot shooting stretch for a while that guy is a big boost that‚Äôs no longer there
"I mean, Kyrie as a number 1 isn't winning you a title. I think there's been enough shown to not argue that. Also, we didn't even break the bank and use a lot of good assets. We traded injured IT, Jae Crowder, and a pick that was considered not that great at the time for a guy with some health issues himself and off the court concerns. To me, that's not pulling the trigger, especially when you sit by and continue to draft several project players and are continuously reported to have ""almost"" traded for some proven talent."
Also Jae Crowder for us.
Losing Jae Crowder was huge
"yeah the heat's poor performance this season with COVID, injuries, lack of quality PF, lack of quality PG, constant rotation changes proves that  the bubble where no one had COVID and no injuries and had Jae Crowder and All-Star calibur Goran Dragic is illegitimate.  yall say the dumbest shit"
Trade Duncan Robinson and Nunn and a few first to get a guy like Zach Lavine. Add Rondae Hollis Jefferson since Jae crowder was a bigger void than expected.
Jae Crowder is now in the GOAT conversation.   Carried this bummy squad to the Finals.
Jae Crowder goated
I can‚Äôt escape people thinking Jae Crowder is good. Lu Dort after only 61 professional NBA games is much better than Crowder is or was.
He‚Äôs become a young version of say Jae Crowder with his now 3 and D abilities and the fact that he‚Äôs the best contract in the NBA(cause crowder had like 5/35)   Him and Shai are our current future. My hope is whoever we draft can be paired with Shai and Dort can be the Defensive anchor
It‚Äôs a stupid bet at best. Very good chance Winslow is never as good as Jae Crowder
"‚ÄúI bet on Jae Crowder over 4 three pointers‚Äù -Monty Williams, probably"
issue is Pat Riley didn't do shit to address the hole Jae Crowder has left. He wanted to gamble for Giannis and got caught with his pants down
"i‚Äôve been saying this! role players get on lebron‚Äôs team and just fold lmao, jae crowder comes to mind too. if lebron had this clarkson the cavs definitely win Game 1 of those finals at the very least"
Mans decked out Jae Crowder that one game lol
Like Jae Crowder for the past 6 years
"I‚Äôll never forget watching my boy Jae crowder absolutely destroy Drummond in college. There‚Äôs no way it should have happened when you looked at the matchup physically, but jae completely outclassed Drummond in every aspect of the game. Thought maybe Drummond would grow as a player but it seems he has not"
"The randomness of Jae Crowder in recent years has been so weird, dude is either a really good starter on a contender or a low end bench player that his fan base hate, there's no middle ground"
Jae Crowder - 100%. The man has thr confidence of an eternal Green Light with the consistency flashing yellow construction marker
"you do realize you're talking about the same coach that revitalized the careers of IT, avery bradley, jae crowder and evan turner. and flush away potential? the only season you can say that is the 2018-19 season. we overachieved in every single other season brad has coached us. he's overseen the developments of the jays and put them in a position to succeed. brad has his faults but player development is not even CLOSE to one of them"
"Jae Crowder has legitimately lived all over the country due to his job, lol.  How many teams has he been on now?"
From Eastern Champs to 9th seed. Jae Crowder is a baaaaad man.
"I feel like I've been on this corner for a while with LeBron: he's so jacked and powerful that shooting a stand-still, no-jump shot must feel awkward. And he has to stagger his feet to create a need for rotation so it feels normal. Jae Crowder is the same way but obviously not as fluid or transcendentally athletic so his stagger is even more exaggerated. I'm curious how Zion will develop as a free throw shooter because he's all touch, bad form right now at the line."
"Raptors get: Jae Crowder 2 first round picks (protected) and maybe a 2nd round pick if raps play hard ball  Suns get: OG Anuoby, Stanley Johnson, Patrck McCaw."
On one rebound I heard Jae Crowder yell for it then CP3 still jumped up and took it away from him.
I hate Jae Crowder so much lol
"You kniw what happens when you assume , you trade IT Jae Crowder and Colin Sexton for 2 years of Kyrie. Celtics with sexton would be looking so sexy right now"
Reminds me of Bucks fans that say the L2M report will show that Jae Crowder fouled Giannis. It didn't. Obviously the same refs that called the foul on Frank are the same ones that called the rest of the night with bullshit calls for Giannis. Honest fans that aren't deluded see this which obviously isn't you.
"I think Dray and Wiggins have both been more impactful than their BPM/VoRP would indicate (especially Draymond). But whether i agree with you depends on what you mean here by ""really good."" If you mean Wiggins is a solid starter now, I'm with you. If you think he is a borderline all-star, hell no.  [EPM,](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) which takes into account plus/minus data and is a lot fairer to defensive players, has Draymond ranked 82nd overall, and Wiggins at 101. (Steph is 5th, and first in offense).    I still think that underrates Dray, though it's impossible to accurately measure Dray when he's currently the only 5ppg 35% shooter in league history to be indispensable to his team's offense.  I do think the ranking is accurate for Wiggs. And it's not a slight on him. Wiggins has turned himself into a top 100 player in the league, which is to say, a solid starter(5 starters x 30 teams, 150 players). This is a major improvement over Minnesota bust Wiggins. Oher players with Wiggins relative impact right now are Jae Crowder, Justin Holiday, Joe Ingles--good role players. That's where Wiggins is, though he's being asked to do more for us because we're so offensively challenged.  If you want to bump him up a little because of his ability to handle second unit scoring responsibilities--albeit inefficiently--I could accept that. That leaves Wiggins as somewhere around the 90-100th best player in the league. If that's what you mean by ""really good,""  I agree with you. Wiggins is no longer a negative on the court and has become a legitimate role player.   He's a good 4th/5th guy on a contending team--think young Harrison Barnes--being asked to be Steph's offensive sidekick. I'm starting to like Wiggins along with the rest of this scrappy team, but Steph is still hard-carrying this shit"
Yeah jae crowder caught fire and that really helped but it the finals and in this season its obvious that Bam needs help in thr frontcourt
"Jimmy missed a month between injuries and Covid. They were complete shit without him, and are good, but not great with him. He's played at an MVP level since coming back at Covid, but they really miss Jae Crowder and the new additions (Avery Bradley primarily) suck. Dragic has been in and out of the lineup too, and Herro and Robinson didn't improve much from the bubble."
I continue to argue that Jae Crowder would have been the better choice.
"idk man. watch that clip a couple times. Crowder sees Giannis about to get the ball, he fronts between Giannis and the basket. Hands are up, they make contact, but crowder is not grabbing, pushing, nor is he reaching out to Giannis. simply bracing himself. he has the right to exist in his own space, defenders aren't supposed to stand there limply with their hands down. Giannis loses balance when Crowder moves off to the side and falls over. Jae intercepts the pass and that's it. at least jae was slow to completely move himself out. he could have been a dick and moved away sooner, which would have cause giannis to fall to the ground full force. watch the clip. slow the speed if you have to. not a foul."
Yeah because we should totally reward players for clamping down on opposition's arms. And Jae Crowder should totally not try to pull himself out of Giannis' armlock despite that being a huge risk to an NBA career. Are you serious right now?

Jae Crowder turned this game around. The rest of the Boyz secured the W
"I hated Jae Crowder before this season entirely due to the whole ""you hate playing against him"" phenomenon. Dude floors me with his IQ. He makes so damn many high IQ defensive plays and passes. At least once a game I'm super impressed by something he does"
Jae crowder
"That's not true. CP3 is a huge part of our success and no one will dispute it. We love him. It's just dumb when people say he single handedly turned our team around because it disrespects the improvement of Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Ayton, Jae Crowder impact etc. We just want our whole team to get credit for what they are doing"
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
Do you think if you replaced LeBron with Dame on last year‚Äôs Lakers team that the Lakers still win the title?  Or do you think it would take more of a swap of LeBron for Dame and a solid role player (like Jae Crowder) to have that team still be champions?
2012 one was the best one Ive seen in a long time  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Tomas Satoransky  Will Barton  Jae Crowder  Kyle OQuinn  Quincy Acy  Darius Miller  Mike Scott

"Yeah I think a series with CP3, Beverley, Rondo, Jae Crowder, and Marcus Morris might get a little chippy."
Jae crowder is clamping Kawhi
All my homies love Jae Crowder
"The Suns are still a playoff team with Rubio instead of CP3. James Jones contracted a deep and balanced team by getting Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, Cam Payne and Torrey Craig. Plus James Jones traded for CP3. CP3 is the difference between being around the 6/7 seed and being the 1/2 seed, but James Jones built this roster and hired Monty Williams. He deserves credit for what he's done, saying CP3 is the only reason for the Suns improvement is ignorant"
"Both him and Jae Crowder are absolutely dudes who frustrate the hell out of you when you are playing against them, but when they're on your team it's so awesome."

TJ Warren played 5 years for the Suns and in those 5 years he has never played more than 66 games in a year. TJ Warren gets paid more than Jae Crowder. If someone straight up said trade TJ Warren and a 2nd round pick for Crowder it would be an excellent trade to get rid of a player that hurts the salary cap so much. At the time it wasn't Warren for Crowder but Rubio who the Suns needed cap space for.
I agree that we miss more Jae Crowder toughness.
"Yup. Of course adding CP3 was huge, but James Jones hiring Monty Williams, acquiring Cam Johnson and Dario Saric, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig etc. Has given this team amazing depth and experience. This team can make a playoff run because of that"
Signing Jae Crowder was another solid move.
Soloman hill and Jae crowder also helped us get assets while also serving us clubhouse vets for all our young guys. Only iggy felt he was too important to show up
"That Charlotte Suns game last week, very 2nd possession Book gets mauled while in the air. Next play Jae Crowder returns the favor even harder. Nothing was called on both plays. These refs need to figure it out."
You‚Äôre flat out wrong. Jae Crowder definitely made the bigger impact but I don‚Äôt think any Heat fan would say Iggy ‚Äúcontributed nothing‚Äù he may not have been filling up the stat sheet but he played great defense and made plays on offense when needed. By the time the Heat got to Lebron and didn‚Äôt have Bam or Goran at 100% there was no chance at stopping him regardless of Iggy‚Äôs defense.
"* COVID took out Butler for some time. He has missed 15 games in total so far. That's almost 30%. He's needed for everything to work with the way the HEAT plays. * Avery Bradley was basically injured and unplayable for his HEAT tenure. He was supposed to be a key player. * Dragic also had a string of injuries for much of the season. He's still clearly not 100%. * Nunn was still not a 100% for like the first half of the season. The dude seems to be experiencing long COVID issues. * Moe Harkless was the Jae Crowder filler - he didn't pan out. Leonard got injured early and was out for the rest of the season. That left us with a a PF-C rotation of BAM - Kelly - Achiuwa. It should then be obvious how F'ed up that was.  * Because of the injuries, Herro and Duncan had to play a more active role together with Bam for like the first half of the season. Herro was forced to be playmaker, of which he was still not. Duncan lacked primary offensive threats which are needed for him to be effective. Look at them now when the HEAT are healthy, back to their old trusty role player ways.  There was a stretch when the HEAT was basically relying on Bam, Kelly, Duncan, Herro, Vincent, Strus, Achiuwa, and Silva. Pre-trade, it was Bam, Kelly, and Duncan who were the only available and consistent players for much of the season.   At the end of the day, the HEAT are victims of the COVID and injuries. Remove those, and they should have at the very least a strong hold on the 4th seed with the 3rd on a spitting distance."
"Chris Paul and Monty Williams bring that experience.  Jae Crowder too.  And Book is as competitive as they come, he‚Äôs been waiting for an opportunity like this."
"In 2018 - 19, Kyrie did. Man scored 37 and seemed unstoppable (also LeVert, Dinwiddie, Harris, and Allen helped out massively). Ja blocked him at the end of the 4th to send the game to OT. We beat y'all in OT with Ja pass to Jae Crowder for the buzzer 3 win for our first win in general and home win of the season. It literally was exactly how Villanova won the NCAA title back in 2016."
"Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince, and Kenneth Faried"
"They had a good run of this for years. Like 2015-18. IT4, Jae Crowder, Marcus Morris etc all left better players than when they came in. Jays and Smart in the draft obviously   Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been as good lately and it‚Äôs frankly one of the things holding them back this year they don‚Äôt have enough good players"
By the end of last year the Suns were really good as capped off by their bubble run. There is a reason Chris Paul and Jae Crowder wanted to be here.
Gimme Jae Crowder
"Thats where the top 5 defensive team in the NBA comes to factor in. Suns are just simply on another with 7.0 net rating. Got that switchable great two way players from Chris Paul to Mikal, to Jae Crowder, and Deandre Ayton."
"Jae Crowder and Olynk on the court, but neither of them wearing heat jerseys :'("
&gt;really sneaky good passer for a 3&amp;D guy.  Idk what it is about Phoenix but the other defensive wing whove Ive been surprised by his passing competence this year is Jae Crowder. Didnt see alot of this in the past but [At least a couple times a month](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/03/28/0022000703/47/120a6b0d-7555-aa58-0d29-7aa9e38633a9_960x540.mp4) he whips [out these no looks](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/01/01/0022000076/36/a5dd3d25-2102-670f-d3f2-8544b4fcffa5_960x540.mp4) and can [look off defenders](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/01/03/0022000091/60/ca3febe3-94ce-f1a2-8b57-9b31fdca8fac_960x540.mp4). Might be something Phx specific to some degree idk but it's surprised me a little. Bridges I think is quietly one of the best finishers in the NBA especially for a non lead creator.   Okeke can probably play the 3 or the 4 but from a team building perspective if you can get away with him playing the 4 often times that can be what's best for you. Okeke at the 3 I bet means alot of Okeke/Isaac/WCJ frontline the next few years which is just a worse version of the offensively inept lineups Orlando had before their trades.
I'd like to think guys like Jae Crowder and Trevor Ariza have a WhatsApp group where they trade rooms and rental contacts whenever they move.
"*checks notes*  Yes, the Celtics have indeed lost Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris in the last 5 years. Great observation man"
Jae crowder stays in luxury winnebagos and has a storage unit in 5 different states
PJ Tucker. Bc he's a badass. Jimmy Butler. Jae Crowder. D fox.
"If you are Jae Crowder, you rent"
"Guys like dame, Steph, and Giannis would buy a house. Unlike players like Jae crowder or Trevor ariza."
"I mean even someone like Jae Crowder might buy, cause he still makes really good money and he might have it as an investment if one cities real estate prices go up."
"This is the third person in this thread using jae crowder as the example, that's funny"
Even Jae Crowder is probably buying I'd guess. Not for all of his stops but I'd assume he bought in Phoenix. Just makes sense because you don't get anything back from renting.
Depends.    I doubt someone like Jae Crowder who seems to get traded every other year wouldn't buy a house.  Someone like Dame who probably won't ever leave the Blazers probably would.
"I‚Äôd assume it depends on your level. A franchise cornerstone like LeBron, Luka, Giannis, Trae, Zion, Shai, Tatum.. I‚Äôd guess buy a house. While someone like Jae Crowder might rent throughout most of his career."
Jae Crowder by far. He‚Äôs fine off the bench for some bench defense on a cheap contract. That‚Äôs it.
"Van Vleet‚Äôs newborn son commanding an army of Goran Dragic and Jae Crowder clones to attack every brewery in Wisconsin, mostly."
"K-Love, TT, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, old Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, young Ingram, young Randle, young Lonzo, young Kuzma, Rondo, and KCP... There are a lot of names there I would take over pretty much any of Steph‚Äôs current teammates apart from Draymond and maybe Wigs"
"These guys are obviously casuals lol. Let‚Äôs think of those IT teams... IT, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Amir Johnson, and Al Horford, with Smart, Jerebko, T. Zeller, 22yo Rozier, and 20yo JB off the bench.   Imagine saying ‚ÄúIT made Brad look way better than he is‚Äù with a roster like that haha. r/nba is filled with some of the dumbest people lol."
"Guys have hot shooting/outlier seasons all the time. Look at Jae Crowder on the same team. He shot 39% from 3 once, 38% 4 years later, and otherwise has never shot more than 34% from 3 for a season. Josh Ricahrdson shot a 46% from 3 for a fucking season and is now shooting 32%. IT had an astonishing offensive season based on complete outlier efficiency for his career with an entire team dedicated to highlighting him on offense and covering for him on defense. In terms of volume and efficiency it is totally unparalleled in his career. He suddenly went from a 57% TS guy to a 63%. From averaging 22 fga to 28 fga."
"Responding to a few comments here: I was aware that it had happened to a couple of college sports teams a long time ago, I meant more along the lines of a pro team.  When it happens to a college team, it's devastating for the community and the family and the fans of that team, but I'd imagine that a pro team would be a lot more impactful nationwide because all these guys are so well known at this point. I mean, just think of how many guys you've heard of on some random team. The Blazers or Suns or whatever. Players, coaches, staff. Beat writers. All gone, just like that.  Not to downplay these college tragedies. It's awful obviously. But the reason Kobe's death was so impactful to a bunch of random people was that he was a part of people's lives, everyone had heard of him, everyone had watched him play. Think of an NBA team. Most of these guys, we have memories watching them in college, going on a run in march madness, something like that. We follow them on social media. They've been traded from team to team, if a guy like Kyle Korver or Jae Crowder or someone was in a plane crash that's several fanbases who all have memories cheering for the guy. Coaches, same thing. Again it's a tragedy when it happens to any team but I literally cannot imagine the fallout if it happened to an honest to god NBA team."

"&gt;You‚Äôre acting like ‚ÄúGiannis being locked up by the wall‚Äù didn‚Äôt include multiple versatile all defensive players all focusing on a one man wrecking crew.   Jae Crowder is All-Defensive?  &gt;You don‚Äôt think Lebron cant be locked up by a wall in transition?  No, because he never has. He's been stopped in the halfcourt a couple times in his career, but that's it"
Jae Crowder and Goran Dragic
This time *we* have Jae Crowder.
I was expecting a 4/5th seed at best. Obviously we still have a bit of a season to go but I didn‚Äôt expect the Suns to be playing like this. Let me tell you Chris Paul plays winning basketball and I‚Äôm so glad we picked him and Jae Crowder up. Good for Booker to see that Phx can be a winning team.
PG - Joe Ingles  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jae Crowder  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Rudy Gobert  Basically a worse version of the current Utah Jazz. We'd likely be a 4-6 seed in the West this season and lose in the first round to the Lakers.
And Jae Crowder  Dudes shooting is all over the place but he is a consistent vet presence alongside CP.
"Not resigning TC after 2011  Not resigning TC after 2015  Trading down in the draft instead of drafting Giannis  Chasing Dwight Howard  Drafting DSJ instead of Mitchell   Trading our only backup C, starting PG, a 1st round pick and Jae Crowder for Rondo"
"&gt;TJ Warren for free  The most games TJ Warren played for the Suns was 66 games. He was hurt literally every year and usually multiple times a year. He has played 4 games this year so far. The Suns signed Jae Crowder with the same money. Would have hurt not having him this year as besides CP3, he brings a lot of experience, and a great 2 way guy."
Demarre Carroll Jae Crowder and Taurean Prince are all the same player
Jae Crowder just pulled off an incredible clutch performance ya love to see it.
"Who would have thought that adding Chris Paul to a good clutch player in Booker would actually make him worse in the closing stages of the game. I love Jae Crowder though, thank you CP3."
"Jae crowder to me is a 4 through and through. Same with Belly, PJ tucker maybe, or Kuzma?"
I would love to see suns vs Jazz in the playoffs. Suns are one of my favorite teams to watch outside of the Jazz. I miss Jae Crowder so much...
"I was at quite a few few those games that season he got traded, because the team was bad so tickets were cheap. They ended up winning 20 games that year. He really really really didn't want to be here, his body language was awful and you could probably see him checking the clock hoping this waa the last game before he got traded. He didn't want to be a part of the rebuild.   The trade also got us Jae Crowder and cleared the decks for Marcus Smart, who they tried at point guard until IT arrived."
"I would disagree. Suns needed cap space for Jae Crowder. I'm sure they would have kept him as a backup for Ayton and play Saric at 4 instead of 5, where he's really struggling as of late. Now that Lakers have two ADs and Gasol, it's gonna hurt watching Saric getting clobbered in the paint against the Lakers."
"Why do you think the Celtics also had to offer up:  * The 3rd Brooklyn pick (considered a top 3 lock at the time) * Jae Crowder (one of the best value contracts at the time) * Ante Zizic (a stashed first round pick that scouts were saying had developed into a lottery talent)  In addition to a guy who had just finished top 5 in MVP voting.  Healthy Isaiah was the better player. Yet the Celtics had to offer all these other pieces up.  &gt;why don't we see any major player or any franchise wanting to do business with the Celtics  First of all, Boston had issues with dealing with franchises way before Isaiah Thomas (Google how the league responded  to Reggie Lewis' death).  Secondly, we actually haven't had issues with dealing with other teams since the Isaiah trade. We just picked up a 20ppg scorer at a reasonable price using a historically large TPE we were practically gifted out of good will."
Goran Dragic? Bam Adebayo? Hell even Jae Crowder was raining 3's.
Someone do Jae Crowder now
"He played on the court with Cam Johnson and Jae Crowder, who shot a combined 0-15 from 3. They played just as bad to even it out"
Crowder could have got going easier if Brick Paul wasn‚Äôt chucking shots for himself and freezing Jae out until late in the game when he‚Äôs already cold

Suns.  Ayton Bridges Booker Johnson.  Johnson is rotating starting lineup with Jae Crowder.  But 4 and a good team with Chris Paul leading.
"Yeah from the few pels games against them ive seen  Hes one of those hustle types of players youd like to have on a contending team, like jae crowder-esque"
"I‚Äôd like to throw Jae Crowder into the mix for this title as well. Junior college to Marquette transfer, Unrecruited out of high school and has quietly churned out an extremely productive 10+ year career as a smart 3 and d player that had a shot at a ring with CLE but otherwise should be looked back at fondly and similarly"
I feel like Rudy gay can be a Jae crowder/Andre iguodala type contributor for a contender.
"honestly man, if it's any Sun, it's Devin Booker. lol He's awesome, but he's not on, like, Bradley Beal's level, much less a full blown superstar. I think he's good enough to be a leading scorer ona. championship team, I just think there's a good reason the team got better this year and it's a combination of Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul, and the addition of Jae Crowder. Chris Paul is a basketball genius, I don't care if he's only averaging 16 a game; hes influencing the game more than a lot of 25 ppg guys."
I feel that yeah they definitely had a bunch of dudes step up. That‚Äôs why it was a finals run and why they are so special. I don‚Äôt believe Jimmy carried them he was always the X factor I believe until he became the guy in the finals. Bam was spectacular against the Celtics but so was Herro. Jae Crowder was also shooting lights for the first two series specifically the bucks series.
"No they do not LOL. Again, I‚Äôm not talking about regular season Lebron. I‚Äôm talking about playoff Lebron where he is locked into every defensive coverage they will run to stop him. If you think Jae Crowder and Mikal Bridges can slow Lebron down...you gonna be in for a surprise if they meet LOL.  Notice how I didn‚Äôt even mention the AD factor. It‚Äôs nothing against the Suns, but you don‚Äôt go from perennial non-playoff team to championship contenders in one season with a bunch of players who‚Äôve never played in the playoffs."
"As a heat fan, We rely on Jimmy too much, If Bam develops a shot , and our younger guys like Herro, Nunn, and Achiuwa keep developing we would be in a much better spot. While we're on the topic, if we got better big defenders it would also help astronomically, like Why is Kelly Olynyk still on our roster, and the fact that we have him and Meyers leonard who is pretty much him but worse is stupid.  They space the floor, but aren't great at it, and the amount of layups i've seen Olynyk miss is insane. A guy like Robert Covington would be so much better, similar to Jae Crowder last year; has good defense and can knock down a 3. The height advantage by Leonard and Olynyk is pretty much useless because they are worse perimeter defenders in a 3 point/perimeter oriented league."
"The Nuggets, Heat and Celtics were all clearly suffering from a lack of health early on but everyone with common sense knew they'd pick it back up over time. People were convinced the Heat losing Jae Crowder as well as the Bubble being a fluke is the reason why they fell off when in reality it's simply because they haven't played together.  You could tell a bunch of butthurt fans who were salty about losing in the Bubble were eager to point to these teams as proof it was somehow fraudulent, so they latched onto this narrative early on. Now they've all gone quiet."
"lets be a little fair and also talk about jae crowder - i know he isnt some star like jimmy or cp3 but hes a good defender who knocks down shots and brings a veteran presence to a team, youre crazy if you dont think hes been a reason why miami started slower and phoenix is better this year"
can they get Jae Crowder back?he was perfect for the reverse zone defense that they ran all the time in the playoffs
"Such a dumb move to sign a C-tier big man instead of a wing, the Celtics would be much better if they went after Justin Holiday or Jae Crowder."
They could really use a guy like **Jae Crowder** that can guard a size up and is quick enough to defend on the perimeter   ^(/s but no really)
&gt; like just jae crowder  I still feel like that was a big loss.
yep that is true but Boucher/Dwight are good they can protect Montrez and Kuzma like the Lakers have Gasol/AD to protect them.   Hoping Satoransky and Ingles can likewise protect Lou and Clarkson.   McDermott should not be on here over Jae Crowder that was a bad choice in retrospect.
i mean who exactly did they lose again? like just jae crowder? If you are in a position to run it back basically while keeping the same core then do it.
"What you are missing here is that Chris Paul was not the only addition to the Suns this season. Compare the Suns bench from last year to now. Look at how players like Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric have taken significant leaps as contributors. Look at what newer additions like Jae Crowder and Cam Payne have brought.  I get that not a lot of people watched the Suns last year but it was a very different team in more ways than just Chris Paul. As for those 20 win teams, yeah, it's not a surprise that you win more with a supporting cast who can all legally buy alcohol."
"&gt; he traded them all away for Kyrie  Avery Bradley wasn't traded for Kyrie, he was traded to Detroit for Marcus Morris.   &gt; Remember how this sub treated the trade when it first broke out?  Are you trying to claim that with hindsight we should all feel like that was a good trade for the Celtics? Wouldn't you guys rather have Jae Crowder and Colin Sexton right now instead of having nobody? What did Kyrie do for Boston to make it seem like the consensus should be that that was a great trade for the Celtics? If anything I think hindsight shows that was a disaster."
"&gt; He got a great trade for Kyrie  I'm pretty stunned that any Celtics fans look back on the trade to get Kyrie and think of it as a great one for Boston. Kyrie was an absolute disaster for you guys. He was hurt half the time, only played in the playoffs for you one of the two years he was there, and was roundly mocked for playing so poorly in the one he did play in. Meanwhile you guys gave up Jae Crowder and the pick that became Sexton to get him, along with Ainge tarnishing his reputation for the perception that he stabbed IT in the back. It's *really* tough to look at the trade to acquire Kyrie and feel like it should be mentioned among the great wins Ainge has had as a GM."
There are more 20 ppg scorers in this league then there are elite wing defenders and winning is the ultimate value. You insult my examples but offer none of your own but there‚Äôs a reason Jae Crowder saw his value sky rocket in half a season and there is a reason everyone wants Bruce Brown now and no one can believe he was so easily available

Demarre Carol and jae crowder
Put jae crowder on that last for me... before he signed with the suns
Add my boy jae Crowder too
"You're a Nets fan, there is quite literally nothing you can say that will affect me because I know anything that we do wrong still makes us better than the Nets. Never will anything ever make me say ""damn, I wish we were like the Nets"". You are the laughing stock of the NBA and this bitterness you have towards the Celtics and its fans is extremely sad to watch. ""Fuck the Celtics"" being your initial response to a Randy fucking Foye buzzer beater win shows just how rent-free the Celtics are in your head. You're like an old ex-boyfriend gone alcoholic who still hasn't gotten over a break-up from years back and shows up at Christmas parties uninvited just to insult her new BF. You could move on with life, meet new people, get a nice job, put down the booze, etc., but you'd rather keep looking back in the past.

I could take a shit down the drain and still be more optimistic about its future.  Go back to irrelevance and entertaining Celtics fans some more. Giddy up"

He‚Äôs no Jae Crowder though
"Jimmy, Bam, and Iggy. If you say Iggy is washed, then Jae Crowder did just as well but not in name"
What if Kyrie never threw that lob and Gordon didn‚Äôt think he was Giannis?   What if Jae Crowder didn‚Äôt hip checked Gordon mid air?   What if LeBron just let Gordon go instead of contesting?   What if Kyrie didn‚Äôt turn out to be a nut head?   What if Gordon never had the fluke ass ankle injury in the bubble?   What if Gordon stayed this season and playing like he is now in Charlotte?   God damn so many Gordon ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù
"Would have to face the Cavs in the East still.  Kyrie, Joe Harris, Lebron, Jae Crowder, Tristan Thompson  Bench: Garland, Sexton, Wiggins, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Tyra Jones  Would probably beat y‚Äôall out"
Bam jimmy and the rest of the heat dont. But hey if you think jae crowder is why they did it then more power to ya
Jae Crowder looks weird this year man
"he‚Äôs been mad solid for us, we‚Äôd been looking for somebody to fill that Jae role all season and he is pretty damn close. not as good a defender but still a solid wing. like 90% crowder which heat fans are more than happy with"
Jae Crowder celebrates every 3 he makes more than Ray Allen did in Game 6.
"I dont think they will play either that much. My guess is theyll do what Miami and others have done in the past vs AD which is put Jae Crowder on him for a fair bit of time and in the 4th quarter put Ayton  on him. Dont think trying to match the Lakers with size does much good for them either.  Crowder on Marc Gasol or Harrell is also fine tbh, and if the Lakers really want to play Drummond big min I dont think that's exactly a disadvantage for Phx. Ayton is generally gonna have to play his best for them to have a chance in that series."
Jae crowder
"I've played a lot on a friends ps5 and that shooting kills me. He still has it on the default settings so maybe thats the problem? But yeah I will only shoot threes with a lights out shooter like curry or klay. Guys like jae crowder have no business being on my team since I cant hit shit with them.    In turn, I am basically stuck playing as the center on defense. Getting to the rim is soooo important, and the computer is constantly dragging the center out of position. So I spend my whole time on defense trying not to get a 3 second call. Even if I am out of position and they get the ball to their center who is unguarded, the controls aren't fluid enough to put the ball up right away so I can pretty much always recover.    It turns into this weird game of each players defense just being a constant effort to make sure the AI center isn't being a fucking idiot, but also looking to make sure the help on the corner isn't stupidly standing in no man's land- to far to contest the 3 and only close enough to the rim to foul but not contest"
"They got Jae Crowder out of that deal, just ended up trading him too"
Maybe they just have a lot of faith in Jae Crowder
"Kerr taking Bazemore off in the 4th after Phoenix hunted him 3 times was a delight to see  Also, Ayton has to GOT to be more aggressive. He had a BBQ Chicken buffet waiting for him  and why does Jae Crowder turn into playoff Horry whenever he plays the Warriors?"
KEKW yea bro just like tonight. Frank Kaminsky and Jae Crowder will be ready come playoff time tho they are not players you want to fuck with
"I was thinking y'all would be gassed too so I wasn't too hopeful. The exhaustion from last nights game really showed at the 3, and Jae Crowder was terrifying, but neither of those could stop motherfucking Wiggins."
"After y‚Äôall‚Äôs comeback last night I was sure we‚Äôd be gassed and Curry kinda was but guys like JTA and Wiggins and even Bazemore played quite well. Defending D Book is a difficult job and they did it well enough to secure the win. Jae Crowder was just killing my heart every time he shot a three, dude was money"
That's what happens when you play the legend known as Jae Crowder.
Oh shit LMAO I forgot we were playing. Ignore me plz going to watch the game now  Edit: getting destroyed by Jae crowder lol what a time to be standing up for our perimeter defense
"I mean Chris Paul has helped Phoenix a fuck ton and Jae Crowder has helped a little too. Minnesota is definitely playing solid basketball right now but no guarantee it carries over, still need to upgrade parts of the roster."
"Who we gonna bandwagon this playoffs? Feeling like the Suns are pretty good looking. They have Jae Crowder, Devin Booker needs more respect, Chris Paul has somehow morphed into a likeable veteran who deserves a ring, and their fans are some of the few who don't viscerally hate our franchise and would probably welcome us (I think)"
"No contract hes gonna make is gonna make me blink an eye. He‚Äôs that good. I love the defensive wing rotation the Suns have worth Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Jae Crowder"
"&gt;That doesn't matter. They don't need good vets to get better, they're trying to build organically. No good vets are coming anyway because it's Oklahoma City. Just like they don't come to Washington or Phoenix or Minnesota.  I mean they brought in CP3 and signed Jae Crowder who has been one of the biggest reasons for their dominance this year. Like no one wanted to sign with us last off-season because no one believed yet in the KAT/D'lo/Ant pairing. We whiffed on Derrick Jones Jr. and Paul Millsap btw.  So yeah until the Thunder proves they can win again they won't be considered a FA destination for vets."
"I really wish the Lakers had picked up Jae Crowder before he went to the Suns. I just feel like he could‚Äôve given the Lakers what they‚Äôve been looking for in Harrell, Gasol, and Drummond."
Jae Crowder  Dario Saric  CP3  Shall I go on?
Wym? Jae Crowder and Frank Kamininsky can absolutely hold LeBron to 29/9/8
"Let's go inside the mind of an AD..boobeleydoboop. ""Jae crowder, one of the hardest flopping safeties in the league...I put the team on my back doe!""  ""Fuck you gumby!"""
Also one of the biggest reasons Utah moved him the season before.   You can't trust Jae Crowder to consistently hit his threes.
[He was traded along with Jae Crowder](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2693564-report-cavs-trade-former-nba-mvp-derrick-rose-to-jazz-in-3-team-deal.amp.html)
No I meant in terms of ultimate goal like how you referenced Jae Crowder. melo‚Äôs ultimate goal would be to match his number too since the double-zero is 100
"You're right I haven't seen that in a minute. And yeah, it almost looks like Jae Crowder be hooping in a full body suit üòÇüòÇ."
"Dude is nowhere close to being well known, but Justin James on the Kings recently has been rocking an armband on his leg. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone do that in a minute.  Jae Crowder is almost mummified, has an accessory covering every inch of his body except for the head"
"A first rounder, a second rounder, the broken shell of Isaiah Thomas, and Jae Crowder for an all-NBA level point guard who wanted off his current team was by no means a ""risk."""
"Fuck that man I want everyone talking trash. I want Ricky Rubio talking shit to Chris Paul. I want Jae Crowder threatening to home invade a Lopez brother. I want Embiid to catch and chug two milk shakes, Stone Cold style, right before he goes on a monologue of hate to Jahlil Okafor. I want the Clippers to raise a Joe Ingles pinata before every game."
Imagine #99 Jae Crowder.
Jae crowder was mad af all game. He got a tech. I think he is still mad at Payton for pushing him last season (or the year before?). Thats why I'm glad randle did it to him again before the game ended lol
"Yes. Led the Celtics to a 1st seed while avging 29 ppg while having a worst cast around him than current celtics. IT had avery bradley, jae crowder, horford and smart lol"
"The Celtics had some lineups with Amir Johnson(91) and Jae Crowder(99) a few years back, it's the only time I can remember two players with numbers in the 90s playing together"
"Jae Crowder played in the finals last year, and Torrey Craig went to the conference finals."
How is Jae crowder relevant to this video
Jae crowder is the fakest tough guy in the league dude.  Also Thibs would go to war for Taj &amp; DRose.
"The Suns are not a team you wanna see with the game close in the 4th, the way they can flip the switch is special. And their defense makes it to where they‚Äôre in that situation often.  Shout out to Jae Crowder, he wouldn‚Äôt be very high on my ranking of shooters on this team, but I wish the rest of the wings shot it with the same confidence."
"Cam Payne is a difference maker on a top NBA team, Jae Crowder is underrated, Ayton is the monster under everyone's bed"
Question for suns fans.  Does jae crowder usually shoot this well?
"I went to Marquette while Juan played there, crazy to think how much he's grown as a player when he didn't get a bunch of minutes with Buzz as coach. Never would have thought Jimmy Butler nor Jae Crowder would have had the success they have now either. Congrats to Juan!"
"Attributing that all to him isn't fair though. Most of their young core has improved a lot and are having career years, every time I watch them Jae Crowder hits like 6 threes or bridges does something nasty.   Obviously he improves the team as any elite player would, but I think everyone knew that team was going to be a lot better after what they did in the bubble.   Great season but mvp talk is a bit much imo."
Grizz are a super young team.  Probably could use a veteran like Jae Crowder
"I feel like CP3 definitely deserves some credit but people are somehow forgetting that this team was already showing signs of being on the rise with the bubble. There was definitely an outlook post-bubble where the Suns could've been a 4 seed team based on the signs they showed. Additionally, while it might seem insignificant compared to the CP3 addition, a lot of people are overlooking the Jae Crowder signing. Jae is the definition of an impact player"
"Let me follow on from this point. A lot of people's history of the Thunder goes like this: Young Promising Team - Harden traded - KD Leaves - Westbrook never gets out of the first round. The reality is so much more nuanced than that.   People fail to understand that the Thunder were ran to make a profit in the franchise's early years, OKC did not have a billionaire on board who could stomach financial losses. The billionaire came later in 2014/5 in the form of George B Kaiser. It is one of the reasons why the Thunder were so risk-tolerant in the Westbrook-PG era, they had the muscle to deal with losses.   You can debate whether the owners are right or wrong to run the team like this until you're blue in the face but the fact remains that the NBA retroactively applying the Rose Rule to Durant's extension hurt massively. The increased max meant that the Thunder would hit the repeater tax year after year if they chose to pay KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka. The Thunder could have amnestied Perkins but getting to the Finals required an elite interior defender who could match up with Duncan. It is not as cut and dry as it is made out to be.  Furthermore, the Harden trade was not solely about money. Money was a big factor but the Thunder held concerns about Harden's partying habits. Harden partying during the NBA Finals was not a good look and did not benefit the team against a tough, veteran Heat team. Moreover, Harden wanted a bigger role and this would have been unlikely in OKC. Harden would have hit RFA in 2013 and posed serious questions about the Thunder's ability to retain his services. It is still a stupid trade but you can understand some of the justification of the decision to trade Harden.  Post trade was an injury-ravaged spell. The 2013 team won 60 games and looked to be a better side that the year before. Patrick Beverley inexplicably ran into Russell's knee in the playoffs and that was a year gone. In 2014, Ibaka was injured against the Spurs and those fine margins make all of the difference. In 2015, KD suffers a Jones Fracture and OKC miss the playoffs entirely. 2016 was the only time that the Thunder were fully healthy and we saw what the Thunder were capable of.   The Thunder's failure to win a championship was pretty poor in the last decade but the team went to 3 Conference Finals, an NBA Finals and made the playoffs nine times. The reality is that the ceiling for small markets is lower than big markets. The Spurs are the only small market team in the last 20 years to win a championship.   When you look at all of these conditions, the Thunder were pretty successful.   I haven't even mentioned the failed Chandler trade in 2010 which would have changed the calculus for the Thunder. Tyson Chandler would have meant no Perk and Jeff Green staying.   OKC could have blown it up after Durant left, Presti did field calls for Russ and was close to a deal with the Celtics. The paperwork was filed with the league office but he got cold feet and worked on a max extension for Russell. That trade was something like Jae Crowder, Olynyk and the Celtics' pick in 2017. If that trade happened, the Thunder would have been in a painful rebuild.   The Thunder and Russ did the best with the hand they were dealt. He probably won't win a ring but that's life."
"Honestly last year I felt like Jae Crowder was hitting every single three against us and turning up. I don‚Äôt see anyone on the heat who had that fire as a role player to step up and Hero being injured doesn‚Äôt help either. I still feel like this current heat team would still give Nets a challenge, Bam and Jimmy were so good on both sides of the floor"
No bias here either. They should trade Sabonis to Phoenix for Dario and Jae Crowder.
"Yeah the whole team seemed off tonight. B2B have been hit or miss, we usually play up or down to competition. It is also very late into season and we have pretty rested players 0% of time because all games are close. Duno if some tired legs or what. Jae Crowder and Dario Saric being out is not wonderful either. Really hurts interior."
"Lol if they purposely tank and still lose the pick to Orlando, their GM will look like a jackass. After making a trade like Chi did you wanna end the season looking competitive and creating positive vibes , especially if the team is targeting FAs for the offseason.   Phoenix had a nice 8-game run to end last season and it did a lot for them internally and helped recruit FAs like Jae Crowder (also the FO learned they were a better team without Kelly Oubre)."
A massive part of it is how genuinely awful Bledsoe was. He was our third option and a borderline all star in the regular season so when he goes completely ice cold it‚Äôs a big loss and he became a liability to even have on the floor. Another big part of it is how hot Miami and Toronto‚Äôs shooters got. Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell were absolutely unguardable in our series. Same with Tyler Herro and even Jae Crowder in the Miami series. I‚Äôm just saying you have to look at things with context because a lot of things that caused us to lose are not the norm whatsoever
Haha Jae Crowder rocking the green pajamas tonight
Good role player with some potential. A Jae Crowder in the making.
That Cam Johnson dunk in OT was sooooo damn filthy. Jae Crowder reaction on the bench had me rolling
Yeah because everyone and their mother knew by the start of the season Harden wanted out of Houston.  Utah I honestly thought we‚Äôre gonna be the 7th or 8th seed.  I had PHx with Denver and Portland but I trusted historical precedence that Chris Paul can lead any team to a great record especially if he‚Äôs playing with another All Star.  Plus I thought Jae Crowder was a sneaky good move.
for like 10 games Drummond was low-key good and seriously playing the best defense a Cavs big has played in some time   and then he just turned into the worst player on the court. dude was like 18/14 and he was making clutch steals and protecting the rim and even made some nice passes. then he just made every single player around him worse. it‚Äôs like if cavs era jae crowder and first year jordan clarkson had a baby
"Who would form the wall / be Giannis's primary defender? Last year Jae Crowder played a big part of that , with Bam and Jimmy mostly, and I could be wrong but I don't think there's anyone to fill that Crowder role very well.   Also, Giannis's playmaking and decision making has definitely improved against the wall this season, so I'm not sure the straight up wall defense will be as effective this time around."
"Hmm. Not Jokic, Not Embiid, Not Gobert, recently not AD, not deandre, or Brook Lopez, not Vucevic...I don't watch ayton, randle, or capela enough.   Maybe jae crowder"
"Y‚Äôall were revitalized by the additions of CP3 and Jae Crowder. It rounded out the starting 5 with the pieces you had in place.   You got CP3 because Booker is lethal score. You got Crowder because CP3 came.   It had nothing to do with the bubble, which is my point. PHX is a good team now because of development and acquisitions; not because of the momentum that started in the bubble [LOL]."
"Stjll not a role player. Klay is a certified all star, the second greatest shooter in history. How can you call him a role player ? Jae Crowder is a role player, it's def not Klay.   I got your point tho. Klay would be valuable for this all time squad."
"I don't care that he's not in our team anymore, or that he wasn't on our team for long. Jae Crowder."
"All the conversations about Booker and Paul, while such little mention of the team having DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, and Cam Johnson all playing extremely good basketball is what's truly been funny. This team has an elite supporting cast around their top 2.  I think that is the reason Phoenix does not need two guys, and I think CP3 brings a bit more to the team and that is reflected in the impact metrics. If Booker goes down, you trust CP3 to pick up the scoring or get a guy like Ayton more shots and more involved. If CP3 goes down, you lose a great defender and your main playmaker."
"Suns -  Suns first championship  CP3 wins one at 35  Suns win chip after missing POs for a decade  James Jones turning around the franchise in just 2 years.  Devin 'injury replacement allstars' Booker rise from empty stats player  Cam Payne from out of league to 6 man on a championship squad  Monty Williams choosing Suns over Lakers, and for good reasons  Jae Crowder in the Finals once again, this time on the winning team  Draymond Green saying Devin Booker should get his ass out of Phoenix"
"The nuggets, clippers and lakers will win a 5 -6 game series against the suns? is that on the basis of past seasons and past playoff success? If thats the basis, I see why you have a preconceived notion about the suns just because they missed the playoffs for 11 years...    We are talking about the CURRENT TEAM the way it is assembled, a huge chunk of which was there when they went 8-0 in the bubble and beat the nuggets, lakers and clippers in what was a playoff type like atmosphere, as well as a team this season that only GOT BETTER with a playoff veterans such as Jae Crowder, who STARTED in the NBA Finals just last year with Miami, and Chris Paul who we know has gotten his fair share of success in the playoffs and may have had the closest chance of winning it all with the rockets if he hadn't gotten injured...   As of today, this team will play either Golden State or San Antonio in the first round, two teams they have beaten easily THIS SEASON.    In the second round, they will be facing either the Lakers or the Nuggets, and based on their past games this season, they've had more trouble with the Nuggets than the Lakers (which they beat by 17 points), of which they've lost back to back overtime games (the second a double OT game which they should've won if they called a travel on Jamal Murray for his game tying shot to force the first OT) after winning the first contest.  This means that they've never been blown out by either team, and actually blew out the Lakers this season.    But let's assume the original premise of the post and that the Lakers don't get past the suns (if not the nuggets).  I see them having a chance at beating the nuggets, especially since Jamal Murray, who does the most damage against them, is out right now and may not be fully healthy by the time the playoffs come around.  That is the reality which we have to consider, which means the suns have an even better chance at beating the nuggets which they've had close games with this season.   I see that going the distance to 7 games...which favors the Suns due to the quality of the bench that I was talking about a few posts up.  Then the Suns will only have to beat either the Jazz (which they swept), or the Clippers or Mavs.  They already swept the Mavs this season 3-0 so the Suns can pretty much win a 7 game series against them.  The clips they just beat recently, and have a nice rivalry going with them (they also have not been blown out by the clips and been competitive in all their games with them..., and not to mention beat them at full STRENGTH with Kawhi and PG in the bubble, and WITHOUT Chris Paul), so I don't see you saying that the Suns get beat in 5-6 games by the Clips.  Perhaps a competitive 7 game series where it goes to the last game and becomes a toss up in the end, but the point being is that the Suns have a LEGITIMATE chance to beat any one of the teams you just mentioned based on their play THIS SEASON alone, and even more so if you include last season's 8-0 bubble performance.   They are hungry after not being in the playoffs and if the 8-0 bubble is any indication of a playoff atmosphere (which I believe really was), the Suns will not buckle under pressure (and haven't the entire season thus far), and will remain focused until the end. I say minimum Western Conference Finals, and if they win that, NBA Champs..."
"Somehow had Isiah Thomas, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, and Jae Crowder, a weird fucking injured mix of malcontents.   Then trade them for Clarkson, Nance, George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jeff Green, who all promptly have their talents stolen by the Mon-Stars."
I mean.. in Cleveland Bron had to teach Jae crowder how to catch n shoot properly
Ayton and Booker both saw a decrease in their stats in both raw numbers and FG%  Mikal Bridges improved by 4ppg and had a + .04% on his 3-shot  You know why they're winning? CP3 and Jae Crowder.  Homegrown my ass lmao
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"You're joking? Leaving aside Klay with injury, there's still Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart, mikal bridges, Covington, Danny green, OG Anunoby off the top of my head."
"I mean... Ayton was healthy and GREAT this year, Booker is still *very* underrated in my opinion, and they also got Jae Crowder who's basically the textbook 3&amp;D player."
It was actually very similar to the Suns last year. Riddled with injuries. Up and downs. Made a strong push at the end (winning 7 of their last 8 vs going 8-0 in the bubble). And why does no one mention Jae crowder as an additional piece added this summer?
"You could copy paste this post, and replace Jae Crowder for Chris Paul and make most of the same arguments.  Jae Crowder even led his last team to the NBA finals."
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
"Assuming Jae crowder gets healthy, I really think we won‚Äôt go under 9 players. We will have to play saric as backup 5, cam Payne, cam Johnson, and Torrey Craig have been too good not to play. I think that‚Äôs our core."
The Jae Crowder Condition
"Last year we were solid and young, got hit by ayton suspension. Young guys got another year to develop, everybody got a second year in montys system, filled out the roster with guys like Jae crowder, cp3 tied it all together and brought them to the next level. We‚Äôre a top 5 defensive team and a top 10 offense. Cp3 and book kill teams on the pnr, team is filled out with good catch and shoot wings like mikal bridges, can Johnson, crowder"
The Jazz really miss Jae Crowder right about now.
Yeah luckily we have Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder this year instead of Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender.
"Team ‚ÄúJM‚Äù:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team ‚ÄúRH‚Äù:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team ‚ÄúJC‚Äù: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team ‚ÄúLD‚Äù:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
didnt Jae Crowder try to come at Book on social media after and book just responded 'you can't guard me'. Baller move for sure
didnt Jae Crowder try to come at Book on social media after and book just responded 'you can't guard me'. Baller move for sure
That team added KG and Ray Allen. This team added Chris Paul and Jae Crowder
Jae crowder
Wow. That's pretty amazing. Kind of interesting that they had to get KG and Ray Allen to do this while the Suns got Jae Crowder and 35-year-old CP3.
"The Jae Crowder effect. He needs to feel disrespected by facing guys that make more money than him. If they make less, he‚Äôs chill."
"Also guys like Jae Crowder, Nance, Cam Johnson, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes."
"Yeah, we added Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Torrey Craig on top of not losing Ayton.  Add Crowder/Craig/Payne/Ayton to any team and they improve a ton.  Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson are playing amazing this year as they have another year under their belt.  I'm not saying Paul isn't making us better, he obviously is, but people acting like he is the sole reason why we are good this year are ignorant at best.  Incredibly young team.  If we just ran it back, we are probably around 5th or 6th this year in the west."
Yeah I'm sure he wants out after we... *checks notes* went 8-0 in the bubble and then signed Jae Crowder and traded for Chris fucking Paul
"Jae Crowder was just in the finals, do not forget him. Also some of the rotation players were in the playoffs before. Book, Bridges and Ayton obviously new to this."
"They could win against any team that isn't the Lakers. I don't even care about CP3 Booker or Ayton. Doesn't matter. They could sign prime Jordan Bird Magic Duncan and Hakeem it still doesn't matter. As long as they have Jae Crowder on the roster, Lebron James will find some way to thoroughly embarrass the Suns in some fashion or another. Jae could sit out the whole series and Lebron will still find a way to hit a 3 in his mouth from the bench and maybe even dunk from out of bounds if he stretches a bit before.   But I like their chances against other teams."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

"The clippers were missing Kawhi, Serge Ibaka and Patrick Beverly. Do you think Jae Crowder and Saric are even remotely close to who the clippers were missing?"
Marcus Smart  Bruce Brown  Jae Crowder  OG Anunoby  Robert Covington
"Joe Harris, Jae Crowder, Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green"
Jae Bossman Crowder. No bias I'd say Jordan Clarkson.
Jae Crowder
"Dedmon is looking to join a pantheon of elite mid-season Heat acquisitions up there with Birdman and Jae Crowder if he keeps this up. 18 pts in 16 minutes, and just plays big and gets rebounds.  Good bounce-back win after a crappy loss vs Chicago."
Ya if we were talking about the Warriors best player (Andrew Wiggins) and Kyrie then that would be interesting. MVP ranking right now is:   1) Cam Johnson (18 RPPG)  2) Kyrie   3) Wiggins  4) Jae Crowder  5) Theo Maledon  6) Paul Millsap
"You‚Äôre insane if you think that‚Äôs consistent with what refs have called this season. Literally just last week Jae Crowder smacked De‚ÄôAaron Fox across the head and there wasn‚Äôt even a foul called. And to address your statement about ‚Äúthe rules,‚Äù a flagrant 2 is defined as defined as ‚Äúunnecessary and excessive contact.‚Äù Obviously, Boban got a piece of his head so it‚Äôs automatically a flagrant, which is fair enough.   However, it‚Äôs literally a missed block. In most cases such as this, refs typically try to decide if there was malicious intent due to the grey area between a F1 and F2. Bobi is last person on the plant that was intentionally try to hurt someone.  This is a flagrant 1 at most."
Lol Jae Crowder whacked Fox in the head and didn't even get a foul called
Current NBA starters and star players only:  Jokic - Crazy Eastern European vibes and pressed Jae Crowder mid game that one time.  Derozan - grew up in Compton and had affiliation to the crips I think  Giannis - absolute tank of a man in his prime.  Westbrook - crazy work ethic and way too much pride to get dropped by anyone  Harden - idk why I just feel like he‚Äôs secretly got hands
"I‚Äôm with u mang, Suns underrated.  CP, Book, Ayton and Jae Crowder all underrated."
if the clippers win lets see him be tough versus sun tough man jae crowder
Jae Crowder.
"I think he can still go for another year or two. Just has to be on a legitimate title contender. Sucks Spo burned him out at the four so much this year to try and replace Jae Crowder. It did work for more than a few games, especially during Miami‚Äôs final stretch of the year. But the Bucks‚Äô front-court was just too overwhelming."
"Jae Crowder for Finals MVP, fight me"
It's gonna come down to Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder.  When they lost the two games in LA those guys were ice cold. When they started hitting their shots the Suns were able to win with a banged up CP3.
"Obviously very biased, but give me Ayton and Jae Crowder. Ayton provides everything Capela does, and Jae spaces the floor at an elite level. Pair super well with our two allstar guards"
"I feel bad for Jae Crowder .. (haha) .. But serious, I feel bad for Monty Williams. That‚Äôs the only reason I wanted the Sun win it all."
"Gosh, it would be terrible if someone's opinions were ""extremely heavily influenced by reputation"". Someone like that would probably make claims that weren't backed up by reality - definitely want to avoid being one of those people.  In totally unrelated news, here's what advanced stats say about Lebron's defense this year  * 18th in [DEPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), between Marc Gasol and Rudy Gay * 26th in [DRAPM](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=-2146555570), between Duncan Robinson and Brad Wanamaker * 40th in [Real Plus-Minus](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), between Steven Adams and Jae Crowder * 92nd in [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/), with the same rating as Jokic and John Collins * DWS tied for the lowest of his career * DBPM below 2.0 for the fifth season in a row  Interesting.  &gt;awards that are extremely heavily influenced by reputation  Wait...you you actually think that *Lebron James* hasn't been named to an All-Defensive team since 2014 because of a lack of reputation? That's delusional. His reputation (well-earned because of those late Cavs/early Heat years, when he was one of the best defensive players in the league) is basically the entire reason why stans keep insisting he belongs in these conversations despite the fact that he hasn't actually been an All-Defensive level player in years.  &gt;I recommend actually watching the games  [**The people who vote on NBA awards**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1KMzwRcilLDej0BWl7eYE_OYC9Tx9olI_Ptn-nHjKfpQ/htmlview) **are literally employed to watch the games**, and not just the ones involving the player they stan. Basketball is their career. They haven't put Lebron on an All-Defensive team since 2014 because he has not been one of the best defensive players in the league since 2014. Other than that, great comment."
"Well damn, the premiere Finals matchup is gonna be Jae Crowder vs Jeff Green."
This may be the most ass playoffs of all time   Finals is gonna be best of 7 games of Joe Harris vs. Jae Crowder one on one
I'm here for a Jae Crowder FMVP
"Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson, Derrick Rose, and Jae Crowder lead by a GOAT is not a trash team. Just because they were misused by the Cavs doesn't make those players bad."
Yeah I don't really care what other people think my own opinion isn't gonna be changed because Jae Crowder said something on TV lmao  Why do some fans think players are inherently basketball geniuses just because they play the sport?
J. Haris is overrated. I will take Jae Crowder any day before him
"I‚Äôd rather have Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikhail Bridges, Jae Crowder and Deandre Ayton."
"DeRozan was as good as you were gonna get though. The stars traded around then got some bad deals. PG who was still respected got traded for Oladipo and Sabonis, Kyrie got traded for Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder, and Butler got traded for Covington and Saric."
Jeff Green aka Jae Crowder aka Sometimes Steph Curry
"DA is the most underrated and disrespected player left in the playoffs and its not even close.   Hes capable of way more than his box scores show and thats not an indictment, he has willingly accepted the role that helps the team be the best it can be, dont let that wash over you.  I get if you just check box scores how you wouldn't see the impact he has on games, but the midrange looks Book and CP get are solely due to the gravity created by DA.  A majority of their unassisted 3pt looks come off a DA Screen.  His role gravity pulls defenders off corner opening up Jae Crowder and Mikal for open looks.  He is the true catalyst of the suns pick your poison offense.  His hands are solid and his off ball defense, help defense and ability to switch is elite.  He understands the exact moment to take a step up that limits a driving guard and forces them to either take a contested floater or make a tough entry pass to the big, he consistently finds the middle point of those 2 options and makes that decision tough on the guard.  He rarely fouls currently averaged 2.7 Fouls per 36 in the playoffs and has the ability to play upwards of 40 impactful minutes.  And on top of all that hes an INCREDIBLE teammate, who consistently puts others before himself.  I could go on for hours about what DA means to this suns team."
Jae Crowder as MVP would make my heart smile. As long as they print the text on the trophy in ALL CAPS.
"I‚Äôm sure conditions that were the exact same for both teams contributed more to our loss than you signing a top 25 player in basketball and us losing Jae Crowder. The mental gymnastics you‚Äôre doing to make The Bucks the victims here are Simon Bikes-like. I am happy with our finals run last year, and annoyed that we got worse as the Bucks got better, and are being called frauds because there was a different result when two completely different teams faced off (seriously. Everyone‚Äôs talked for years about how great and under appreciated Jrue Holiday is, and then the second the Bucks beat the Heat they acted like he doesn‚Äôt exist so they can push their ‚Äúbubble frauds‚Äù narrative in order to reconcile with their team‚Äôs lack of postseason success last year)"
Yeah Lebron was killing it going 11-26 his last game üòÇ. Shit was sweet when he was backing down Jae Crowder and smiling while doing it right? Next thing you know they lose 3 straight ü§£.
Either that or surround him with rangy defensive wings like jae crowder
"impact stats that have jae crowder as a better player than tatum. i just don't think impact stats are that useful, i don't use them to prop my guys up either."
That‚Äôs the Jae crowder special
"&gt;I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the short offseason.   We'll soon find out. Whoever makes the Finals this year will only get about 2-3 weeks longer in the off-season than last year's Finals teams did. If the Suns are one of those teams I wonder how Chris Paul will hold up next year, or Jae Crowder after consecutive short off-seasons.   In any event, I don't think it's merely a coincidence that none of the four conference finalists from last year won any games outside of the first round this year."
*Jae Crowder face*
"I like how they‚Äôre constructed, can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt been more exposed in the paint when Ayton goes out, they don‚Äôt have a rim protector outside of him and Jae Crowder apparently"
"I really hate all of the players that shoot, then fall to the ground as if they were pushed or undercut (plenty of players do this, but I'm going to specifically call out Jae Crowder because he does it every game I see him play). It's so obvious it's to get a call from the refs, and pisses me off more when the replay shows that no contact even occurred, or contact done by the shooter."
JAE CROWDER
"That‚Äôs another factor in analytics, at least the ones us normal schlubs can find on BBallReference: they play into the law of averages. That‚Äôs a smart thing to do from a team-building perspective, because it shows a player is ultimately a net value in the long run. But for guys like Wright, Jae Crowder, Georges Niang, and Maxi Kleber, you need a coach who can pull the plug or adjust when they‚Äôre performing below the average, because they can shoot you out of the game when they play poorly. In the current West where two or three wins can help you miss or make the playoffs (especially now, with the play-in), you can‚Äôt set rigid lineups because the numbers say so. Almost no analytics adherent is doing that, but this article makes it seems like the Mavs guy was, considering how the players argued Carlisle‚Äôs rotations were too rigid."
"Monty wasn‚Äôt considered top tier after his stint in New Orleans. Even Snyder was at risk of being fired as early as the start of this season if he didn‚Äôt perform.   Your roster matters a lot. Carlisle has kept the Mavs competitive when they had no right being so. Cuban broke up the 2011 Mavs team right after they won and has gone as far as saying that‚Äôs one of his biggest mistakes since owning the team.   I mean, just consider their first round drafts that followed their championship season:   In 2012, traded the 17th pick (Tyler zeller) for the 24th (Jared Cunningham), 33rd (Bernard James), and 34th (Jae Crowder).   Had no draft pick in 2013.   In 2014, traded the 13th pick (Kelly Olynyk) for Lucas Nogueira and two future seconds.   In 2015, drafted Justin anderson with the 21st pick. Anderson was traded two years later.   Had no 2016 pick.   In 2017, drafted Dennis Smith Jr. with the 9th pick. Was traded in 2019.   In 2018, they get Luka.   That‚Äôs a pretty shitty record sans Luka lol. You can‚Äôt expect to be much better than average when you‚Äôre drafting like that. A big part of why they were even competitive is because of Carlisle."
"It might have been, but the Suns added Chris Paul and Jae Crowder."
"That's what I mean  If he opts in, he has to play well enough next year to get 2/15 as a 31-year-old free agent with some injury history.  3/30 is a number I brought up because it's the mid-level exception, so he could get it from any playoff team below the tax (this is the mechanism that the Suns used to sign Jae Crowder). But I actually suspect he could get more than 3/30 from the Nuggets, since they have his Bird Rights and no good way to replace him.  So let's say the Nuggets offer would be 3/40 - then he has to be very confident of an offer for 2/25 next year (this is more than the mid-level exception, so getting this level of offer from a playoff team is much more difficult)."
"I feel like Jae Crowder is one of the most underrated guys in the league, I just always see him make his teams better."
Lmfao jae crowder usually acts tuff... He just wanted to separate them this time ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
"Yeah, you guys legit found something in the bubble and Jones was smart to add to it and keep that same style going with not just CP3 but Jae Crowder as well. He's had his mistakes (giving away T.J. Warren, trading De'Anthony Melton for Jevon Carter, passing on Haliburton for Jalen Smith) but none of them are that egregious and some (Warren giveaway), have helped lead to CP3 being in Phoenix which is more important."
Jae Crowder hitting the salsa
"There‚Äôs a reason klay is probably the best role player of all time, but he still is one. What star creates less than 5% of their own shots? What star creates very little shots for his teammates? His role is to run around and shoot 3s, and create spacing for his teammates. He‚Äôs one of the best players of all time at this role, but it‚Äôs a very specific role that you would never give to a star. Who‚Äôs role is more similar to klay‚Äôs in the flow of an offense? Jae crowder or lebron? Danny green or James harden? Klay is just a really great version of the 2 former players."
"I'm half with you here on this cause I'm for real shocked that multiple people on this comment string are calling Klay a role player. Imo most 3 and D players are generally considered role players but sure as hell not when you can easily drop 40 like Klay does.   When's the last time Jae Crowder dropped 40, if ever?"
"This is a peak reactionary r/nba take. There‚Äôs a reason Jae crowder makes 7 million a year, and teams would line up to hand jaylen brown a max right now. Unless you‚Äôre trolling you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/boston-celtics/boston-celtics-jae-crowder-phoenix-suns-devin-booker-exchange-instagram-barbs-following-70-point-game   Glad him and Booker squashed whatever this was.  Dudes been legit.
"Jae ""Almost Mccaw"" Crowder"
I miss Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder straight-up pushed back the entire nuggets staff. Surprised he didn't get more involved.
Because no one could do anything offensively this series jpkic just had to work way harder i would be rich if I had a dime every time a man was open and jae crowder was perfectly there to swipe at the ball because no one else was producing anything
"I think he was more mad now, with Crowder he was just pushing Jae with his stomach and talking something, but he looked fairly calm, as he was not frustrated already before Crowder lightly shoved him. With Booker he had a bit of crazy eyes look and asked ""what are you gonna do?"" if I am reading well from his lips.   &amp;#x200B;  I know Joker looks goofy, but I would not mess with him if I am most of the NBA players. Kind of like Lopez brothers, they are looking goofy, but I think they are way more dangerous than Morris brothers, or Jae Crowder, who are trying to look tough, but are not (for NBA player standards, obviously they would be scary for us regular folks)."
"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why can‚Äôt you ‚Äúhide‚Äù Facu on a lesser offensive player like Jae Crowder and put like Will Barton or someone onto Paul? That way you have a guy who can potentially get around the pick for a contest"
"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why can‚Äôt you ‚Äúhide‚Äù Facu on a player like Jae Crowder and put like Will Barton or someone onto Paul? That way you have a guy who can potentially get around the pick for a contest"
"If you think this was a lotto team without him this year, it's going to be hard to have a meaningful basketball discussion.  Booker's game evolved in ways that aren't obvious in the stats: he became more willing to get his points in the flow of the offense, which makes him more impactful. Ayton improved by leaps and bounds from last year. Mikhail Bridges clearly leveled up his game. They had Cam Payne all year and he's been pretty good, a big upgrade from last year.   Jae Crowder wasn't on the team last year.   So basically every player in their top six either improved or wasn't on the team last year. Chris Paul's leadership and efficiency are obviously a big part of why they improved, but the team was over 5pts better than their opponents with Paul off the floor this year, which translates to about a 64% winning percentage."
He did the exact thing to Jae Crowder before a few years back and made him look like a bitch. At least Book didn't back down but Jokic is a giant scary man when he's mad lol.
"Not really IMO. Like a Malik Monk, TJ Warren, Spinder Dinwiddie level player. Just someone who can initiate offense, and create their own shot. Also could prolly use a Jae Crowder lol."
"Not really IMO. Like a Malik Monk, TJ Warren, Spinder Dinwiddie level player. Just someone who can initiate offense, and create their own shot. Also could prolly use a Jae Crowder lol."
Heat paid Meyers Leonard over Jae Crowder
"Wow, Suns went from out of the playoffs to the conference finals. And all it took was adding one guy. Really shows the impact that he has on the game, big shout out to Jae Crowder"
- CP3 is Lowkey dirty and ofc flops quite a lot - Jae Crowder is Jae Crowder - Book is one the rare ‚Äúsore winners‚Äù on top of being a foul baiter
So would you or would you not be advocating for an ejection if Jae Crowder did that?
Lots of teams would be happy to have a Jae Crowder.  He's that veteran pest on defense that makes makes timely shots on offense and gets under people's skin.  He's not a star player but he can be a crucial contributor on a playoff team.
Jae Crowder looking revitalized by the knowledge he won't have to guard LeBron in these playoffs.

"This is a really easy fallacy to fall into because core stats aren't as scalable as impact metrics, but ultimately even if Zach is paid like a high end 6 man/ 3 and D Starter instead of an all star, the major all-NBA players in the league typically have impacts that are even higher than their max contracts (hence why the max exists, so there isn't a speculation war over if Lebron is worth 50 million or 70 million etc and you dont have a star surrounded by 10 PJ Tuckers).  Zach is on a relatively cheap contract but you have to pair that cheapness with oppurtunity cost of not having a higher paid but bonafide star. So if Joel Embiid makes $30 million and Zach makes 18 Million, the question youre asking is with Zach plus whichever player you can buy for $12 million = Joel Embiid. So is Zach Lavine plus Jae Crowder or plus Spencer Dinwiddie or plus Joe Harris better than Joel Embiid (no, but the Zach + Joe Harris seems close). Ultimately, no matter how much else you can buy due to Zachs cheaper contract, it will never equal 1 Joel Embiid, or Jokic, or Giannis or Harden or Lebron because their impact is scalable.  Also the impact metrics are still out on Levine as a primary ball handler and as a defender. This year was a revelation just shooting wise and the contract he gets will make this one look cheap, but, simultaneously, the contract he gets will over pay him for his impact"
LeBron flexing on Jae crowder in game three   Then saying his shoulders were built for this  Then quitting on his team in game 5 loss  Then quitting on his team again in game 6 loss  And losing the series as Jae Crowder salsa danced on his grave
"Too many unknowns now to actually answer that question. This team, as a whole, doesn't exist with Luka on it. As in, I'm not really sure there's a Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, even Mikal Bridges. I'm not really sure there's a Monty Williams. I'm not really sure James Jones is the GM. Everything changed AFTER the 2018 draft -- McD was let go october 8th, 2018, 3-4 months after the draft.  Igor Kokoskov gets a bad year, and loses the respect of the locker room.  James Jones takes over, sheds the dead weight left in by McDonough, and brings in Monty, and here we are.  If we draft Luka, best case scenario is a lineup of:  1-2-3 SGA Book Luka or Book Luka Mikal 4-5 ??? Capela and Cam Johnson maybe? Kelly Oubre maybe?  But with Kokoskov likely staying in as coach and McD potentially keeping his job I'm not convinced we're here, 1 game away from the WCF."
"I mean he averaged to 44% from 3 against us.   that's just how it be with streaky shooters, see THJ, Jae Crowder...etc  THJ was 65% from 3 first 3 games, then went 23% the rest."
"Jae Crowder.   Honorable mentions: AD‚Äôs groin, Jamal Murray‚Äôs knee  (But I think Monty should be COTY)"
"That's not even true. It's pretty even, and you could argue that Booker has consistently been the better player. Just CP3 brought the attention to the team and their success is attributable to him being the major change.   Booker, Mikal, Ayton, Cam Johnson, and slot of their bench has improved in various amounts. Signing Jae Crowder was a great piece.   CP3 helped them alot, but it's not everything."
It's like if Dirk had a younger Shawn Marion in Bridges and a younger Tyson Chandler in Ayton and a younger Deshawn Stevenson in Jae Crowder. Man if that team got together 5 years earlier they would've stomped the league
Only the dirty Jae Crowder
Crazy how a player that's essentially Jae Crowder with hops and worse defense was Orlando's 2nd option for years.
jae crowder and Torrey Craig who played in the Finals and WCF last year have been holding up just fine.
"Look at both videos... You will see Mikal running the baseline as an option for CP3 to pass to if Jokic or Mikals man tried to agressively defend CP3 since he beat Rivers to his spot (this happens a lot tbh, with Torrey Craig and Jae Crowder doing similar actions as well to give more options to Cp3) ...while like you said, Ayton is another option as the screener, in a traditional PnR, who could roll to the paint as well or pick and pop... If u dont have other cutters opening up options for CP3 aside from the original screener, a ""pretty basic PnR"" wont be as successful IMO... This is great execution, but a play that gives CP3 other options aside from Ayton if this was just a basic PnR."
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker 3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton
I just want to see Jae Crowder salsa dance with the fans after winning a title
"Someone mentioned in the danny green injury thread that Jae Crowder and Dwight Howard are the only ones from last years finals that are still in the playoffs without being plagued by injuries after a very short offseason. KCP, DG, Bron, and AD all got injured during or right before the playoff."
Lucky my love for cp3 outweighs my hatred for Jae Crowder.
Jae Crowder said that one of his reasons for signing with us because he saw the potential of this team. Who would have thought that Jae saw it better than casuals out here?
ayy booker shouting out jae crowder as a team leader  &lt;3 jae
"So for a person that didn‚Äôt pay much attention to this game, what was Aaron Gordan doing this game? Did Jae Crowder really get into his head that hard? Because I can‚Äôt think of much else for this game."
Jae Crowder is only at 4-6 from the 3pt? It feels like he‚Äôs made a lot more.
Jae Crowder loves to run NEVER walk off a court lol
"Not even mad if Facu baited Crowder, it goes both ways and that's what Jae does too"
They won the 8 straight to finish last season without CP3 and Jae Crowder.
"He literally did, they added cp3 and Jae crowder, plus the other young players developed."
"For nuggets is probably Jokic or j-myke. Dark horse would be [Vlatko](https://i.imgur.com/IUfFwcH.jpg)  I think lots of people will say crowder for phx, but he‚Äôs like the third fakest tough guy in the league behind the Morris twins  Last time [he got in jokic‚Äôs face, jok wasn‚Äôt halibut and Jae proved pretty quickly he didn‚Äôt want that smoke](https://youtu.be/AOlp8INIxrI)"
Ah. Jae Crowder with the familiar brick
I know these playoffs are fast and good but I feel like we arent appreciating the randomness of Jae Crowder of all people to out play LeBron James and finally take him out first round while salsa dancing to taunt him
"&gt; Terrible for so many years  I hate how this is a criteria for being likable.  CP3, Jae Crowder and Booker somewhat make that team unlikable"
Ohhh so that was the salsa that Jae Crowder was doing lmao 1st time I saw that commercial
"You say incidental, but that's because PJ is built like a truck and didn't flop there. Crowder took incidental contact on a loose ball scrum with Pat+Portis but acted like he was shot, and took whatever-is-less-than-incidental contact when Pat went to position himself for a screen Jae was setting (the one where Crowder ran across the whole court)."
Jae Crowder or Facundo Campazzo. Duh.
Cause Chris Paul is a bitch ass flopper. Also fuck Jae crowder
"""As long as jae crowder can hit his threes ""  -a team that is definitely not desperate"
Jae Crowder
Is this a serious reply?   You guys have fucking Chris Paul and Jae Crowder on your team. That's reason enough.   Any likeable players or cool storylines about your team are cancelled out by those two shitheads with their whining and dirty play.
Jae Crowder -  LBJ tried to school him in the playoffs game 2 and got shut down the rest of the series when on him.
"It's hilarious how defensive Suns fans have been since blowing the 2-0 lead. All we've heard from this fanbase is ""Suns in 4"" since that clip went viral. Most Phx fans on here were acting like the series was a wrap after going up 2-0 at home.  Now they're trying to push the narrative that Giannis is a dirty player because one play (which I agree was dangerous but doesn't make Giannis a dirty player)...or that Middleton is a flop because he did what Jae Crowder and Cp3 do litterally every possession.   I've never seen a team flop as much as the Suns...it's borderline unbareable to watch at times. Plus, seeing Phx celebrate like they won a championship after knocking out a Clipper squad without Kawhi in the WCF and Phx fans acting like the finals were over after game 2 is pretty classless. Loving how the tables have turned but it's funny every comment from a Phx flair is why does everybody hate us"
Jae crowder and Jeff green are wayyy better than george hill or Trevor ariza
add my boy Jae Crowder to that list
They all had/have to beat Jae Crowder as well
Cause we don‚Äôt? Now I‚Äôm thinking about Jae Crowder and laughing at you ü§°
Jae Crowder is a villain for casual LeBron fans like me.
I absolutely want CP3 and Jae Crowder to never win a championship so I disagree.
That's what CP3 and Jae Crowder have been doing all playoffs. Exaggerate the contact and fall on the floor to force the refs to either call a travel or the foul. It's pathetic but it unfortunately works.
Spoken like someone who's never seen Jae Crowder play...
Booker and Jae Crowder are in the top 10 of most unlikeable players in the NBA
"when contesting shots, players now like to act like they got shot. pls check recent booker and chris paul film. special shout out jae crowder."
"It's just past midnight Cam Payne and their bench have reverted back to pre-Fairy Godmother status, and combined with the fact they're actually facing a team which has their main guys healthy and playing as expected means we're returning back to normalcy when it comes to the Suns run this year.  This team has overachieved and is just coming back down to earth, kinda like the Heat last year against the Lakers. And what a coincidence Jae Crowder was in both teams lmao he must be Cinderella"
lol CP3 has been great all season and the entire playoffs until this series. Idk if it‚Äôs fair to group him with Jae Crowder.
Giannis is just a nice guy so it‚Äôs easy to root for him and the bucks and not the suns who have people like Jae crowder
Giannis is a dirty player because one hard foul on a breakaway? You clearly haven't watched Jae Crowder this postseason lol
Easy. Chris Paul and Jae Crowder have been on the roster for all of 7 months. Giannis was drafted by the Bucks and Khris Middleton was a trade throw-in years ago.
"Knicks fan here. People didn‚Äôt have an opinion on the suns coming into the season because they weren‚Äôt good before, so they weren‚Äôt on national TV enough for people to form an opinion. It‚Äôs not like people liked the Suns in the playoffs last year, they‚Äôre pretty much a ‚Äúnew‚Äù team.  I thought I liked Booker because he had a cool slasher game and dropped 70 that one time. Since I‚Äôve watched him in these playoffs I‚Äôve come to dislike him. His patented move is to run into the shoulder of the defender and then flop back harden style to get the whistle.  Then you‚Äôve got CP3 who nobody has ever liked. The man always whines to the refs. Always gets that brake check foul. And he commits a crazy amount of dirty plays considering he is the union president.  Then you‚Äôve got Jae Crowder who falls down literally every time he chucks a 3. It‚Äôs a patented part of his shooting motion at this point.  Nonetheless, I do like Book‚Äôs shotmaking, and I‚Äôll always have love for the 7 seconds or less suns and those 90‚Äôs era jerseys, so it‚Äôs not like anything personal against Phoenix."
"&gt; because our 24 year old superstar is a diva  I don't hate Booker that much, but he is starting to get on my nerves a bit. I think CP3's on court behavior is just serving to magnify it, but for the most part it's complicated. CP3 finally winning a ring is a great narrative, and at this point in his career I feel sorry enough for him that despite his on court behavior (his off court behavior is great) I would love  for him to win one. Then you have Booker who is for me at worst mildly annoying. Jae Crowder is another guy who's both easy and hard to root for, like Draymond. Guys like Ayton, Cam Johnson, Mikal, Payne, Craig, Saric and the rest of the guys not getting minutes in the rotation are very likeable and easy to root for.  On the other hand, the Bucks don't really have anyone that I even mildly dislike, and Giannis, Khris, Jrue are incredibly likeable. I hate Teague as a player but that's about it.   At this point I'm starting to root for the Bucks even though the Suns and CP3 could really use a chip... it's just flowing that way for me right now. And Giannis' story has always been incredible, and his game growing throughout this playoffs has been incredible to watch."
I would be surprised if he makes an All-Star but I could see him with a long career like a Thad Young or Jae Crowder.
"Jae Crowder, Booker, CP3"
"These dudes must not have been alive back in the day.   Nobody that's a Laker fan is rooting for the Suns ever after what happened in 06 and 07.  I will never root for them, I will never root for Chris Paul,and I'll never root for Jae Crowder. Fuck Phoenix."
"Jae Crowder learned from the flop goat himself, Marcus Smart."
"We obviously disagree  on the impact of not fouling out a star player or the many flops of Jae Crowder or whatever, most of which happened at key points late in the game. But you're a Booker guy, so you have both your opinion and a certain amount of skin in the game. We're not going to agree, and that's ok."
Jae 'Marian Hossa' Crowder
"This is why I've been rooting against the Suns ever since they beat the Lakers. I was happy they slayed the Lakers (though not without a big asterisk). But CP3 flops constantly, so the team takes after him. They ALL fall down constantly on jump shots. Book is constantly whining. He's VERY handsy on defense and then has the gall to complain when he gets called for it. Jae Crowder is the *ultimate* fake tough guy. The dude tries to be tough but falls down at the slightest contact as soon as he's touched. Conversely PJ Tucker would run through a fucking wall to get a stop. That dude is so much tougher than Crowder, it's not close. And so much more physical."
"So is Booker and Jae Crowder. This sub loved to push the Suns as the feel good team that deserves a ring but they‚Äôre just a team full of dirty, flopping, whining fucks. The Bucks are the much easier team to root for and should have been from the start."
"Ugh what Laker fan could possibly root for Jae crowder , cp3 and that clown booker?  Fake fans smh"
Im glad more people are coming to see this now. As someone who was rooting for the Clippers i noticed D Book and CP3 were a all time duo‚Ä¶ flopping wise. Then you had Jae Crowder obviously extending his arms to poke PG13 in the eyes on a jumper.
"I've been saying it in this sub for a long time now, I'm glad to see there be support for this fact. Both Chris Paul and Jae Crowder are dirty players who regularly put other players in dangerous situations."
Fuck Jae Crowder
"yes lol, I've legit seen people say on this sub that Crowder is learning from CP3 as if Jae hasnt been one of the dirtiest players in the league for his entire career"
I think having him available would help on the boards/help with foul trouble and he still definitely is less of a small ball 5 than Torrey Craig or Jae Crowder.
"I mean I think op shouldn‚Äôt have brought this up but that‚Äôs also not a fair response and it gets repeated a ton by people who ignore context. 8 guys are averaging at least 30 this postseason vs 3 last postseason, all of whom lost in the 1st round. Booker‚Äôs 27.7 ppg is currently 13th in the league while Tatum‚Äôs 25.7 was 11th.   As for the conference finals‚Ä¶ Tatum led both the Celtics and the Heat in ppg with 26.5 (3.2 higher than the next guy) and apg with 6.3 (1 more than the next guy). He was 2nd in rebounds after Bam with 9.8, tied with Jae Crowder for most blocks per game with 1.2, and was 4th in steals with 1.3.  To be fair, here are the wcf and the finals so far. In the wcf, Booker was 2nd in ppg among both teams with 3.2 less than George, and was 4th in rpg and apg while 5th in steals and tied for 11th in blocks. Hes also been 2nd in ppg with 2.2 less than Giannis these finals plus 5th in assists, 9th in rebounds, 7th and tied for both 5th in steals and 7th in blocks."
"Jae ""Anderson Varejao"" Crowder"
Then why‚Äôd the Heat get swept by this bucks team in the first round? No Jae Crowder?
Fuck Devin Booker Fuck Chris Paul Fuck the Refs who were trying to hand them the game Fuck Lebum James and his shitty movie Fuck Cam Johnson and his floppin ass shit Fuck the dude counting money Fuck Jae Crowder for thinking he‚Äôs the third splash brother     BUCKS IN 6
FUCK JAE CROWDER!
"We wasted the ""Jae Crowder can't miss"" game already."
Jae Crowder is like the 2019-20 postseason PG of role players
Fuck Chris Paul. Him and Jae crowder never winning a ring makes me so damn happy
Never been happier to see a duo lose than Chris Paul and Jae Crowder
"Jae Crowder about to lose B2B Finals, oof"
JAE CROWDER GETTING A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE LMAO
Jae zaza crowder
KHA$H   HUGE shot. Dumbass foul by crowder jae you doodoo
Hahahah fuck Jae Crowder bum boy ass
Jae Crowder has never committed a foul in his life.
Jae Crowder is cursed to bring teams to finals and then lose
Jae Crowder went from can‚Äôt miss to cant even hit the backboard. He may come back in the 4th.

2 quick fouls on Holiday and Jae Crowder shooting like the 3rd splash brother.  This has the makings of a blow out
jae crowder acting tough pisses me off everytime
Jae Crowder is so underrated as a player. Hes such a key player for contending teams and imo over-hated for no reason. Loving his game rn.
I don't think I've ever seen Jae Crowder dunk until this very moment
I don't think I've ever seen Jae Crowder dunk.
Jae crowder dunked that like it was the first time he ever did it
Jae Crowder and Jesus Christ have the same initials. Coincidence?  Yes. Yes it is

Bucks letting Jae fucking Crowder spank them ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So Game 5 is the Jae Crowder game. Gotcha!
Don't forget Jae Crowder aswell
"If this player gets the 10/10/10 pretty naturally without stat hunting then this is a player with star-level impact but potentially underrated because of a lack of scoring. Like some others have said, kinda like a Draymond Green. I might even look at this as some super PJ Tucker or Jae Crowder - just a good net positive guy on the court who can step up to any occassion and make the right play."
"I'd worry about those teams holding up as well this season after such a short off-season (training camps open in a month). This especially will apply to the guys who then went and played in the Olympics, but also I'm worried about how well Chris Paul will hold up at his age (this is the first time in his career he won't have had a long off-season), and Jae Crowder who played in back to back Finals, with consecutive shortened off-seasons."
jae crowder
"I am gonna get a lot of downvotes but I have a hot take where I feel like the bucks got worse this offseason, they lost Bryn Forbes ( huge factor in winning the heat series) and PJ Tucker (his defense was insane in the playoffs and just like how the Heat missed Jae Crowder last szn, I feel like the bucks are gonna have a similar effect). They replaced them with Grayson Allen and George Hill (who was waived by Philly and was not good last szn). It might be a hot take, but I have the Heat over the Bucks rn. My order is Nets, Heat, and then the Bucks."
Calm down Jae Crowder
That time Jae Crowder [made a three-pointer](https://youtu.be/xm8CS9DVsUA) while inbounding the ball from the opposite baseline.
"&gt;The biggest difference was the CP3 addition. Jae was an improvement over Kelly, and Mikal did play a lot better, but CP3 over Rubio is by far the biggest improvement.  They improved from .667 over the second-half of 2020 to .708 in 2021.  The difference is just 3 wins.  You are divvying up a very small improvement now, which was the entire point.  Booker improved.  Ayton improved.  Bridges improved.  Crowder arrived.  Payne played.  All that, plus Paul, led to just +3 wins.  &gt;CP3 is $24 million dollars better than Rubio. He‚Äôs an actual scoring option and has consistently led better offences. He‚Äôs also been one of the best closers in the game.  Not for the Suns he hasn't been.  Maybe peak Paul versus peak Rubio.  The Suns beat the Lakers despite Paul's 9/8 on 44% true shooting, not because of it.    &gt;His minutes were slashed for a reason.  Which was what, exactly?  He was playing fine up to that point -- as I showed.  Did he do something off court to anger Carlisle?  &gt;And no, it is not common for your sixth man to see 33% of their ppg cut and their TS% decline by 5%.  I never said it was common for a coach to slash his 6th man's minutes by 40%, despite that player playing just fine.  But that's what Carlisle did.  &gt;And what happened after Game 3? They couldn‚Äôt hit their perimeter shots like they did the first 3 games, so Luka and the coach had less trust in them.  Doncic wasn't hitting his shots, either.  9-24.  17-37.  11-24.  &gt;Your second article references Shams reporting that it is unlikely for Pelicans to match any significant offer for Ball, and the third article literally says this:  And what, exactly, do you think that says?  It says the Pelicans may, or may not, decide to continue with Ball.  Meaning that it was precisely not ""common knowledge"" that he would leave.  As I clearly showed -- even Ball and Williamson were quoted talking about his potential return, and you damn sure don't and didn't know more about the situation than those two."
"Something else to keep an eye on with Phoenix in addition to Booker's short break after the Olympics is that this will be the first time in Chris Paul's career that he hasn't had a long off-season, and Jae Crowder will be getting his second consecutive shortened off-season after playing in the Finals the last two years."
Since it seems Suns themed Jae Crowder was on the Heat and he seemed fine.
It's the jae crowder syndrome. He's valuable enough to where teams want to trade for him but not valuable enough to where he's untouchable.
"Shit put Wiggins, Harris , Powell, any solid wing who could shoot might have won that year. I‚Äôd even say Jae crowder."
"&gt;but this year‚Äôs Suns were actually playing great basketball for the majority of the season. Hence, the difference in their overall records.  And they got their #1 overall pick back into the lineup, and swapped Kelly Oubre for Jae Crowder.  &gt;CP3 averaged 16/9 on 59.9 TS%. Rubio averaged 13/9 on 53.3 TS%. Pretty clear difference.  Not $24M worth.  &gt;But it must be fun to make up things to argue against. I said 112 combined games from 7 of the team‚Äôs top 8 players.  Which is 16 per player, well down into the bench.  &gt;Brunson‚Äôs ppg decreased by over 4 points.   Because his minutes were slashed.  &gt;His TS% decreased by over 5 percent.  Most players see a decline in that neighborhood in the playoffs.  Even Doncic saw a (smaller) 1.5% decline.  Last time Lowry made the playoffs, his dropped 3%.  &gt;There‚Äôs a reason why they had to resort to the Luka-do-it-all strategy.  No, they didn't.  They didn't in the first two games -- with Brunson playing 20 and 17 minutes, and going 4-7 in each for 15 and 9 points.  Even in G3, Brunson played 22 minutes, shot 5 for 8 for 14 points.  Dallas chose to go all-Luka later in the series, and only played Brunson 20 minutes combined in the last two games.  Do you remember the first two games of that series?  Dallas looked invincible.  They were passing the ball all over the place, and all manner of guys were hitting shots.  They shot 50% in game one, despite Doncic missing 13 of his 24 shots.  Finney-Smith and Hardaway combined to shoot 15 for 24 and score 37 points.  The whole team shot 59% in G2.  Porzingis was 8 for 12 in G2, and 7 for 12 in the game four debacle and probably their best option with Doncic unable to hit water from a boat ( 9 for 24 ).  Then he got 13 shots total in the next two games.  That series was not a masterclass in resource utilization, and was probably a fire-able offense by a coach without Carlisle's lengthy history with the franchise.  &gt;They weren‚Äôt considering keeping Ball clearly, that‚Äôs common knowledge.

Jae crowder taking plenty of Ls lmao. Just saw article where a Instagram model screenshotted his DMs and she rejected him
"Doing the shit he‚Äôs done keeps people talking about him and is part of the reason he made it to the NBA. People hate it but some teams actually like having those guys on the court/field that will go out and intimidate or annoy. Look at the NFL with Vontaze Burfict or Richie Incognito. Those guys aren‚Äôt all stars but they bring a different type of intensity by being a dick on the field. Bucks had a PJ Tucker, Suns had a Jae Crowder. People just hate on Bev more because he‚Äôs done it to stars like CP3 and KD and says very stupid things like ‚Äúthe next 5 years are mine‚Äù. He‚Äôs always going to be shit talked but as long as he keeps getting a game check, he‚Äôll keep talking shit back."
"Also note that after kd left, the warriors FO have started to shift the roster to make way for the next generation after curry, steph himself has said recently that they want a healthy mix of young talents and old veterans.  However, if kd stayed, the warriors would likely be flipping assets like Wiseman for good veteran role players that belong on a championship run. Basically, even this previous season, kd and steph would probably be the favorites to win it since their teammates would look more like Jae crowder and less like Oubre."
"As someone from Boston, fans say that about everyone. Jackie Bradley Junior and Jae Crowder are two recent examples. Once they're gone, no one misses them.   I'm hoping this contract makes him more tradable. The try hard guys are great when they aren't making much. It's  another thing when you're paying them $20 million a year"
You just described Jae crowder so I‚Äôll say $10M which is about what he makes
The rondo trade also ranked their record breaking offense and lost them Jae crowder and Brendan Wright
Downvoted by delusional raptors fans lol.  They seriously think Jae Crowder is a bad contract and that teams would trade NBA starter level players for an expiring Dragic
"I generally like Booker but I think it probably has a lot to do with the antics of the team overall this post season, I‚Äôve never seen a team flop that much going all the way into the finals. Chris Paul and Jae crowder are generally unlikeable for those reasons (among others) and booker seemed to have learned a bit from them this season too. There‚Äôs also the push off argument I‚Äôve seen, but many players do that as well so I don‚Äôt think it has as much to do with. Regardless, Booker did have a great run for his playoffs but the sour taste remains I suspect."
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
Did the announced confuse Grayson Allen for Jae Crowder? That‚Äôs a good one
"It's game thread overreaction to the Clipper series.  He was great this season and in the Grizz series.   Think of him like the inverse Jae Crowder.  He's a stretch 4 but he's one of the best heat check guys in the league and he has a really beautiful offensive game, but he's often a liability on defense.   Which is frustrating because he definitely has that 90s power forward enforcer energy.  You guys will love that piece of it, he talks a lot of shit and will occasionally just go out there and dominate someone physically on defense, but he doesn't really have the body or the athleticism to do that very often because he's either guarding super athletic swings who are more athletic than him or big men who are stronger.  He's also one of those guys that is awesome as the 7-8 guy in the rotation but when he has to play 30 minutes he starts to get exposed.  When our rotation tightened and people were hurt we needed him to step up.... and he didn't contribute much on either end in that Clippers series."
He also waved to the Phoenix crowd right before Jae Crowder threw that inbounds lob to Ayton to win the game
"I feel like he was meant to be a Jae Crowder/poor man's Draymond utility type. Looked on track 3-4 years ago, but has been destroyed by injury since (just 98 games in the past 3 seasons). No idea of he'll get another NBA contract at this stage."

"I didn't say its the same stat, its just implying that because Wade was 1 in RAPM for a season, it doesn't mean a lot. For reference, Danny green was 2nd in 18-19 and Jae Crowder was 4th the year beforee, it has itts weakneses even though it involves less of the boxsccore.  Where can you find Wade's RAPTOR +.-?, because Harden has been dominating RAPTOR for a while."
Jae Crowder
He‚Äôs either going to be a chest shooter or a Jae Crowder full court shot form though. Or a photographer like KD and Russ.

"Yes my argument is that the stat you are referring to is worthless (obviously not all stats, but defensive stats tend to be worse than offensive stats). Just because [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) or ESPN includes them doesn't mean they actually track something meaningful, it just means they think it might generate more clicks.  538 seems to have the best alternative:    [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/)     That stat puts him at around Vuc and Jonas V. level which is what the eye test will show you as well. Before you discount 538s stats remember it also had him as the best player this season after accounting for him on offense.      Here are a few articles that look at stats similar to real defensive +/- and explain why it doesn't measure anything meaningful:   [https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/defensive\_rating](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/defensive_rating)  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.vice.com/en/article/aebkbz/why-an-all-in-one-defensive-stat-is-still-the-nbas-holy-grail](https://www.vice.com/en/article/aebkbz/why-an-all-in-one-defensive-stat-is-still-the-nbas-holy-grail)  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2014/4/9/5591108/jae-crowder-problem-espn-real-plus-minus-rpm](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2014/4/9/5591108/jae-crowder-problem-espn-real-plus-minus-rpm)"
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Bruh they put Fox on the same tier as JAE CROWDER
Steph Curry - David Duchovny Khris Middleton - Orlando Jones Kevin Love - Sean William Scott Jae Crowder - Julianne Moore Pop - Ted Levine
"We say that, but Jae Crowder got elbowed in the face by JR Smith and there was no fight. Haslem and Dwight got into it, but no fight.  There might be a punch thrown at best, but these guys ain't gonna risk their careers over a fight. Bench players can have their careers ended by a controversy like this."
jae crowder booping wall  the failed funeral game  marcus smart marcus smarting  the miyah game  lots of personal classic moments
"Because everything is not about money. You're imagining some THOT looking to get a paycheck, but what if she's a successful woman with her own shit going on and Jae Crowder is a dumbass she was thinking of dumping anyway?"
Fuck jae crowder
Dwyane Wade is a douche and a dirty player.   J.R. Smith is also a huge douche.   Up until recently it was an unpopular opinion but I never thought the Simmons Embiid duo was going to work well enough to win it all. On paper paring a ball handling player with no jumper next to a dominant big man isn't the best pairing. Sometimes talent wins out but i didn't think Philly would.   Jae Crowder is the right kind of douche.   Jimmy Butler's new deal is horrible.
Man I just realized how stoked I am that Jae Crowder lost
assuming he wasnt hacked? its jae crowder man. dude is in his feelings 24/7.
"I seriously dont get the Suns hype. They added a declining CP3 and Jae Crowder. Like Jae is nice, but c'mon. He isnt a top 30 player."
"I mix up Jae Crowder and Jamal Crawford's names sometimes, at least it kinda made sense with old man Crawford"
Walter **Ray** Allen Jr.  Aaron **Jamal** Crawford  James **Caron** Butler  James **Khris**tian Middleton  Corey **Jae** Crowder
"another thing is that isn‚Äôt a good roster build for 3 on 3, even if they are that good  pritchard yes, but you need ball handlers when you only have 3 guys. ball will be in your hands 1/3 as opposed to 1/5 of the time. PJ washington was really poor at UK as a freshman and zach collins is nice for a big, but not 3 on 3. more spacing on the court also allows your handles to flourish way more since you don‚Äôt have to worry about as much help defense. same thing with passing. both bigs are capable for bigs, but not 3 on 3  i think the perfect team for 3 on 3 ball would look like early 2010s Buzz Williams marquette teams. guys like jimmy butler, jae crowder, lazar hayward, darius johnson odom and vander blue are the perfect guys who can all rebound, pass, shoot, and guard multiple possessions on defense"
"Corey Jae Crowder is the son of NBA player Jonathan Corey Crowder who went by Corey Crowder.  so if Jae went by his first name he would be Corey Crowder, son of Corey Crowder, but he wouldn't be a Junior.  names are weird"
"Ray Allen, Jamal Crawford, Jae Crowder, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant"
"Ray Allen, Jamal Crawford,  Caron Butler, Khris Middleton, and Jae Crowder"
"Especially when talking about D there is no objective measure. And and what point is a guy more than a 3&amp;D player? I see KD and Kawhi both mentioned, but to me stars like them don't fall into 3&amp;D players.   When you say 3&amp;D I'm thinking more roleplayer types who specialize in just those 2 things. Jae Crowder has to be up there in that category."
"Again, find me another team other than Cleveland that was going to take Isaiah Thomas off the C's hands for them. the only ""assets"" they lost were Jae Crowder, definitely a good player but not a life changer, Ante Zizic, the Nets' 2018 1st rd. pick (which was 29th that year) and a Miami 2nd rounder... How bad do you think they're hurting from losing those great ""assets""??? They're hurting WAY more from the Hayward and Kemba pickups than for the Kyrie trade."
"There is NBA fans all over the world. Take me as example. I'm from Brazil. I have simpathy towards various teams because in the 90's we used to watch these teams and admire the stars that played for them. If Supersonics ever comes back, I'll have simpathy for them too, because I saw Gary Payton play for them. I root for players, like D. Rose and despise others, like Kyrie, CP3, Jae Crowder..."
Jae Crowder is getting there
Duncan Robinson/Jae crowder
"jae crowder, blake griffin, boogie"
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
Nah fuck the Suns and Jae Crowder.
I remember him decking Jae Crowder because Jae ran up the score. Now they‚Äôre teammates.
OK well as long as we all acknowledge that Jae Crowder is the difference between being swept in the first round and going to 6 in the finals
"Shout out to Cam Johnson and Jae Crowder too, along with superstar Abdel Nader"
JAE CROWDER EVERYWHERE HE SEEMS TO GO IT'S SUCCESSFUL THEY ALL ARE ABLE TO SHIT THROUGH HIS SCREEN DOORS
"You did outplay us, I just feel like it was a fluke. Jae crowder turning into Steph curry was flukey as shit"
I was pretty sad when we had to let Jae Crowder go to Memphis for Conley
"Jeff Green, Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen, idk why these 3&amp;D wings just don't do well in the Jazz."
"&gt;Disaster of a trade? We gave up expiring contracts in Solomon Hill, Andre Iguodala, and Jae Crowder.   Yes, it was a disaster. You gave up solid players on expiring contracts just to take back a shit ton of bad salaries which were not expiring and which weren't positive contributors for you. You got two large multi year contracts that you ended up just buying out (Waiters and Dieng), and Winslow, who was a bust.   If you had not made that trade and those guys had all left it would have opened up $38 million in cap space that summer. Instead, you essentially traded those expiring contracts so you could devote  $84 million total over two years basically just for Winslow. How is that *not* a disaster?   And let's be honest: the only reason Memphis did this is because they were too proud to just buy Iguodala out, even though they'd already received a 1st round pick to take him on. They had made a big stink in the press about how they believed they could get something positive for him again in another trade, and when that never happened, rather than admit they'd been wrong, instead they made a bad trade and tried to proclaim that they'd been right. They should have just bought Iguodala out and been done with it. Wasting $15 million is far better than wasting $84 million."
"Disaster of a trade? We gave up expiring contracts in Solomon Hill, Andre Iguodala, and Jae Crowder. None of which were re-signing with us anyways. We took on a bit of cap hits, but it was a low-risk/high-reward trade for us.   The Grizzlies needed an athletic wing who can create his own shot. We were hoping that Winslow was that guy. He wasn't.  It was a risk worth taking, especially considering we didn't give up any assets that actually match with Ja and JJJ's timelines."
Jae Crowder also
Jae Crowder actually
"Really you mean the jae crowder, devin booker, Chris Paul suns? Or the James ‚Äúmr flop‚Äù harden nets? These two fan bases are complaining about players bitching to the refs?  Classic"
"With the amount of player movement and speculation of movement each year, franchises are becoming irrelevant.   To me it seems like they should just have the players and coaches on league contracts and do a yearly draft to create teams that travel to the biggest cities and play games.  What would be different really?   Kawhai was on SA, then he was on Toronto, now he‚Äôs on the LAC with Paul George.   Durant and Westbrook were on OKC then Paul George and Westbrook were on OKC.   Houston had Harden and Chris Paul and then Paul was on OKC.   Houston had Harden and Westbrook.  Brooklyn has Harden, Kyrie and Durant now.   Cleveland had Lebron and Kyrie.   LA has Westbrook and Lebron now.   I‚Äôm pretty sure Jae Crowder has been on a different team every year of his career‚Ä¶  Seems reasonable to just ‚Äúchoose em up‚Äù every year at this point."
"That‚Äôs not how I meant it. Duncan is consistent, however, he has the ability to score like 4 in a row. I was NOT calling him a Jae Crowder type that will go 0-7 then 4-5 the next game."
"Lets all join another game. Who fouled jae crowder!? He fell, so someone had to. I think it was colonel mustard in the kitchen"
"I‚Äôd rather have players like that. Like Jae Crowder. Whenever I‚Äôve watched him he plays with a perpetual green light. Some games they‚Äôre dropping and he balls out, other games he misses every single open shot, but he still shoots. I like that level of confidence and feel like it‚Äôs much easier to work with and improve with."
Fuck Jae Crowder
No. Fuck Jae Crowder
"People were equating his impact on the roster to what Jae Crowder did for us did in the 2020 playoffs, which is a pretty high bar, especially because PJ‚Äôs shooting much less 3‚Äôs."
Rich mans Jae Crowder.
Jae crowder did this all playoffs
"He's like Jae Crowder (but no where near as dirty) where he is really good at trolling the opposing team and fanbase. I acknowledge hes good at it, but it still gets under my skin haha."
"Yeah it was a one season extension (second year team option). And I'm not sure it was even a good move then.  I'm just saying I think Jae Crowder, who started every game for Miami that year in the playoffs (playing 32 min a game) was a bit more important in the trade than Iggy who came off the bench to put up 3.8 points."
"For giving up Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill and taking on 30 m in waiters and Johnson Grizzlies got Winslow. It wasn't like Iggy was the reason that trade was being made, he was just dead money filler for that deal."
For a title contender? Jae Crowder has been to back to back finals on two different teams and was prob the worst starter on both  An asset towards any team? Prob a solid bench player like a Patty Mills
"That 2018 Cleveland Cavaliers team would have prime D Rose/ D Wade/ IT/ LeBron/ K Love with Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder, Tristram Thompson, JR Smith and the infamous Brooklyn 1st"
The Suns faced one healthy team the entire playoffs. Please. Y‚Äôall still don‚Äôt have a ring though so all this shit talking is just hilarious to me. Lebron clowning on Jae Crowder after the Finals loss was actually the funniest shit ever.
Tre transformation from that roster to a Finals team in a few short years is as remarkable a front office achievement as I have ever seen.  They got Memphis to give them Iggy and Jae Crowder and in return got to buy out James Johnson for like 40m and pay Justice Winslow 26m for 2 years (and got 30 games of solid G league play from him over two years).  They just kept getting value from the craziest contracts.
"Three Suns players should be watched carefully this upcoming season. Devin Booker is going to have hardly any time off after playing into the Finals and then right into the Olympics before getting back to work for next year (training camps start in about 7 weeks). Jae Crowder will be playing his second consecutive season on extremely short rest after making the Finals in back to back years, each with the shortest off-seasons ever. And of course Chris Paul, who has never gone deep into the playoffs at all so he's always had a long off-season, and now will be playing on extremely limited rest.   I think Phoenix could have a lot of problems this year."
He kinda felt like a budget Jae Crowder
Thought this was Jae crowder for a sec üíÄ
Jae Crowder aint shit ü§£
"I never understood the move. From the moment it happened, I was banging the table saying they should have gone after bringing back Jae Crowder or someone like that. This Utah team has legitimate title/finals aspirations, and there is absolutely no world in which you could play Rudy+Derrick together in the playoffs. So now he's a 10 MPG backup 5 when the games matter...and that isn't worth the MLE.   It didn't matter whether he was good at the role. It mattered that the role wasn't big enough to justify that waste of an asset."
"You just made a case for 4th seed at best, which I also made as well.  Why the butthurt?  When you got clapped Heat fans pined for Jae Crowder and that he would be the difference between stopping Giannis or not. So which is it now? Better roster or worse?  I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm arguing with you. I like these signings because it ensure mediocrity at best for the Heat with low draft picks. You do you though if you like it so much."
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
They missed Jae Crowder this year. PJ fills that role nicely
"Suns‚Äô 2021-22 rotation:  Starters = Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton  Second Unit = Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, JaVale McGee  Phoenix made the NBA Finals and upgraded their roster."
Downvotes don't mean shit. Gtfo with that Jae crowder bs
Olynyk is lowkey a great role player. Gives me Jae Crowder vibes in terms of his contribution to his team.
"Colin Sexton, Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and Ante Zizic"
&gt; The thought of Jaw Crowder guarding Zion is funny   Jae Crowder is a LeBron stopper Zion is nothing to him
The thought of Jae Crowder guarding Zion is funny   Also who is the Grizzlies center in this particular moment lmfao
Don‚Äôt forget the Celtics also gave up Jae Crowder and the Nets pick. I highly doubt the Cavs would‚Äôve agreed for a one-to-one deal of injured IT for Kyrie.
"Damn some Saddiq love! Idk if he‚Äôs the next Paul George or the next Jae Crowder but I do know he‚Äôs gonna be a reliable starter for the next decade, pretty good for the 19th pick"
"I mean I‚Äôd argue that Giannis was slowed down because of his ankle injury, thus making their ‚Äòwall‚Äô more effective. I think the series would have been a lot closer than 5 games had he been available and 100%.  Your right, Butler played out of his mind, and i think the best version we may ever see out of him. I only mentioned the young players because of the ‚Äòvariance‚Äô discussion. I got kind of triggered reading that comment section lol. no one expected Herro to make every open 3 they gave him and then some (I was thinking of the Celtics series more so your right - not a perfect argument) Same thing for Robinson and Jae crowder(he went nuclear that bucks series( and I would not consider him young). The expectations were low and they blew them out of the water. The bucks series just felt like it ended too early.  I think the injury situation was weird, considering how beat up the team was during the regular season (especially dragic - dude always is injured lol) it was amazing to see them firing on all cylinders. Truly what basketball fans live for. Motion offense, insane shooting, clutch shots, epic defense. It‚Äôs sad their season came in an end the way it did."
League contracts.  Teams redraft players from a common pool every year.  Every player becomes Jae Crowder and plays for a new team with new teammates every season.   We are almost halfway there anyway so‚Ä¶
Was Jae Crowder?
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
"&gt; Arguably even better than what happened irl  I don't think ""arguably"" is the right word, to say the least. That Cavs team with Paul George instead of IT and Jae Crowder is unquestionably better. Maybe still not good enough to beat the KD Warriors but it would have been more of a contest. Current Cavs would be worse without Collin Sexton, though, since LeBron probably would have left in 2018 anyway."
"Not that many teams had better defense than the Suns. DeAndre Ayton is one of the best at Defending Giannis in the league. They also have Jae Crowder who does pretty well defensively against him. I don't see a single team having a better combo than that, unless you make a case for Embiid. In which case he should of made a case for himself and not disappeared against the Hawks over and over lmao  Edit: looked it up and Phoenix had one of the best defensive ratings in the playoffs and a very good rating in season. Talking about elite defenses is odd because the only one that people can point to is Toronto, and that team does not exist anymore, and that was probably one of the better defensive 5s in playoff history. So it's a very weird thing to nitpick, considering the Suns were one of the best in the playoffs. And sorry but the Sixers lost in the 2nd round, so I guess elite defense only takes you so far"
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Joel Embiid  Bench  LaMelo Ball / Jamal Murray / Austin Rivers / Lu Dort / Jae Crowder / Robert Covington / Clint Capela  I legitimately think this team can go 82-0 if injuries are not a factor.
Jae Crowder did this to LeBron this year
"PG: LeBron James (SS) SG: Brad Beal (AS) SF: Kevin Durant (SS) PF: Jayson Tatum (AS) C: Rob Williams  6-12 FVV, Seth Curry, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis, Tacko Fall"
"A big who can handle the ball like jokic and a 2 way guard like kawhi for all stars i would have two athletic guards like Jamal Murray and Mitchell. For the role players id have jae crowder, joe Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr, javale Mcgee, Duncan Robinson, and Caruso. The end of the bench could be Grayson Allen and Jah"
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
"Jrue Holiday, Bradley Beal, KD, Lebron, Clint Capela‚Ä¶.    7 man Bench would be TJ Mcconel, KCP, Jae Crowder, Thaddeus Young, Nerlens Noel, Javale Mcgee and Seth Curry"
"I get it OP.  My wife won't let me hang out with Jae Crowder because of his ""female tendencies""."
"&gt; the longest shot ever could have belonged to Jae Crowder. In 2015 he shot the end line with a shot of 95 feet with the aim of serving a teammate. But since no one touched the ball, the shot was not valid.  If someone else would have touched it, it wouldn't have counted as a 95 feet shot. Right?"
Link for anyone who hasn't seen it.   https://youtu.be/xm8CS9DVsUA  It's awesome considering his game winning pass this year too. Jae Crowder from out of bounds cannot be stopped.
I hope that Jae Crowder inbound doesn't get lost to history because that's one of the wildest shots of all time
"I‚Äôm a big fan of players taking unique numbers. Taking 23 is boring, your never going to enter the same stratosphere of Jordan and Bron, may as well take something people will remember you by  and on top of that you get it on pretty much every team you go to, Jae Crowder always getting that 99 wherever he goes."
"Robert Covington is the epitome of this, on paper a perfect 3 and D player. He is cheap enough that desperate teams will keep trading for him to make a push (Rockets, Blazers) but not actually good enough to make much of a difference. Jae Crowder to an extent is as well, if there was a pokemon evolution line it would be Solomon Hill -&gt; Covington -&gt; Crowder"
i think its really funny that all these dunks n shit are just former all stars yammin it on Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder is always all over these kinds of videos. Dude is a top-tier fake tough guy who loves to start shit.
Jae Crowder? More like [Jae Chowder](https://youtu.be/2-bbYH_akHg)
"""He's got a lot of female tendencies on the court, flopping and throwing his head back‚Ä¶he's soft, very woman-like"". ‚Äì Marcus Morris on Jae Crowder"
LeVert Brogdon and Warren are injured all the time  Clint Capela is a defensive rim running big man. Their market value is never gonna be as high as high end wing defenders  Aaron Gordon is a better player than Duncan Robinson imo  Jae Crowder was the closest player to Aaron Gordon in terms of archetype but also does less than AG on offense and have similar defensive abilities. He was also 30 when he signed his current deal.  I feel like people keep viewing the AG deal in terms of a 109M cap instead of a ~120M cap that it‚Äôs gonna be when his deal expires.
"&gt;On deferring to Jae Crowder on for a game winner- Nov. 26th, 2015  &gt; ‚Ä¢ ""When I was dribbling, I was like, 'Oh, snap, I‚Äôm at 15 feet, I‚Äôm about to end this.' And then I thought about [Michael Jordan] passing to Steve Kerr. And I thought, 'Well, let me add that to my legacy. I‚Äôll pass one time.' And that was it. It was unbelievable, actually. Ingenious by me."""
"Dennis Schroder, Draymond Green, Solomon Hill, PJ Tucker, Jae Crowder if Schroder and Hill were on the Warriors and Jae Crowder was still on the Heat"
"Ehh I hear your points but they seem a bit mute. Rob Sarver has been a cheapass forever and he's going to have to pay the tax if he wants to pay Booker, Ayton, *and* CP3 in the coming years regardless of Bridges. Bridges is never going to be Jae Crowder and take tough physical post matchups but he's a great slasher, good post up shooter, and easily our best perimeter defender. Pretty sure every team in the league would pay Bridges 15/year lol. If it costs 20 to keep him from other teams that seems like a win/win."
Probably Jae Crowder. He will either go 8/10 or 0/11.
Jae Crowder would fill a huge hole Boston
But have you considered the team that has Jae Crowder?
Bubble Jae Crowder was insane honestly. Didn't he shoot like 80% from 3pt against the Bucks?   Bubble Jae &gt; Suns Jae. Heat in 7.
I would love to see how Jae Crowder would match up with Jae Crowder ü•µ
I'm gonna go with the team that has Jae Crowder
"Bruh... Kenneth Faried, Trezz, Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince, DeMarre Carroll  are they gonna be the most intimidating line up?"
Jae crowder is 99
"You don't think that star players aren't going to play for something that gives them a competitive edge over their rivals?  For a team like the warriors for instance signing a guy for the Full MLE without it counting towards tax or cap would be huge. Imagine being able to add a Jae Crowder, a reggie Jackson, a Nick Batum. You'd be able to offer market rates whilst still. Offering contention. And for mid tier teams it's another way they can improve. The blazers would probably love it.  Plus if the squad is still getting 1 million, this gives role players the incentives, and the core players incentives as well."
How would you stack the Mavericks players up against the low end of the list?  Let's say Danny Green and Jae Crowder
"Luka cooked everyone this year, but our playoff series against him in the bubble, Mook was our best defender on him alongside Zu. Morris isn't lockdown all defense good, but he's right in the same range as a Jae Crowder on defense  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Matchup=Offense"
"The only other name coming to mind is Jae Crowder.  I'd probably go Anunoby, Bridges, Covington, Green, Crowder.  I'm not really sure which of Green or Crowder is better currently."
Jae Crowder should be here.
Jae Crowder maybe
He walked so Jae Crowder could run
Jae Crowder says hi with his 99
Cavs:  Derrick rose/Isaiah Thomas   Baron davis  Dwayne wade  Jae crowder  Shaq
Pat Bev Demarcus Cousins Morris Twins Jae Crowder
He might also be traded for a win now guy + a pick as well. I‚Äôd absolutely hate to see it but if like Dillon Brooks comes available or if a Jae Crowder type guy is out there you might make a move.
"not one of the greatest, but Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jae Crowder deserve some recognition"
"Last year Monty tried all 3 of Crowder, Saric, and Johnson at the starting PF, and ended up sticking with Jae in the end because he was the healthiest and most consistent of the 3. If we brought in Thad, he'd be cemented into starting lineup, no question."
Thaddeus Young wouldn‚Äôt get minutes on the Suns roster because Jae Crowder and Cam Johnson are on the roster? I highly doubt that lmfao
"Yeah LeBron his teams are too old I bet for the streak to last long enough. However an interesting one is Jeff Green due to duration and being on a billion different teams.   1999: Kurt Thomas  2000-2002: Shaq 2003: Richard Jefferson 2004: Shaq  2005: Nazr Mohammed  2006: Shaq 2007: Ira Newble/LeBron 2008: KG 2009: JJ Redick 2010: KG 2011: Tyson Chandler  2012: Kevin Durant  2013: Ray Allen 2014: Ray Allen 2015: LeBron  2016: LeBron 2017: LeBron 2018: LeBron 2019: Kevin Durant  2020: LeBron 2021: Jae Crowder   His streak I bet lasts a long time. Teammates already with: Durant, LeBron, Jokic(about to be), Westbrook, Harden, Donovan Mitchell, Gobert, Beal, CP3, Kyrie. That streak will probably last a fair bit. He has ties to all the top teams this year: LAC(Ibaka), LAL, BKN, Den, Utah, Phx, Mil(Bobby Portis), Atl(Lou Will) etc"
Jae Crowder
"The bad boy pistons have built this aura of insane aggression. Like no, that was exception where a team literally couldn‚Äôt stop the GOAT so they resorted to beating the shit out of him in a series or two. I watched Kelly Olynyk rip Kevin Love‚Äôs shoulder out and then Kendrick Perkins and JR Smith literally committed battery on Jae Crowder as revenge. It‚Äôs really not different other than a couple rule changes."
"It really doesn't make sense, especially when you consider that guys like Jae Crowder have longer hair than the headbands."
"Didn't that happen [in 2013](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--after-trade-talks-to-send-paul-pierce-to-dallas-fell-through--celtics-make-another-spring-run-203043279.html)?   &gt; Before the trade deadline passed, the Boston Celtics had one final choice to make on the franchise's future: In a three-way deal that would've secured Josh Smith and surrendered Paul Pierce to Dallas, Atlanta wanted Boston's first-round draft pick, too. &gt;  &gt; As much as any of the proposed deals discussed in February, perhaps this had been the closest Pierce had come to parting with the Celtics, sources told Yahoo! Sports. &gt;  &gt; Dallas had constructed a package that included Jae Crowder, Brandan Wright and Dahntay Jones to Atlanta, with the Mavericks and Hawks exchanging positions in the 2013 NBA draft. &gt;  &gt; Nevertheless, Boston wouldn't relent on the pick and the deal died on meeting-room grease boards in three cities."
"Before the 2010-11 season, he was sign-and-traded to Miami for 2 first round picks, one pick swap, and two 2nd round picks (one was used on Jae Crowder lol). So start there, and add probably 2 more picks and a bunch of young players to compensate for additional team control."
"the problem is Ayton was the best on him 1v1 but if he does that, who meets him at the rim? Jae Crowder?"
As a team though center is locked in with ayton. Sg is locked in with booker aka ben simmons didnt hit this jenner shot either . And you have a god pg. All of which are very expensive to replace because of their talent. Then you add two dogs in mikal bridges and jae crowder. With dario sitting on the bench ready to run around any bench player. Yall have a noice team
"That's slander to Nappa.  He beat the shit out Krillen &amp; co, survived a suicide bombing and took Goku personally stepping in to beat.  Kuzma got super outplayed by Jae Crowder.  That's like if Nappa got stomped by Tien."
&gt; Jae Crowder was awful for most of that series  As was basically every single Lakers role player
"CP3 wasn‚Äôt healthy  Jae Crowder was awful for most of that series  Their best players consisted of 20-25 year olds  Not exactly deathly competition to beat, but instead you lost to them twice in embarrassing fashion"
"LeBron is 37, just give it up and admit he‚Äôs not the best player in the world anymore   If he was the best player, he would‚Äôve beat the Suns with an injured CP3, Jae Crowder playing like garbage, and their other 3 players playing their first playoff series"
"&gt;or just completely shit the bed like he did vs Houston a couple of years back  Lmao, it was his sophomore year and he was the only actual scoring threat as a significant underdog to the Rockets.   It was Mitch, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors, Jae Crowder, Rudy Gobert, Royce O'Neale, and Joe Ingles as the guys that played significant minutes."
"Buzz Williams was doing that with Lazar Hayward , Jae Crowder, Darius Johnson-Odom etc. wayyy back. all those marquette teams were full of guys who could dribble, pass, and defend multiple positions  Raptors didn‚Äôt invent shit lol"
"PG: Chris Paul  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Mikal Bridges   PF: Cam Johnson  C: Deandre Ayton  Bench 5: Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Abdel Nader, Javale McGee, Landry Shamat"
"Starting: Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton Next 5: Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith, Javale McGee"
"Cam Johnson, Jae crowder, Jalen smith and a pick"
Yeah the Rockets got themselves an ‚Äúasset‚Äù lol. I feel like he‚Äôs gonna get traded 3 times over the course of that deal and be a solid player wherever he goes kinda like Jae Crowder.
"&gt; Dame exclusively guards other PGs.  Thank you, I‚Äôve not had a good laugh yet today.  In the three games Blazers played the Suns this year, Dame‚Äôs defensive assignments were as follows: * Mikal Bridges 17:28 * Chris Paul 3:46 * Devin Booker 3:04 * Jae Crowder 3:02 * Cam Payne 2:09  All of them played in all three games btw.  &gt; They‚Äôre both at least always guarding and being guarded by other guards.  Dame was guarded by Mikal for 20:28 over those three games. Far and away more than any other guard."
"Jokic and Dame then try to get guys like Lonzo, RoCo, Mikal Bridges, Andrew Wiggins, Jae Crowder."
"Jae crowder was mad overrated back then.  Celtics fans were calling him a borderline all star and an ‚Äúall nba caliber defender‚Äù back then and it‚Äôs like no he‚Äôs a role player.   If IT is healthy that trade is probably fair value. Cleveland gets a few prospects, a star with ~4 years left as a top player, and a mediocre role player in exchange for a younger, but worse star, allowing them to maximize brons prime while incubating a top pick.  The main issue with your analogy is that Randle is not much older than Ben. A better example would be if they offered Charlotte kemba+ picks for Ben."
"I'd say Cleveland as well. We've traded the following players one way or another:      Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, George Hill, Dante Exum, Kyle Korver, Alec Burks and best of all Jordan Clarkson."
I've always thought of him as someone who would be considered one of the great role players (like Danny Green or Jae Crowder) in the league if he ended up on a great team that consistently went deep in the playoffs.
The lakers can‚Äôt beat jae crowder and the nets can‚Äôt beat that one Greek dude I think the warriors will be alright

Jae Crowder?
"2017 starters: IT, horford, jae crowder, avery bradley, amir johnson. no superstars.   2018: the celtics beat the sixers 4-1 in the 2018 second round to reach the ECF. were the sixers meh competition?  2020: everyone had the same environment?"
"Jae crowder does this shit too. Rest of he nba too. Kick your legs out anytime you shoot a 3. Fall down for no reason even when the defender jumps to your side and doesn‚Äôt touc you. It‚Äôs fucking infuriating, watching players shoot to get calls rather than shoot to make a shot"

"2013: Thunder have the 1 seed in west. Russ goes down in round 1. Bounced in the 2nd.  2014: KD mvp.. Russ hurt most of season. Wcf and ibaka goes down. Chip for sure  2015 : kd missed most of season and russ has to carry a pre-post Kd roster his mvp potential shows, but they dont even make the playoffs.  2016 : 3rd seed. Upset the spurs in the semis. WCF up 3-1. On the 73-9 warriors. Kd performed bad in the closing minutes of every close out game. Klay game 6 stuff. Warriors win. Then he leaves to the team he choked against.  2018: 4th seed with melo and pg. get dropped off by the jazz because they leave jae crowder open the entire series. Roberson gets hurt.   2019: MVPG. Falls off near the playoffs. Is shit in the playoffs. The dame shot."
"I feel like 2014 was Dirk's last really great season, and kind of underrated and overlooked. Carried one of the more mediocre squads he'd ever play with (Monta Ellis being the 2nd ""star"", and Shawn Marion, Jose Calder√≥n, and Samuel Dalembert/Dejuan Blair being the other regular starters, with VC, Devin Harris Mk II, and Brandan Wright and Jae Crowder coming off the bench) to 49 wins, and pushed the eventual champion Spurs to 7 games in the 1st Round."
"&gt;one of the reasons the bucks won is due to their perimeter defense.  The Suns shot 49/38.4/85.7 from 3 over the Finals.   CP3 shot 52% from 3, Mikal Bridges shot 42.9% from 3, Jae Crowder shot 41% from 3, Cam Johnson shot 43.5% from 3.   CP3 put up 62.2% TS, Bridges put up 66.3% TS, Crowder put up 61.2% TS, Johnson put up 67% TS.   They would've shot over 40% from 3 as a team if Booker hadn't taken so many while shooting 26.8%.   &gt;PG is a way better defender than Tatum and say that it‚Äôs gonna be hard for him to overtake PG but then u say defense doesn‚Äôt matter when involving Trae  The defense wasn't the defining reason that Tatum would struggle to overtake PG, it was one of a bunch of things that I listed.   The point was that PG and Tatum are the same archetype of player and Tatum is strictly worse within that archetype at this point.  &gt;If PG is an all around better player than Trae, then the hawks improve, am I right or not.  You're wrong. All-around better matters when you're ranking players on a list, it doesn't mean that switching a lower-ranked player for a higher-ranked one necessarily improves the team.  Trae serving as the offensive engine for the team is more valuable than getting a much better defender."
"Getting Iguodala wasn't the problem, as that was a good trade. It's basically everything they did after that that didn't work. They probably would have been better off just buying out Iguodala and then trying to re-sign Jae Crowder instead of doing what they did. Crowder is really the only player from that whole group who's proved to be any good at all."
Jae Crowder as a legend ü§¢ü§Æ
"Pretty sure that was in relation to Andre Iguodala and their refusal to buy out his expiring $17 million contract. But since they ended up trading him (along with Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill) for the combined $85 million in salary of Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng, and Justise Winslow, I'm not sure they actually got any assets back. In two years those three players combined to play only 65 games for Memphis, and now all of them are no longer on the roster, with none being traded to bring back anything further."
"Memphis should have just bought him out on his expiring $17 million contract and been done with it. Instead they ended up trading him, Solomon Hill and Jae Crowder to Miami and got back Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng and Justise Winslow.   Now let's look at how that played out, shall we? They immediately ended up buying out Waiters 2 years and $25 million remaining and bought out Dieng this past year, and then Winslow left in free agency this summer. Waiters never played a game for the Grizzlies, Winslow only played a total of 26 games for Memphis and Dieng only played a total of 39 games for Memphis in the two years they had these guys.   So what did these 65 combined games over two years of Dieng and Winslow cost Memphis? Well, in addition to losing Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill, Memphis ended up spending $85 million on Waiters, Dieng and Winslow. In retrospect, simply buying out Iguodala would have been the smart move."
"i'm just saying, in comparison to Lauri Markannen or Derrick Jones Jr, Nance is playing at an entirely different level right now. For Portland to somehow swing that out of nothing is big, especially with Dame one foot out the door. I could see Nance being a Jae Crowder type for them, which is maybe the glue they need.  And btw, I don't like the Blazers at all. Lillard and Portland can go fuck themselves after 2014 lmao"
"Why, let him play the perimeter on offence and stick him on the corner shooter on defence. He‚Äôs never going to be good on defence but he can bother whatever Joe Harris/Even Fournier/Jae Crowder guy better than he can defend against 6‚Äô10+ guys."
"Buddy Hield's contract is similarly bad lmfao, and Barnes doesn't put them over the top. Like if you asked me Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder or Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum maybe different story"
Russillo said it best.  Find me a front office that wouldn't trade a broken down Isaiah and Jae Crowder for Kyrie.
Royce O'Neal  Dorian Finney-Smith  Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder   Jerami Grant  Kawhi Leonard
"Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince, Demarre Carroll"
"It's pretty close, actually. The Suns and Bucks are getting roughly the same off-season that Denver and Boston got last year, and we saw what it did to those teams. The guys to really keep an eye on are the three who played in the Olympics this year, of course, but also 36 year old Chris Paul (who has only had long off-seasons before now), and Jae Crowder who also had a short off-season last year being a member of Miami's bubble team."
Marcus Morris or Jae Crowder?
I just had a look and Jae Crowder got an assist for his inbound pass game winner to Deandre Ayton in game 2 vs. Clippers this year (according to the espn play-by-play report)
"We literally did. We have Isaiah Thomas (who‚Äôs not in the league), Jae Crowder, and the pick that became Colin Sexton for Kyrie Irving.  You‚Äôre the casual"
Fluke or not they probably could have won if Jae Crowder could hit open shots
suns use a variety of on and off ball screens to get favorable mismatches so there was no marquee iso matchup like donovan mitchell/dame lillard/cj mccollum  but they did try posting jae crowder on him lol
"Bruh he could‚Äôve stopped with one dribble and the clock would‚Äôve ran out. Literally AD did the exact same thing last game against the Spurs, dribbled it out instead of taking the open dunk. Westbrook did it against the hawks in his 3rd year and got reamed for it by his coach and the other team, and he learned his lesson and expects others to follow as well. Bazley too young and shitty to be doing that stuff, Jae Crowder got laid out for the same shit a season or two ago."
Jae Crowder
"[This is a good way to actually gauge defensive performances](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630558/head-to-head/?sort=MATCHUP_FGA&amp;dir=1)  There's more context involved with help defence and stuff, and sometimes if a dude gets completely lost on a screen it the tracking doesn't pick it up as guarded by them. For the most part though, this paints a pretty accurate picture of a defensive performance.  Only on possessions when Davion guarded them:  * Devin Booker went 1-3 * Mikal Bridges went 1-2 * Jae Crowder went 0-1"
The Jae crowder special
get mad before you start losing in embarrassing fashion. It's a punk move. I was so pissed when Elfrid Payton pushed someone (i think Jae Crowder?) when the knicks were getting blown out 2 years ago. Or during the playoffs when Reggie Bullock was trying to do that fake tough guy shit in game 5. Trae weighs 78 pounds and he whooped your ass for 5 games straight after you talked shit. Man up on the basketball court or go into MMA if you wanna do that tough guy shit.
"Teams tend to behave differently when they don't own their pick.  Jae Crowder going immediately into the starting lineup for instance or us taking the much more polished Clarke over riskier projects like Bazley, Nassir Little, Keldon Johnson, or Kevin Porter."
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it‚Äôs guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc‚Ä¶ fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they‚Äôre my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
"The Winslow/Iggy/Crowder trade wasn't good, but giving up half a season of Jae Crowder for nothing isn't *THAT* terrible."
Losing Jae Crowder was the only negative part of that trade imo the flyer on Winslow was worth it
Mirror Jae Crowder maybe. Faried couldn't shoot or defend
Jae Crowder but yea it‚Äôs been a few years
Jae Crowder. Dude‚Äôs such a fake tough-guy.
If The Animal was a few years later he‚Äôd be Jae Crowder.
"He‚Äôs still bouncing around the league. He witnessed a murder , had to go into witness protection and the new name they gave him is Jae crowder"
"Lol yeah, elbowed him in the head and caused him to injure his knee when falling down. I hate Jae crowder, but even I can't defend that play."
jae crowder tries to injure everyone
"&gt; no one else should be wearing 99  Ah yes, the Jae Crowder dilemma"
Jae Crowder tries to injure LeBron and AD multiple times a game everytime he plays the Lakers
embiid  also kobe  edit  maybe jae crowder?
" After a physical layup or dunk absolutely you'll see guys hit the deck.  But my original comment was talking about guys that go to the ground for seemingly no reason. I mostly made the post about Jae Crowder who will be on his back on every three point attempt reguardless of it being contested or not.  The first guy who responded brought up Anthony Davis, who will ofter go to his back after wide open dunks. Even the Lakers announcers last night noted the fact that he is on the ground more than most players.  And whenever I see Davis on the ground it makes me think the worst due to his history.   I decided to argue with u/heynow16 because he is in every thread picking a fight and uses the idea that everyone hates Lakers fans to fuel his ignorance.   &gt;It‚Äôs ok. Everyone hates our team, we‚Äôre allowed to hate teams as well."
Jae crowder and Giannis is the first that came to mind
More like Jae Crowder or Robert Covington imo
"That picture of LeBron posting up Jae Crowder with Drummond on the bench imitating LeBron during Game 3 of the First Round last season going around with the caption ""Lakers are 0-whatever"" since this moment. Funny thing is the Lakers won that game though lol"
Hes got 2 great actors in CP3 and Jae Crowder on the team so I don't find it surprising
Jae Crowder says hello
Fk jae crowder. He does this all the time
"Jae Crowder, idk i just don like him"
Jae Crowder
but what about Jae Crowder Jumping forward 3 feet so Lebron can land on his feet?
Stupid Jae Crowder
"I have many. cam payne, jae crowder, jordan poole, jusuf nurkic, jj barea, pat bev, deandre jordan, james harden, kyle kuzma, raja bell, &amp; dahntay jones."
"What about the Jae Crowder jumping into Lebron? Is that natural shooting motion for a typical shooter? I don't think either side intended any maliciousness, but that was quite the ways Crowder travelled from a feet behind the 3pt line to a feet inside."
Jae Crowder was really the only appealing piece they had at that time.
"The 2018 Cavs had ancient DWade, pre-career revival DRose, Isaiah Thomas after his play fell off a cliff, Iman Shumpert, and Jae Crowder and turned that into Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, and George Hill."
he‚Äôs the perfect example of the guy you only love when he‚Äôs on your team lol. if you can root for markieff morris you‚Äôd fucking love jae crowder on your team
I fucking hate Jae Crowder so much
Nah that‚Äôs Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder. Love him though.
The Lakers played like trash all night and deserved to lose but the refs calling a kickout foul on Russ after Jae Crowder has shot all game like he is Superman trying to fly backwards is hilarious.
"LeBron has been trying to take charges and actually engaged, idk what game you‚Äôre watching. He‚Äôs also been in foul trouble and yet still remains our highest scorer. AD is being guarded by no one and maybe half of his shots by Jae Crowder and is 4-15 from the field. Westbrook has missed 2 layups. Carmelo is hogging .  Yeah but this is on LeBron lmao"
LeBron literally got a flagrant 1 today for slightly stepping under Jae Crowder lol. By the LeBron metric this deserves to be a flagrant 2
I think the Suns are becoming my fav western team. Just a fun team to watch. Plus I‚Äôll forever love Jae Crowder.
cp3 and jae crowder having a flop-off rn
Lakers fans showing without a doubt that they've never watched Jae Crowder actually take a jumpshot before. That's his regular form lol.
"On one hand it‚Äôs a foul, on the other it‚Äôs jae  crowder"
"Jae Crowder is my least favorite player in the NBA, both a flopper and dirty player"
jae crowder flopped
Lakers are making Jae Crowder look like Tony Parker right now
"Putting into a vaccume means simply stating something with no context in the situation, for example, lebron lost in the first round to Jae Crowder, that statement is technically true, it doesn't really tell the full story or paint the whole picture"
"Yeah, and honestly 2 years ago in the playoffs Bam wasn‚Äôt even our Giannis defender, that was Jae Crowder mainly, with a lot of help"
Jae Crowder
"The Rockets traded Harden for a bunch of late 1sts and expiring contracts.   The Wolves traded Butler for RoCo and Saric.  The Cavs traded Kyrie for a hobbled IT, Jae Crowder, and some picks.   When guys want out in season value is super reduced. You have to accept that. Especially for someone like Simmons who is such a tough fit in most places and has legitimate concerns regarding his mentality in the playoffs."
Jae Crowder can only shoot vs the Lakers

"Yea in the first quarter he was hitting his turnaround jumper and even hit a three, then when the second half started we ran pin downs for Jae crowder who didn‚Äôt hit a shot tonight lmaooo this team is unserious"
"How was it made by LeBron? Ya'll like to pull shit out of the air. After Kyrie got traded, they got a wash up Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder who forgot how to shoot, Ante Zizic. They then got Dwade and Rose in the offseason. They got guys who they could get with limited cap space. Ya'll like to make shit up about LeBron all the fucking time."
" Bro what?! You a casual? You don‚Äôt remember kyrie wanting out and it being a big ass story of them trading him to Cavs for kyrie???  Kyrie Irving Traded to Celtics for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Draft Pick, More  JOSEPH ZUCKER AUGUST 22, 2017 Bleacher Report  Isaiah Thomas Says Celtics Didn't Reveal Long-term Risk of 2017 Hip Injury  ROB GOLDBERG MAY 27, 2021   The Celtics were the No. 1 seed, just think about this, and Isaiah Thomas was dealing with a personal tragedy, the loss of his sister, but he was also dealing with an injury. They said it was in one place. It was not in that place. It ended up being in his hip. Therefore, when they traded him, he was already quote unquote damaged goods to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Remember, the trade was rescinded. The Cavs had to accept Isaiah Thomas injured. Once he went to the Cavs he was already hurt, he only played a handful of games there. The training staff of the Boston Celtics got let go because of it. Now, Isaiah Thomas, two teams later, is a substitute going into free agency injured. After now finally getting surgery. That cost him $100 million. No question about it.  -Jalen Rose"
"Melo is a perfectly fine winning player if you just need a bench sparkplug to get you points. Offense flagging, team‚Äôs stalled out, opposition on a 9-0 run, star locked up, you put Melo in to get you a bucket. It‚Äôs the role he played on the Blazers, and the same role LouWill, Clarkson, and Jamal Crawford play, just a bit taller. But Melo isn‚Äôt a spot-up shooter, and he‚Äôs not good enough on defense or efficient enough to be a starting role player- players like Jae Crowder, Danny Green, Marcus Morris, or prime Trevor Ariza are much better in this niche."
Jae Crowder cursed them sadly.
"This is exactly the reason I was thinking of. A deep playoff run doesn't help matters either.  They had eight guys play at least 60 games last season, and Saric was a pretty big part after his return from injury too. Then, their top eight guys played at least 20 of their 22 playoff games, too. That's incredible injury luck. Granted, the team is quite young outside of CP3 and Jae Crowder and now JaVale McGee, but it's still highly improbable they make it through all of next season without someone having to sit out a decent chunk of the season."
"I wonder if its annoying to Jae Crowder for Melo to be shuffling next to him while jabbing at his own head lol, i dunno its funny"
We‚Äôre gonna have the best bench in the league.   CP3/cam Payne/Elfrid Payton   Booker/shamet  Mikal bridges/cam Johnson  Jae crowder / cam Johnson /jalen smith  Ayton / jevale McGee / Frank kaminsky
Otto Porter- Carries his belongings   De‚ÄôAnthony Melton- Makes a mean grilled cheese   Jae Crowder- Crowds you on defense   Immanuel Quickley- A pretty fast dude
"2012 was really good- Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton, Jae Crowder, Mike Scott, Tomas Sataransky, Kyle O‚ÄôQuinn"
"I watched just over half of the Raptors games this season as I have a friend who is a fan, and I agree that OG is better offensively than Mikal. But you clearly didn't pay much attention as Mikal was so rarely used offensively, it was a real problem in many games (CP3/Book hero ball) despite Mikal having outrageously good stats in the clutch for most of the year. OG had the ball in his hands more than Mikal this year. Even Jae Crowder had the ball in his hands more this year. OG might have been more efficient but he would have had no stats to show for it.  Defensively, they're close to equal. OG defends stronger players better, but Mikal deals with speed better. For the Suns, we prefer Mikal because Ayton and Crowder handle strength defensively."
"Shane Battier kinda, Marion, Draymond, Jae Crowder, PJ Tucker, Lebron, Durant, Giannis, Simmons"
Jae Crowder
"A Miami team that was one Jae crowder short of their finals team? Lol. Lucked out by playing against the second best record in the league ?  Trae had one good game and when he got injured giannis got injured too. You bitching about injuries is extra stupid when you do it in a series where the bucks were injured too.  Literally every piece of criteria you can use suggests Milwaukee is an elite top 3 team and a championship caliber team. The only thing that can discredit them is hypotheticals made by fans regarding the health of other teams, and hypotheticals mean nothing. I can promise you, neither the NBA or the bucks give a single shit whether you value the legitimacy of their ring"
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
"But in all seriousness, It‚Äôs Dray and ***Iguodala*** with the Ice water in his veins.   Also, Rondo in the playoffs. Jae Crowder."
The GOAT podcast between Andrew Sharp and Ben Golliver once described Jae Crowder as the ballast of every team he's on which I think fits perfectly.  For those who don't know like me ballast is defined as either 'a heavy substance (such as rocks or water) placed in such a way as to improve stability and control (as of the draft of a ship or the buoyancy of a balloon or submarine)'.
"Jae ""99 Overall"" Crowder"
"The question talks about a *winning team*. I guess it depends by what we mean by winning. If we are talking championship, then I don't think Randle is good enough for the question.  I'll say something ridicolous to make myself clear: nobody would ask ""Zion or Jae Crowder?"" because we recognize that for this to be a valid question, the second player needs to be at a certain level. I just don't think Randle is at that level right now."
"It could've. Imagine the suns were missing Chris Paul, Cam Johnson, and Jae Crowder was just coming back from injury in the middle of the series and the nuggets were fully healthy. That series wouldn't be close either and y'all would have something to say about it"
Damn what happened with Jae Crowder? What happened with Jalen Brunson?   Maybe most of his rookies weren‚Äôt good‚Ä¶
"Depth can be gotten easily.  Guys like Jrue Holiday, Cameron Payne, Jae Crowder, Booby Portis, Brook Lopez who make the rest of the roster of championship level teams are traded, waived, or developed all the time.  Lakers won a championship with Caruso starting game 6, with guys like Rondo and Dwight Howard filling major roles on the team.    Philly should have said ""Take anything from our team except Embiid"" for Harden, and then built around those two."
Jae Crowder broke them when he salsa danced on them
Jae Crowder in shambles
"For starters, let's keep in mind that there are 150 starters in the league.  Danny Green is 34 years old on the decline of his career being used as a role 3&amp;D player.  He's certainly not top 120.  Jae Crowder averages 10/4/2 on fluctuating efficiency and he's not a starter.  Again, not top 120.  Tristan Thompson is not a starting caliber player and certainly not Top 120.  Reggie and Nerlens are both starting caliber on a handful of teams and they have *fantastic* team friendly deals--the latter to the point that there is a lawsuit about his agent not returning calls.   10-12 million for a legitimate starter is no the norm, and thinking a young player with lots of upside on that is incredibly out of touch.  The fact that you are using Danny Green, Crowder, and Thompson as examples shows how off base that is."
"https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/  Lets see, we got ...   Danny Green Jae Crowder Tristan Thompson Reggie Jackson Nerlens Noel"
"Yeah it would be any post with one of them and you'd get people saying ""I never know whether it's Jae Crowder or Kenneth Faried playing aha"" without fail like it's some top tier comedy"
Y‚Äôall had the same team minus Jae Crowder and got swept by the bucks lol
"&gt; You guys  My biggest issue here is that you're acting as if everyone in a fanbase has the same opinion on someone just because they support a certain team.   Just going off of your other replies, maybe that's because you support a player more than a team. Obviously if you support a player you're always supportive of the player? Whereas you can support a team and sometimes dislike players on the team (for example, I never liked Tristan Thompson or Jae Crowder, even when they were on the Celtics)."
jae crowder is either a straight bucket or straight brick. there‚Äôs no in between
Jae Crowder and Dwight are gonna get in at least one fight each time the Suns and Lakers match up
Luka Doncic  Devin Booker   Mikal Bridges   Jae Crowder  Clint Capela
"ayton is much harder to replace, although at times in the regular season bridges looked like he was just as good as ayton. jae crowder and cam johnson are good wings."
Jae Crowder...
Throw two wing defenders that can shoot next to them and you have the 2020 dynasty.  like say a Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder.
Who's up front though? Jae Crowder? Not going anywhere in the playoffs without a proper PF/C.
"So I'm assuming this includes all the way back to 99  Josh howard Devin Harris JJ barea Jalen brunson Dorian Finney smith Jae crowder   Dallas did fuck up big time though and really messed up. Especially in 2013. We had the 13th pick. Traded down to 16th to save money (missed out on Giannis) then traded down again to save more money (missed out on Schroeder) and ended up drafting Shane fucking Larkin at 18th (missing out on gobert)  And before you say we didn't scout those guys, we wanted Giannis and ended up going a different direction bc Cuban. Shroeder was being talked about in local media. And gobert was being touted as a sleeper pick by several Mavs centric outlets."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"I assume you‚Äôre talking the Raptors and Heat series the Nets at no point successfully walled him off, even in game 2 which was the one shitty game he had.  Are you sure you‚Äôve seen a basketball before? You‚Äôre definitely talking about the right sport here? The Brooklyn Nets, with I guess KD, Nicholas Claxton and the corpses of Blake Griffin and LMA, are more suited to defend Giannis than the Phoenix Suns with Deandre Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder (who was Giannis‚Äô primary defender on the 2020 Heat, a series you clearly remember well)? This is what I‚Äôm talking about, there‚Äôs skepticism and there‚Äôs delusion."
Or you gotta get a Jae Crowder type for similar money (adjusted to era).
Jae Crowder gonna feel right at home   Source: Marcus Morris
Jae Crowder at 10 million over Cam Johnson at 18 million unless Cam breaks out
"Book doesn't do himself any favors, either, with his antics. Although I think he will be more well-liked after the Olympics. Don't get me started on Jae Crowder."
PJ brings more to the table than his defense tho. He has that hustle and leader mentality that would uplift a team. Think of it like Jae Crowder. Valuable role player. Hard to replace with anyone esp some1 like semi.
lmao Fuck Jae Crowder.  IDK if I could ever have a worst experience with a player.
"jesus christ the suns haven't lost since fucking october, calm down now.  this defense is just too much, you got mikal bridges who might be the most terrifying perimeter defender since spurs kawhi, deandre ayton is one of the best perimeter guarding bigs, cp3 might not be the defender he was in his prime, but he can still get a crap ton of steals and play solid defense. you throw in jae crowder who is a great defender and it's a nightmare. this suns team was not a fluke, they did get a little lucky in the playoffs, but that's most finals teams. if both teams healthy i think this could be the western conference finals matchup, with the only other team maybe getting there being the lakers if lebron manages to rebuild his own team at the trade deadline."
Fuck Jae Crowder
Chris Paul and Jae Crowder. Losing to these guys is the worst.
Klay Thompson watching Jae Crowder: *I‚Äôm pussy?!*
jae crowder is a tough guy to take to the rim props to porter
"You have Chris Paul and Jae crowder on your team, calm down bud"
"Jae ""I'm gonna fucking tackle you in the air and you'll get a flagrant foul"" Crowder"
Jae Crowder is the greatest athlete in Arizona sports history with dreads
"Recent history, the only ""bad"" trade would be the Winslow trade. But I don't really consider losing Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill to be that bad. You can make the argument that we wasted cap space on Winslow, which is true, but we thought he might be the third piece of the puzzle with Ja and Jaren. Turns out he wasn't. In hindsight, it was ""bad"" because it didn't work out, but I understand what the idea behind it was."
"What the Lakers need is to tell Anthony Davis that they need him to be that center.   They need to look at the Heat with Bam, Butler and Lowry and be like AD, James and Westbrook should be a better version of that.   I think that was the game plan but Trevor Ariza injury had stopped that lineup as I think he was going to play a PJ Tucker/Jae Crowder type of role."
"This year is just like Book's year was last year for Zach. The Bulls were pretty good last year, but not quite a playoff team (partly because Zach caught COVID at the worst possible time and came back and couldnt find his range for a bit).  The year before last, the Suns were not very good, but then they were the Bubble darlings. Then they got CP3 and Ayton matured and they got Jae Crowder and everything fell into place, and they had a very fortunate playoff run. Not taking away from their accomplishment, but that's a fact. I am *not* saying they wouldnt have made the Finals if Jamal Murray / Kawhi / AD/Bron were healthy. I am just saying they took advantage of that.  This year the Bulls are on a similar path so far in terms of... They might not go to the Finals, but they're a really, really damn good team with a ton of weapons and options, and Zach and DeMar are clearly the head of the spear, just as Book and CP3 are for the Suns. Vuc+Caruso+Lonzo makes for a really good supporting cast around those two, just as the Suns supporting cast works really well for CP3/Book.   If you just compare the stats head to head it's really not that close between LaVine and Book, and Book did nothing before CP3 arrived in PHX.  Last year:  Player A: 27, 5, and 5 on 51/42/85, .8 steals, .5 blocks.  Player B: 26, 4, and 4 on 48/34/87, .8 steals, .2 blocks.  this year:  Player A: 25, 5, 4 on 48/39/87, .5 steals, .3 blocks.  Player B: 24, 5, 4 on 45/41/85, 1 steal, .3 blocks.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Player A is Zach. Objectively the better shooter/scorer, objectively the better athlete. His team was worse last year but he was the better player."
Its that easy. Why don't they just go to the 3&amp;D wing store and just pick one up?  I heard if you buy a Jae Crowder you get a Robert Covington 50% off.
The only fouls I hate called is when players extend their arms all the way with the ball and lift them up to draw fouls and players jumping 4ft forward on their jump shots. Like Jae Crowder/Harden bro do you really need to fall on every jump shot.
"Fair enough, Okoro is built a lot more sturdily though and I think that lets him play up more than Thybulle‚Äôs length does. Think like Jae Crowder"
"Covington was a better player 2+seasons ago.   Before coming to Portland, he's averaged double digits points since his 2nd season.  He's been known as a tier 1 to tier 1.5 defender for a long time.  He's just not aging well, for whatever reason.  His defensive instincts are usually good, but his foot speed/lateral quickness isn't keeping up.  His offense is becoming more and more only 3s.  He shot like 45% from 2pt range last year with us.  He's at 50% this season (still bad for a forward), but on a measly one attempt a game.  Idk if it's scheme, confidence, or age.  But he's not really the player we traded for.  He isn't bad, but we really need that 10-14pt player instead of this 6pt player.  He at the least needs to be able to dunk the ball as a cutter which he isn't doing anymore.  I think missing those 2 open dunks in the playoffs messed with his head.  He's a decent player, he's paid appropriately.  We just needed him to be more for our starting forward and someone traded 2 picks for.  Jae Crowder is better and has been for 2 seasons."
**JAZZ LEGEND JAE CROWDER..!!**
"What people thought Robert Covington was at one point is exactly what Jae Crowder is, so give me Jae"
"We were talking about where people draw fouls. I said KATs shot profile is more outside, and it is. He takes 37.5% of his shots from deep to Embiids 23%.   Embiid overall takes about 10 FTA per game to KATs 5 (I'm rounding). KAT and Embiid take the same amount of FTA on drives (2), Embiid takes 2.6 FTA on post ups to KATs 0.3.   That's 4.6 FTA per game on drives and post ups for Embiid, and 2.3 FTA per game for KAT. Another 5 FTA per game for Embiid are coming from other areas of the midrange. And and a chunk of those possessions would be situations where KAT is posted up outside the arc. In general, people get fouled less on 3s than they do on 2s (unless you're Jae Crowder last season üòÇ).   His shot profile contributes to th FT disparity. Does it make up for it 100%? No, but they're different players, but it definitely contributes to it as there numbers on drives and post ups doesn't make up for the disparity in attempts"
Jae Crowder
my guess would be Cam Payne or Jae Crowder
&gt; That game where they kept going at Jae Crowder and clowning him was so disrespectful.   Jae Crowder is incredibly dirty and piece of shit on the court so he deserved all that lol. Dude is the definition of a clown if you've been following this league for even more than a year
ask phoenix what happens when the lakers are smiling and laughing  \-cue up jae crowder salsa dance-
That game where they kept going at Jae Crowder and clowning him was so disrespectful. For that PHX-LAL series to end the way it did was clearly karmic justice
Same shit last year in the playoffs. Dude was dancing and fucking around on Jae Crowder and ultimately lost in the first round.
Mills not going for that layup and Nets not securing that rebound just for Jae Crowder to make that bucket was the dagger
"AD isn‚Äôt as good of a 3pt or midrange shooter as people think he is.  Duncan was definitely a better midrange shooter than AD, and there‚Äôs no way someone like Jae Crowder would be able to guard him in his prime.  How are you measuring shot creation? You could give Duncan the ball on any play and he‚Äôd get a decent shot or pass out of a double team."
"We had 2 bigs in the Finals. One of them tore his acl after game 2 and the other one got into foul trouble. We were literally putting 6'6"" Jae Crowder on fucking Giannis. And 1. It's an absolute fact, toxic-ass.      Imagine being so insecure you have to try everything in your power to invalidate a team who has zero rings"
1. Frank Kaminsky 2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul 4. Deandre Ayton 5. Mikal Bridges  6. Cam Johnson 7. Cam Payne 8. Jae Crowder 9. Javale McGee 10. Landry Shamet
You mean there were no ‚ÄúJae Crowder career ending injury‚Äù threats per the norm????
"The main event of the night, Draymond vs Jae Crowder"
My god I just remembered how ass Jae Crowder was for the Cavs
"We suck yes - but it‚Äôs a stream of shitty luck with catching teams who desperately need a win, or seeing sub-25% shooters from 3 go 5 for 9. It‚Äôs nauseating and bizarre, and of course we‚Äôre responsible for a lot of it, but it‚Äôs like watching a curse play out. The main thing, though, is a total lack of maturity and no defensive anchor. Dillon‚Äôs been out for all but a few games, and even though he‚Äôs a monster, he‚Äôs not the mature leader we‚Äôre going to follow. We don‚Äôt have the veteran keeping everybody on point, calling out assignments and forcing discipline. We‚Äôre YOUNG and we get dejected in a flash. It‚Äôs going to be a rough year, and I‚Äôm afraid our devotion to the long-view, shedding any veteran and playing unprepared rookies 20 mins a game, may backfire and destroy confidence. In short - bring back Jae Crowder."
Cam Payne  Cam Johnson  Jae Crowder  Lebron  Dario Saric  My bad I just put prime lebron with all the suns role players averaging under 10 ppg
"Bro these guys aren‚Äôt bums lmao  Rondo is an all star and great playmaker, Korver is one of the best shooters ever, Jae Crowder was an elite 3&amp;D guy and DJ was literally first team all nba and one of the best lob threats ever  And prime LeBron who is arguably the best guy to ever play"
LeBron Draymond Thybulle Caruso Jae Crowder
The Jae Crowder experience
"The nice thing about teams figuring out how to slow that down is that CP3 and Book, elite passers, have an elite lob threat, an elite cutter, and... Jae Crowder as release valves on the trap."
Him and Jae Crowder are the league introverts for sure
Jae Crowder is 99
Remember when Jae Crowder got kicked out of a playoff game for doing Lebron‚Äôs commercial salsa dance? Pepperidge Farms remembers‚Ä¶.
"sure but both morris and beverly have intentionally injured other players, if that doesn‚Äôt bother u then jae crowder putting on some slight acting to win a game shouldn‚Äôt bother u either"
Jae Crowder can fuck right off
CP3 probably had his most egregious pass out of a wide open shot moment this season in the 3rd when he was wide open for a pull up 14 footer and instead threw the ball out of bounds trying to thread it to Jae Crowder
"GGs, fuck Jae Crowder, Suns are a really good team but man the flopping was pretty offputting"
"Jae ""foot on the line"" Crowder"
Jae Crowder is the biggest whiner/actor in the league. Fuck that guy
Nowhere near his face. Jae crowder can fuck right off
Jae Crowder and Cameron Johnson getting superstar calls. What a time to be alive.
"DG literally walks next to them with his hands straight up without touching them and gets two fucking consecutive fouls called on Cam Thomas and Jae Crowder, god damn man they're rawdogging us"
The only Suns player who's missed an FG so far is Jae Crowder lmao
Cp3 and dbook are obnoxious floppers. I'd hate that team a lot more if mikal and Jae crowder weren't there. Beating the clippers helps too
"Mook is still alive in our hearts. Sometimes on a cool summer evening, the breeze rolls through, and I can hear it whisper *""Jae Crowder has female tendencies""*"
"Fuck Kyrie. Fuck Benamin. Fuck Vince Carter. Fuck Kobe. Fuck LeBron. Fuck Paul Pierce. Fuck Jae Crowder and his hockey number. Fuck the Lakers. *FFFFUUCK THE CELTICS*, and **FUCK BROOKLYN!!**   *PETTY*"
"Because CP3, Booker and Jae Crowder are all dirty whiners."
Me personally I hate Jae Crowder
"They have a trifecta of dirty players that people kinda dislike: CP3, Booker and Jae crowder. Also, it's not totally fair, but easy to discredit their playoff run since all the teams they beat had a star or two injured."
"Chris Paul is dirty, Devin Booker is dirty, and Jae crowder is dirty.   Plus just CP3 being such a little bitch. That‚Äôs why for me at least"
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
Jae crowderü§ÆCP3s stupid mid rangeü§Æbooker looks annoyingü§Æ
I hope Jae Crowder gets championship blue balled the rest of his career. Love that he was in the finals 2 years in a row just to lose. Never want him to win.
"On Chris Vernon's Show yesterday, he was speculating that with how young the team is, they are getting caught up in being young kids and not being professional basketball players. With COVID last year and half of the previous season, these guys are finally allowed to go out and be 20 year olds. They were cooped up in their hotel rooms all last season and finally have some freedom.  No idea if that's true or not, but it's definitely an interesting speculation. We don't really have any vocal veteran leaders. Adams is 28, but he's not a vocal leader. Same with Kyle Anderson. Those aren't the guys who get everyone to do the right thing. Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill were HUGE for us in Ja's rookie season in being those older vets to show the young guys the ropes.   If this team is locked in, they can beat anyone. But god damn, can they also lose to anyone."
in order of importance  1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Deandre Ayton  5. JaVale McGee  6. Cam Johnson  7. Cam Payne  8. Jae Crowder (Dario Saric if he was healthy)
"Yeah I don't think our team was ever on edge around anyone more than JR Smith in recent years. You'd probably have to go back to Wade and the Heatles years to find someone more distrusted by the Celtics.  He earned his reputation and his short leash.  And on the note of that JR/Crowder hit linked in the video, Jae landed awkwardly, suffered an ACL sprain and he was still noticeably slower the next season.   LeBron might have caused more blood but JR caused a lot more damage.  &gt;save the Lakers over $500K in luxury tax money in the process  Although this I can agree is stupid if true. The team shouldn't benefit at all from league fines."
* Devin Booker * CP3 * Deandre Ayton * Jae Crowder * Mikal Bridges * Cam Payne * Cam Johnson * Javale Mcgee
coulda told you that during the playoff meltdown last year where he let his team play 4v5 for extended periods cause he was sick of playing against the suns and getting bullied by jae crowder
"He was full on holding lebron‚Äôs hand, fingers locked and everything and lebron ripped it away. It‚Äôs not like JR‚Äôs spinning back fist that knocked out jae crowder lol"
I mean to be fair that DeanBlandino user is a moron. Elsewhere in this comment section he‚Äôs been shouting about how Jae Crowder hates LeBron so much that he *intentionally sabotaged his own career* out of spite.
Lots of guys. Isaiah Thomas looked rough but was like 6 months removed from being arguably the best offensive player in basketball. Jae Crowder had a lot of value and was one on the bets contract in the NBA. Shumpert was pretty solid.   The Lakers roster is shambles. Who the hell has value on this roster? THT and maybe Nunn or Monk 2 guys who are mid-level contract players that were out of Charlottes and Miami's rotation last season.
Jae Crowder is dirty
"As a Cavs fan, fuck Jae Crowder"
"We‚Äôre missing that Crowder type, except Crowder isn‚Äôt all that great. Jerami is the same role as Jae but a million times better. I wanted to give the Giannis money ‚Äî that Riley should‚Äôve known wasn‚Äôt going to get Giannis ‚Äî to a combo of Jerami and Wood."
It‚Äôs weird how Jae Crowder didn‚Äôt fit next to LeBron. What was happening at the time with him? All I remember from that season was ‚Äúwait until we get IT‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôll flip the switch.‚Äù Everything else is a blur.
For the cavs Jae crowder shot so many long toe-on-the-line two pointers
"We wouldn‚Äôt have received the treasure that is Jae Crowder without this move, so I approve. Jae is the man!"
Jae Crowder has consistently won in every team he has been to besides the Cavs.   Jordan Clarkson is a 6MOY player.   Rose is now closing games with the Knicks.
"Search ""Jae crowder 4 point play"" on youtube. They're almost  never (none that I saw in any case) behind the line. I think he was one of the major reason for rule changes"
"that's how people thought Jae Crowder was a great shooter. He'd shoot 1/13 when the game is close (on wide open shots btw), and then go 4/5 in the 4th when we're up 20"
"It was something like:  OUT:  Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert  IN:  Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr,  Rodney Hood, George Hill,"
"Ok, but how well does he do it? That matters more than just being put on the best player lol. I mean, someone has to guard those guys every game.  I don't watch the Suns so I'm actually asking how well he does it. All-Defense is saying you're one of the 3 best at your position (theoretically, since we know narrative exists). Is he that? Defensive RAPTOR likes him, but idk how reliable that stat is, and his own teammate Jae Crowder is definitively above him in that stat, let alone other players on other teams."
You can easily make the argument that Curry wasn't even the best player on his own team in any final he ever player. Dude has done nothing but choke in every big moment in his entire career.    Just the fact that you are even bringing up Barnes as the reason for them losing the 2016 finals is completely insane. He was what? the fifth best player on that team? That's like blaming Jae Crowder the suns didn't win last year.
"Yes, you‚Äôre right. That‚Äôs what good teams do, they build around their star players. But I could also argue that Kyrie had his best seasons with LeBron. AD had a great season in 2020, playing with LeBron.   JR Smith, Caruso, Channing Frye, Richard Jefferson all played well with LeBron. Of course other players have not such as Jae Crowder, Rose, and Isaiah Thomas."
"&gt; There was a list, i don't even know what list it was, but DeRozan was number 82 on that list. Ask me how I know.  It was one of ESPN's pre-season player rankings which are constantly filled with controversial choices - for the reasons you already mentioned. IIRC they had Jae Crowder above him lol"
"Here you go. The thrice a week post about KAT not getting enough touches.   I have to post this over and over: 1.	KAT can't post up or overpower his defenders. He just can't. Once you defend him on the post and you get to the position first, he's basically neutered there.  2.	KAT can't also and don't shoot over smaller defenders. It's fucking baffling. When teams front him with Nic Batum or Jae Crowder, he's out.  3.	KAT also won't shoot low FG% shots. It's why on games where he's defended heavily, his point total and attempts are much less.    Game yesterday, KAT was being defended heavily after that sequence so DLo was supposed to ""exploit"" it. Dumbass DLo just isn't that good, so it didn't work. Ant knows he wasn't getting shots so he was setting up people instead.  Timberwolves team is not good, but KAT is part of the problem."
"Cole Anthony, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry, Larry Nance Jr, Claxton, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland are all 2nd generation."
"You all will figure it out! It reminds me of us after we lost Jae Crowder at the beginning of last year. Our defense was just never as swarming. You can‚Äôt really replace PJ, but I think the East is wide open unless Kyrie comes back."
"Remember when Bron got out played by Jae crowder in playoffs, yet Lakers fans blamed Kuzma for being eliminated by suns"
"lol thanks, a lot of these Lakers are always fucking ridiculous with their NBA takes and like to shit on other teams/deflect criticism when things aren't going perfectly for the Lakers. Like in my opinion, the Suns have just about everything you need in highly-seeded playoff team, a PG that can run an offense and hit shots in the clutch (CP3), a true three level scorer (DBook), multiple wings and forwards who can play defense and stretch the defense on the offensive side of the ball (Mikal, Jae Crowder, Cameron Johnson, Saric), a good two way center (Ayton), and overall good depth in for Guards and Centers (Payne, Elfrid Payton, Javale, Frank the Tank). You can just tell this team has pieces and chemistry to make another deep run in the playoffs if their core guys are able to stay healthy when it matters most."
"&gt;""A decade of stagnation"" is such a reductionist and lazy take. There's no way we would have extended him for 4/$54m if he was as disappointing as you seem to believe. He's been genuinely brilliant at times for us, and still has value in this league.  I've never doubted he's a good player.  But you seem to think has value = worth a first.  Guys like Danny Green, PJ Tucker, Jordan Clarkson and Jae Crowder have all been traded for less.  Danny Green + offloading 30m in bad money = a 1st.  Ross still has value in the league, but a 1st is a ludicrous price for a bench spark plug.  Why would teams spend a full 1st on a role player when there are comparable decent players available for cheaper?  Would you put Terrance Ross on the same level as someone like Clint Capela?  Because Atlanta only spent a 1st on Capela.  &gt;Him ""realising his full potential"" - whatever that is - is also a moot point. Who cares.  &gt;The only thing that matters is the player that he's become.   100% agree and that's exactly what I've been saying.  You kept saying he could be this, he could be that.    *""I could certainly see one of the main contenders rolling the dice and giving up what would be a late 1st rounder.""*  ...  *""what TRoss could bring to the right team""*   Who cares?  Teams don't roll the dice on 30 year olds. His value is entirely based on his past production. Potential doesn't factor in.  He is what he is, which is decent but still not worth a 1st."

"If you‚Äôre the worst defender among Chris Paul, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton, that doesn‚Äôt really say a ton tbh, you could range from pretty good to atrocious. Booker is closer to the pretty good end."
Jae Crowder and Joe Ingles must be on that team as well.
Jae Crowder jus leaving Bridges on the ground back there lmao
Not sure if it‚Äôs been said but Jae Crowder
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
Jae Crowder
Honestly the toughest guy right now in the nba is probably Jae Crowder
"It's funny how a team will get a Morris or a Jae Crowder or Pat Bev and then those fans suddenly believe that guy has never done anything wrong in his life, lol."
"There's the Cameron Payne incident and the Kanter one which are both bad looks for Jokic. He's also gotten into it with Westbrook, Beverly, Dwight, Jae Crowder, and Meyers Leonard, but he was mostly responding to an altercation against those players."
"&gt; If Jokic was less liked I think he would be getting more shit  I think it's more that it was a Morrii. If that's like Jae Crowder - somebody who has a reputation as a tough player, but nothing quite like the Morrii - I think everybody piles on Jokic more. The Morris Bros have been annoying for years, but I was still surprised at how positive the reaction was towards Jokic."
This is like when y‚Äôall wanted him suspended for an accidental elbow on Jae crowder in the finals
Pls no. I don‚Äôt wanna have to go through my boy Jae ‚ÄúTrae‚Äù Crowder
Except they almost always go by the letter of the law not the spirit of the law with this rule.  When elfrid payton shoved jae crowder last season JJJ got suspended for a game for taking 3 steps off the bench on the other side of the court to where the scuffle was happening.  Wouldn't surprise me to see a superstar getting special treatment though.
"Have we ever seen Montrez, Faried, Jae Crowder, or DeMarre Carrol in the same room together?"
"The first rounder was probably most valuable, but what it comes down to is that Boston wouldn‚Äôt accept the trade if Jae Crowder isn‚Äôt included. So to me that makes him not a throw in. Especially considering they were playing 20+ minutes a game from the start, I think that shows Boston thought highly of him."
He‚Äôs 27 and averages 6/2/1.5 lmfao. Jae Crowder just signed for 9M/year and is a hell of a lot better. Get real.
"Jae Crowder tricked everyone with his offensive capability. Dude is a liability on offense. In his 11-year career (before this season), he only shot 45% FG and up twice, but shot 36% and under four times. One of those times above 45% was during his post-trade regular season with the Heat, so not a full season + the bubble weirdness. The very season before that was one of his 36% seasons, so it's not like those shooting days are far behind him.  In the Heat bubble playoffs, he shot 40% from two and 34% from three. That's bad. If you take away his one good playoff series (the Bucks), his percentages are somehow even worse -- it's not like he shot as ""well"" as 40/34 for the whole playoffs, he had one series *raise* his numbers to those percentages.  Jae often took more shots than Duncan. ""But Jae was open!"" Yeah, wonder why opposing professional basketball players, coaches, and strategists left him open? Not sure how to check, but I wouldn't be surprised if a contested Duncan three is a higher percentage shot than a wide-open Jae three from the bubble playoffs.  Maybe with Chris Paul setting him up this year he can be a better shooter, but as a Heat fan, the thing that frustrated me most last year was Jae having the green light."
I mean Jae Crowder got 14 offers. And you guys got him lol.
Plus a smaller PF like Jae Crowder
"Don't worry, Jae Crowder will be starting on a finals team with a flaming basketball as it's logo for the second straight year :)"
Jae Crowder attempted over 10 threes a game against the bucks???
&gt;&gt; ~~I sifted through and found what combined to be the most lucrative starting opportunity and the most talented starters~~ I struggled with 14 contract offers.  - Jae Crowder
"Because this team has a lot of mouths to feed.   CP3, Booker, Mikal, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, Payne, etc. have been taking turns in getting their shots. This team is still trying to find a healthy balance of shot distribution."
"He‚Äôs intensity on the defensive end is amazing and offensively has been lights out from 3 this year so far while being able to create his own shot if needed and create for others. Whether he starts or comes off the bench he will play insane amounts of minutes  This might be a hot take but as a heat fan, I think at the end of the year I think we look back and prefer Avery Bradley to jae crowder despite jae crowder playing incredibly well for us"
Jae crowder 14 job offers  Giannis 1 job offer.  Crowder &gt; Giannis confirmed.
"Obviously i can't relate to jae crowder but picking between multiple offers is nerve-racking, especially if you don't want to disappoint your previous employer."
That's Jae Crowder dude
In no way is Jae Crowder hoping you feel sorry for him lmao.
Damn that must be so tough to get 14 millionaire job offers. My condolences to Jae Crowder.
I love the narrative that hes an unassuming guy. He almost lost us the Suns game trying to prove a point to Jae Crowder
JAE CROWDER HAS THE BEST CONTRACT IN THE LEAGUE
"Could you imagine if Jae Crowder, Taurean Prince and Demarre Caroll were in the same game?"
"Does this sound like a lottery team to you?  Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio, Jae Crowder, Dante Exum, Derrick Favors, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html)"
"Dragic, Smart, Joe Harris, Jae Crowder"
Jae Crowder might know
"I always get confused with Kennet Faried,DeMare Carroll,Jae Crowder and Taurean Price lmao!"
"Duncan didn't. Jae Crowder was on fire ever since we had traded for him. Nunn was god awful in the bubble, dude couldn't even see the fuckin floor. Meyers Leonard went from starter to unplayable.  Dragic and Jimmy are guys who have had big moments in the playoffs and can elevate their play. Tyler played good, but his per 36 was pretty much identical. Only difference is he played 7 more minutes lol"
"So nobody else in the bubble was tired? And Jimmy did all the work despite the fact that he wasn't the lead scorer leading up to the finals, Goran was. Not to mention Jae Crowder, Iggy, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn. Not what I would call hero ball"
Along with Trezz and Jae Crowder
Ah shit I thought that was jae crowder this whole time
Now they're saying it was Jae Crowder
"Wasn't he a Rocket too at one point? Seems to be a real mercenary, similar to Jae Crowder."
I can atest to the Jae crowder turning into Klay Thompson üò≠
Jae Crowder seems like he always goes off against the raps
When Jae Crowder signed with Phoenix I had a sigh of relief. He was trouble in Miami
Just got out of jail recently and I'm trying to catch back up with the NBA. Is Jae Crowder the best shooter in the NBA?
"Jae Crowder can guard Giannis but not Siakam, lol."
"&gt;DJJ and Meyers  They were barely part of the playoff rotation. I should have been more precise with my language.  &gt;Herro had some good performances but it was quite consistent with what he has shown in the regular season. Goran, Jimmy and Bam have played at a high caliber all season. Jae Crowder as well.  Right, so they would qualify as ""met or exceeded expectations."""
"Thats not really true at all. DJJ and Meyers leonard fell out of the rotation mid-way. Herro had some good performances but it was quite consistent with what he has shown in the regular season. Goran, Jimmy and Bam have played at a high caliber all season. Jae Crowder as well. He was hot from 3 and then he cooled off which is regression back to the mean."
Did they? Or did the long layoff mean we didn't know how good the Heat were until the playoffs? Remember they only had Jae Crowder and Iggy for a few games before the season was suspended. They only started Bam at center once the bubble started. They only started Dragic in the playoffs. Bam and Herro as young players had months to improve. I think the real story is that the Heat pre bubble and during the bubble is a different team
"One of Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, or Cam Johnson"
Booker Ayton  Cp3 Mikal Cam Johnson  Jae crowder  Cam payne (yes over saric)
"The crazy thing is that they also have other valuable players like Kendrick nunn, who I expect to get there by the end of the season, precious achiuwa, who looks like a promising young defender, Andre iguodala, who provides veteran leadership, defense, and shooting, Myers Leonard, a strong center who can shoot threes, and mo harkless, who is a solid 3 and d player. This is after losing derick Jones jr, Jae crowder, and Solomon hill in free agency. If they were able to bring those guys back they would be 15 men deep."

"And Derrick Rose... and Isaiah Thomas... and Jae Crowder... what an absolute disaster of a team. Ty Lue had horrible rotations that year... Crowder at the 4 was absolutely horrible.  The de facto lineup was Crowder at the 4 and Love at the 5... Jae at 6'6"" would just get punished by bigger players like LaMarcus Aldridge. Love/Thompson was much better."
"I remember seeing a meme right after all those trades that killed me. something like ""D rose, D goes. D wade, get out D way. iman shump, hop skip and jump. jae crowder, clam chowder, don't matter"" idk sounds dumb as hell now but that shit got me at the time lmaoo"
"Since when is you‚Äôre word gospel?  Boston has the worst bench I‚Äôve ever seen, Philly is tough yet we play them very well, nets while have the stars play zero defense. The loss of Jae crowder is seriously underrated for miami.  We were a 4 seed last year without Vic, who is balling out. I see no reason why if things go right we can‚Äôt be that or better."
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
"Now that they're teammates, I wonder if Jae Crowder still feels salty about Booker dropping 70 on his ass"
"Some thoughts:  Clippers came out the gate and punched the Suns in the mouth. That first quarter was a brutal beatdown. Suns were as careless with the ball as they have been in the past few games but this time they were being careless around several of the best perimeter defenders in the league. That carelessness transitioned into tired, scrambling defense and the Clippers hit the open 3s we gave them.  PG13 might be the streakiest shooter in the NBA with Klay sidelined. He can have games where he's ice cold and others, like tonight, where he is a flamethrower. I think outside the first quarter the Suns did a pretty good job contesting his shots (DA was in his grill for a decent number of his 3s) but those lapses in the first quarter already started the fire.  Mikal's impact was limited by the Clippers. They closed out on him well and closed off his usual slashing. He had a couple of great blocks but the Clippers game planned well to force him off of their wings and he really didn't fight any of those screens.  Jae Crowder was a great defender on Kawhi. He matches Kawhi's physicality well and while he's not as fast as him he has good footwork to keep in front of him. We could have used a little more shooting from him though.  I think this was Booker's first good game of the season. I know he's put up decent numbers but he's come into this year looking sloppy. He only had a couple turnovers which has been a huge issue for him this year and felt like he was actually dialed into the offense.  Cam Johnson probably had one of his worst games of his career tonight. He was taking good shots in theory but when you're cold it's not always a good idea to hoist it up; even if you're open. We were struggling all around but he burned a lot of possessions trying to shoot himself out of a bad night.  Deandre Ayton had a good night. His offensive rebounding and presence in the post really helped the Suns rally there after the rough start. I know he had a negative plus minus but he was out there for a lot of the Clipper's beatdown on the second unit which primarily came from the perimeter rather than anyone Ayton was handling.  It was impressive to watch CP3 pick up Paul George in the second half. He plays some really scrappy defense and you can tell that he got under PG's skin a little which led to the flare up between him and Book. Personally I don't have a problem with people getting heated in a game like that. The Suns were gunning to get back into it and I'm sure the Clippers felt a huge urgency to close it out due to the heat they've received from the media about being chokers. I don't think anyone did anything too out of line and I'd say it was a good game.  The Clippers really need some kind of shot creation outside of a PG13 iso or a Kawhi iso. It works when one of them is hot but there is very little contribution from 3/5 of the guys on the court. Kennard, Ibaka, and Batum all hit huge 3s which definitely helped them win the game but I would like to see them more engaged in the offense. It felt like they are only allowed to touch the ball if they are a) getting a dribble back for Kawhi or PG13 or b) shooting a 3 after a pass from one of their stars. I know its become a pretty common occurrence on teams with two superstars (like the Houston system) but I feel like it's a really stagnant style to play.  Glad I didn't turn this one off because the Suns of the past few years have definitely conditioned me to turn off a game after a quarter like that and grab the whiskey."
Cam is great! Took a jump in the bubble and maybe took another tiny one before this season. He Should be our starting PF and closing all our games. But we play jae crowder over him because something something he was a role player in the finals last year. Its not to say crowder is a bad player because everyone knows he's a super solid role player. But Cam is just better than him. any night like tonight cam plays 9 minutes less than jae monty is making a big lineup mistake.
"and since DA has 5 for us, jae crowder is our 5"
I'm surprised the Lakers didn't go get Jae Crowder. As good of a Kawhi stopper there is
90% of Jae Crowder FG are assisted. you need someone who can create his shot unless you expect Lebron to handle all possessions.
Jae Crowder is arguable.
"Thank you.   Adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder cannot be under stated though. It‚Äôs similar to an 8 seed adding those two, which is huge."
Jae Crowder was playing basketball the exact way we needed him to though.  ...it‚Äôs just he started doing it last year for Miami in the bubble.  ...A little bit late...
"Brogdon most likely gets it done but i think there‚Äôs worse players out there that would still win it. Say if Lebron averages 25 we need someone who averages 11-12 points (x7). Lebron probably needs a spacer, would someone like Jae Crowder be crazy?"
"To improve on the team that made the ECF last season we really just need Kemba healthy. The Jays have stepped up in a big way. Tatum, Brown and (healthy) Kemba is looking like a really strong top 3.   To take the next step, we're one starting level wing short and it means we're asking for a lot from everyone. We're relying on our top-end talent having huge nights every night and we play a lot of bad lineups that end up costing us games.    All of our main bench players are individually good when they're playing with the starters. The issue is when we play our bench players with other bench players.   Grant Williams is a great example, he looks good playing next to Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum. He looks pretty bad when he's playing next to 2-3 other Grant Williams.    We could chase a secondary star, but even just 1 decent wing would take a lot of pressure off our guys.   Eg:  * Robert Covington * Otto Porter Jr * Jae Crowder * Harrison Barnes * Terrence Ross * etc etc  Our bench players are good fill-ins but 1 more starting wing would mean we don't have to play so many lineups that have a bench majority."
"Westbrook definitely overhated but this take is just crazy to me. Wins are a team stat unless Jae Crowder is one of the best players in the league because he has more wins.   The efficiency is just not even close. Jokic's numbers come from efficent play whereas Westbrook is taking less efficient shots to get his numbers and they're still worse than Jokic.     That's not playing favorites, Westbrook is still a good player but it's obvious why his numbers would be viewed less favorably than Jokic"
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
Prince + a few mins work to meet the necessary salary range. People forget we‚Äôre paying Prince 12m/year. You only need to hit like 15m to match.  Sixers could do the same with Danny Green who makes 15.5m. Danny Green + Mike Scott = 20m.  Pacers could do Jeremy Lamb + Doug McDermott as filler.  Suns could do Dario Saric + Jae Crowder or one of them + Jalen Smith + a few mins
"While LeBron is gradually declining with his athleticism, I‚Äôm pretty sure he wouldn‚Äôt be getting blocked like that if he really used his full athletic ability and energy, and his athletic ability is still top 10 in the nba. He just tries to use as minimal of it as he can to conserve his energy, avoid possibilities of injuries, and not to run out of gas/stamina because he does get tired quick these days. Just 2 months ago he was effortlessly driving to the rack on Jae Crowder, Bam, Jimmy Butler. So he will go back to that again in the playoffs."
"Those are alright, what pisses me off is when Jae Crowder or Jevon Carter settle for fuckin contested midrange moving shots instead of dumping it down to Ayton."
"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs Kristaps and then Jaren Jackson Jr, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd place him specifically but my boy Jae Crowder has definitely gotta be in the top 5-7 for PF‚Äôs in the west"
Jae Crowder? Lol
"How the hell do NBA officials call a foul every damn time a player flops after launching a three **and still not call** Jae Crowder getting whacked on a three in the last minute?  Could any random collection of people off the street -- who don't require seeing-eye animals -- in fact do a better job than these people are?  I think so.  I'm neutral for this game, but when, exactly, is Monty McCutchen going to be fired for this on-going disaster?"
"In Miami‚Äôs situation, trade Kendrick Nunn for Kyle Lowry. No trading draft picks nor bigs for an expiring contract. Matching his contract would be less of a concern because it‚Äôs his final contractual season. Like Jae Crowder, he‚Äôll be used in the playoffs before becoming a free agent.  Regarding age, Iguodala was a beast at 36 in the ECF. The point in adding Lowry to the Heat roster would be to compensate for Dragic in case of injury, actually adding depth."
Coming from a Heat fan I almost forgot Crowder doesn‚Äôt play for us nor the Jazz anymore.  Im thinking Jae wasn‚Äôt making his teammates case any better in front of the ref
Crowder crying for the technical is sooo Jae crowder
"Yeah absolutely. I do think Grant leaving was the best move for him, it moreso sucks that you weren‚Äôt able to get an equivalent replacement. A guy like Jae Crowder wouldve been perfect, only 9 million, and content in that role. He was still available after Grant signed for Detroit too."
2 JAE CROWDER SPECIALS IN 1 GAME
Yeah but it‚Äôs bad defensively too on team A which is weird for a team with Giannis Murray and Norman but they have no wing stoppers on that team and are playing 3 power forwards.  They just don‚Äôt fit together.  Getting rid of Randle for someone like Jae Crowder makes them probably the best team but the 3 bigs together don‚Äôt work on either end.
"The best way to judge how good players are defensively is to look at their ability to stay in front of their man and regain ground on a shot if they are beaten. The leagues best defenders get beaten, but the best way to judge a defensive possession is individually watching the matchups, the ability to contest without contact, foul at the right time and create turnovers are all accurate measures of a great defender. Some of my favourite defenders to watch are Jrue Holiday, Jae Crowder, Bam Adebayo &amp; Kawhi Leonard, they all defend differently, but they are the best defenders in the league if you ask me."
Heat are one Jae Crowder replacement away from making a second run. They miss his switchability.    * Rudy Gay? * Doug McDermott * Otto Porter * Danny Green * Bobby Portis  I don't know but they need that gap filled and then it's all gravy.
"PHO would actually really benefit from having a post-up threat over than Ayton (also could be a mentor ie. Chris Paul)  BOS has no use for Aldridge. He‚Äôs negative defensively and they don‚Äôt need more bigs.  MIA would be cool, as a bigger Jae Crowder on offense. Although I don‚Äôt Aldridge is *thaaat* much better than Olynyk right now, especially not on that contract.  DEN needs defense, they‚Äôre set offensively. No need to get someone who‚Äôs just gonna take minutes away form Millsap, their 2nd best defender."
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante ≈Ωi≈æiƒá, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
or jae crowder lmao. it was honestly a head scratcher. we needed bigs badly (still do) but he is a non factor
"Herro is not better than Dragic Bam or Jimmy. He‚Äôs fourth at most, but I would argue that Jae Crowder was a bigger contributor if we are factoring in defense."
"They gave him and Iggy big 2-year contracts with team options for the second year. The whole point is that those options were going to be declined anyways to free up 2021 cap space (but the issue is now all of the coveted 2021 FAs have signed elsewhere).  As previously mentioned, hindsight is 20/20 and letting Jae Crowder walk really hurt the team."
I can‚Äôt wait til we cut this motherfucker. We let Jae Crowder go to keep this racist piece of shit.
"You‚Äôre right but at least the play style is still somewhat similar in terms of post ups, pick and rolls, rim defense, etc among centers  The power forward now is so different both in skill and physically, a power forward back then was still typically a big man whereas now it‚Äôs a swing man. Jae crowder and Mo harkless are power forwards in the league now, whereas Kurt Thomas and joe smith were power forwards in the 90s/2000s. Those are drastically different player types."
"That article has him fighting Gortat. In the months directly after he beefs with Brooks and Jeff Green and likely Oubre. Before all that Nene and Emeka Okafor.  On the court he 's tussled with Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart.  Goalposts. What do you want, a reacharound? What is it you want me to deliver? This conversation started about RW leading the league in techs since he's a hot headed dumbfuck but it's instead devolved into proving just how much of an ignoramus you are.   The original statement was that Russ never took the high road ever, never has, and continues not to as seen with his techs vs Wall and then getting tossed against Rondo. You're out to prove....what? That slandering Reggie Jackson as Wall did Gortat is ok? We've come far. Goalposts"
Jae Crowder and Ricky Rubio.
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
this is who they kept over Jae Crowder LMAOOOOOOO
"People already forgot how Jae Crowder was the primary defender on Giannis in that series, not Bam."
Bam has done well on giannis even in the matchups before we had jae crowder. Plenty of highlights of bam forcing turnovers on giannis in our first couple games of last season before that trade happened. Jae obviously did a great job but I dont know how you could deny that bam has always been our best option on the team to guard the greek freak
"Yeah I personally think it‚Äôs the other dude on the team (was on the team). Bam did well in the regular season on Giannis barring one game, but in the playoffs it was the Jae Crowder show on defense, and Bam was able to just protect the rim at an elite level.  Nonetheless it‚Äôs one of those 2 Heat dudes imo"
"He did? If having 2-3 other defenders flanking you by yourside counts as 1-on-1 defense then sure. We saw in game 4 when Giannis went 1-on-1 with Bam how dominant he was.  If anything I think it‚Äôs Jae Crowder, no one I‚Äôve ever seen has stopped Giannis from driving by themselves as well as Jae motherfucking Crowder"
Jae Crowder apparently   But seriously Bam is probably the ideal physical specimen for that matchup
"I mean the modern 4 varies a lot. From Jae Crowder to Lebron to AD to Giannis to Porzingis. Neither are optimal to guard the last 3, but the first two id take kawhi. And 1-3 Kawhi was better in his prime.  I‚Äôd say both of them are 1-3 defenders who guard the transplanted 4 because they sure as hell ain‚Äôt guarding the true 4s like Giannis, Garnett, Duncan, AD, etc."
"Some fair points. I have never played 2k though. And it's not about signing a better player with Barnes money, although that is certainly possible. It's about flexibility. Let's say SAC wants to trade for Vucevic. Which package do you think Orlando would prefer:   A) Barnes, 1st (lotto protected SAC), a 4MM TPE, and no cap space   B) Three 1st's (2 BOS, 1 lotto protected SAC), Nesmith, a 20MM TPE, and 15MM in cap space.   Keep in mind they're in the position SAC is with little to no chance to win during the remainder of Barnes' contract. It won't happen every time, but I'd say a quality GM will do as well with 15MM in cap space as getting Barnes on 2/40, and we're left with a bunch of assets and flexibility to improve. This is looking at using the cap in just one way, too. What if someone wants to pay you to clear room? TJ Warren and #32 were traded for cash considerations (in real life, not 2k). In my opinion TJ Warren is a better basketball player, on a better contract, than Barnes. De'Anthony Melton and two 2nd's were traded to dump Josh Jackson's salary. Melton recently re-signed for 4/35. I'd rather have Melton at 4/35 than Barnes at 2/40. These opportunities pop up all the time, but you have to be in a position to take them. Let people match on the Crabbe's. Not every move is via RFA. Jerami just went for 3/60 and is better than Barnes. Christian Wood 3/41 via cheap S&amp;T. Jae Crowder 3/30. Sure, I'd rather have Jae + 10 million in cap than Barnes in many situations.      PHI: bottomed out and drafted Embiid, Simmons, used assets and cap flexibility (poorly) in deal for Tobias      LAL: had the cap flexibility to sign LeBron, used cap flexibility and assets from bottoming out to trade for AD      LAC: had the cap flexibility to sign Kawhi, cap/asset flexibility to trade for PG13 (including two MIA 1st's)      BKN: cap flexibility to sign Kyrie/KD, capitalized on Harden deal with assets      UTA: drafted Gobert, Mitchell (via trade), utilized cap space &amp; assets to trade for Conley      These are probably 5 of the top 6 or 7 title contenders this year, and every single one used significant cap flexibility to get where they are. If SAC is actually offered these type of assets for Barnes, who provides no surplus value and limits flexibility, yes I believe keeping him is ridiculous. As it relates to this hypothetical offer, keeping him over two 1st's, Nesmith, a 16MM TPE, and going from ~20MM to ~40MM in cap space would be egregious. Just this past off-season you could've traded one of those BOS 1st's and absorbed Oubre into your TPE. Do that after you spend your 40MM in cap and you've gone from Barnes +20MM in cap to Oubre, however you spent your 40MM in cap, Nesmith, 1st. Someone please tell me how SAC goes from where they are now, to championship contenders, while turning down deals like this. At what point will they get more for Harrison Barnes?"
"If it's about players who's playing right now, I'd switch jae Crowder with Serge Ibaka.  Jae is the least tough from those 5. He's just ""acting tough"", just get in front of guys and talking. Instigator you could say.  Serge actually throw hands. And not just one time. Time and time again he throw hands at his opponent.  And switch Trez with Portis. Portis broke his teammate's face."
"They're so reliant on Jimmy and Bam to do everything. Their two stars are their whole defense and run their entire offense. Everything around that isn't as good. In the bubble Dragic, Herro, Duncan stepped up so it worked. They also had Jae Crowder to give Jimmy and Bam a lot of help defensively. They also rely on dudes like Nunn and previously Olynyk. Basically shooting/scoring which has fallen off this year.   They lose those shooters or those shooters are asked to create themselves and they aren't good enough. They need more scoring basically. They're that team that's basically a good fit for every scoring guard in the league but they don't have good enough ones as is."
"Butler and Adebayo are still playing like stars.  Pretty much everyone else has fallen off for various reasons, in large part due to injury and illness and lack of continuity.    Duncan Robinson in particular has struggled even as he's played the most minutes on the team, perhaps because almost everyone around him has missed time.  Even his free throw shooting percentage is down from last year.    Just as Robinson was playing better he left the Bulls game last night due to illness.  That leaves the Heat with little backcourt depth, with Victor Oladipo, Kendrick Nunn, and Tyler Herro all out.  They also miss Jae Crowder, who was an underrated veteran presence especially in the playoffs.  Crowder has been a valuable player for the Suns this season.  If everyone gets healthy they are still a threat in the East, but time is getting short, and they are going to have a rough road in the playoffs.    Last year they had the benefit of months off before the bubble.  That's not happening this year."
"This playoffs will tell a lot because lot of those players don‚Äôt look that good this year. Jimmy and Bam are having better regular seasons this year then last. But Dragic has been injured and a little less productive, Herro has been disappointing, and teams are able to key in on Duncan Robinson a little better (though he‚Äôs improved defensively). They lose Jae Crowder as well.  Their success IN the finals, winning two games absolutely was because of one player though. They challenged the champs as much as anyone."
"I was hoping one of the Baylor guards would fall to them in the draft but after this tourney, I doubt that is happening. I think James Jones will just find another veterans FA or trade. He found Rubio who played great for us last year, and everyone knows about Chris Paul this year. Jones will have a lot of capspace and an great young ascending team to attract other FA's like Jae Crowder and Chris Paul who both wanted to be here."
Jae Crowder certainly tries.
"Yeah, I totally agree.   2015-16 we were totally stacked with Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Jae Crowder and Amir Johnson. What coach wouldn‚Äôt have made that lineup a top 10 offense and top 5 defense?  Add Horford to that mix everyone knew we were going to the Conference Finals.   And the year after that, I mean *I* could‚Äôve coached rookie Tatum to game 7 of the conference finals against LeBron.   And after losing Kyrie two years later, it‚Äôs no wonder we went a round further than than the year before.   This is easy stuff. Brad hasn‚Äôt proved anything yet, and probably never will."
Powell for Jae Crowder
Yeah but honestly I‚Äôd still rather have a a guy like Jae Crowder atm.
Oh I remembered that the heat are missing Jae Crowder from the playoff run. It‚Äôs a fairly significant loss
"He's been one of the most underrated guys in the league for years now. Every team should want to have a Jae Crowder, and he's an instant starter for all 30 teams."
"Jae Crowder deserves more recognition. It's not suprise that every team he goes to plays well (Phoenix, Miami's playoff run, Utah etc). He brings some absolute hard nosed defence and he has the confidence down the stretch to take and make shots that other players are afraid of missing."
"I love this guy. He‚Äôs a great interview. No danger he‚Äôll shrink in the spotlight. He‚Äôs from Marquette, where some of my favorite tough minded players also went like D Wade, Jae Crowder and Jim McIlvaine."
The Suns also added Jae Crowder and the Suns last year wouldn't have been so bad if Ayton wasn't suspended for so much time.  Yeah and the Jazz also added Clarkson and Bogdanovic lol
"I wouldn‚Äôt call CP3 and Jae Crowder a minor difference. That‚Äôs a pretty significant upgrade any way you look at it. The Suns last year, before the bubble, were 26-39. That is an amazing turnaround and anyone who knows ANYTHING about basketball knows adding those two is a major part of that. Trying to dismiss their impact, especially CP3, the way you did is ridiculous."
"Jae Crowder was the glue, now I feel like they too soft for playoff basketball. But last year they had a mid regular season too, so who knows."
jae crowder threw one in from the opposite baseline when he was in boston. didnt count tho
Having Jae Crowder on your team helps.
"because nobody that's ever won coach of the year has coached all NBA players or had the MVP on their team?  CP3 is in consideration for All-NBA for sure, not really sure what you are getting at.  Monty Williams has done a great job of integrating key rotation pieces like CP3 &amp; Jae Crowder, has gotten good results from Bridges &amp; Ayton and has his team playing tough every single night.  The Suns are 42-16 and 1.5 games out of first in the West, is he not a deserving candidate?"
Hes gonna pretend that Jae Crowder still plays for the Grizz lol...
I want to see Jae Crowder and Haslem if I‚Äôm being completely honest
"Right. And you can debate who‚Äôs better between KAT and booker but at best it‚Äôs close. Then the suns have Ayton, bridges, cam Johnson and Dario (thanks t wolves! Enjoy jarret culver!) Jae crowder, and even cam Payne.  The wolves have ant Edwards whose a rookie and Rubio? Edit: oops! I forgot about DLo, but sadly he hasn‚Äôt really played."
Jae Crowder did it to Giannis for us this year to win the game the first time we played the Bucks.
"Don‚Äôt know if it would be the top, but I‚Äôd take cam Payne, cam johnson/Jae crowder, and mikal bridges."
"Food for thought: did Rondo ruin the 14-15 Mavs, or was the real problem trading a young Jae Crowder?"
Jae crowder is honestly underrated as fuck though   Every team that has him overperforms expectations   That plus bridges really coming alive is also a huge part of it. Plus Payne randomly becoming solid out of nowhere
Jae Crowder gonna get his shots up by any means necessary
Jae crowder with the bizness decision
"honestly, as a someone who has potential to be franchise player and walking 25/12, he should not defer to Mikal Bridges and especially not to freaking Jae Crowder  i get that he's still 3rd option but it should be much more clear"
"I disagree I think Miami‚Äôs team is better this year, Jae crowder is surely missed but Trevor Ariza, dedmon, and bjelica are improvements. Our current record isn‚Äôt a great example of our potential but we‚Äôve been trash as of late, with some ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù lineups"
This is exactly right and a big reason the heat improved when crowder became part of the starting rotation and bam got more minutes at the 5. Center is clearly is best position but ideally we should pair him with a stretch 4 that can also body up on some centers from time to time... maybe like a Jae Crowder üò≠
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"Slightly more than Jae Crowder who is starting PF and excellent two way player for the Suns. He would have eaten it up again this year since he was hurt the entire year. I thought after this year, it became obvious why the Suns wanted to get rid of him."
"CP3 is great but you‚Äôre just disregarding the general development of Bridges, Ayton, Cam Johnson. As well as the addition of Jae Crowder and Cam Payne filling in the backup pg spot that the suns lacked behind Rubio last year"
"You guys still lost 4 in a row to the Bucks and now recently blew up the team because you realized that roster couldn't compete in the East. What exactly did I say was wrong?   We are 3-13 without Jimmy Butler this season. 10 games behind the 1st seed. People are discrediting a team that's not playing as well as they did last regular season? Really? The Bucks were 12 games ahead of us and got beat down. Celtics/Pacers all had better regular season records and got beat down. How exactly do you write this team off again in the playoffs this season?! How exactly are fans pointing to a disappointing playoff performance from the Heat already, I'm curious. If Butler left the team, yeah we stand no chance. If Bam left, yeah. Some important player like Dragic left no doubt. We lost Jae Crowder and added Ariza in return + more pieces. This team should have a better record and are underperforming this season due to health reasons. You get downvoted for having an opinion as if regular season record matters so much come playoff time lol. Player talent matters and the Heat are one of the more talented rosters in the East."
"But actually, it‚Äôs the absense of Jae Crowder and I know that‚Äôs probably not correct but it‚Äôs the narrative that I‚Äôve decided to go with."
"Playoff experience, I assume.   Jazz have been in the playoffs for several years now, and aside from CP3 and Jae Crowder I can‚Äôt think of anyone on PHX that has significant playoff experience. (If I‚Äôm forgetting someone obvious let me know)  Obviously experience alone isn‚Äôt everything, but it does paint a picture of how a team is viewed."
"We traded Oubre. Got Jae Crowder, Cam Payne and bench depth. Bridges, Johnson, and Ayton all making improvements being young players. CP3 is amazing and I‚Äôm a diehard fan but stop saying the sole success of the Suns is him. If we keep Rubio we would have a close to similar record up to this point."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are the newest ones:  Dwight Howard: [https://basketballbeacon.com/dwight-howard-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/dwight-howard-player-profile-stats/)  Jae Crowder: [https://basketballbeacon.com/jae-crowder-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/jae-crowder-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks!"
Don't forget Kyle Lowry was 26 when he got to Toronto as well. Some guys are just late bloomers. Obviously don't expect Yuta to get to kyle's level but he can develop into a great help defender and if his shot keeps improving can turn in to an elite 3 and D guy kinda like a younger Jae crowder but a couple inches longer.  Seth is the perfect example needed the right opportunity to break in to the NBA.
"Fuck jae crowder, all my homies hate jae crowder."
"What‚Äôs a statistic you like then? Literally every single stat will have something like this. RAPTOR has Conley&gt;LeBron/Harden and Trez and Caruso &gt; Dame and Jrue. RPM has Graham &gt; Jokic. Not sure if RAPM or PIPM are still publicly available, but Jae Crowder was ranked as 5th by RAPM in 2016-17 and Patrick Patterson at 11. Every statistic has these situations. But at the end of the day they more or less provide a decent indicator of player quality in whatever metric is being measured, be it passing, impact, etc"
"Also getting luka likely means no cam johnson, no saric, no rubio, no 8-0 bubble, and subsequently no chris paul and jae crowder. The culture of the Suns likely wouldn't have been fixed if we drafted Luka"
"Well, if u really must know. The Heat have been plagued by injuries both early on and as of late (Butler early in the year, Dragic throughout the year, and now Oladipo just to name a few). In addition to injuries the loss of Jae Crowder has been worse than anticipated. Besides that the Heat have struggled to shoot the 3 ball consistently w even Duncan Robinson struggling, although as of late he‚Äôs back to form. Dragic is a year older and is really showing it. But at the end of the day this team never looked like a finals level team until the playoffs anyway last year. That team still shows up in glimpses and has looked really good in the brief time we‚Äôve seen Dipo on the floor. Butler still has the ability to take over games and we shall see if playoff Jimmy is still a thing when that time comes."
Jae Crowder. He never misses.
"Jae Crowder infamously hated playing for the Cavs and instantly played better after he got traded  George Hill and Jordan Clarkson sucked ass, same with Tristan"
PG: Kyle Lowry 17.1 SG: James Harden 25.2 SF: Andre Igoudala 4.4 PF: Jae Crowder 10.3 C: Bam Adebayo 19
"Jae Crowder (yes he was traded but he was on that team), Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance jr, JR Smith &amp; Tristan Thompson as support around a consistent 3rd option scoring 16-18ppg (there is max 3 teams in the league right now that could say no to such a 3rd option...) in Kevin Love, and THEN you have Kyrie and Lebron. Really don't believe i'm overhyping them, it's just not true Lebron was alone against the world."
Clocks more broken than Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder does this every time he shoots a 3 pointer. Didn't know he was just taking care of his ankles.
The main differences is that the Mavs lost their defensive anchor.... and faced OKC on the last year the big 3 played (aside: that OKC team had by far the hardest play-off scheduling... maybe ever). And the Heat had traded Shaq and lost Alonzo at the end.    This Heat team... lost Jae Crowder.
"The Lakers are better this season, and Bam had nothing to do with that, he was injured most of the series. It was Jimmy having an all time series plus our shooters being hot at the right time. This team doesn't have good shooters, and wouldn't have as good defense. You're ignoring the Heat having Derrick Jones Jr, Jae Crowder, and Andre Iguodala, who were all great defenders. Thats where depth mattered in the playoffs. Jimmy and Bam cant play 48 minutes and in the minutes that one of them is sitting they'd have completely atrocious defense."
"To be fair, if you're expecting Jae Crowder to be good in order for you to win that's already a bad strategy"
"Jae Crowder hated playing with LeBron, he took shots at him when he was in Utah, praising how much fun it was playing within a system. Dude still holds grudges against him to this day."
Jae Crowder and Lebron James are both averaging the same FTA/game in this series  The lakers have 14 more points in the paint  The Suns have 3 more total fouls
"Well I don't know if he would have signed with you guys considering he seems to dislike LeBron and he had just played you guys in the Finals and I know he's bricking all his 3s right now, but Jae Crowder would've been a more ideal fit.   But yeah options were pretty dire last offseason."
Lots of players wear them. I think Jae Crowder uses them.
I felt Jae crowder not hitting a shot and them playing zero defense in the 2nd half made a difference.
"Also, Jae Crowder masquerading as prime Klay Thompson"
"Ref help wouldn‚Äôt have mattered that much, since Jae Crowder was clearly playing for the Lakers yesterday."
Jae crowder is garbage and been garbage. He‚Äôs just good for looking tough on the court and that‚Äôs about it
"1. He was barely off the ground.  2. He ran into Jae, reducing air speed.  3. He STILL went flying.   Crowder for the save."
"""Stop trying to find a way to FIT-OUT and just FIT-IN. Be apart of something special! Just my thoughts."" -LeBron, to Jae Crowder in 2018"
Thank god jae crowder was there to kind of stop denniss momentum. If he wasnt there that could of been a bad fall
Dude is doing his best Jae Crowder 2016 impression
&gt;lebron dribbles the air out of the ball and settles for midrange garbage against Jae Crowder
"Lmfaoo poor Jae Crowder, this is going on year 5 he's getting owned by LBJ"
As he kicks Jae Crowder in the nuts
Jae Crowder is and has been a certified bitch
Jae ‚ÄòStats are for pussies‚Äô Crowder
Cavs fans already know prime Jae Crowder Playoff performances.
Jae Crowder is so trash... he WANNA be Lebron so bad!!
"LeBron turns Jae Crowder into a journeyman every season. You would think teams would stop thinking he can do anything with lebron by now. He's literally only on him for his size, which has no impact on LBJ whatsoever. You need to be a Draymond 'defends with his mind' kind of defender to play up on LeBron."

LeBron hates Jae Crowder ever since Cleveland lmfao
Average Jae Crowder fans vs true Jake Rowder appreciators
"Idk, there are always some dumb takes here, but in the playoffs it gets cranked up to max because the games are so much more important. People love to talk about one playoff game like it changes everything we know about the league, so a few playoff games may as well mean Jesus himself came down from heaven and told us ‚ÄúThis is the real truth nephews, Jae Crowder is TRASH‚Äù. How can it not be true after a 3 game sample size?  It‚Äôs similar to how after game 1, one of the top comments about Bryn Forbes post game was something like ‚ÄúBut Spurs fans told me he was trash‚Äù like him making some open 3‚Äôs in one game means he is clearly a good player. Sometimes guys make shots, sometimes they miss shots. You‚Äôll learn a whole lot more about someone‚Äôs actual shooting ability from regular season stats, ESPECIALLY when most of their shots are just catch and shoot"
"The fuck jae crowder chants gave me life tonight. Some guy when we were leaving the game ""fuck jae crowder, I mean I don't really know who he is but he has a ponytail and I hate him."""
"Booker‚Äôs been doing this shit for a while now. Whenever he gets frustrated he starts acting out - cheap shots, talking shit, and just overall petty stuff.  You got clamped tonight just accept it and move on to the next game. With CP3 and Jae Crowder you got the trio of just annoying ass whiny players that always do borderline dirty stuff when they get mad."
"He's not the Heat's main issue. He's going up against Jrue, so I'm surprised that he was one of the only positives for the Heat so far.  Herro has gone AWOL, and Bam and Butler were playing significantly better last year. They don't have Jae Crowder who shot 40%+ from 3 and even a center like KO who can space the floor for small stretches in the game (Dedmon doing pretty good though)."
I legit cant imagine waking up every day and being a fan of Jae Crowder. There is no way anyone is actually doing that
Yet y'all keep throwing Jae Crowder on the court and leaving him there to stink up the place
You mean Jae ‚ÄúPut‚Äôem in an arm bar‚Äù Crowder?
Who‚Äôs a better LeBron stopper: PJ Tucker or Jae Crowder?
Jae ‚Äúthe human fleshlight‚Äù Crowder
Lebron was laughing off and was playing with Jae Crowder. He is in Lecoast mode.
&gt;!Jae Crowder was just a passenger on the subway.!&lt;
"Kept on thinking to myself all game long, ‚ÄúJae Crowder can‚Äôt miss another three can he?‚Äù. In the bubble he was shooting lights out but his shot has completely abandoned him this series."
"Yes? I can cherry pick stats, too. See here: with a +/- of +15 he had the highest +/- on the court. He also had 21/6/9 just one shot shy of 50% shooting AND he made Jae Crowder his bitch. What a night!  Also fucking hilarious you focus on TOs and FG% alone with Westbrook as your PG..."
"I can't believe I was rooting for Suns for them to get into the playoffs the past few years. Devin Booker, CP3, and Jae Crowder have been dirty this game. Lost a lot of respect for them."
Not to mention jae crowder lmao
Hobbled CP3 and Jae Crowder will do that
"Jae Crowder wasn't good just cuz of the bubble.  He had a hot series and then cooled off. Like most role players in playoff series. He's a good decent piece, but asking him to be a ""LeBron stopper"" is as ludicrous an assignment as you can give any player."
He was toying with the Suns in that 3rd qtr (insert Jae Crowder here). He probably just coasting or just letting the other guys around him do their thing.   We need a healthy LeBron in the later rounds of the playoffs.
"&gt;Holy shit, Jae Crowder has more fouls than fieldgoals made?  He's largely defending Davis -- who is half-a-foot taller.  Which is a big part of why Davis doesn't want to be a center.  The game is easier when your opponents are much smaller."
And assistant teacher Jae crowder
"I think it was obviously a frustration foul, but yeah that's unacceptable. Jae Crowder with some extra lack of sportsmanship as well pushing Dennis away from him as Dennis was falling from the contact by Booker. I think both looked quite bad there."
"I would say that today‚Äôs shameful reactions from Booker and Crowder are more on CP3 absence on the floor than his ‚Äúteachings‚Äù, Dbook and Jae are just frustrated and let it out"
Jae Crowder has always been wildly inconsistent from 3. In his last season in Boston he shot like high 40s before the all star break then after shot like low 30s. His reputation as a shooter is very overrated considered he shoots 35% and 32% from the regular season and playoffs and those are mostly open looks.
That‚Äôs what happens when you have Jae Crowder guarding him.
Jae Crowder has been so good for the Lakers the past two games.  MVP level
&gt;!If he‚Äôs weakening this planet‚Äôs defenses for takeover then I‚Äôm curious as to why he started off with murdering Jae Crowder!&lt;
That's what I was worried about. Jae Crowder got clowned on by Alex Caruso last game and clowned by LeBron while being mocked by the Lakers bench. He's a dirty fucking player who is going to try and take our guys out if things keep going this way.
Fuck Jae Crowder bitchass
Tbh before the game I saw Jae Crowder hit Lebron with a bat
#JAE CROWDER TRICK YALL
Jae Crowder is actually like 0.0001% top defensive basketball players on earth and Lebron wasn‚Äôt even sweating lol
Why would any team want Jae Crowder?
Fuck Jae Crowder
Fuck Jae Crowder
Fuck Jae Crowder
Fuck Devin Booker and fuck Jae Crowder
"Imagine being Jae Crowder, playing the TOUGHEST defense you can muster up, and LeBron smiling and laughing like he does when he posts up Bronny. He completely SUNED(see what I did there? :)) this team tonight and all of Phoenix needs to call him LeDaddy after that spanking he handed out.  #LeBuildDifferent #KidFromAkron #Year18 #LeBigJohnson #LeTastesDifferent"
That stretch in the fourth quarter where Lebron had a field day abusing Jae Crowder was so amusing to watch.
"Holy shit, Jae Crowder has more fouls than fieldgoals made?? Wtf happened to him."
Jae Crowder in this series is 7 for 27 from the field and a scorching hot 2 of 20 from 3.
Better than Jae Crowder
jae crowder assuming role of sour beta bitch as usual peace
"book shoved schroeder in the air, got tossed. jae crowder went back to his couch."
lmao jae crowder bitch
"Man the only dude who can wear 99 in LA is Aaron Donald, Jae Crowder needs to change his number."
Fuck Jae crowder
Jae Crowder should be out of the league. He and Solomon Hill are cut from the same cloth
jae crowder is mad at his own uselessness lmao
Jae Crowder is one of the biggest bitches in NBA history
"no matter what, fuck jae crowder"
Lol Jae Crowder really messed it up for his team with his like.
"‚ÄòFUCK JAE CROWDER‚Äô chants. Come on staples, get loud. let Jae crowder know he sucks."
FUCK JAE CROWDER
Jae Crowder is the most frustrating player you can have on your team   Change my Mind
"Last year's Heat team would lose to the Bucks, Sixers and Nets this year and I'm not sure they'd be that close. Their big difference is losing Jae Crowder.  The previous year's best team lost their best player, the Sixers lost Ben Simmons, Kemba had knee issues. They were better than the Bucks but that was also aided by a major injury."
"Jae ""Stephen Curry"" Crowder"
am i a better player than jae crowder?
I actually feel bad for Jae crowder rn
"Lmao Jae Crowder hid, just so Lebron could pass it and then he stole it. Well played"
Fucking love watching Jae Crowder not being on my team lol
Jae Crowder is fucking üóë this game
"Someone remind me, outside of missing wide open 3's, what does Jae Crowder do? At this rate, the only person he can guard is me."
I think my favorite part of this game is the ‚ÄòFuck Jae Crowder‚Äô chants
Steven Crowder vs Jae Crowder: which douche would win in a debate?
Jae Crowder is desperately trying to reach Lance Stephenson levels of clowning right now.
Can I put money on Jae Crowder swinging first
jae crowder is a tool
He's playing like he hates jae crowder
Jae Crowder whooooo do you think you are lmaooo Jesus Christ man
Jae Crowder straight up getting clowned
I LOVE me some Jae crowder but I don‚Äôt blame LeBron for not talking trash after scoring on him. Not worth the risk of him pulling another Solomon hill incident
jae crowder a bum lmaooooo
"Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, and/or Mikal Bridges. Plenty of 3 and D wings to choose from."
"Blake, marcus morris, jae crowder  I like the gritty defensive guys"
If this deserves it's own post then Jae Crowder deserves his own sub. He's notorious for this shit.
"Teams aren‚Äôt rebuilding forever. If you are the Cavs, Bulls etc and if you are looking for 3-4 contracts you should be thinking that you might be playoff team in 1-2 years, so it technically won‚Äôt be a rebuilding team far into future.  And yes you are right on that second point. It‚Äôs really up to the GM to do due diligence on the player. Role player contracts can also win you championship as well as lose them. I can think of 20+ role player signings that were immediately thought as overpaid and then worked out to be undervalued even in year one.  Some examples in the past 3-4 years: Terry Rozier, Kyle Anderson, Julius Randle, Jae Crowder (3-4 times lol), Seth Curry, PJ Tucker etc"
Jae Crowder is dirty af
"dude was doing everything he could to win us games but when the best shooters on your team are going 28% and 33% from three and the next best guys are ricky rubio and jae crowder going 30% and 20%, then you're going to get a shit ton of on ball pressure. Alas, he grew through it and is dealing with on ball pressure like a king now."
I don‚Äôt know how so many forgot that this is a literal Marcus Morris quote.   [lmfao](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/01/30/marcus-morris-says-jae-crowder-has-female-tendencies-on-the-court/amp/)
"Craig is seriously playing so well. Not sure if it‚Äôs revenge series or what but he‚Äôs looking like the poor man‚Äôs Jae Crowder, only younger. And prime Crowder was so good (still is)."
Well last year they should have been playoff bound.  But Ayton's suspension pretty much killed that.  Then they murdered everyone in the bubble.  Then they acquired Cp3 and Jae Crowder.  Then everyone from Booker to Ayton to Bridges to Payne makes huge jumps because they're all young.  Then they win a title.
LeBron and Jae Crowder? Wow what an honor for Jae
He was holding Jae crowder back too tbh
"As a finals team...? The starting line up for Game 3 of the NBA finals were Jimmy Butler, Duncan Robinson, Jae Crowder, Tyler Herro and Meyers Leonard. With Nunn, 36 year old iggy and Olynyk off the bench...The starting line up was literally Jimmy, Crowder and 3 white guys that play absolutely no defence"
Jae Crowder is the NBA version of Ben Yedder in FIFA 20. He just pisses you off to an unreal extent when he's on the opposite team
This is just Jae Crowder
What is Jae crowder doing there
"I‚Äôd say vets, Jae Crowder has been great for them"
So you‚Äôre saying you would‚Äôve still listed DeMarre Carroll and Jae Crowder if they weren‚Äôt both black dudes with beards and long hair? Lmao gtfo üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Their rotation was olynyk, Robinson, nunn, herro, dragic, iggy and jae crowder...."
&gt; Jae Crowder is better than PJ Tucker  No he's not stop this slander dude. PJ is way better then Jae.
"well thats gonna happen in the postseason, people get really physical  hell aaron gordon shoulder charged jae crowder just last night, lebron gave a hockey bodycheck to ayton in the first round.   kawhi gave joe ingles a body check in game 1"
"Yeah a lot of what you're saying is true--that's why I had to remove context. Although I would add that ""a strong Lakers defensive squad"" also literally describes the 2020 Finals--Jimmy was being guarded by LeBron, with AD as an elite rim protector.   And, while this is certainly nuanced, I think that part of the reason that Jimmy seemed to have more help was his playmaking and distribution. Guys like Duncan Robinson and Jae Crowder weren't creating their own offense; the team offense ran on catch-and-shoot and Jimmy had to facilitate all of that with Dragic out and no other true PG.  And that's not even mentioning the defensive load. Jimmy was the primary defender on, again, LeBron, with basically no help with rim protection (Kelly Olynyk and an injured 22-year-old Bam to stop AD). AI had the DPOY.  In sum, the point of this comparison is to see who had the most unimpeachable defense against being told they have no championships because of poor finals performances. Iverson could have facilitated better and gotten better looks. I don't think Jimmy could have left anything more out on the floor."
"Plays the 3, which is the middle. Good defense. Good offense. Nice guy. Team player. Catches. Shoots. Really nothing he doesn't do and no reason you can get mad at him without becoming Jae Crowder. The guy's basically a 30-something version of what IBM was 30 years ago."
Jae crowder is out there nodding in approval to this
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"I think the Suns are very similar to the 2018 Rockets, but with much better ball movement and generally better across the board _____ Chris Paul is Chris Paul _____ Devin Booker is James Harden. They have a different play style and Harden is obviously a lot better, but they are the bucket getters _____ Mikal Bridges is a better version of Trevor Ariza ______ Jae Crowder is better than PJ Tucker _____ Ayton is about equal to Capela"
"This is a man who turned Jarrett Culver into Dario and Cam Johnson, found Cam Payne off the scrap heap, maybe probably the best mid level exception signing in Jae Crowder, the corpse of Trevor Ariza into Kelly Oubre, and upgraded Tyler Johnson to Ricky Rubio and then Ricky Rubio to Chris Paul. I‚Äôll give him the benefit of the doubt that he did his best with TJ Warren. The revisionist history around him has hit as he was coming off a season where he missed the majority of it with a head injury."
Jae Crowder the real MVP.
They are clogging jokic passing lanes too jae crowder has been phenomenal at that they rotate correctly every time I'm sure crowder had towo deflection just of being in the correct place at the time because we have no shot creators they can easily collapse on jokic and because the other aren't cutting or shooting well it just makes it harder
I‚Äôm laughing so hard at this thread. I too love to equate the struggles of middle management with the salary concerns of Jae Crowder.
"jae crowder always cryin with somebody , tired of him  but I want jazz to win it all for jordan clarkson!"
Earliest stages? The curse of Jae Crowder and IT started the year we traded them for Kyrie. Hayward broke his foot game 1. Kyrie got injured before the playoffs. And then all the bad chemistry the next season... I could make a list...  Culminating with Kyrie going to Brooklyn and bouncing the Cs from the playoffs.
That's not the only thing that changed.  They got killed by injuries last year.  They also basically swapped Baynes and Kelly Oubre for Jae Crowder and Torrey Craig.
Honestly Jae Crowder hitting a 3 hits different than everyone else on the team I don‚Äôt know what else to say about it. I have absolutely loved him in the playoffs so far. He hasn‚Äôt shown up on the stat sheet but watching the games I can‚Äôt help but get excited any time he‚Äôs involved in a play offense or defense.
"5 of the 8 remaining teams have never won a championship,, with all 4 of the West teams, and the Nets of the East, and the Nets being the heavy favorite to win the East (and the finals), assuming the big 3 stay healthy, It is fairly likely that a first time champion will be crowned, and after tonights performance, I believe that it will be the suns vs Nets in the 2021 nba finals, which is probably the best matchup for the Nets considering the suns have CP3, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig, who are all capable defenders, as well as Cam Payne, who isnt necessarily a great defender, but definitely a pest, and Ayton at the anchor, with Saric, who has shown he is a good defender who can stretch the floor, I think this team is the only team with enough defensive assets with the offensive fire power to challenge the Nets"
"Stuck between wanting CP3 to get a ring, and not wanting Jae Crowder to get one. That dude irks me like no other lol"
jae crowder
Lol do you really think I think Lebron got outplayed by Jae Crowder and is more important to the Suns than CP3?
lmao ain‚Äôt no one scared of Jae Crowder
A team with Chris Paul and Jae Crowder is somehow likeable and I'm here for it
So is jae crowder just like the key to success of going to finals?
Jae Crowder did in person before the game
Jae Crowder did before the game on mic‚Äôd up
jae crowder get passed around more than kendall
jae baited gordon so hard lol Crowder has been excellent at his role during the playoffs
Jae Crowder on his bully shit all playoffs. Need him to slap Compazzo
Jae Crowder &gt; Aaron Gordon by far
"Have fully enjoyed the Jae crowder experience, highly recommended. 5 stars on Yelp"
bruh jae crowder was scared of elfrid payton
Jae 'Hold Me Back' Crowder lol
This is why it is important to have someone like Jae Crowder in your team lol
Jae Crowder or Lizzo?
Jae Crowder just gets into everyones heads and its amazing
"I can't overstate how much I love Jae Crowder. One of those guys that every championship caliber team has to have, a guy you absolutely hate until he's on your team."
"Jae crowder raises the level of every team he‚Äôs on.  He was like a borderline all star in Boston, helped Miami get to the finals, and is going off in Phoenix.   Insanely switchable, can shoot and defend, and seems like a great locker room guy who is also super tough."
Jae Crowder owns Aaron Gordon üò≠üò≠
God I love Jae Crowder
Rooting for this suns team but jae crowder pisses me off for some reason. I get gobert vibes from him
Jae crowderü§£ü§£ü§£ AG would beat his fucking ass
Why is Jae Crowder acting like he‚Äôs good
Reggie nobody is scared of Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder: master agitator
Jae Crowder gets in so many skirmishes
Jae Crowder and AG are both fake tough guys loll
Jae Crowder about to end Aaron Gordon‚Äôs career
Jae Crowder is a revelation.
"Jae ""Patrick Mahommes"" Crowder"
"this is like the best jae crowder has ever played, is he actually one of the best players in the NBA now  not volume shooting or scoring but his all around game and directing defenses, valuable stuff"
Jae Crowder is the one who carried the Heat last playoffs all along and not Jimmy
"If you don't have Jae Crowder on your team, you're gonna have a hard time getting to the finals."
Jae Crowder is annoying af
Jae Crowder makes a big impact wherever he goes. Dude is underpaid.
"Everytime I see Jae Crowder play, his stats are like 3 - 3 3PM or 4-4. Tf is this guy"
JAE CROWDER IS THE 2ND ROUND GOAT SHOOTER OF ALL TIME
jae crowder &gt; jimmy butler
Jae crowder the most oddly intense guy lol
Jae Crowder &gt; MPJ by far
jae crowder stinkface lmao
Ive never seen jae crowder like this
I miss Jae Crowder. He had some good seasons with the Celtics.
Jae Crowder is a menace and I love it
"Damn, early Celtics Jae Crowder in the house"
Jae Crowder either goes 6-6 or 1-9 from 3
Jae Curry Crowder 100% FG so far
"THEY HAD THAT SHIT DRAWN UP. JAE CROWDER TAPPED BRIDGES' BUTT AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHY, THEN THEY PULLED THAT LIL PLAY"
"Jae ""Chris Paul"" Crowder"
Jae Crowder is just allowed to hold Jokic the entire possession lmao
Jae Crowder did a bang up job on Giannis last year. Very underrated reason the Heat got obliterated this year Ariza just couldn't replicate his physicality   Giannis or Ben really seems like the best matchup for KD but its basically up for KD to miss more than someone guarding him tbh
You don't want Jae Crowder going off lol
"That's like saying Paul George had nothing to apologize for for his performance last year. Sure, his numbers were sufficient. But he was supposed to be a second star, and his performance just doesn't cut it. If you just need Porzingis to be a Jae Crowder or Marcus Morris then that's fine, but you're saying that you're fine with Jae Crowder or Marcus Morris being your second best player. That's not good."
"It's all fun and games, him and Joe were talking shit in a heated OKC vs UTA series. Westbrook was going at it too with Rubio. Jae Crowder was our tough guy then too."
We could also see Marcus Morris vs Jae Crowder. That would be incredible
Probably Rubio or Jae Crowder tbh. I think Jae was our second leading scorer off the bench
His name is Kevin huerter and he's better than jae crowder
ATL missing that Jae Crowder type player
"It *sort of* changed my opinion, sort of did not. Like credit to him he played great in those two games and really throughout that series mostly.   But I also am very aware that... who's the Mavs best defender / who did they try to guard him with? Maxi Kleber and DFS? Neither is great... So I reserve judgment. The Mavs defense didnt really have a good answer to at least make things difficult on him which the Nuggets did last year with Jerami Grant, and this year will again with Aaron Gordon (should they match up). Both guys are better defenders individually than any Mavs player they threw at him, really. Mikal Bridges is also better, as is Jae Crowder probably, should the Suns and Clippers meet in a WCF.   We shall see is all I'm saying. I still dont overall buy their offense without an elite playmaker. Still think there's too much isolation (though it's better than last year in that respect)."

I was gonna say Jae Crowder but he actually pulls it off
mike scott. jae crowder. steven adams. uhh‚Ä¶pj tucker
"&gt;he‚Äôs worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
"Ideally CP3 opts out for a multi-year deal at less annually. We use the new space to lock down Payne and maybe Craig. If we can then get a backup 5 behind Ayton at a reasonable price, I think we're set to see what we can do for a few years. At that point our team looks like:  Guards of CP3, Book, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter on multi year deals  Forwards of Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Centers of Ayton, the hypothetical backup I talked about and Dario"
2 techs away for both.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/phoenix-suns/jae-crowder-10859/fines/ only 5 techs showing for playoffs
Chris Paul and Jae crowder
"I don't think Thanasis is that bad. He's overly aggressive which gets him into trouble, but if he had the reputation (and favorable whistle that comes with it) of being an elite defender, people wouldn't make so much of it.  Thanasis with PJ Tucker's whistle, or Jae Crowder, or insert your favorite defender who gets away with a lot... that Thanasis would not be so bad"
I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind a Bobby Portis vs Jae crowder finals
is there a team Jae Crowder hasn‚Äôt been on? lol
"Jae Crowder got sick of booker's shit, so he joined him to form a super team"
"Almost like the Suns have a relatively balanced roster with solid contributors in the roation.  The team as a whole was top 10 in both offense and defense. Chris's impact goes far beyond what you see in the box score and that'd exactly why Monty Williams and the front office wanted to bring him to Phoenix. His influence on the young players is palpable and his pairing with Devin Booker is a great fit. Everybody thought that the Suns inexperience would be their downfall. Chris Paul and Jae Crowder helped avoid that. Shit, Chris Paul has been one of the best closers in the game for years at this point."
"You can have an opinion of Jae Crowder being better than Lebron, it‚Äôs just gonna be disputed"
Crazy Jae Crowder hasn‚Äôt won a ring yet
Is Jae crowder the only one that‚Äôs been to a final?
"It's funny how you say ""not really a big fan of either team"" then you vomit a bunch of crap that completely ignores all the dirty shit the Clippers were doing this series.  First things first, the Clippers didn't commit a foul for 24 minutes. That literally broke a record. For a team that's allowed free reign to be physical, that's not just unlikely. That's damning.  I'm fine with the fouls that we were called for. I'm not fine for not getting the same treatment down the line. Booker gets sent to the deck every time he drives and the whistles are swallowed so far down the refs' mouths that they're melting in stomach acid. Ayton gets hit in the head and the eye 4-5 times last game and gets one trip to the line from taking an elbow to the head.   Also, Cousins shoved Payne and Booker after their game 2 L and has been shoving players on dead ball situations the entire series with no consequences. If Chris Paul has to flop for him to get caught, then maybe he shouldn't be actively raising elbows to people like a dumbass.  &gt; Jae Crowder literally tripped a guy in this very game  That was stupid and reckless.  Paul George also elbowed a guy who broke his nose in three places after looking him directly in the face.   &gt; Bev can be dirty and annoying, but Paul is in his class.  Which one of these guys dead ball shoved another guy after getting shot after shot drained in his face? Which one of these guys broke another superstar's nose? Which one of these guys took out another guy's legs and then mocked him as he fell on the ground?  You're so fucking biased it's pathetic. You have zero clue what you're talking about. And on top of all of that, the Clippers had a massive free throw advantage and couldn't make this a game within 20 points. That's sad."
&gt; Except Lebron looked great when he was catching lobs off the backboard with his head at the rim and dancing trying to clown Jae Crowder.   Only Suns fans can compare wide open transition dunks to driving in traffic...  &gt;Cp3 being bad except for yesterday during the clipper series shows how much worse the Lakers were for not being able to capitalize on him with one arm while the Clippers were able to actually win games without their superstar against a team that was more healthy than the one you faced.  Lmao we were up 2-1. The Clippers went down 1-3. Please try again.  &gt;He showed he was able to penetrate and get to the rim at will he just didn't for some reason and that's why the Lakers had no offense after AD went down.  Yeah guess he just decided he didn‚Äôt want to drive for some reason...
"The Suns were not getting hosed by the refs. They were fouling. The Bridges hit on the elbow of Paul as he went up was an easy one. The baseline foul on Craig when he put two hands on the body of George was an easy one. Maybe one or two calls went one way or the other, but the Suns got those calls, too such as on the out of bounds call that should‚Äôve gone the other way but resulted in them hitting a 3 instead or the nonsense Boogie elbow.   Watching this as not really a big fan of either team, it‚Äôs kind of funny seeing a Suns fan complain about George‚Äôs pushoffs or the danger of playing against Cousins. Both of these teams have those guys. The Suns have their own PG who is one of the biggest rule benders in the league. Jae Crowder literally tripped a guy in this very game. Cousins wasn‚Äôt hurting anyone with that shove, it was a fake dust up Paul was using to get an advantage. Bev can be dirty and annoying, but Paul is in his class and one example from this series of Bev being dirty was just Paul foul baiting and flopping. Paul has either injured or gone after injured guys before, too.   It just shows that for most fans when a guy is on your team, what he does is pretty much okay. No self aware Suns fan should be saying this stuff about another team, they aren‚Äôt victims."
Jae Crowder can actually shoot a basketball lmao

"As interesting as this is, this isn't even close to the most unlikely NBA Finals teammate for Jae Crowder.     After the Cavs v. Celtics series got ultra physical in 2015, with Lunch Lady pulling off K Love's arm, Crowder and JR Smith got into it with the end result being JR Smith unleashing a spinning backfist sending Crowder into the shadow realm.  &amp;#x200B;  [http://static.businessinsider.com/image/553e3dd76da811316ac5c918/image.gif](http://static.businessinsider.com/image/553e3dd76da811316ac5c918/image.gif)  &amp;#x200B;  They would be teammates 2 years later in 2017 (Losing to the Durant Golden State team)."
the bubble suns weren‚Äôt a fluke and neither were games 1 and 2 of the clippers series. we also added jae crowder - the whole team took a step up this season and even more so in the playoffs. ayton has never played like this before (he‚Äôs had great matchups in the playoffs too) and neither has cam payne. cp3 was a contributing factor but it‚Äôs a team effort.
I think younger guys buy in better to CP3 than established vets.. guys like crowder probably respect CPs grit and obviously jae has bounced around the league.. the rest of that team needed vet leadership like CP so i think this was the perfect circumstance.. same in OKC.. CP seemed to so much better with rookies and young guns than established vets like harden who can question who tf you talkin to
"&gt; Shit, the only difference between Pat pushing CP3 and Jae tripping whoever that was is that Jae Crowder did it in cold blood.  LMAO the play you're talking about where Crowder grabbed Batum's leg is nowhere even close to what Bev did Paul. Cmon man be real. ""Cold Blood"" wtf is that"
complaining about the refs when you have jae crowder on your team trying to poke players eyes out is kinda sad dude. stop being a hater and enjoy the finals.
"Wanna know something else? When Book scored 59 against Utah, Jae Crowder was on that Utah team as well. There's something about Jae Crowder."
"Because Jae Crowder and Devin Booker are very close to dealing with a one game suspensions because of technicals and it's not worth blowing it because Patrick Beverly decided to have a hissy fit.  If Frank steps in and hits PatBev, who the fuck knows what happens. An all out brawl with ejections and suspensions across the board maybe. It was the right move for the team to make to not try and snap PatBev."
"Pretty much this, not to mention having someone like Jae Crowder who was just recently in the finals sure helped a ton.  Thing is about CP3, at this point you know what you are getting. He will over-react/flop on something he knows he will get a foul. Not that I'm a fan of it, but if it helps your team win and draw attention from the refs on a clear foul there you go, free points.  Each team he seems to go to tends to elevate to another level, and he leads the team quite well. On the court yeah he may not be a fan favorite, but I respect the way he carries himself and handles his life off the court.  Contrast this to Pat Bev."
"Pat Beverley ain't making anyone tougher.  He'd just make them even more mentally fragile.  Someone like Jae Crowder brings toughness, not this little crackhead/roach-looking motherfucker."
He didn‚Äôt earn shit. He played one good game in a 6 game series. Jae crowder can do that
Jae crowder has had multiple dirty plays. Even Chris Paul has. This isn‚Äôt a versus thing. My point is that most dirty plays are just forgotten history and that all it takes is an injury for a player to be called dirty. If crowder injured pg‚Äôs eye and takes him out for the series then he becomes the villain. If Beverly does that slide and it doesn‚Äôt lead to an injury than his reputation changes.
If Jae Crowder is there that‚Äôs 3 of the top 5 lol.   If you add Lebron you get an all flop team too
"Clippers fans are still defending his grit and toughness on the their sub as we speak.  I can't imagine Suns fans still playing dumb if Jae Crowder dived at a superstar's knee and seriously injured him, or talked shit nonstop this series just to act like a bitch the moment that another star just glances at him during a blowout. Pathetic player, pathetic excuses for him."
Looks like just Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill
"Yes, a team starting Dragan Bender and having 39 year old Jamal Crawford, Elie Okobo, and Isiah Canaan as our pg rotation didn‚Äôt win as much with our core of 20 year olds as they did with an allstar pg and guys like Jae Crowder. Crazy how that works."
Pat Bev is dirty. CP3 is dirty. Jae Crowder is dirty.   Reggi Jackson is nice
"Right? Dude was closing out on the wide open Jae Crowder. I don't think it was a miscommunication though, Batum wasn't in a position to switch onto Ayton. What we're actually seeing here I think is Ayton doing a really good job of screening Batum from Paul and Batum just kind of getting his heads lost in the clouds instead of fighting through it."
"Chris Paul, Jae Crowder"
Jae Crowder in the Finals again...  He can't keep getting away with it!
"Raul Neto will always be loved in Utah. I feel like Jae Crowder gets a lot of love from us. I feel like Rubio will always be liked here, but that might just be me."
Yall have CP3 and Jae Crowder on your team. Your team isn't exactly the cleanest around.
"The player that deserves it. Could be Jae Crowder as far as we know, but I‚Äôd like to see CP3 or Ayton win it."
"You guys can keep him, Cleveland can only handle The Jae Crowder once every 10 years."
jae crowder poking people in the eye
"I don‚Äôt care for Devin Booker either.  Jae Crowder is annoying as fuck too.   But I like Ayton, Cam Payne, and Cam Johnson a lot.  All of them showed so much poise."
LeBron was out there catching alley oops and clowning Jae Crowder when the Lakers were up in the series and now he‚Äôs ‚Äú75%‚Äù after the Suns mopped the floor with them?
HEAT LEGEND JAE CROWDER
Jae Crowder the same way Iggy won it in GS
Jae Crowder is a bitch too
"It‚Äôs got to be somebody who has played on a bunch of teams, but isn‚Äôt bad enough where they were out of the league in 5 years. Jae Crowder probably has a pretty good streak going and likely will for a while given the number of teammates he‚Äôs had."
Jae Crowder. Would be hilarious. But CP3 is the best player on the team so I'm assuming he'll win it.
So‚Ä¶ he came to ride Jae Crowder to completion?
Also did it to jae crowder when he was with the jazz. got up in his face and crowder was like holee shit.
Cause fuck Chris Paul and Jae Crowder. Outside of those two dirty fucks the rest of the team is honestly fine. I love Notre Dame so I‚Äôve always been a Monty Williams fan. But Paul and Crowder are just the fucking worst.
Deandre Ayton or Jae Crowder (a la Andre Iguodala all those years ago)
"Lebron James two hand shoved Joel Embiid while he was in the air, an extremely dangerous play and much worse than anything Jae Crowder or Pat Bev did this series. He‚Äôs a dirty player. You should be ashamed to support him."
"jae crowder trying to blind players is dirtier then what pat bev has intentionally done this year, pushing players is dirty but its not gonna really harm someone, trying to poke people in their eyes will"
jae crowder is the real pat bev
I honestly don't get the Jae crowder hate
"Jae ""Danny 'Patrick McCaw' Green"" Crowder"
understandable. hats off to you but fuck Jae Crowder
"Jae crowder 2 nba finals in a row, mans a perfect enforcers and role player"
"Jae Crowder? He's probably as big a pick up as anyone else as far as what the team needed. Not a big giant all star, but this is a man any team would shell out cash to sign, and he signed in Phoenix."
Like Jae Crowder isn't
"Jae ""I look like a Genius"" Crowder"
"I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt like that Jae Crowder acts like every foul called on him is obviously incorrect. We wasted 2 challenges on him acting like he clearly didn‚Äôt make contact.  I get that the game gets dirty and scrappy at times, but I like my basketball to be fair"
Jae Crowder carries the torch
Totally get why people hate CP3 and Jae Crowder.  Doesn't stop me from loving them to death tho
"Jae Crowder: ""... And that was all I needed"""
Fuck this guy. Jae crowder should‚Äôve beat the fuck out of him
The league runs through Jae Crowder obvi.
Damn Jae crowder with the back to back finals
"It was actually Batum's fault for not getting back to his man after they covered the initial PnR. If Morris switches onto Paul, Jae Crowder (who shot 55% from 3 in this game) has a wide open 3."
Danny Green and Jae Crowder having Finals streaks shows the importance of 3&amp;D guys I guess?
JAE CROWDER HAVE THE LONGEST FINALS STREAK IN THE NBA among all current players
I know everything's gonna be about CP3 which he 100% deserves but shutout to Jae Crowder. His shooting was clutch today
Reminder. 14 teams wanted Jae Crowder in the offseason. And he came to Phoenix after CP3 because they saw the roster and saw the potential. Y‚Äôall are seeing it now but they saw it then.
Jae Crowder is a finals guarantee these days.
Chris Paul didn‚Äôt come to Phoenix to reunite with Monty or play with Booker or Ayton. He came to ride Jae Crowder to a Finals
"Point GOD.  Nah but seriously, Jae Crowder has to have like a 90% win rate when he scores 15+. Everytime this dude plays great, the rest of his team seems too also.  Congrats Phoenix."
Chris Paul didn‚Äôt come to Phoenix to reunite with Monty or play with Booker or Ayton. He came to ride Jae Crowder to a Finals
Jae Crowder back in the Finals!
Congrats to Heat Legends James Jones and Jae Crowder for getting to another NBA Finals. I'm rooting for this Suns team all the way. Let's Go!
Jae Crowder..back to back finals.. what a boss
"It‚Äôs really not out of the realm of possibility that they choke a bit. I mean D Book is being called the new Kobe, it‚Äôs his first finals. Ayton is young in his first. Besides Jae Crowder, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any finals experience on the team. And the way these playoffs have been going, you can‚Äôt rule out an injury happening unfortunately."
"Jae ""I'm a genius"" Crowder going to back to back finals."
JAE CROWDER BACK TO THE FINALS
Jae Crowder now in back to back finals. GOAT
"jae crowder rules, what a sick player.   a guy like that is so nice to have on your team  I think he's easily top 50 in the NBA right now.  top 30 might be generous"
Jae Crowder yours? Your answer is the same as mine
Imagine rooting for Jae Crowder
And still outscored by Jae crowder and Marcus morris üò≥
"I will say, I am getting kinda tired of jae crowder falling to the ground on every 3pt shot."

THE JAE CROWDER GAME
Whatever the outcome of the series Jae Crowder is gonna finish like 65% from 3
JAE CROWDER
Jae Crowder god damn dude
Jae Crowder looks like his name is Jae Crowder.
PJ Tucker VS Jae Crowder 1V1 for the championship
&gt;Jae Crowder
"Barnes was overpaid by SAC to stay in town. Wiggins (or Barnes) isn‚Äôt a better player than Jae Crowder, Ingles, VanVleet, Grant, OG‚Ä¶. and they all make below 20M.               20M for Wiggins isn‚Äôt terrible, still not a great contract but much better than his current contract."
"&gt;	as solid a 3-and-D player as you‚Äôre gonna get in this league outside of the superstars.  Outside of superstars? Last time I checked, there was a tier below superstars that included allstar/near allstar players like Jrue, Middleton, Klay‚Ä¶.         Then there is another tier of high level role players like Jae Crowder, Fred VanVleet, Ingles, Grant, OG‚Ä¶ that are 3&amp;D but unlike Wiggins, are actually elite at either defense or 3PT shooting (or perhaps both).             Wiggins is a tier below those players.           My point isn‚Äôt that Wiggins doesn‚Äôt have a place in the NBA, but the money he is making is absurd when all the elite role players I mentioned make waaaay less than him."
Jae Crowder is the all-time best at one pass.
"I was down for the Suns to win because I like watching CP3 and Booker but I don‚Äôt like Jae Crowder and watching the last 2 rounds especially reminded me of how dirty a player CP3 is and I‚Äôd rather Giannis win a ring and succeed given his backstory/upbringing and winning one for Milwaukee. Especially after coming back with his leg bending the other way, shit was insane because we thought he‚Äôd be out for most of next year now he‚Äôs dominating in the Finals."
I nominally would like the Bucks to win because I hate Jae Crowder. But if the Suns win CP3 gets a ring along with Monty Williams which is nice. On the other hand the meme potential is amazing if CP3 loses this finals.
"I don't really REALLY care who wins, but I'm rooting for CP3. He's my favorite point guard. The Suns gm won his only chips with us and Jae Crowder still got some heat culture in him. When you put all that together, I feel as if I should be on Phoenix's side. Oh, and the bucks fanbase talks too much shit about us, so no way I'm rooting for them"
I want the bucks to win too but haven‚Äôt the suns built their roster the same way? The best FA acquisition on their roster is probably jae crowder
"Alright I agree with your sentiment, but I won't tolerate needless Marcus Smart slander, guy is a great role player who is far too often asked to take on a greater role than he should on offense because of injuries to our key guys. He is absolutely capable of being a starter on a championship team, look at Jae Crowder right now on the Suns, he can be exactly like him."
"Both great blocks.  Jae Crowder played in both of these games, this dude switches teams too much, lol."
"&gt;Why are you bringing up that Dirk played without all-stars? Josh Howard was an all-star  Not to demean Josh Howard but he was an ""all-star"". That one year he made it he averaged 19/7/2 and only got in because of injuries to Nash, AI, Yao and Boozer (and a few other guys like Pau Gasol, David West or CP3). That's why Mehmet Okur made his sole all-star appearance that year as well.  Josh Howard was a solid defensive specialist that could also score a guy like Jae Crowder or Trevor Ariza today but arguing he was an all-star teammate because he made it that one year due to a lot of injuries is a stretch imo."
"That's fair. I would probably choose Young over Lavine and Ayton over Kevin Love.  Hell, give me Julius Randle over Kevin Love.   There's actually a long list of bigs I'd take over Kevin Love. I don't actually think he's one of the top 20 big men in the league. The majority of teams have a 4 or 5 better than him. I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that Nerlens Noel would be more useful. Or Brook Lopez, Blake Griffin, Jae Crowder...literally just random roleplaying guys about 6'8"" or so."
Jae crowder played for Marquette in Milwaukee but I hate that flopping motherfucker
That was a foul nonetheless. But how are you complaining when u have Jae crowder and cp3 LOL. Any slight touch they either exaggerate to sell it or straight up fall to force the call.
Fuck JAE CROWDER
"Booker and Jae Crowder are future Oscar winner being valedictorians of the Harden school of acting, who graduated top of his acting class"
just bring jae crowder
"I thought the Suns and their fans were kinda cool before the series, I was happy to play them.  How wrong I was. So many of their fans are just like the team: little bitches who whine about the refs. It's so gross seeing Jae Crowder apparently lose an eye several times or even worse Cam Johnson crying on the ground after he tripped himself begging for the refs to blow a fast break dead. Then getting up and running back on D and not subbing out.  Fuck y'all whiney little bitches. The refs didn't make CP3 forget how to dribble."
Did lebron give Jae Crowder depression?
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
"he got that heat culture, you know he cant keep it anywhere below üíØ. jae crowder a dog! üò§ü§ô"
"I mean, it‚Äôs Jae crowder, what do you expect?"
Yes we are in the Jae Crowder era of just flopping around like a fish and then acting tough afterwards.  You're right.  Sorry
Why the goddamn fuck didn‚Äôt Bud challenge the PJ Tucker‚Äôs three-point foul on Jae Crowder?
"Jae Crowder tries to draw contact on the 3. CP3 does a lot of flop / foul baiting.  Other than that - not a lot of flopping tactics from the Suns.   Booker tries to draw contact, but he doesn't flop. I can see how his complaining can annoy other fanbases. But he isn't a flopper.  As far as the ""help of the refs."" The Suns have been significantly out shot at the line pretty much every series this playoffs..."
Jae Crowder is such a fucking turd. His tough guy act and fish flopping is damn embarrassing and annoying.
"And people were saying the Suns deserved to win it all.. Cmon man, Jae crowder flop act and CP flopping in the clips series was craaaazy as much as i love CP hes one of those guys you hate when hes not on your team."
"Unfortunately, from a life-long Lakers fan, nobody will feel sorry for you, especially over the internet lol. Lakers fans, Nuggets fans, and Clippers fans were trashed by this sub for seeing all of the reasons anyone would criticize this Suns team in their respective series‚Äô. Now more people who didn‚Äôt really care to give any of those three fanbases the time of day and would just shit on them for being Lakers/Nuggets/Clippers fans are seeing exactly what we were all talking about. The CP3 flopping/subtle dirtiness, the Booker whining after every possession, and the Jae Crowder clown show. That being said, this is what comes with winning/being a good team, this is going to be reality for y‚Äôall as I assume you will continue to be a top team in the West for years to come with your young core"
"If the Suns win, let's give it to Jae Crowder for defending Giannis."
Will Jae Crowder &amp; the Phoenix Floppers ever play the game of basketball with integrity? We may never know...
"I wish you had this energy when you went up 2-0 and this sub was the exact opposite. But you didn't you were probably piing it on.  This is what happens when a team wins in the playoffs, they're naysayers don't come on reddit to upvote the comments that would defend the losing team.  That being said, fuck Jae Crowder and his flopping."
The suns don't have a real backup 5 and they're playing Jae Crowder at 4 against Giannis and Bobby Portis. The bucks have Brook Lopez at the 5 who's still very good. Cam Johnson has played well in some minutes but he's a second year player and clearly extremely overmatched when he's played against Giannis. There's no way the bucks wouldn't dominate the boards with the way the teams lineups are.
"I was rooting for CP3 as the series started because I want him to cement his legacy in a good way. Prime athletic CP3 was a joy to watch on NO and he's become kind of underrated overall, but also overrated by his hooligan fans. I just thought it would have been a nice way to slowly transition to the end of his career if he capped this season off with a ring as his teams best player (I still think he has a solid chance at the FMVP if PHX wins).  But after watching the first 4 games there's only one player truly trying to manifest every bit of will onto the court and it's Giannis - not Booker, Ayton or Paul. He dominated after that horrible looking injury every game, impacts every possession when he's on the field and found a way to dominate the wall. His squad isn't playing as pretty, they're fighting and hustling. Defense kept them afloat and not the pretty ball PHX plays with all those open looks and lobs for Ayton or Crowder (who looks like the best 3&amp;D guy in the league right now, massive shoutout to Jae these playoffs). Giannis has to fight for everything and it's not pretty on offense bar the occasional brilliant performance by Middleton.  Idk I think Giannis is proving right now that the 2 MVPs and the DPOY are very deserved. From a mentality standpoint Giannis has been bullet proof the entire post season. They struggled in every round after the first one but always found ways to prevail and this is largely due to Giannis' insane motor and will to dominate on both ends. He deserves it the most atm. I think we're looking at a legendary player playing his first truly legendary post season and I'm all for it."
"Yes, and op is ignoring that *things happen* during games and series. The entire basketball-watching community just watched a game where the Suns were flopping like fish and bitching relentlessly for every call. Jae Crowder crumpled to the ground on threes where he literally wasn't touched. Narratives form because *this shit goes down and we see it happen.*"
 Nothing funny about Jae Crowder tbh. Always talking and acting like a tough guy while he constantly flops like the biggest bitch ever. Plus his cheap talk about the ‚ÄûMicky Mouse Ring‚Äú when in fact he tried very hard to get it himself.  Plus he seems like a constant threat to injure someone.  Fuck this guy.  Edit: remember when Jokic confronted Crowder and he got scared as hell üòÇ the definition of a fake tough guy
Jae Crowder has never committed a foul in his life and you should be ashamed for even thinking he has. He's also always fouled when he has the ball...
"On the one hand, yes. On the other hand, Jae Crowder has been doing this kinda shit for years."
And this right here is why I‚Äôm rooting for the Bucks in this series. I fucking HATE Jae Crowder.
Honestly the Jae Crowder Grimace is S tier
"(Live in Kentucky, love nba basketball but never had a local team to root for)  Definitely Bucks. Giannis is just a good guy that plays the game on a extremely watchable way (tries to dunk the soul out of everyone). Middleton is that quiet kid in middle school everyone made fun of but has had an insane redemption arc. Bobby Portis is an s-tier hype man  Suns on the other hand worship at the altar of flops and bullshit. Jae crowder is approaching pat bev level of annoying. Chris Paul is dirty. Booker is a great scorer but is learning a little too much negativity from Chris Paul. Add in the fact that the refs seem like they‚Äôre trying to hand the series to the suns and it‚Äôs a wrap"
Ahh yes. There's the Jae Crowder I know. Acting like a clown and shooting 3-10.
The mere brush of a finger from Pat sends Jae Crowder flying and flailing in pain. Pat must be much stronger than Shaq.
Nah Jae Crowder and Payne stepped up so did Cam Johnson
Jae Crowder is starting to complain more than anyone on the court... and that's saying somewhen when Chris Paul is playing
Crowder is one of the biggest bitches in the league. Constantly acting tough while flopping all the time mixed with dirty plays and that one time where he shitted his pants when Jokic confronted him.   Fuck Jae Crowder.
"The way the whole Suns team has attempted to meta-game this has driven me firmly off the fence and into Bucks In Six! Chris Paul, Jae Crowder and Devin Booker do not deserve a ring. Fuck their floppity little bunny ears."
wait that just reminded me didn‚Äôt he diss jae crowder when it happened
jae crowder would be out of the league. he wouldn‚Äôt get away with any of his flops
Yeah your not wrong about that but I was always there getting downvoted saying Jae Crowder and CP3s flopping was starting to get dangerous for other players.
"Sat next to some suns fans tonight and they were cool.  Except for some reason instead of cheering the chick shrieked like she was in a horror movie.  After a Jae Crowder flop the dude shouted out that he loved Jae so much he would let him do anal with his girlfriend, then she stopped screaming for a second and gave him a really wierd look. They were alright though."
Fuck the refs and fuck Jae crowder flopping like a bitch on every play. Buck in 6.
"The goalpost moving is massive.  First it's copy the Raptors (having three of the best defenders in the League).  Then it's ""just have a bigger 4"". Heat did, got swept.  Now it's ""have a bigger 4 *and* have Jae Crowder"".  Like bro we get it, you hate Giannis lmao"
Jae Crowder on Jae Crowder is gonna get interesting.

Just do what Jae Crowder does and you‚Äôll get 7 free throws for flopping
"I see what ur saying but the refs prob had specific instructions on these things and prob just stick with to not foul out thr big names no matter what. If that was a jae Crowder player then he'd be gone.   Again I deff see what ur saying, but the refs have their rules they gotta stick too. I urge u listen to the whistleblower podcast when u get a chance."
"They didn't, though. They bailed the Suns out multiple times in the 4th with Jae Crowder flops. They just refused to make a star player foul out. It's 100% bullshit, but that's the NBA.  Refs were fucking terrible all game long, and both teams got fucked. I feel like the Suns got the better end of it, but the Bucks had some fucking awful calls/non-calls go their way too."
"No Jae crowder this year. Giving old ass Trevor Ariza, Djelica, and Dwayne Dedmon huge minutes."
"That's not even counting the fact that Jae Crowder bought them 2 free possessions in a 5 minute period by flopping. Suns have been getting weak-ass foul calls this whole series, and Suns fans are complaining about the fact that the Bucks are getting more whistles in their favor as the Suns are literally wrapping guys up in the paint."
Who knew Jae Crowder was such a bitch that a high five knocks him over üòÇ
Jae Crowder
"Jae crowder and flopping name a better duo. Wait maybe there are better duos, but are they as consistent? *mind blown* *points to head*"
"Yeah, that ball hit PJ's foot so hard Jae Crowder limped off the court."
"And another thing. Not only did Devin Booker foul out twice and not have it called, but Jae Crowder was out there flopping all other the place. And the Suns literally cried about every fucking foul, including when Devin Booker wrapped Giannis' arm under the hoop. I don't want to root for the Bucks but fuck it, Suns and their fans are fucking insufferable."
Jae crowder was flopping and arguing bout his fouls being called all night man
Every team flops. That said I can‚Äôt stand how much Jae Crowder whines about no calls.
"Jae ""Hollywood"" Crowder"
Jae Crowder with the clutchest flops Ive ever seen!
Devin Booker and Jae Crowder don't. They gonna get exposed by a healthy team next season so they better not choke lmao
If Karma is coming for anyone it‚Äôs Jae crowder and every ref in the building tonight
"I never liked cp3. I didn't have a problem with booker until recently. Jae crowder has the stupidest flop face in the league. Yeah, I don't like them.  But they won't be villains because they won't be relevant next season."
"lmao fucking stop. They were in your corner all night. Your players think literally every foul called on them is illegitimate, and then you have Jae Crowder being launched across court but a hand brushing his jersey."
"Bro Booker had to sit for 3 minutes because of a bullshit 5th foul call, the refs didn‚Äôt gift the Suns anything compared to the Bucks. So what Jae Crowder gets 3 free throws, that‚Äôs not equivalent. Not calling Bookers 6th foul was because he had to sit for 3 minutes"
"Man shut up, if you wanna talk about soft let‚Äôs talk about Jae crowder"
"Huge game from Jae Crowder. Time to start considering him in that elite group of floppers with Marcus Smart, Chris Paul and James Harden"
Jae crowder is the biggest bitch in the nba
Jae Crowder really doing everything he can to make his team unlikeable huh?
Jae Crowder gonna lose an eye with how often he‚Äôs getting poked.
Why doesn't Jae Crowder just wear a long sleeve shirt instead of a short sleeve shirt with arm sleeves?
lmao i hope the bucks win in 7 so booker and jae crowder cry. an nba player who cries about seeing a basic double team does not deserve a ring
**Biggest Takeaway from Game 4** - Jae Crowder is a little bitch.
I wasn‚Äôt sure who I was rooting for in this series until watching Jae Crowder act like a little B on the last two fouls calls.  Go Bucks
Jae crowder a bitch
Jae crowder really pissing me off
Jae crowder winning a ring would be the worst.
"I‚Äôd probably love Jae Crowder if he was on the Bucks, especially because he went to Marquette, but I absolutely despise his game playing against him."
PJ Tucker and Jae Crowder have never fouled anyone in their lives lol
Jae Crowder turning into the villain
"Jae crowder first team ""hold me back"""
JAE CROWDER LMAO
"What is it with this sub and role players‚Ä¶.Their bench is cam Payne, Dario saric, cam Johnson, Jae crowder. There is nothing special or unique at all about any of these players. It‚Äôs the stars being better that rises the level of the role players.   Any GM in the league can create depth, but it‚Äôs getting the stars that‚Äôs the hard part. Once you have a top 4 of Lowry, Zion, Ingram, and Jonas, it will I turn make the exact same role players look better.  Bc they (the role players) are asked to do less"
People label shit thats not a flop a flop regularly because they dont understand even a slight hit in the head can knock you over or being slightly bumped when your running can make a guy go flying.  Nothing to do with lebron. Go watch the finals and see how many times jae crowder or middleton get hit in the head on replay but were getting labeled floppers in game threads.
Hmmm maybe we need to add Jae Crowder too. Make a superteam of Bucks killers.
There's a list of players that arent ball dominant that would fit next to almost anyone.  Klay  Pg Khris Middleton  Jae Crowder Joe Harris Evan Fournier Desmond Bayne Robert Covington  Tobias Harris  Luka needs a dominant big and some c&amp;s threats.
"It‚Äôs not really a coincidence I think it‚Äôs bc Bron in LA and at the end with Cleveland was always maximizing flexibility, so no one they brought in was on long term deals. No one was comfortable.   Jae crowder, clarkson, Danny green, Schroeder to an extent. Plus the added pressure of fans, knowing they‚Äôre gonna blame you for missing shots. There‚Äôs this perception that bron gets everyone wide open looks and you‚Äôd be an invalid if you miss them."
Jae Crowder in shambles reading your comment
Jae Crowder
It'd be hilarious since he was shitting on the Suns last year but that seems to be a trend.  Book had beef with Troy Daniels and Jae Crowder and both ended up playing with him.  Even besides the comments I love Draymond I'd so be down with it.
"Definitely. I like advanced stats but some stuff just doesn‚Äôt show up. For instance from the regular season VORP: mikal 3.0, book 1.2, Jae crowder 1.1. But it‚Äôs so clear that booker is waaay harder to replace than Jae crowder. And having watched nearly all the games Jae only gets wide open shots because of books offensive gravity.  And btw cam Payne was 1.3. Higher than books. Lol"
Wiggins had a negative BPM of -0.7 and a VORP of 0.8 which is worse than someone like Jae Crowder who is making less than $10 million.  Wiggins wasn‚Äôt absolutely terrible but with his contract he is definitely still a negative asset
Jae Crowder is great at poking people in the eye
Lakers with Dwight Howard: Champion  Lakers without Dwight Howard: 1st round exit   Dwight howard &gt; AD  Really comparing Jae Crowder to CP3. This subreddit is a joke. Hilarious how other people who didnt watch the suns all season try to tell me who the best player was this season
"Doesn‚Äôt have to be equal, to be detrimental. Doesn‚Äôt have to be equal to hinder on-court performance. Individual performance doesn‚Äôt win a championship. There‚Äôs no way to determine which player hurt which team more. Both teams were hurting for depth at the respective positions. A great example would be if Jae Crowder went down for the Suns. Top player on the roster? Nope. But takes them down a peg or two on the court. New age fans have to get the single superstar wins the ring mentality. Otherwise Harden would have had his years ago."
Jae crowder is a beef cake
Jae Crowder knows how to salsa
"In the three full games he played he averaged 7 assist to 3.6 TO (half probably offensive fouls) not great but also not terrible. Jimmy butler playing like a God, Jae crowder shooting the piss out the ball, and Buds horrific game plan are the top three reason why we lost. And go ahead and lump in everyone playing horrible and out of sync (outside or game three Middleton) for the whole series. Those are the reasons we lost."
Marcus Morris once Jae Crowder had ‚Äúfemale tendencies‚Äù   I‚Äôd say many players don‚Äôt lmao
"he's near jae crowder territory, anyone would take him for free if they could. starting caliber 3 and D wing"
Jae Crowder louder clam chowder
Jae Crowder talking about Antics seems awfully ironic
"The Suns lineup isnt really any smaller than the Heat lineup that beat up on the Bucks in 5 last yr. Jae Crowder guarded Giannis most of that series last year and did fine, it's the execution of the defense(and Giannis playing better) that was the difference."
"Even bam got cooked by Giannis this year. To guard peak Giannis you need a whole team of big all-defense players. The heat had jimmy, bam and Jae crowder last year and the raptors had Kawhi, siakam, Gasol and Ibaka. There‚Äôs like 3 teams that have the personnel to do the wall."
Did Iggy pass the torch to Jae Crowder?!
" &gt;Lebron was also coming off an injury and was very obviously not 100%.  LeBron, in his own words, will never again be %100. He still very clearly decides when to go HAM and when he wants to coast, and it was obvious that LeBron simply did not care about winning that series and I'm sure he welcomed a longer, Space Jam premiering offseason with open arms.   &gt;no AD and most of our team not playing fully together the last part of the year,  We spent a majority of the year without AD and we were still winning. We spent weeks without LeBron and AD and we were still holding steady, not great, but steady. Once AD and then LeBron came back, we closed out the regular season very strong. Everything was clicking. Again, most of the guys on our team are not new.As for the new guys, Schroeder gets a lot of hate but he's instant offense, Gasol gave us a solid veteran presence. Harrell was in the doghouse for some reason but I think he played great the first half of the year. At the end of the day, with just one healthy superstar, whether it was LeBron no AD or AD no LeBron, we were doing good enough to be competitive. When they were both back no one could stop us if we kept our heads on straight.   &gt;Paul missing a game and leaving one isn‚Äôt comparable to all that.   It is. It was an even series. Without CP3, the Suns had the leadership and mental fortitude to keep going. But we were the better team. Bar none. LeBron and no AD is miles ahead of Suns and no CP3, I don't care that they made the Finals. Pretty much 2 games missed for Paul evens out for pretty much 2 games missed for AD. That series had an effort disparity, not a talent disparity. Effort and leadership starts at the top. LeBron acted lackadaisical, fatigued, whiny, and uninterested. He hated the play-in game and basically didn't feel like putting in any more effort after having to exhaust energy carrying the team against Golden State.  &gt;If hurt Lebron and shit role players was enough to beat the Suns, the Suns aren‚Äôt very good and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true.   Our role players aren't shit. We have champions on our roster. Again, this team was not really that different at all from last year's team. We were up 2-1 on the Suns. AD goes down and it's like a balloon popped in the arena. LeBron didn't care. We acted like ""well there's no point now"" and got blown out in our own arena in front of our own fans. That has nothing to do with talent. When CP went down multiple times this postseason the Suns played *even harder*.    Even after all that we still had a chance to make an epic comeback and win in the 4th quarter of game 6. Schroeder, Gasol, and THT in particular all acted like they wanted to win. They acted like being professionals and elite athletes still meant something to them--that they had a responsibility to give %100 every second of every play. LeBron simply did not. He played no defense, stood still and stared defeatedly as Jae Crowder hit a game sealing 3 like an old fat guy who missed his assignment playing the perimeter at LA fitness. He even let the man Salsa dance in his face. For a man that's terribly injured, he sure had enough animation and energy to complain to the refs in the middle of a *live* play *multiple* times that *each* resulted in 4-on-5 fastbreaks for the other team. If I'm Talen, or Dennis, or Marc... at this point I'm thinking to myself: ""Why am I trying?"" ""Why am I putting any effort at all into this game?"" ""Why should I want to win if LeBron doesn't?""  Two nights ago I saw a young man from Greece who was not 100% healthy nearly collapse with exhaustion to do absolutely everything in his power to will his team to victory. He gave %110 when just about every other teammate played like shit. And not only did it work---it was contagious. It positively infected his teammates, his coaches, and the fans. And it's what we lacked on the Lakers this postseason.   That, in a nutshell, is why we lost to the Suns. Not AD, not role players, not injuries. LeBron's effort. If *he* wanted to go to Game 7, we would've gone to game 7. Period."
that‚Äôs jae crowder
Ayton and Jae Crowder compared to Richard Jefferson and banged up Tristan Thompson come on now lolol
"*""To the...free-throw line around Jae Crowder""*"
Yes some people did no need for revisionist history. They pulled up the 1v1 stats and everything. And they were somehow convinced Jae crowder would guard him well too
Jae and jay crowder
Did you even watch the games? Bridges and Jae crowder guarded him 50 times more than Kaminsky did. Giannis was never guarded by Ayton when lopez was on the floor
"Danny green, Tristan, Joe Harris, Jae Crowder as well. Cavs in 4"
imagine having two jae crowder on the floor must be a tough job for the referees
now they're saying it's Jae Crowder
Did he transform into Jae Crowder?
"Oh man, I can name a few from the 2013-2019 dark years:  - Larry Nance Jr. making his own basket against the Clippers on Christmas 2015  - Robert Sacre inbounding it to fucking Jae Crowder and then fouling him as he makes the layup in a game in Dallas.  - D'Angelo Russell with that blunder on the fastbreak with Jordan Clarkson. Kobe then rolls his eyes afterwards lmao.  - Marcelo Huertas (the GOAT) and his backwards shot against the Heat.  - Jeremy Lin not fouling Mike Conley in crunch time while Kobe is yelling at him to foul so Kobe has to run up and do it himself.  - Lonzo passing up a wide open layup he could have got on the fastbreak and instead tries to pass it back to Javale McGee (who was behind him) but turns it over instead.  - LeBron not dribbling the ball to start the clock against the Nuggets and instead the ball just rolls out of bounds."
Devin Booker and Jae Crowder each missed 7 three pointers in game 6
PG - Delonte West  SG - DeShawn Stevenson  SF - Paul Pierce  PF - pj tucken  C - Joakim Noah  6th man - Jae Crowder
Because he has high trade value? Jae crowder has been in like 6 teams in last 6 years
ikr TIL  &gt; Traded by the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat for:  &gt; * a 2011 2nd round draft pick (Milan Maƒçvan was later selected)  &gt; * a 2012 2nd round draft pick (Jae Crowder was later selected)  &gt; * a 2013 1st round draft pick (Nemanja Nedoviƒá was later selected)   &gt; * a 2016 1st round draft pick (Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot was later selected).   &gt; Cleveland also received a trade exception from Miami. Cleveland had the option to swap 1st round draft picks with Miami in 2012 but did not do so.
Crazy thing is the bucks for the rebound on all of these except a jae crowder 40fter
"Jae Crowder -- lost in the finals last year, is on the top team after finally defeating LeBron in the playoffs, only to lose in the finals again."
Because KD would have shattered the Suns as well. The Suns were limited in who could guard Giannis and that would apply to KD as well. Dude averages 31ppg for his career against Jae Crowder.
"Ok, now do Jae Crowder steals. Lol."
I never said the nba was sending him to fix games I just said If they did it would be to extend the series as opposed to pursuing some hidden agenda against Chris Paul.  Maybe Paul hates foster cause he doesn't go for his little flopping shit. I laughed early in the game when he tried acting and turned the ball over...it wasn't the first time this series it happened either.  Giannis got some calls last night that's for sure...but don't act like Jae crowder didn't get some complete phantom calls...or booker didn't...or Middleton didn't pick up 3 fouls half way through the second quarter.  Phoenix lost cause ayton took dumb shots and got bullied by giannis..they lost cause booker missed 7 threes including a wide open one at a crucial juncture...and they lost cause they couldn't make plays down the stretch.  I've always been skeptical of nba officiating but I saw nothing different than the typical shit officiating we see in every game.
None of my comments are edited   Jae Crowder was routinely to small to effectively Guard AD/Giannis this playoffs...?   My issue isn‚Äôt with Zions current defense it‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt think he has shown the tools to have the potential for future defense  EDIT: also Being bad at defense is easier as a guard than as a big
He‚Äôs about the same height as modern power forwards like Jae Crowder or Robert covington
"I love Jae Crowder, but he better be reminded as well how many great open shots he just kept clanking..."
Jae Crowder is a runner up two years in a row!
"First of all: CP3 is a dirty, flopping player who is incredibly grating.  Secondly: While I suspect everyone loves Booker's shot-making, which is tons of fun, he also complains the the refs A LOT and does a lot of stuff with his left arm while driving that most players can't get away with - it's so obvious and I'm very confused why he never gets called on it, and furthermore he uses that arm to create a ton of contact and then, like Harden, complains if he doesn't get a foul on the contact that he created.    I mean, after that atrocious no-call in game 4, he whined to the refs that it should have been his ball.   Jae Crowder flops like crazy.   Ayton, on the other hand, is one of the most enjoyable players in the league. Hard not to root for the guy.   On the other hand, Giannis is one of the most delightful personalities in the game, and seems (like mid-decade Curry) to be exploding with joy at all times.   I had no rooting interesting going into the playoffs, but found myself definitely pulling for the Bucks in the finals for these reasons, mostly."
"No  Chris Paul, Jae crowder, and Booker all missed wide open shots. They had their chance."
"Not sure, but I *AM* sure there is a Jae Crowder curse."
I feel like jae crowder is a close runner up lol
Jae crowder in shambles
"It's so painful to watch, like the ""watch Jae Crowder flop"" post.  But clearly you see him get raked across the face,  in the video showing the flop. Like the people. How is everyone so blind. Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean you are right.  Every single post about a flop I have seen, clearly there was contact and it wasn't a flop.  I am almost tempted to post a few videos the other way where no one fouls Giannis and yet he gets freethrows.  Like also, where the fuck was the foul on Giannis on Mikal Bridges first play of the game? He literally takes out Bridges while also getting the block, it was  the play of the day.... yet in all 20 angles and slow-motion replays, it's clearly shown to be a foul."
"He definitely didn‚Äôt choke, but it also felt like he didn‚Äôt rise to meet the moment when the game was really in the balance.   With 7:21 left in the game, Paul hit 2 free throws to make it a 4-point game. It took nearly 7 minutes for Paul to attempt another shot (a missed 3 with 37 seconds remaining). He didn‚Äôt register an assist. He had one rebound.   He was outshot in that period by Devin Booker (understandable), Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton (far less so). And it didn‚Äôt feel like he was orchestrating the offense either ‚Äî he was far more mortal than his usual Point God moniker.   I don‚Äôt think he ‚Äúchoked,‚Äù especially since it does look like something‚Äôs physically wrong with him (that late turnover was just ‚Äî not Chris Paul), but he definitely didn‚Äôt seize the moment like you would hope for a player of his caliber in a moment of this magnitude."
"Monty Williams did a fantastic job. There‚Äôs a point where you can‚Äôt overcome your roster deficiencies. When your choice of who to guard Giannis in a close out game in the Finals is between Jae Crowder and Frank Kaminsky, well, you‚Äôre kinda fucked. Giannis was eating their lunch, over and over, all game long. Ayton, too  After six games, there really are no more adjustments to be made. Your players have to execute. Giannis and the Bucks did. The Suns did not"
https://youtu.be/tJkMJEH-Eso   I got you. It was dirty as fuck. Fuck Jae Crowder.
[This I think idk](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/10004828-jae-crowder-trolls-lebron-james-on-instagram-after-suns-beat-lakers.amp.html)
Because your argument isn‚Äôt logical. Jae crowder not getting many fouls doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt foul Giannis. It just means he didn‚Äôt play on Giannis much‚Ä¶
Jae Crowder is frankly not good enough for finals wins vs losses to affect his legacy

The suns were just inexperienced. He is better now but with better defense they could have slowed him down. In the 1st rd series vs heat. He had 23ppg on 43%FG. Monty williqms decided to guard him one on one instead of building a wall and keeping him out of the paint.. they should have played torrey craig at PF instead of jae crowder. They needed size but they lost being stupid
"&gt; I don't think they can be better then what they just did  Why not? They're an extremely young team and most of their core and role players just got finals experience.  They now have 3 starters under 25 with Finals experience, Jae Crowder &amp; CP3.  The individual talent on that team has far from peaked.  Now the road will most likely be more challenging in the future, but the individual talent on the Suns team will still develop.  (Of course it depends on how their offseason goes)."
I have 0 respect for the suns espically with the antics Jae crowder and cp3 pull and with antics Devin booker does I‚Äôm happy they lost
"*Devin Booker gives another forearm shiver to a defender who doesn't touch him otherwise, gets another shooting foul.*  *Jae Crowder falls down after every shot, gets another foul.*  Cry harder."
the biggest mistake that heat did was letting Jae Crowder go to us.
"In fairness, Giannis dropped a bunch of those points on Jae Crowder."
FUCK THAT DIRTY PIECE OF SHIT JAE CROWDER
Lol fuck Jae Crowder too
"Considering the Suns have Chris Paul, Cam Payne and Jae Crowder, I'm completely fine with Book lol.  Dude is a beast and a competitor, fierce competitors always get a little bit of hate though."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/01/30/marcus-morris-says-jae-crowder-has-female-tendencies-on-the-court/amp/
Fuck Jae Crowder
"If you in the Finals with Jae Crowder, you gonna take the L"
"Jae Crowder with the 2 straight finals losses. It's like a blessing and a curse. Last year's Miami (12W-3L) and this year's Suns (12W-4L) had really positive playoff results, only to lose 4-2 in the NBA Finals. Feels bad man..."
"One of the best finals in a while. Refreshing to see new players, happy for Giannis and disappointing for Chris Paul.   Awkward plane ride to Tokyo for Booker  Back to back NBA finalist for Jae Crowder"
Jae crowder aint never winnin a ring lets go
Man I want to say if I was a suns fan i would be pissed... to close the game out you had to have jae crowder try some bailout shots. Amazing game by the bucks and it's crazy they were down 0-2 and Giannis hyper extended his knee...
"If jae crowder can be less of a bum, suns  could win this game. So many wide open opportunities wasted"
KYLE KUZMA has more championships than cp3 jae crowder booker combined
All my homies hate Jae fucking Crowder
"Jae Crowder losing in 6 in back to back seasons, damn"
Bruh Jae Crowder got carried to the finals two years in a row in different teams just to lose üíÄ
"Why am I not surprised that the two least likeable players in Chris Paul and Jae Crowder don't even stick around to shake hands. Fuck them both, fuck them so hard."
Cp3 really was letting Jae Crowder decide the game. Offensively.   That was a bad performance for the Point God. Scott Foster or no
Jae Crowder is a certified finals loser.
jae crowder really been through it the past few years
JAE CROWDER has been bounced in game 6 back to back years
Lmao CP3 and Jae Crowder. Congrats Milwaukee
SOME1 PULLL UP JAE CROWDER FINALS RECORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SOME1 PULLL UP JAE CROWDER FINALS RECORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
has jae crowder ever won a finals
look at chris paul and jae crowder not even shaking hands lmfao
Jae Crowder loses again in the Finals lol
Someone needs to make a gif of the doc rivers looking shocked face then it cuts to Jae crowder looking shocked back at him
"Seeing Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Jae Crowder lose gives me a raging erection"
someone salsa in front of jae crowder
Congrats bucks fans. You deserve this moment. Also fuck Jae crowder
ChokepP3 really let Jae fucking Crowder decide his championship. Lol
Congrats bucks fans. You deserve this moment. Also fuck Jae crowder
JAE CROWDER IS A CURSE IF ON YOUR TEAM IF YOU'RE IN THE FINALS
jae crowder
"Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier"
"Because the next biggest defender we had on the court in that series was Jae Crowder. You can't just point to Ayton and say that he failed to defend the Bucks when they outsized us at every position, including people coming off the bench."
Jae Crowder üôè
"The year is 2034, Jayson Tatum has retired. Brad Stevens is rolling out a starting five of Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Al Horford"
"He didn't need to play, but suiting up and sitting on the bench giving pointers is the least he could have done. The reason we didn't want him in the locker room was because he was being a bitch about it all. Compare him to Jae Crowder or Solomon Hill as vets who were in similar situations to Iggy but actually decided to contribute to the team paying their salary. What a wild concept huh."
"2012 had Draymond Green, Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder, Thomas Satoransky, Will Barton and Kyle O'Quinn."
Jae Crowder back in green
Jae crowder ejected in first two minutes
Blazic is a really nice 3/D SG. If he was 6‚Äô8 he could be a Jae Crowder type
"I know that's what they are trying to do, but there are some real key &amp; glaring differences that make this extremely risky for the Pleicans.  * CP3 is a much better player than Lowry  * The Suns roster was a seamless &amp; clean fit for him (Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder etc.), whereas the Pelicans roster is less complete  * The Suns were able to add CP3 without having to sacrifice any young talent, the Pelicans clearly aren't able to do this if it costs them Lonzo.  * The risk was lower for the Suns, they traded for 1 year of CP3.  The Pelicans are about to sign Lowry for 3-4 years, woof.  * Booker &amp; Ayton (and Bridges) is a better duo than Zion &amp; Ingram."
Why would the Celtics trade Tatum for Kyrie? They traded Jae Crowder and the 9th overall pick for Kyrie.
Probably when the lakers got eliminated by Jae Crowder
"Not true, he'd be much more likely to get injured by Crowder cause Jae would try to literally injure him lol"
He get injured easy guarding folks like embiid and jokic   Compare to jae crowder
He learned it from Jae Crowder
"No, they really don't. People just assume that they do, if you actually watch games you see that people like Danny Green, Pat Connaughton, KCP, Jae Crowder, Joe Harris, etc. all get played off of if they aren't actively hitting their shots."
"Your front office seems to make a lot of moves as if the team was far from making the playoffs? If you guys kept Jae Crowder last year, I think you guys make the bubble playoffs. You make the playoffs this year so I would think you would get some more vets, but Bledsoe is not it and Adams is a downgrade from JV. There's still free agency so maybe there will be a good vet signing but as of now, the moves seem weird."
I've not liked jae crowder recently. also pat bev
"PG Steph   SG Booker   SF Durant   PF Ben Simmons   Center Rudy Gobert    Bench: Grayson Allen, Zaza,Jae Crowder"
"Jae Crowder is exactly who the Cavs needed him to be when he played for us, it‚Äôs just nobody really played like that then.  ‚ÄúOk I‚Äôm not going to get any touches and you just want me to hit 3s and play defense???  Like basically zero touches???‚Äù  And now he‚Äôs so so so valuable for that"
Richardson isn't nearly as bad as you guys think he is.  There are role players who have ups and downs on different teams. Just look at Jae Crowder. Pretty ass for Cleveland and Memphis. Awesome with Boston and us.
"I'd rather have them move Bojan than anyone else. Like you said, he doesn't have versatility. He's a great shooter but we need defense in the worst way. We need someone like Jae Crowder."
"I definitely think they‚Äôll still be making moves. I also think the Warriors have made people overrate getting top tier shooters for playoff teams. The Warriors legit had the GOAT 3 point shooters so they shouldn‚Äôt be used as a comparison, if you look at other amazing shooters like Korver or Joe Harris, they‚Äôve gone thru stretches in the playoffs where they‚Äôre cold as fuck, And then they have such limited value. Jae Crowder is a top tier 3 and D guy and he had a game in the finals where he had 1 point. Getting a player who can run the offense when Lebron subs out will always be good, and Westbrook has dominated in the pick and roll wit Steven Adams, jus imagine what he‚Äôll be able to do wit AD. It‚Äôs either Westbrook getting to the basket or an easy mid range for AD everytime. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pick up shooters on the minimum or sign and trade Dennis still. Think it was a good trade honestly"
"I meant probable, like Jae Crowder level I‚Äôd say."
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs more the case with dudes who shoot a low to mediocre percentage but are willing to let it fly. Guys like Eric Gordon or Jae Crowder don‚Äôt always shoot the best percentages but shoot at high volumes and are always guarded. Westbrook is literally left open because he‚Äôs such a terrible shooter.
Shamet is on that Jae Crowder type career where everyone wants him but no one keeps him and now they're on the same team shit is like poetry
Wanna explain what I‚Äôm missing? Because the question asks who is the worst player that you could make a team out of that would win the nba finals. A team of Jae crowder would not win the nba finals. I‚Äôm honestly not sure what you think I‚Äôm not getting or why you‚Äôre mad.
"15 Jae Crowders just might be able to do it. Probably not though.  The defense of point Crowder and rim protecting Crowder wouldn't be great, but overall I think the defense could actually be pretty good with a switch-everything scheme anchored by wing Crowders. Plus that many Crowders slows down a lot of the best players in the league like LeBron, Kawhi, Giannis, etc.  The offense would be iffy. Spacing would be decent, but getting the offense going might be tough as the playmaking Crowders might not be able to get the shooting Crowders open. And you can probably forget about posting up Crowders.  Team Crowders I think could be a playoff team, and given the right breaks and matchups in the East, they could make it as far as the Conference Finals and maybe even the Finals."
Jae Crowder
"Well, to start, some context, Kyrie got traded to the Celtics in 2017. The return package for Cleveland was IT, Jae Crowder, Zizic, and the Brooklyn Pick (which turned into Sexton). Now even before this people were already speculating what LeBron was going to do in 2018 when he becomes a free agent, but the Kyrie trade push that conversation onto overdrive.  Basically Cleveland had two options, keep the pick and let LeBron walk (iirc LeBron had no interest in a trade to somewhere, not sure if he had a no trade clause) or trade the pick, get another superstar and get LeBron another ring, which in theory would convince him to stay.  So every superstar trade rumour had people commenting a Cleveland trade package of TT, Shump, and the pick. Obviously Cleveland never went that route.   to Cleveland's credit, short of getting rid of the pick, they really tried to make it work. They basically traded their entire roster at the trade deadline because the roster before the deadline just wasn't working. But they never got rid of the pick because in the back of their head Cleveland knew he was gone. And if you wasn't gone before, he definitely was after Jr Smith's little stunt at the end of game 1."
"But their role players did step up. Cameron Payne and Cam Johnson played great, it‚Äôs a shame Cameron Payne didn‚Äôt get played more. Granted Jae crowder did go ice cold in some games, but pat connaughton was as well, so suns legitamelly had chances to put all 3 of those games to bed. DeAndre Ayton did have some poor games but he‚Äôs playing against a former all star and a back to back league mvp and a Greek demigod"
as an /r/nba nephew im happier those bums devin booker and jae crowder lost
and Jae Crowder
**Jae Crowder has left the chat**
"Booker, Bridges, Ayton, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder"
I mean Royce is a but undersized at 6‚Äô4 but his toughness makes him seem bigger. He‚Äôs like a guard/wing version of Jae Crowder. Then they have Ingles who‚Äôs 6‚Äô8 and slowing down. At this point I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs best at getting stretch 4s and some 3s. Then There‚Äôs Brooks who‚Äôs 6‚Äô7 and decently athletic and good at defending. I definitely don‚Äôt think he can get jumbo wings like LeBron and Kawhi or Jimmy Butler but he can definitely get PG. Gobert makes their jobs way easier because he can account for their lack of size. So all they‚Äôd have to do is contest shots on the perimeter and funnel the players in for difficult pull up middies. I‚Äôm not sure of anyone else who they can realistically get to help them improve.
"why do people assume jokic is friendly and non chalant just because he‚Äôs white and unathletic?  in his most recent playoff game he wound up and swung at cameron payne‚Äôs face. he targeted enes kanters injured shoulder in 2019 when he was fasting for ramadan and tried to yank it down. earlier this year he had that thing where he slapped the fuck out of TRoss and barreled into a ref just because he didn‚Äôt like a call. there was also that thing with jae crowder last year where he got all pissy just because he got intentionally fouled. does this sound like someone who isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfiery‚Äù to you?  and like, this is just stuff off the top of my head. there‚Äôs probably a decent amount of more shit that i can‚Äôt recall right now. dude gets such a massive pass for this type of stuff just bc of his appearance"
They really missed jae crowder a lot last season. Ariza was okay but PJ&gt;ariza. Dragic fully healthy is underrated but even so Lowry&gt;dragic especially since lowry should be healthier. Nunn gone means clearer opportunities for tyler herro who was a huge reason for their 2020 finals run. Also if oladipo gets healthy at any point he can replace nunn even if hes washed. Morris is an upgrade to their bench too. Im a celtics fan but I think the heat clearly got better
They made the finals with Jae crowder shooting 70% from 3
"The real hit is Favors falling off and not playing the 4 next to Rudy. That and losing Jae crowder as an actual stretch 4 that can defend. Favors and Rudy were just dominant defensively because they could cover for each other at the rim, whereas now Rudy can‚Äôt really step out unless it‚Äôs the end of the shot clock or quarter. And Jae was just a much stronger and fiercer defender than Bojan, plus Ingles and Mitchell have fallen off a lot defensively since 2018 and Rubio was good too. The whole team around Rudy has really just fallen off since he won his first DPOY. It actually show how much Rudy‚Äôs gotten better as a defender that we still had a top ranked defense in 2021 given the pieces around him."
[Jae Crowder.](https://youtu.be/TbePs5BHLpw)
And then sometimes it's Jae Crowder and Mikal Bridges.  Not everyone is going to be a terrible matchup for a large stretch 4 (who is being used in a floor spacing exterior spot up shooter role).
"&gt;Kawhi, Tatum, George,  all 3 of those guys are all around stars that wouldn't just be a 3 and D role player so I think considering them to be the same kind of player as Bridges is a bit disingenious. Bridges's comparisons would be more guys like OG, Gary Harris, KCP, Danny Green, Jae Crowder and Klay (Who I'd consider to be the best among that role) so saying he's one of the best might not be that far off."
"Jae Crowder, nic batum, idk‚Ä¶ mikal Bridges? Definitely Jae crowder tho, great 3 and D wing with decent passing and iq as well"
"It‚Äôs not but ur also forgetting that jae crowder is a big difference.  Pretty much every team he goes to becomes good. Went to Boston, they went from a dumpster squad to ecf.   Suns went from no playoffs to finals.   Culture?"
And is Jae Crowder the difference between getting swept and winning the series? It's obviously not that simple
Nah you foh moron it‚Äôs a play on Jae Crowder saying the same shit like 2 years ago. I shoulda known posting an NBA related joke in an NBA subreddit would result in some trained clapping seal rushing in tho
"Patrick Beverley(will probably be downvoted by okc fans, and that‚Äôs fine)  Fair: he plays a bit rough and isn‚Äôt careful. Also he shoved cp3 like a bitch.   Unfair: holy shit there‚Äôs a lot. that he‚Äôs this particularly dirty player who intentionally tries to injure people. He‚Äôs no dirtier than a player like Joe Ingles. Hell, I‚Äôd say  Jae crowder is the *much* dirtier player who intentionally tries to injure people. Jae crowder intentionally poked pg in the eye in the playoffs, was called out by the lakers in round one,  and took swipes at people‚Äôs knees after flopping to the floor in every play. It wasn‚Äôt really close. Beverley and Booker bonked heads and articles wrote that Beverley headbutt him. It‚Äôs insane.   Even the Russ injury, Russ made the same dive for the ball earlier in the game where he got injured. And Beverley, on every replay is clearly going for the ball."
"Jerami Grant or Thaddeus Young for the Suns. I think we‚Äôre pretty damn solid at every single position right now except for PF. Jae Crowder is good but we need a guy who can slide in at PF to start or backup and who can move up to C for small ball lineups and Jae‚Äôs not really that, nor is anyone else on our roster"
"If I'm the Warriors, I'm looking to trade Wiggins at this point. You're low on depth, now you're set to miss a starter for more than half the season because of his vaccine bullshit. On top of all that, he's on a backloaded contract which far exceeds his worth, and his value is the highest it's been. It's not as though he's irreplaceable either, his best season ever was last year and he's peaked at ""good defender, average efficiency, negative passer, erratic shot selection."" That's basically Jae Crowder, only Wiggins is less versatile and paid three times as much. Try and see if a market with less stringent vaccine rules will take him."
"Fave: Dame/ AD/ Bron  Least Fave: Pat Bev, Chris Paul, Jae Crowder"
Kevin Durant favorite Jae crowder least favorite
Ayo where's my man Jae Crowder at? We all need a number 99 in the Hizzous!
"Do I really need to narrate the history of post-championship Kyrie Irving to you?  In the shadow of LeBron on the Cavs even after his own Finals-winning shot, Kyrie wanted to do it on his own and asked out. Got moved to the Celtics, and since it was an unpredictable trade request, GM David Griffin could only get an injured Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, and a 1st Rd pick.  Then, after struggling to grab a hold of the leadership role in already quickly-developing young Celtics team, leaves for Brooklyn in FA after literally telling a full TD Garden that he would re-sign.  He's missed about 1/4 of his games in the NBA and stands to miss even more this year. What's more unpredictable than that?"
"They tried a lot. Ayton is one of the better defenders in the league and Giannis got him in foul trouble early. They tried Jae Crowder, who is a good defender and sometimes matches with Giannis. It wasn't working, so they tried swarming him and had Frank Kaminsky out too. There wasn't much Phoenix can do. Elite offense triumphs."

CP3- Isaiah Thomas/Tony Parker  Booker- Klay/ Danny Green  Bridges- Otto Porter/Trevor Ariza/Middleton   Jae Crowder- PJ Tucker  Ayton- Demarcus Cousins/ David Robinson  I‚Äôd like this team
Jae Crowder and Kenneth Faried
"Fans overrate scoring. Simple as that.  Players who specialize in other areas (i.e. Draymond, B Wallace, Rodman) will never be *fully* appreciated because so much analysis is reductive to the point of ""Who scores the most points?""   You see the same thing in soccer. Ask about the best players of the past decade. People will invariably name goal scorers like Messi, Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, etc. It is very easy to understand the person whose job is to finish the chain. What's harder to value correctly is the people who toil in the support structure, like a defensive midfielder, center back, or goalie.  In basketball there are players like Ron Artest, Jae Crowder, Andre Iguodala, Tristan Thompson, Jrue Holiday (until this year), Andrew Bogut, and Tyson Chandler who just sort of fly under the radar because the things they excel at aren't the things that most impress the general public (i.e. shot making).   But to actually win basketball games, you need rebounding, passing, defense, etc. That's why you see Scottie Barnes as a top 5 pick in the draft, and the Bucks selling the farm for Jrue, who is not regarded as a great pure scorer. Teams have more of an understanding that winning isn't just about having a bunch of guys who can drop 20 every night."
Nothing better than seeing someone stand up for themselves. Reminds me of JR Smith Jae Crowder moments years ago.
"He's had two serious ones with Payne and now Morris, so I disagree with Marks.  At the same time, Jokic isn't in the same tier as the Morris twins, Jae Crowder, Pat Bev, etc. Jokic loses his cool way more than the average player, but at the very least it is somewhat warrented.  With that said, if this was Embiid, people would be calling for a ban lol."
"No, Marcus got his panties in a wad about Jae Crowder once...."
"&gt; However guys like Marcus Morris, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard are gonna try to get a reaction like that out of him again come playoff time. You'd be stupid not to.  Yup, exactly this.  Getting a reaction like Morris got out of Jokic is exactly what Morris and those types of playes want.  What's more impactful, Morris missing 2 games for the Heat or Jokic missing 2 games for the Nuggets?"
"He has zero tolerance for people taking shots at him, which I respect. However guys like Marcus Morris, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard are gonna try to get a reaction like that out of him again come playoff time. You'd be stupid not to."
Almost the entire league has clowned Jae Crowder let's be real
[He put Jae Crowder in his place lmao](https://youtu.be/TbePs5BHLpw)
Jae Crowder is up there
Is Jae Crowder still playing? If he is then he takes that crown
Jae Crowder
"There are actually so many, I had no idea. Other than the ones you listed, JJJ, Domantis Sabonis, Ed Davis, Al Horford, with Jerami Grant and Jae Crowder as small ball options."
Jae Crowder. You think he‚Äôs a great 3 and D guy til he plays for your team and you realize his defense is mediocre and his 3 is sub par unless he gets hot
"1) Did you miss the part of my comment that said I'd take him for the current season?   2) if I was trying to win the next 10games, I'd also take LaMelo, unless my team already has 3 ball dominant guys. At which point it would be close, but I'd still probably take LaMelo.   Again, role player and efficient #1 option playmaker are world apart in value. It's always hilarious when redditors go ahead calling other fans ""box score watchers"" because they want to sound smart. I'm sure you used to think Jae Crowder was a better player than DeMar. What a joke."
"Miami made the finals two years ago and got swept last year. And their biggest roster change was Jae ducking Crowder.   Yeah. Sure short offseason. Covid. Etc.   Being good in the past isn‚Äôt all that counts. You have to get better because other teams get better.   Bulls, Knicks and Heat are all objectively better. Each of them added All-Stars.   Cavs added a pair of Stars too. Washington added a ton of solid role players with one or two possibly even future a stars.   (Honestly I would‚Äôve said Boston is better too, but they sure aren‚Äôt acting like it)."
"If the team stays as is, Lebron can maybe will them into the play-in, though I don't think they are getting much further.  If things don't shape up, LeGM will come up with some goofy one-sided trade at mid-season and some sucker team will take it, like they did in the past. Just see what happened if Cleveland the year they had Jae Crowder and Thomas and see them somehow getting Anthony Davis against all sanity and odds. Those trades were so unbelieveable that I honestly think the league blackmailed the teams into taking them."

Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder were playing like ass and now Isaiah Thomas can't even get a G league offer. (Mind you this was around Thomas and Wade being pretty toxic in the locker room too) This is so anti-LeBron you've got to be dumb to buy this revisionist history
"At least the Clippers didn't sacrifice much to get him. If you want a laugh, go look at everything the Grizzlies paid and gave up for him: they traded away Jae Crowder and Andre Iguodala for him while also taking on the bloated contracts of Dion Waiters (immediately buying out his remaining $25 million) and Gorgui Dieng (whom they bought out last year), all to give Winslow a look. Winslow only wound up playing 26 games for Memphis. That's one of the least talked about disastrous trades of recent memory."
"&gt; Amazing that the Suns have not been able to sign any big names with this kind of advanced analytics  I mean, you aren't wrong, but we did sign Chris Paul/Jae Crowder, resigned Mikal/Booker plus a whole slew of really solid role players that made us an NBA finals team.  Imagine if we didn't have a sorry ass owner."
"yes, i did see that video where derrick rose finds out he‚Äôs traded while standing in front of his mansion and next to his luxury car  he‚Äôs free to retire in stay in chicago  i also find it funny how D Rose getting treated like this is unconscionable, but somebody like Robert Covington or Jae Crowder just has to deal with it bc they are role players and should just be happy to have a spot"
"There's legit no trade worse that the Kings-Sixers salary dump, maybe the Kyrie to Boston trade  Like people can make fun of the Harden trade or the Nets-Celtics trade, but at least in these both teams had a plan  Kings had literally no reason to make the salary dump. Alternatively, the Cavs knew Isaiah Thomas was damaged goods and didn't stop the trade, didn't even ask for more compensation. They willingly traded received only Jae Crowder and a Nets pick for Kyrie with full knowledge that Isaiah Thomas was a dud, and this was Koby Altman's first move as GM"
Obligatory Jae Crowder and two Second round picks
"You cut out the best part  &gt;""Chris Paul and Devin Booker are All-Stars, but Deandre Ayton is a quality center, Jae Crowder is an experienced, quality stretch-four man that‚Äôs tough, Cam Johnson is nice and **Mikal Bridges is my favorite small forward in the league.""**"
"Last year I felt like we lacked some of that bully ball, shit talking, emotional quality that we last had with Jae Crowder. Just some x-factor toughness. Whiteside and Paschall bring a little bit of that energy back and I love it."

"Jae Crowder drafted, contributed with us, traded in a trade even Dirk wanted at the time. DFS was undrafted. JJ Barea was undrafted. Kleber undrafted. &amp; yea, fuckin Brunson counts too, idiots.  We consistently had late first round picks which rarely turn into star players especially when talent was less widespread in the early to late 2000s. but that's 5 guys that were drafted or signed undrafted that made contributions to the team solidly &amp; have the talent that shoulda made them 1st round picks. &amp; that's a pretty good track record to have."
"dude if you give Luka or last year's team jae crowder we probably win our series, game 3 shoulda been it. we went to game 7 yet nerds here like to troll"
Jae Crowder connection
"If they can find expendable salary on top of Coby White, a 1st and a 2nd - Tobias Harris can be an option. Otherwise they should look for someone like Jae Crowder."
Exactly. He‚Äôs nice on D in theory. Cavs 3rd stringers torched us in the 4th quarter last game by running pick and rolls at him every possession until we had to play Jae Crowder at C.
It‚Äôs also the fact that the Suns had a need for a guard and Haliburon was easily the best one available is all the more confusing. They even took a PF in last year‚Äôs draft with Cam Johnson and signed one in free agency the year after with Jae Crowder. That was a bad pick that I feel like even most Suns fans knew it wouldn‚Äôt pan out.
He's like in that Marcus smart/Jae crowder category of guys who just piss off opposing fans to no end
"Jae Crowder 99, Robert Parish 00"
That‚Äôs the goal! That‚Äôs also why I like Jae Crowder‚Ä¶ you can move him all around. He can play the 3 or the 4 and start or come off the bench‚Ä¶ guards 1-4. Very versatile piece.
"But the year you don't have Jae Crowder, we also steamrolled your team."
"He reminds me of Jae Crowder, he should really lean into that style of play and he will have a lot of success I think."
"Your last sentence is what the rule is. It's the same thing if a player leg kicks, you see this with Jae Crowder a lot"
"I like how you said ‚Äúball out‚Äù. It‚Äôs balls out üòÇ   The guy that instantly came to mind for me was Jae Crowder, no idea why‚Ä¶"
"Right. They're useful. But when you have limited resources (salary cap/salary slots/assets in general) and you have title aspirations, you cannot use your MLE on a guy who becomes unplayable when the games matter. You have to get the most bang for your buck or you will lose in the playoffs.   Utah, last season, fucked themselves by signing Derrick Favors with their only real FA asset (a full MLE) instead of signing someone who actually solved their biggest weakness (somebody who can guard big wings).  Jae Crowder signed for the same money as Favors.   The players you sign if you want to win 45 games and maybe get out of the first round are different than the role players you sign if you're trying to win a trophy at the end of the season."
"Remember when Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson and Derrick Rose were n the Cavs a few years ago and a ton of people said that they sucked, and all of them went on to play very well elsewhere. I think Lebron is a great passer and very versatile and people conflate that with making everyone better."
Fuck Jae Crowder
"&gt;THT wanted to stay and the Lakers wanted the same.   lmaoooooo  If someone else wanted to sign THT they would sign him. The fear was that the Lakers would get poison-pilled. But no, crickets.  Let's see who else is earning around THT's range (9.5). I've put in bold text the ones who signed in the same FA year as THT.  **- Richaun Holmes (10.3)**  **- Devonte Graham (11)**  **- Shmurda (10.3)**  \- Jae Crowder (9.7)  **- Danny Green (10)**  **- Reggie Bullock (9.5)**  \- Seth Curry (8.2)  \- Monte Morris (8.4)  \- **Caruso (8.6)**  Source: [https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  THT is the NBA version of ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know""  I mean it's just the price of dealing with LeBron/Klutch. That's just the way it is. At least you already got a ring out of it."
Jae Crowder?
"Last year we had Jae Crowder, who is now on the second place team in the league, he was our answer for Giannis, he did it perfectly, I'm guessing we would be using Ariza this year, hopefully he can fill the role that Jae had"
Jae crowder robbed
Jae Crowder gonna be that guy in this era.
"I think a Jae Crowder / Derrick Jones Jr type would‚Äôve been better  A wing with some size  Trez had some great games in the regular season, but paying someone close to $10m that isn‚Äôt going to see playoff minutes seems like a bad use of it to me"
"I tried connecting Jae Crowder to Rajon Rondo, R.J. Hampton to Aaron Gordon etc, players who were traded for each other but technically never played with eachother but it shows that they did, any way to fix?"
It may even be better than last season's Thunder vs Rockets series in terms of flopping.  (Also Jae Crowder vs Lebron rematch from last year's Finals.)
Sounds like a job for Jae Crowder.
Jae Crowder could never defend him üò§
Death lineup that's getting swept in 4 by Jae Crowder
People really underestimating how good your team is. They think its just CP3 and Booker vs Steph and Draymond. But the Suns role players like Jae Crowder and Mikal Bridges are incredibly good. Not even mentioning Ayton who has become a good rim defender.
You really saying that any of those guys are better than kyrie?!  Like what are you even comparing here?  Let's not be silly. Kyrie is all nba and a top player in the league at his position.  Thats worth them + jae crowder and an injured IT any day.  Its just intellectually dishonest to pretend otherwise.  Every franchise does that trade 100/100 times and you'd probably even do it again if you get a do over.
"We traded IT, colin sexton and Jae crowder...we didnt exactly sell the farm."
"Why is it wrong for CP3 to be in the conversation? Obviously he's not gonna win MVP, but he should be somewhere on the discussion ladder. He's the biggest catalyst in the Suns securing the 2nd best record in the NBA this year. He's getting so much credit because he deserves the credit. You can still acknowledge a great signing like Jae Crowder and the development of Mikal Bridges while understanding that CP3 is the main reason why the Suns took this big ass leap to the top. We don't get to see all the behind the scenes shit, but the way the players talk about him paints a pretty clear picture regarding his impact within the organization. Wherever he goes he adds wins, and he showed it again this season with the Suns. Nobody had them winning 50+ games this year."
Booker  Mikal  Ayton  Cam johnson  Cam Payne  Jevon Carter  CP3  Jae crowder or torrey Craig. probably crowder. he would have a higher chance of being drafted but could see both leaving if not protected.
"I am crying, my Cavaliers couldn't finesse him out of the Kyrie trade üòîAll we got was Isiah Fucking Thomas and Jae Crowder after having temporary amnesia and forgetting what a basketball is"
Don't forget like 5 years ago Marv said Marcus Smart on a Jae Crowder dunk.
Suns barely missed the playoffs last year and we're only 1 game out of 8th. They added CP3 and jae crowder and are now a 2nd seed while being one of the healthiest teams all season. I fail to see how the coach gets the credit. Thibs got completely robbed. Also Scott Brooks being listed just shows how legitimate this is.
Stg folk just read what she wants. Are you blind did you not see the jae crowder?
Heat aren‚Äôt winning. they lost Derrick Jones jr and jae crowder
"CP3, Book, Mikal, Jae Crowder, DA, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Jevon Carter? (8 seems like a tossup tbh)"
"Nah im just being real, im more a Lebron fan than anything else. You can say im overrating him but i obviously disagree for reasons that are very valid  Trez is underpaid though, he had more money waiting for him in Charlotte, im sure Ibaka could have made 12 mill on another team that wasn‚Äôt necessarily contending, KCP is in the same tier of role player as Caruso and I don‚Äôt think Jae crowder is as good as Caruso   I also think AC is higher impact player than Kuz"
"Bro,...I get it. You‚Äôre a diehard laker fan who will fall on his sword and believe In his guys no matter what. I‚Äôve been a lakers fan for 21 years now and I‚Äôve gotten to a place where I can at least be unbiased in my opinion of guys. And you‚Äôre vastly overrating Caruso my friend and I absolutely LOVE the big balder.   9 million is what guys like Trez, Ibaka, Jae crowder got. KCP got what, 13 a year? Sorry but Ac isn‚Äôt as good or impactful as those guys. Fuck, Kuzma only got 13 on his extension. You‚Äôre telling me AC is that level?! No way."
"&gt;how basically the same suns team from last year is now performing at an elite level  Ah yes - same team - unless you count a 25 game suspension to DA, Jae Crowder, CP3 and Cam Payne the same - then yes, totally the same.      This team had already turned the corner last year, and would have been a playoff team had DA not been suspended."
"The ""Jae Crowder shot"""
So many downvotes but I get you. I mean Jae  Crowder always tossing his hair. So feminine.
"Here's the alley-oop passers to Ayton!  1. Booker (31) 2. CP3 (29) 3. Mikal (7) 4. Cam Payne (4) 5. Cam Johnson, E'Twaun Moore &amp; Jae Crowder (1)"
Jae crowder *
"If the Heat fall out of the playoffs, I'll be rooting hard for you guys and the Jazz.  Especially you guys with the Dragic connection (sounds like you all understand there was no hard feelings between him and the fans when he wanted to leave),   being able to see CP3 get his first ring,   Jae Crowder because of Last year with us (even if only one season),   Booker because of his Kentucky connection with Herro,   &amp; of course James Jones (your guys' mastermind who supposedly said the Miami Heat influenced a lot of how he wanted to try and positively help the Suns and get them an identity).  You guys got this!"

"Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder Cam Payne and Torrey Craig have all been great in addition to our big 3. You are disrespecting a damn good team by saying they'll be clapped. Chris Paul has been near MVP level, no way a team lead by him is an easy out"
Suns since they have Jae Crowder
"Something about buzz William‚Äôs coaching and culture at Marquette was special. Every player he recruited was tough as nails and had a heart of gold. Jimmy butler and Jae crowder were both premier guys given that they were taken so late in the draft. JTA being a NBA player was a shock but given the history of the program I am not surprised. I just wish the NBA gave vander blue a real shot, he is another guy who I felt like deserved a chance. Howard was the only decent player from Wojo‚Äôs tenure at Marquette, but Wojo was one of the worst basketball coaches in the program‚Äôs history. Hopefully Shaka smart will get back to creating diamond in the rough players at an unreal rate."

"Jae Crowder is a slightly above serviceable backup who has the potential to be monumentally bad for periods of time. But, he's still good enough to keep getting playing time. He's odd."
I never understood how they didn‚Äôt go all in on tryna get Harden. He woulda been a great fit with Jimmy and Bam. Their toughness and resolve coulda helped Harden through some tough playoff spots. Plus Harden going from one strip club capitol of Houston to another in Miami along with his style and work ethic. It just made too much sense. Also letting Jae Crowder go was just a huge mistake even at the time

AD stays steady bailing out Jae Crowder
It‚Äôs a combo of all three things you listed. Jrue was a crazy upgrade. Donte is playing great even though he went out tonight. PJ tucker has helped them on defense. Middleton has been lights out.  Heat got worse. That‚Äôs literally the biggest part. Jae Crowder was huge for us playing them last year and no one on the team now brings that physicality to help out.
He lost Jae Crowder trying to snag Giannis. I‚Äôm still not convinced Giannis planned on signing all along but waited until the end of free agency for this exact reason.
If Jae Crowder gets 3 shots for kicking out his legs at least look at that for a flagrant.
looks like an another game of cold af jae crowder and bridges
Jae Crowder specialty
"Holiday is a huge difference maker, Bud has made some significant adjustments since last year, and Miami doesn‚Äôt have Jae ‚ÄúSuper Sized Curry‚Äù Crowder or Kelly ‚ÄúLarry Bird‚Äù Olynyk anymore."
"Yes, the upgrade from Eric Bledsoe who absolutely sucks to Jrue Holiday who is an All Star Caliber player is a big deal.  The loss of Jae Crowder is also a really big deal.  Not to mention Miami just got really hot at the right time, that wasn‚Äôt who they were all season."
"Losing Jae Crowder and Derrick Jones Jr has been HUGE for our defense, and Jae was a sharpshooter last playoffs. Dragic aged and is very quickly approaching washed status, and Herro is slumping."
Nah he's fine at center. We need an upgrade next to him tho. Jae Crowder was literally the perfect 4 next to Bam
"im getting crazy, heat fans  are trying to make us believe that their roster drastically change between last years playoff run and this years sweep because of Jae Crowder"
Jae Crowder a bitch
Heat Legend jae crowder
Anthony Davis and fouling Jae Crowder within 15 seconds of a game‚Äôs start. Name a more iconic duo.
Reminder that Riley paid an antiseminite over Jae crowder
what a difference Jae Crowder makes
Jae Crowder and the Bucks having Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe.
"I'm sorry, I forgot Jae Crowder was the difference between a finals run and a first round sweep"
Jae Crowder was the difference between a finals team and a first round sweep
P sure it was the bucks having Bledsoe and the heat having jae crowder
Myers Leonard and Jae Crowder wouldn't save them rn
Heat clearly missing Kelly O and Jae crowder.
Don't forget Jae Crowder
Bucks lost an Eric Bledsoe and gained a Jrue Holiday.   Heat lost Jae Crowder and traded Kelly Olynyk for a Victor Oladipo with paper legs.
* The rest of the conference got better. * They lost high level role players in Kelly Olynyk and Jae Crowder. * Goran Dragic declined because of old age/his finals injury. * Iguodala declined because of old age. * Tyler Herro declined because he didn't work on his game/body properly this summer. * Bam? * Budenholzer finally realized he could put Giannis on Butler.   They had a +3.0 net rating last year (7th in the league) and a -0.2 net rating this season (16th in the league). This team just isn't that good outside of Jimmy/Bam/Robinson.
"Your wrote this like an analyst but the analysis shows you‚Äôre a causal.   The Heat did not have the assets the Rockets wanted. Period. End of story. It wasn‚Äôt their decision. Stop this narrative. For the love of god.   Jae Crowder is like 1-12 in this year‚Äôs playoffs from 3. He‚Äôs no Giannis stopper. The Heat played a walled off scheme against him last year and his teammates couldn‚Äôt deliver. Simple as that.   And it‚Äôs easy to imagine that Kelly O would‚Äôve helped but the facts are he wasn‚Äôt that great in last year‚Äôs playoffs and went long stretches without playing. Of course once he went to Houston and was their 3-4 best player on a tank job he looked great. That means jack shit.   Again, the Heat did NOT turn down a trade with Houston and running back their team. There was never a formal offer, this has been reported multiple places."
"We got worse. Jae Crowder was a huge contributor for us last season, and Tyler Herro has slumped. Dragic got older and cant put up the same 20ppg. Anyone thinking this is the same team that made the finals isnt paying attention."
"And like we traded Kelly and Avery Bradley for a star who won't be playing, and lost Jae Crowder the bossman. Why is no one calling the Lakers bubble frauds (they were playing equally garbage).  To make it clear I'm in no way making excuse for my team we playing dogshit basketball rn... But like frauds?"
So Herro was an anomaly last year and Jae Crowder was a huge part of the Heats success. I definitely see Miami making a big trade/signing this off-season
I guess this Heat team just isn't the same without the legendary Jae Crowder
"Miami letting go of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard and Dion Waiters really affected them apparently..  In reality, Jrue and PJ for Bucks has truly ascended them."
"Them letting go of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard and Dion Waiters really affected them apparently.."
They lost Jae Crowder.
We got worse instead of better. Extended the wrong people willing to take bad contracts instead of giving Jae Crowder more than a single year deal. We‚Äôre unwilling to trade any assets to improve before the deadline. Oladipo got hurt.   Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.  Edit: it‚Äôd also help if literally anyone could shoot anything but a brick
Jae crowder was underrated in their game he provided a lot of defense and playmaker they need. Also Kelly olynk was a stretch mark 5 that gave trouble to lopez. On top of that coach bud didn't make any adjustments and going against coach spo really took advantage of that
They wanted to save the space for a potential Giannis signing this coming offseason. Crowder (understandably) wanted some years and stability given he‚Äôs been traded a million times. Giannis signed his extension after Jae signed with PHX
"Jae Crowder was a big part of their team, he plays for the Suns. Butler and Adabeyo can't get a bucket to save their lives AND Herro and Robinson aren't shooting like prime Curry and Allen lol"
Letting Jae Crowder walk was a big mistake for Heat
AD should win a real ring like Jae Crowder
Ariza is a cardboard-cutout version of Jae Crowder too
"Harden, CP3, jae crowder"
"Surely some people here and there does not like Jae Crowder right?  Idk he just came off as annoying to me, like last year, had full respect for the Heat team. Loved Butler, Duncan, Dragic but Crowder?   Every time he steps on the floor, I get a bit angry. Even right now with the Suns. I don‚Äôt like his patented move of Shoot 3 while moving forward and drop down to get the call.  He genuinely is, for some reason, a player I do not like."
Highly doubt this sub has 4 million unique members and I'd even wager that its 60% or greater of the same people consistently posting in this sub.    Highly upvoted opinions tend to repeat themselves constantly on this sub. I haven't seen Jae Crowder receive praise just one time on this sub. I've seen his praise highly upvoted plenty of times.
Give Beal and Westbrook players like Jae Crowder and Austin Rivers how much better can we do?
"Jae Crowder maybe, but I saw a photoshopped bald headed trae tho and that was scary so..."
*Alongside Jae Crowder*
"Name a GM that wouldn‚Äôt trade IT the pick that became Colin Sexton and Jae Crowder for Kyrie Irving and I‚Äôll name you a GM that won‚Äôt be around very long. Free agents were never going to Boston because Boston isn‚Äôt a cool city to live in. That‚Äôs the way the NBA works you want to get a show stopping free agent you better be in Los Angeles Miami New York or the player‚Äôs hometown, a big free agent is never signing in Boston."
His 3rd year as coach they were a 5 seed at 48-34  His best players on that roster were:  \- Isiah Thomas (defensive sieve)  \- Avery Bradley  \- Jae Crowder  \- Evan Turner  \- Jared Sullinger  and Kelly Olynyk.  That would not be a playoff team with most coaches.
"I wouldn't even necessarily say this to be honest. In game 3 when the Lakers were crushing the Suns he started clowning and intentionally humiliating our players on the floor. Making a show of laughing while Jae Crowder defended him in front of the Lakers bench. That's not good leadership, it's just a lack of class. Suns crushed the Lakers today and you didn't see anything like that."
"Jae crowder being top 5 in the league?  Edit: The man is shooting 33% from the field and 21% from 3, i really would like you to defend this."
"Then what about jae crowder, and Seth curry being above doncic? Jokic has been lighting you guys up and he's not even in the top 20 for the playoffs.   In the regular season Thadeus young and Jakob poetl was above booker, Lavine, young, Simmons, and mitchell.  Find another stat to back lillard cause this one ain't it."
"I'm not saying he's been awful on that end. My issue is that he hasn't been a top 7 defender and never will be.   Like you can't use these stats they're so wack. Like why is giannis a negative on offense, or how is jae crowder double giannis war. Crowder is a top 5 playoff performer if you see war. Simmons apparently is doing better on offense than Tatum, and Seth curry is doing more than Luka."
Jae Crowder says probably.
The same shoulders Jae Crowder had the audacity to grab last game?!?  They looked pretty sensitive to me.
"I mean getting someone like Lowry in Free Agency, a Jae Crowder-type of guy (or even just a healthy Trevor Ariza), and a big like Marc Gasol or Dwight Howard has not and will not be impossible to get."
Jae crowder called out ad for the same title he was competing for ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"What if Chris Paul wasn't hurt? What if Jae Crowder was hitting his wide open threes in first 3 games? At this point it doesn't matter. Good luck in game 6, hope AD will be healthy."
"OK, that was then this is now  This man has been trashing on jae crowder for the crime of playing above average defense on lebron  This series he's been awesome, it's okay to admit it"
"Jae Crowder didn't stop Lebron from getting what he wanted in the finals, lol. I was unaware that Jae Crowder accounted for all 3-4 guys who are packing the paint"
"jae crowder was the bigger issue  you ready to admit it yet  guess who the top defenders in the playoffs are by all defensive metrics, a bunch of bucks then jae crowder"
Just look at Jae Crowder who played like ass in Cleveland but now plays pretty well with the Suns and even the Heat last year
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
Lebron can‚Äôt even get by Jae Crowder let alone carry the team üòπüòπ
"laker fans clowning jae crowder so hard after games 2 and 3 because he missed a bunch of 3 pointers  insisting he's playing ""bad defense"" when hes got the best defensive rating on the suns while taking the hardest matchups  he's giving up nothing to lebron inside, no drives only outside shots  I get that lebron could use some help out there but still put some respect on crowder for shutting down one of the greatest to ever do it"
1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
imagine thinking lebron was gonna score 35+ against the mighty jae crowder
I mean Jae Crowder is keeping lakers in this series so far
Jae Crowder missing open looks as always
"this series over, lebron has no answer to jae crowder"
"Wasn't being serious, just a callback to when AD kicked Crowder in the jewels to start the game earlier in the series and Jae got the foul"
Can someone please tell me the name of the shoes that Jae Crowder is wearing
What‚Äôs the name of the shoes Jae Crowder have on??
Jae crowder with an early 3? Lakers in big trouble if ad doesn‚Äôt come back next game
"&gt; it's extremely close to the same team.   Not really. Loss of important guys, age related decline, it‚Äôs a completely different team.  &gt; Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter.   He‚Äôs inconsistent. But the fact remains that he shot 43% from 3 against the Bucks.  &gt;He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically  He really didn‚Äôt. Man was cold during the Lakers series, averaging out his shooting vs the Bucks and Celtics.  &gt;I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them.   Not really. But even if they were, I‚Äôm not the front office so maybe try telling Riley that instead of me.  &gt;The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that  Exposed what exactly? That the 2021 Bucks were better than us? Because last I recall they added really good shooters on top of replacing negative Bledsoe with borderline all star Jrue Holiday. It‚Äôs not exactly the same team isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs not exactly the Heat lost due to these ‚Äúmarginal players‚Äù as much as the Bucks new additions were key for them. Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis shot over 46% from 3, and Holiday averaged a near triple double."
"Because A. He just turned 36 and B. I'm not particularly fond of dirty players. I also don't want Draymond, Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder, or Zaza."
"it's extremely close to the same team. Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter. He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically. I'm sorry the Heat's run to the finals was based on the elite play of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk and Derrick Jones Jr.  I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them. The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that"
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"Healthy Timelord is the perfect complimentary piece the Jays need. He defends, he is efficient, and he moves the ball.   Basically the C's need those 3 things in a player. Cheap examples of this could be guys like Mason Plumlee, Royce O'Neal, Jae Crowder, or Kelly Olynyk."
jae crowder wannabe talking shit *once you're up 3-1*  awfully quiet until you get to the point where you only need 1 in 3
"Having had Jae Crowder, I think about the same on D. I think Royce‚Äôs defensive 1v1 d IQ is higher, but jae has a little more size and plays a bit more tenaciously/more emotional.  But royce is better at 3s on offense. He‚Äôs a tinyyy bit undersized but can guard anyone 1-4, draws the toughest assignment every game"
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
"I love mike Conley but the pieces involved in getting him (jae crowder, Grayson Allen, two late firsts) all worked out and are still good/development pieces.   Happy to see success with these guys"
Was jae crowder the centerpiece of the heat?
Oh Jae Crowder has other ideas?
"uh huh you seriously think lakers are gonna win this series  that's so cute, jae crowder has other ideas tho  and look at lebron helplessly chuck 3s when jae is guarding him, cause he is terrified to drive against the mighty jae crowder"
Kelly Olynyk &amp; Jae Crowder were two big losses and also Iggy‚Äôs washed
"Lol what. Ayton is an elite defensive anchor who's p switcheable. Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and Torrey Craig are some of the best defenders to throw at Lebron."
"1) You clearly don't take his high ankle sprain seriously, and you should  2) THE SUNS ARE REALLY GOOD ON DEFENSE. Give my boys some credit! Jeez.   Go watch the film. Ayton made his life a living hell.  And btw, LeBron drove to the rim more times than any other game this season in game 4 per Zach Lowe...so...you're going to just need to give the Suns and Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder and Torrey Craig some credit.   LeBron has been killing Cam Johnson though. You can have that."
"jae crowder gonna keep locking him up  lebron is gonna have nightmares about crowder after this series  sure lebron post all your flashy posters and layups on instagram, but you don't wanna talk about all the times jae clamped you and you settled for a crappy midrange jumper"
suns fans would send death threats to players like Jae Crowder (It actually happened). Lakers fans too (Steve Blake)
"You think the defense matches up well against him because of the injury that happened, last years Lebron would've had no problems against any of your wings. Jae Crowder already got the business last finals"
"It‚Äôs classic Jae Crowder. Dude will go 2-20 in a 2 game stretch and then go 10/15 in the next 2 games. It‚Äôs annoying sometimes but dude always keeps shooting, which is somewhat admirable I guess."
"This has been my point as well throughout this thread.  I'm perfectly fine with the idea that if Marc Gasol received a flagrant for his move on Ayton for his poor wrap up attempt then Jae Crowder also deserves one, but if Gasol didn't get one then Crowder should not either.  While everyone would prefer to see all the calls made correctly in a given game, the 2nd best outcome is all the calls are made *consistently* in a given game and I think that's what we saw here, was a consistent ruling, so I'm ok with it."
&gt;The reason why LeBron did not fall is because Jae does not have the strength to pull him down.  LOL sure that's how gravity works.  Crowder holds on to James the entire time because he is holding him up because that's what you do on a wrap up foul
It was fine enough to dance around and mock Jae crowder the other game.  Didn‚Äôt look too banged up doing that hop sprint down the court after talking trash.  It was fine when they were crushing Phoenix for 2 straight games.  But yeah man sure. It‚Äôs Lebron so if he ever loses gotta make some excuses.  We‚Äôre 17 years into him doing this.
"Lebron has always had games where we wondered why he was being so passive.  I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not 100%. But nobody is. He looks basically fine.  He can run full court sprint fast breaks and slam down towering tomahawk alley oops but it‚Äôs too hurt to drive past Jae crowder?  Cmon.     Put it this way if he never made those comments or he didn‚Äôt hurt his ankle, you would look at him and think nothing is wrong. There is no way anybody without knowledge of his injury could look at him and tell that he‚Äôs injured by how he‚Äôs moving."
Jae Crowder looks like Serena Williams lmao
Are you kidding did you see how he dribbled between his legs for 10 seconds against Jae Crowder in game 3?!?? Look beyond the stat sheet!
To be honest any time Jae Crowder does anything even if he is in the wrong or not he makes those faces
"Jae crowder with the Wrestlemania tag on Bron,  Reddit: CrYinG FoR NoTHiNg"
"Lebron shot 1 FT in game 2....  Up until yesterday, he and Jae Crowder had the same FTAs   Lebron has never come close to leading the league in FTr unlike giannis, ***Harden***, and Jimmy Butler   It‚Äôs wild you accuse CP3 haters of having brain rot when you literally have it as a Lebron hater"
How many teams has Jae Crowder been on at this point? He‚Äôs such a good role player but he never seems to stick anywhere for more than a season or two.
I was enjoying this until I remembered how much I miss Jae Crowder.
I was enjoying this until I remembered how much I miss Jae Crowder.
Jae crowder always shows up eventually.
"Shaq was 325lb and Embiid is 280. That‚Äôs a 45 lb pound difference which is massive. That‚Äôs the same difference as Embiid to 235lb Jae Crowder. If you want to go percentage then it‚Äôs the difference between Embiid and 240 Anthony Tolliver. Not to say Embiid isn‚Äôt big but he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúas big as Shaq.‚Äù  Embiid has Hakeem-esque moves like Demar has Kobe-esque moves. Sure the style is there but the end result is inferior. Not to say Embiid isn‚Äôt skilled in the post but his finesse and footwork are a tier below Hakeems.   Dirk was an All-Time shooter. You chose to compare Embiids best single season with Dirks career number which included his very young and very very old years. If we compare single season to single season we can see examples of Dirks shooting that surpassed Embiid at EVERY DISTANCE.    Embiid   0-3: 74  3-10: 44  10-16: 48  16-3P: 50  3P: 38   Dirk:  0-3: 78  3-10: 58  10-16: 49  16-3P: 52  3P: 40  Not to say Embiid is a bad shooter but Dirk‚Äôs splits are all time. Keep in mind Dirks offensive numbers came from a more defense oriented era against the greatest era of PFs which included defensive stalwarts like KG, TD, and Wallace vs. Embiid who plays in the weakest era for defenders in his position.   It‚Äôs possible to be a fan of a player and laud their accomplish without resorting to unfounded takes and hyperbole like claiming Embiid is basically hakeem in shaqs body with Dirks shooting"
Jae Crowder redemption arc?! üòÇ
"After people clowning crowder in the game 3 PGT...  people celebrating lebrons dominance over crowder... lol  crowder has been putting up the best +/- numbers on the entire suns team, he's by far the best defender the suns have for lebron james  even if he gets beat by lebron sometimes he still makes his life miserable.  and lebron isn't popping off with huge games.   he's doing his job and bringing it every night defensively.   lebron can post the dunks and layups over crowder on instagram but he doesn't want to bring up all the times that crowder stopped him cold and he settled for a bad jumper  and look at this the suns are turning the series around and lebron is bitching out with time left on the clock in a winnable game, JAE CROWDER is in his head with those long arms and quick feet cutting off his drives  like look at this embarrassing shit:  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nmq1jc/post_game_thread_the_los_angeles_lakers_defeat/gzq32jb/"
Lmao Jae Crowder. The guy lebron has shit on his whole career
"Kuzma, Jae Crowder, Julius Randle, Butler, everyone on the Wizards except Beal."
"Before today, it was Jae Crowder. But he showed up today"
forget who said it but when jae crowder arrived in Utah he was telling everyone how happy he was to be out of there
carried by lebron against the superteam of...avery bradley and jae crowder after IT couldn‚Äôt continue?? and kyrie dropped an average of 19 ppg? that series??
He showed true leadership when he let Jae Crowder take a wide open three to seal the game today while he pouted and moaned on the other end of the court.
"suns have mikal bridges, jae crowder, cam johnson, Torrey Craig to throw at him. all those guys are long and good defenders. plus there is ayton on the help rotation. the suns defense is really good. its a lot to handle. even for lebron."
Jae Crowder definitely stepped up this name
:stares in Jae Crowder
What if you wanted to go to heaven  But God said  Jae Crowder for 3 boi
"He was really good in the previous games while Jae Crowder was terrible on offense, they decided to switch roles"
"Its like when the cavs put in Perkins, you knew what was about to happen. I think he fought jae crowder too"
"This is literally Jae Crowder experience. He'll shoot 45% in the next series, if they advance."
Heat also had a better supporting cast last year. Jae Crowder was big especially vs the Bucks and Herro was also playing injured most of this season
"When Da Vinci was painting the Mona Lisa's smile, he was thinking of this exact Jae Crowder clip"
Because when Jae Crowder is off he is unbelievably butt and a huge burden to his team's offense.
Jae Crowder
"I would argue that for Jae Crowder, that contributes to a good game."
"You gotta give up something in the playoffs. Against the Suns, you trap Book and give up Jae Crowder 3s. If they go in, we win. If not, we lose."
Jae Crowder sends his regards.
Jae Crowder redemption arc
"Jae Crowder hit a wide-open 3? When he was on my team, he could only hit contested ones."
Yeah Crowder lucky AF he hit that because if they blew that game all anyone would remember is Jae Crowder almost missing the entire backboard.
"The masses have now voted Jae Crowder to be public enemy #1. He will be sentenced to the gallows. May God have mercy on his soul.  But seriously cmon man, I was rooting hardtime for Crowder this series and this is kinda disappointing"
"Jae Crowder reaction to Lebron asking for a foul waa peak Jae Crowder meme game.  Also,  Every Laker fan right now trying to donate their groin to AD"
When Jae Crowder is on. The team wins. Why is that always the case
Jae Crowder +21
The Jae Crowder experience
real wild ass jae crowder ride in the last quarter
Jae Crowder is such a fun player when he‚Äôs on.
We should all hang our heads in shame for getting crushed by shit ass Jae Crowder.
Jae Crowder is an enigma
Jae crowder gets a bang call. Haha
Obligatory fuck Jae Crowder
Looking forward to the inevitable Mortezl Harrell/Jae Crowder fight next game
"Lol I think people are missing the point.  13/5/1 aren't bad numbers if you're, say, Jae Crowder. If you're former all-star and purported second star to a contending team Kristaps Porzingis, those numbers are really, really bad. Look how the Bucks are getting thrashed with an 18ppg guy as their second option. The Mavs can only dream of being thrashed by the best team in the league in the second round right now."
I mean there's usually pushback from one side if there actually are differences in opinion. There was none so I just figured that 'Jae Crowder sucks' is /r/nba certified. He's not the type of player they like anyway lol.
this sub is so up and down on Jae Crowder lol. For the longest time he was asscheeks and soft as Charmin and now he's back to being tough?
Also for some reason everyone has forgotten about Jae Crowder. Like he wasnt a huge addition.
Russell Westbrook  Joe Ingles  Jae Crowder  Michael Porter Jr  Myles Turner
Jae crowder might be the best glue guy in the league. Maybe not peak iguadala level but just a guy you will take on your team any day of the weak
For real. But they ignore the Jae Crowder linebacker screen on Jokic that got him open.
"Think of it this way, OG is a better version of his teammate Jae Crowder."
"Oh, I had no issue with the way the two were officiated. Both played physical and got pretty fair calls. It's when others switched on Jokic, he got whacked and should have got like 1-3 shooting calls and 3-4 calls on the floor. Jae Crowder to me was the main guilty party. That non-call shove in particular was a pretty egregious non-call to me. But i think it's more of an indication on how the game is called these games. Smalls can get away with war-crimes against bigs but you breath on a smaller player, it's a flagrant one."
"Not to overreact, but the Phoenix Suns are winning the NBA Championship.  Memes aside and the classic r/nba overreaction comment hopefully avoided, I really do think they have a good chance, due to the thing I always look for in the playoffs -- a complete roster.  I love the way the Suns are built.   Point guard, 3&amp;D, elite scorer, big man.   If you evaluate rosters throughout the NBA based on the idea that those 4 player-archetypes round out a team, I just don't see anyone anywhere close to as complete as the Suns (the team they're playing in the Nuggets I'd argue is closest with a fully healthy roster).  I'm not saying other rosters aren't ""better"", obviously when you have the talent of the Clippers/Nets, and great teams like the Bucks (sadness) and Jazz.  But just looking at those categories, the Suns are insane:  * Point guard: The point god himself cp3, great backup option in Cam Payne  * Elite scorer: Booker. Enough said. Important that this role is fulfilled by someone that can create their own offense.  * 3&amp;D: Fucking loaded. Proven playoff 3D guy in Jae Crowder who makes all the teams he's been on better. Mikal Bridges and Torrey Craig are legit as fuck. Then a 6'8 Cam Johnson to maybe give a spark when the others don't have it. Four guys!  * Big guy: Ayton. #1 overall pick. Solid as fuck already at 22 years old. Lets the game come to him. Efficient, strong, good rebounder. Good feel around the rim and short range touch shots. Just a really good big man offensively and defensively. Maybe not as dominant/assertive as people would want, but come on.  Love rosters that are complete like this."
"I'm just here to hype up the Jae Crowder signing. As I watched the Heat vs. Celtics series last year, I was just thinking, 'Find a way to get this guy to Golden State!' Depth is so important in the NBA and he's a player that can improve any team with his versatility. One of those unsung guys who can be the key piece to help get a roster over the line. Loved that pickup for Phoenix, and maybe Miami are missing him."
Jae crowder a better career playoffs performer than Giannis lmao
jae crowder would unironically be mavs 2nd best player
Jae Crowder is loving life
Jae Crowder and Danny Green are always the last pieces of good teams
Apparently Jae Crowder
Where were you during the Jae Crowder revenge tour
Jae Crowder does SO many things right . no idea why people hate him so much. Wish my dumb ass team never gave him up
Jae Crowder a real one
Who the hell let Jae Crowder shoot 8 times in a quarter üòÇüòÇ
jae crowder is one of the best roleplayers left in the playoffs
JAE CROWDER ONLY MAKES THE HARD ONES
"Jae ""Salsa"" Crowder"
JAE FUCKING CROWDER!
I swear Jae crowder has the most 4 point plays
Every team needs a Jae Crowder
I love watching Jae Crowder
Feels like Jae Crowder gets a decent amount of 4-point plays haha
Jae crowder letting them hoes fly
Man CP3 really turned a bubble Cinderella into a solid contender. Jae crowder too a great addition.
Jae Crowder is 3 games cold 3 games hot. So if this goes 6+ Crowder will be cooking by the end.
"I‚Äôve been making these claims before the series started. You guys were gonna win against The lakers game 4 since AD was having a bad game. Aswell you guys have way more depth than the lakers. Plus you guys have 3 all star caliber players, with and elite 3&amp;d player in mikal bridges and Jae crowder who doesn‚Äôt get the right amount of appreciation."
Should have been between Thibs and Snyder. Monty gets way too much credit for their success. He‚Äôs a fantastic coach but they added CP3 and Jae Crowder. Snyder literally just got Derrick Favors back and is the best team in the league by a mile.
Your the team that might have to face that in the finals.  No Jae Crowder or Mikal Bridges alive can stop that scary bad man.
Basically picture Kevin Huerter or Jae Crowder
0 Devin Booker highlights  0 Chris Paul 3s 0 Jae Crowder 3s
"Jae Crowder signed with the Suns, a couple of the bigger free agents signed with the Hawks.   There are ways to improve rosters without signing just marquee guys.   There is no argument to be made that Olshey made smart moves with his cap space this summer. He spend 9+ mil a year on a guy that can only dunk."
"Lmao bruh the difference is twofold. One The lakers were playing the Suns while the Nuggets were playing the Blazers. Switch that and you just might get a different result. Second, Jokic is healhty whereas Lebron is not. I'm not sure Lebron is the best player on earth, but I know he damn sure isn't when he can't get by Jae Crowder because of a bum ankle."
Jae Crowder
"Jae Crowder shouldn't be the difference to you being competitive and getting absolutely abused by the Bucks. You can look at Jae's shooting history. It's full on brief hot streaks amid mediocre shooting numbers. Again, if you're relying on him for lots of offense, your team has problems.   The bucks absolutely exposed the Heat. They weren't just better, they destroyed the Heat. Jimmy Butler was useless. Bam was a huge disappointment. And the heat are supposed to be a great defensive team. Don't undersell it, it was a really bad series"
If bron is the best in the world what does that make Jae crowder
"Thank you for the very detailed answer. I appreciate the time it took for this response.   I honestly don‚Äôt remember too much of the ECF bubble games because I watched so many games (most of the playoffs) last year during COVID but just going off this year he wasn‚Äôt going to beat the Bucks who came out with an even better roster than last year (Jrue&gt;&gt;&gt;Bledsoe) and the Bucks went nuclear from beyond the arc. They also lost a couple key pieces - Jae Crowder and Olynyk were more valuable than they thought as bigger bodies who could also space the floor and defend decently well against the size of the Bucks. Iguodala also regressed even more. They just weren‚Äôt going to win this year, and there‚Äôs not much a coach can do when his best player (Jimmy) just played like absolute dogshit.  I would say last year is probably the best roster Spoelstra has had since the LeBron days, but they‚Äôve made some questionable gambles and risks in FA that haven‚Äôt panned out particularly well. I do think that Carlisle is an elite coach and has been for a while though. People just forget about him and anyone saying Lue outcoached him (while having a much better roster) is an idiot. He adjusted well, something a lot of coaches don‚Äôt do, but Mavs were the definite underdogs and it came down to the wire."
Having those assets gives them the ability to make those moves in a sense. Otherwise Capella and Bog would have likely been invested in the infamous ‚ÄúJae Crowder‚Äù type
"Also, and Dallas fans correct me if I'm wrong here, but wasn't Dallas posturing for Giannis's free agency?   I thought them and the heat were, and it screwed over both teams. I think Dallas and Miami didn't want to offer Jae Crowder more than a 1 year deal cause of Giannis, I imagine they lost out on others FAs for the same reason.   The Dallas GM seems to swing for the fences.. on one hand it got them Doncic. On the other.. porzingis lol. And then whatever FAs they lost chasing Giannis (assuming my memory is correct)."
Who hurt you? Oh yea. Jae crowder a 12th man did üòÇ
I'd compare him to Jae Crowder in that way
"When will this sub learn that this how role players do in this league? One game they can't hit anything, other game they hit a lot. Jae Crowder, Danny Green, KCP etc."
Does jae crowder has the potential to become the next lebron?
"This man had never made more than 6 threes in a game in his entire six year career, in an era when even Jae Crowder has done that shit, and then he goes and does it in the most important game of his life?! I fuckin love this guy"
"I would imagine that Monty will be relying on Torrey Craig/Jae Crowder quite a bit to defend Jokic if DA is resting, otherwise I‚Äôm sure DA is going to have to match Joker‚Äôs minutes as closely as possible"
"Jae Crowder??? Lmao (put every facepalm gifs here). Conley??  CP3, ill give u that. But Booker is clearly their no.1 option. But then who else?  DPOY, 6MOTY, or whatever OTY that is... they got nothing on KD alone. Then there's harden and kyrie."
Jae Crowder might know something about that
Fans will say whatever. But Jae crowder was literally going overboard because of the fact that bron has historically owned him and traded him as well  The theatrics on the court plus social media all support this. Bron lives in his head rent free
jae crowder
"Suns and Lakers was magical, ya I‚Äôm biased but the back and forth competitive play was good and the Jae Crowder/Lebron drama was chefs kiss"
"Mate, Clyde averaged 21/7/4 with 50% shooting that season as a Rocket, and he made All-NBA team. Similar to Kevin Love? Who barely made All-stars because multiple selectees were injured. Are you kidding me?  Why is this even a conversation, are you trying to compare 1995 Magic to 2018 GSW? Like.. what?  Check you stats before ranting random shits, Jae Crowder played 107 games for Jazz. He had third most attempted shots in both of seasons with Jazz, plenty of chances.  Yeah of course, he is Lebron James, but true fans would always remember The Block, The Shot, and the Stop. How many fans do you think know that Pau Gasol was actually the most impactful player on the both ends for 2009-2010 Lakers? Kerr won a game for Bulls with that shot, do you think people mention that more than MJ's last shot?"
"Kuzma really is one of those tweener forwards that can‚Äôt figure it out. Seems like for all of the talk about so many guys having a limited impact because their tweeners, most of them have figured out a role somehow. Guys like Draymond, Thad Young, Jae Crowder, Danilo, etc. have seemed to carve out productive careers despite note cleanly fitting into one position. They figured out their skills and their role and how they can help a team win. Kuzma hasn‚Äôt really done that in my opinion. Not really a 3&amp;D guy, not really a ball handling scorer, not a high energy fly around the court guy."
"Shaq? Bruh you serious right now? First of all, Hakeem played against Shaq in 1995, when he had Clyde as his teammates. OP was clearly referring to 1994 season. Second, you really want to start with teams that Lebron played against in the Finals? You really want to go there?  Did Jae Crowder play well on Jazz? Oh did you know he also played for Memphis?  His shooting were MUCH worse than his tenue with Cavs, weird isn't it? Ja Morant and Mitchell made his shooting worse?  IT was a hot garbage. For a PG that shot under 40% and can't defend, h o t  g a r b a g e. Not even Lakers in rebuild mode wanted him. Was he not given opportunity in Denver? In Washington? Didn't Pels signed him for 10 days this season?"
"I like how you just ignored SHAQ like I didn't bring him up lmao.  Lebron has played with multiple legit career 40% shooters from 3 every year like Kyle Korver on that 2018 squad but somehow those 3-pt snipers always shot like shit when they play with Lebron. Why is that? Maybe it's the Lebron system that they were playing in? For a guy who has the reputation of making the guys around him better, Lebron's teammates sure always underperform when they play with him don't they?  Speaking of 10+ points, Jae Crowder has looked like an above average role player on every team he's played on except the Cavs. Same with Danny Green with the Lakers, he's has been great on the spurs, raptors, and sixers this year but everyone could've sworn he was the worst player in the league last year.  IT was garbage on the defensive end, but could've at least averaged 10 ppg. You're acting like he didn't average 30 the year before. I'm also just listing you players on the Cavs squad that could've given Lebron 10 points on the Cavs squad."
Noted Cavs journeyman Jae Crowder obviously
Seems like the usual Jae Crowder experience tbh
Its funny. You have to give credit to the Suns. They're the 2nd seed in the West for a reason. They have some great talent and rising stars on the roster w/Chris Paul and Jae Crowder being the veterans who can guide them.
Cam Payne or Jae Crowder for Kuzma? Hell nah.
I thought Jae Crowder was 35.
"Smh. KP is very frustrating yes but my man,  he averaged 20 and 9 THIS year.  Wiggins is both fools gold and easily replaceable. With Klay back half the shots that Wiggins took, Wiggins would no longer be taking. So you‚Äôd have a 40 million dollar scorer masquerading as a role player.   Instead of Wiggins you‚Äôd just need a 3 and D. And the key is the ability to slide to the 4. Which Wiggins can‚Äôt. It would be very easy to replace Wiggins. Guys like Jae crowder/PJ Tucker/Harrison Barnes. Someone like that will be available.  Not to mention, the ‚Äòsafe‚Äô play of Wiggins isn‚Äôt winning them a title. You make that trade banking on your system gettin more out of KP"
Cava jae crowder was the worst player in the league lmao
Jae crowder and cam johnson too
"&gt; LeBron got on a phone call with Chris Paul, Westbrook, and someone else and they talked out next steps and advice from Obama.  That someone else? None other than Jae Crowder!"
Wabbit season for Jae Crowder.
I said that earlier today. He‚Äôs just a bully. That‚Äôs why it was ultimate karma when Jae hit him with that salsa.   They was hoopin and hollerin when he was dancing on Crowder game 3. He was laughing and having a good time. When he gets a dose of his own medicine he pouts and goes to the back to go cry.   He‚Äôs a textbook bully &amp; a narcissist.
"You sound like you could use a hug.  Instead, here's Jae Crowder getting ejected for salsa dancing:   https://youtu.be/xLYvxoAoiZs"
Danny Green and Jae Crowder are still in the playoffs so lemme get back to you once the dust settles
Remember when Jae Crowder player like shit that year in Cleveland
"Jae Crowder ain‚Äôt shit, he‚Äôs cool talking all that smack when the lakers injured as fuck but fully healthy squads? We know how that ends."
Jae Crowder said in his post gamer that LeBron is the best player in the world  But go off!
Dude its Jae Crowder.... lol hes a good role player
"Enter Jae Crowder, who is the streakiest shooter ever, but will shoot those shots every time."
Thats just the Jae Crowder experience.
Jae Crowder is not a man I would mess with.
How on earth does Jae Crowder think he has room to troll Lebron. So painfully unaware of his inferiority.
and [he salsa danced](https://sports.yahoo.com/watch-jae-crowder-ejected-celebratory-151420375.html) to top off his revenge tour. What a hero.
You for sure. Think the lakers should trade him for a winner like Jae Crowder üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ
"lol - love how Crowder has been trying to beef with Lebron this series. Like an ant trying to fuck with a giant. Get real, Jae."
"Relax. I was rooting for and had money on the Lakers. AD is soft and injury prone. This post isn‚Äôt about the suns, it‚Äôs about Jae Crowder"
Jae Crowder just straight chills on playoff teams. What a great journey man
"Jae Crowder is streaky as fuck, talks a lot of shit and has some dirty plays on his resume. He clowned the Lakers for their Micky Mouse ring. Alright my guy, but if I remember correctly you tried pretty hard to get it yourself just last year.   He‚Äòs one of the guys you might like when he is on your team but seriously, fuck Jae Crowder."
"jae crowder is funny, your king quit"
1.	Cam Payne 2.	Devin booker 3.	Chris Paul 4.	deandre ayton 5.	Mikal bridges 6.	Jae crowder 7.	frank kaminsky 8.	cam Johnson 9.	Dario saric 10. Lebron James
Making up narratives. Everyone likes Booker.  It‚Äôs Jae Crowder we hate.
We live In a time where Jae crowder gets the last laugh on lebron
Ankle didnt seem to be bothering him when he was doing spin dunks and laughing at jae crowder
"Ahh yes, as Jae Crowder had 4 other guys in the paint behind him. He definitely shut LBJ down. You sound dumb"
"I hated when he would run right into Jae Crowder's space. He didn't even have to hit Crowder, he would just flop to the ground before Kuzma even reached him and the refs would still give 3 free throws every time. Dude, just contest the shot without charging like an idiot."
Jae Crowder is like the kid in call of duty who‚Äôs talking shit after going for 3 kills and 17 deaths
i really don‚Äôt like Jae Crowder at all ‚Ä¶ man i wish we had him. lots of respect for the guy.
This is the first time jae crowder has ever beat lebron in the playoffs I doubt he got into his head lmao
"I always kinda felt bad for Crowder after JR punched him the face and destroyed his knee, have to imagine Jae hasn‚Äôt forgot that was Lebron team lol"
Jae Crowder did not get in LeBron's head
Except for Cavs Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder is not good enough to be talking THIS much shit against an AD-less Lakers lol
Jae Crowder is the first person that comes to mind. He seems to shoot fairly consistently regardless of pressure. I think I would prefer him taking a wide open 3 than KD taking a contested one.
"Watching these conference finals, the Kyrie Irving trade was actually a good return for the Cavs. Jae Crowder is a championship level role player as seen by him starting in back to back finals on different teams. They got to take a flyer on Isaiah Thomas, but most importantly they got an unprotected pick in the 2018 draft that included Deandre Ayton (1), Luka Doncic (3), and Trae Young (5). This was a brillaint gambit by the Cavs GM, as not only could they get one of these franchise altering players, but it could have also convinced LeBron to stay if they got someone that could lead a team to the finals like Trae Young or Deandre Ayton."
"Gallo, Bogi don't fit the hawks timeline  CP3 and Jae Crowder don't fit the suns timeline  Millsap didn't fit the nuggets timeline  You need vets and most importantly take advantage of cheap contracts"
that play was mostly jae crowder too.
And Jae Crowder will get a technical for it
"This one had to be the most ridiculous. Literally all he did was exist and have Jae Crowder Face during a game. Like I still can't figure out what the tech was for, aside from being him around an opposing player who got a tech."
"The pass was a hail mary so it just had to be put on the spot and hopefully Ayton would be there. Series would be tied if Zubac beat Ayton to it. I will give credit to Jae Crowder but this shouldn't take you 1,000 tries by yourself like the other user implied."
"I live just north of Miami, but never really go there. I can‚Äôt watch ESPN for this reason. I don‚Äôt think it is elitism as much as it is laziness. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not LA, so there‚Äôs nothing to do!‚Äù Poor baby, hike a beautiful mountain trail you derp.   I‚Äôd do anything to move to Denver, Portland, Seattle, etc. Most US cuties have some unique and awesome things to do.   I say it is laziness, because in the case of the NBA, as a fan, as most people in here are, I can safely say that each team has some pretty great story lines and players that can be talked about by big networks, but they don‚Äôt because they are lazy. Another poster mentioned they talk about like 10 players all season long. It‚Äôs really sad as a fan when you watch a team like PHX or Denver or Utah play such exciting basketball, but they get no play in media because it would be too hard for SAS and Max Kellerman to talk for two second about how great someone like Jae Crowder has been everywhere he goes.   They‚Äôre just so lazy. It‚Äôs so much easier to just yell and bloviate and say all sorts of nasty things about places they‚Äôre too lazy to experience than to actually work and not recycle the same 5 storylines every day.   Imagine if basketball was reported on by actual fans and not just media hype people getting paid to make clickbait segments for mass consumption of stupid storylines no actual fan really cares about?"
"As long as you ignore the play in game where he played great and everyone started picking them to win the finals again...  Wild how there wasn‚Äôt injury talk when he was clowning Jae crowder in game 3 and getting his head at the rim on oops, but it sure started once AD went down. Not saying he wasn‚Äôt fully healthy, but Lakers fans want to pretend like he was limping around out there and not making insane athleticism highlight plays"
"It should be VERY concerning to the Bucks that Jae Crowder and Kawhi Leonard were the players who were the primary perimeter defenders on Giannis when the Bucks lost in the playoffs, and now Kawhi is on one of the teams in the WCF and Crowder is on the other team."
The way you're talking about Jae Crowder you'd think he didn't just thread the needle on an out of bounds pass to set up a game winning dunk.
He pulls him first then pushes him. LOL.   I‚Äôm frankly surprised they didn‚Äôt call it. And then review that call. And then after reviewing it confirming the call and adding a flagrant foul on Booker and also ejecting Jae Crowder for instigating the whole thing with that inbound pass.
I don't know how NOBODY is mentioning the one person that does actually do really well against him that you guys somehow ended up with... Jae Crowder. He rocked our shit last year.
"&gt; It‚Äôs the obvious first read for Crowder because it‚Äôs their best chance  Not necessarily.  With hindsight it looks like the obvious choice but there are really 2 options for Phoenix.  1. Try the alley oop  2. Try a catch and shoot  There are pros and cons to each. The alley oop is a more surefire shot, but extremely difficult to execute the inbound and time the oop.  The catch and shoot is a more difficult shot but easier to get an inbound look for.   Phoenix chose the oop play but they could've just as easily tried to do a catch and shoot since they have an elite catch and shoot SG.  From the perspective of LAC Phoenix could do either of those.  So you have 2 options, either 1. Sell out on one of them and for Phoenix to do the other or 2. Try to stop both.  Even if you are going to sell out to stop the oop, you're going to do it with your bigs on the floor, not the inbounding man.   What the Clippers did is basically decide to position Boogie where he could try to disrupt both. Make the oop more difficult and make an inbound for a catch and shoot more difficult, rather than totally selling out for one or the other.  It's a perfectly fine strategy, as it was Jae needed a perfect inbound to do it. Unfortunately for LAC he make a perfect pass.  But to say Boogie should've sold out for the oop is just playing with 20/20 hindsight. At the time there were two viable options and Boogie had to work against both (also he couldn't see the play unfold because his back was to the play)"
"Lol there was zero movement.  And I dunno if you know about Jae crowder, but that‚Äôs the last dude you want with the ball with a real game on the line."
"lol what the fuck are you talking about? I haven't dissected the play to see what the off ball movement looked like but it was quite clearly a play to get Bridges the wide open 3 in the corner which is one his favorite spots. Also, not sure what you're talking about with Jae. Crowder has made clutch game winning shots for the Suns all season long. Now let's set all this aside, who cares how much movement there is? Lol if a play gets the wide open shot you're looking for then it's a successful play. The aesthetics of a play don't count on the scoreboard. I have absolutely no idea why you're obsessing over the amount of screens set and people running around but you do realize that game winning shots/plays fail more often than they succeed right?"
You‚Äôd trade Kyrie Irving for Jae Crowder?   That‚Äôs the take you have?   Fine let‚Äôs break this down:   1. Bucks aren‚Äôt trading Jrue they need his defense  2. Suns don‚Äôt have the money for a Jae for Kyrie swap   3. Lowry is a FA and a Lowry ST for Kyrie means the raptors are probably giving up assets they wouldn‚Äôt do this   4. PG13 isn‚Äôt getting traded.
"I like Ayton, I like CP3, I respect Book, I love Mikal Bridges, I like Saric, I fucking hate Jae Crowder so yep I hate the Suns"
"All these young dudes are learning from a dude literally nicknamed Point God. The combination and experiences of him, Monty, and Jae Crowder are invaluable for the growth of these guys. Ayton went from a goofy, inconsistent dude to a vocal leader and absolute beast. Booker was already a killer, but you can see parts of CP3's game rubbing off on him in situational awareness and hunting your spots. And Cam Payne, man. He gets to backup a top 5 point guard in the history of the game and soak up all that knowledge"
Jae had a great pass earlier in the game as well.  That Ayton and Crowder chemistry is off the charts.
"Jordan passed to Kerr from the wing on a designed play to get things moving first. Devin booker passed off Jae Crowder(who you 100% don‚Äôt want taking that shot) who then turned in to Mikal Bridges. Who has been anything but good shooting the ball from 3 lately.   I‚Äôm not saying he shouldn‚Äôt have passed the ball. I‚Äôm saying more should‚Äôve been done previous to that. Deandre Ayton and Cam Johnson(who actually had the hotter shooting hand) go far side as booker comes to collect the ball. He slowly dribbles up, double teamed roughly 30 feet from the hoop. He flips the pass to Jae crowder the inbounded. Who then kicks a pass to the corner to a guy who‚Äôs been ice cold for the series and last 5 games.    You compare it to jordan and Kerr. But that was a designed play with lots of movement going on. There was absolutely zero movement on this one. And the suns got lucky that somehow the shorter guy going for the rebound knocked it out of bounds. Because if it goes off Ayton, that‚Äôs game, or if Ayton cleanly gets it where he‚Äôs at, he would‚Äôve had less than two seconds to gather and put it back up.   But I think you missed my point. It‚Äôs not that he passed. Every legend has a big time game winning assist. But it‚Äôs that there was nothing smooth about that play. And booker didn‚Äôt even pass it to bridges anyways. Booker kicked it to Jae Crowder, the last man you want shooting when you absolutely need a bucket."
"I've bene all over Ayton this year, I've got lots of respect for CP3 and Booker, but it's Jae Crowder that makes this team work."
Suns paying Jae Crowder to do what Dragan Bender would‚Äôve done for peanuts /s
Is Jae Crowder the new ‚Äúpoint god‚Äù
Lol /r/NBA with the absurd hot takes again. I love Jae Crowder but chill out with this bullshit lmao
Jae Crowder &gt;&gt;&gt; Jaylen Brown
"Every year you hear people say about whatever team he just left, ‚ÄúYou can really see how much they miss Jae Crowder‚Äù.  Every year."
"Nobody's calling you old school. Your opinion is just fucking stupid, or you're living in some alternate dimension where walking up to other players and shoving them(which clearly looked like he was trying to provoke a retaliation to get the Suns to shoot themselves in the foot) is allowed. It's not allowed. Newsflash: It's not allowed, and the refs need to be consistent with their calls. Jae Crowder literally got a tech for breathing a way the refs didn't like."
WHAT A PASS FROM JAE CROWDER
It looked to me like Crowder was faking a pass towards the middle and looking off players similar to a quarterback. Watch a replay and tell me what you think. Too bad Jae didn‚Äôt do a postgame presser.
So what you're saying is Jae Crowder has more experience that perhaps anyone in the NBA with this.
So what you're saying is Jae Crowder has more experience that perhaps anyone in the NBA with this.
Let's talk about beer pong partners. Jae crowder is my #1 pick for sure. He has perfect aim. It's unquestionable now.
I'm buying my first ever Suns jersey and its gonna be Jae Crowder! Lets goo!
Jae Crowder making Robert Horry type plays.
Jae Crowder is what Pat Beverly THINKS he is.  A pest who makes some big plays to win games.
In this scenario jae crowder is H3 and ayton is Sam Seder dunking on Steven crowder
I feel like Jae Crowder is having the time of his life this postseason
Jae Crowder is the inbound god. Remember the full court shot he made on an inbound pass?
Jae Crowder was my absolute favorite thing about the ‚ÄúIT Celtics‚Äù.
had boogie cousins guarded the rim rather the inbound pass thrown by jae crowder ..
Jae Crowder himself would know https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8CS9DVsUA
"Just call Jae Crowder, as that alley-oop to Ayton was perfect."
"Clippers up by one, PG is fouled but bricks both free throws. Mikal Bridges then misses a 3 but the suns still have it. There‚Äôs 0.8 secs left, Suns still down 1. Jae Crowder lob to DA on the inbound. Bang"
&gt; you can't shoot during an inbounds  Jae Crowder knows this from experience unfortunately
Jae Crowder was a great addition for the Suns.
All Jae Crowder
"SALUTE TO JAE CROWDER for the perfect pass from the hardest spot on the court, and then AYTON for the finish"
Jae Crowder deserves more credit for that lob.
I love how everyone's complaining about this because it's the Suns and you all want the Suns to win  Just like the Jae Crowder tech that's clearly a tech
"Conley for 2 firsts, Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder, and a traded player exception.  Marc Gasol for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles."
JAE CROWDER IS OUR FATHER
Props to Ayton for preventing Jae Crowder from making another clutch illegal inbounds basket.
"Fucking ass crazy, Jae Crowder with the great inbound pass"
Jae ‚ÄúChris Paul‚Äù Crowder
MMMMMMMMMMM YOU LOVE TO SEE IT  Jae Crowder is the best passer in the league
Ayton is incredible but Jae Crowder getting that up over Boogie is amazing
jae crowder with a perfect inbound and ayton with a good jump timing
Excellent Lob by Jae Crowder!
THANK YOU JAE CROWDER
WHAT A FUCKING PASS FROM JAE CROWDER THAT WAS PIXEL PERFECT
 jae crowder would‚Äôve made that
And its Jae Crowder of all people. Yall givin em the benefit of the doubt?
jae crowder got scored on by pg for the go ahead. lmao
don‚Äôt worry. if booker fouls out then jae crowder will lead the suns to victory
jae crowder is so good at acting tough when he‚Äôs on good teams
Jae crowder living rent free in Paul Georges head I see
"This is based on my very limited perception with no stats handy to back it up, but Jae Crowder has to be the worst player in the league who takes a lot of 3s."
Gotta sink those Jae  Don't turn into Cleveland Crowder
Jae Crowder really might be the Suns best passer on the court right now lmao
Jae Crowder was another great pickup
Jae Crowder was a huge addition recently. He‚Äôs an amazing glue guy.
JAE CROWDER
Pat Bev vs Jae Crowder. My goodness whose side do you take?
"Dort is Jae Crowder. If Crowder were on a team like the Thunder, he'd probably be averaging over 12ppg too, and on better efficiency. His contract is excellent value but he's still not very high impact.  There's a difference between a star and a superstar. No one thinks SGA has superstar potential."
I love Jae Crowder so much
That‚Äôs a no call and Jae crowder fouled the shit out of PG on the ‚Äújump ball‚Äù
What's the money line on a Jae Crowder/Marcus Morris fight
"Yeah but that was the team with IT who‚Äôs hip was hurting, Jae Crowder and a very raw Jaylen Brown. You guys still had Kyrie with Bron and Love at the time we posed no threat lmao"
Same thing happened when Jae Crowder signed with the Suns.
Keep an eye for a tech or 2 on Jae Crowder. Couple more and he gets suspended
Who do you like in a potential Suns vs Bucks Finals? Does Jae Crowder have to guard Giannis in that matchup?
I mean if Jae Crowder and Ayton shut down Giannis and Khris Middelton saves the day by hitting big shots late in the 4th...it can happen. It's actually not that unlikely either. Giannis has been relying heavily on Khris and Jrue to close games.
"They also added another veteran enforcer 3-and-D player in Jae Crowder, which has been huge in every way, added a better play-making back-up 4/5 in Saric, Payne has been playing like a Playoff starting-caliber PG this whole time too.  All the additions made them even better, but the original core made their strides to get here as well. This is not the Suns of old though. I watched the Bubble Suns. I watched a lot of losing seasons where Book was running the PG at times because they had no playmaker.   I firmly believe unless they had someone who could alleviate pressure off Book with not just playmaking capability, but also scoring ability, they would have finished borderline lotto/8th seed in a stacked West this year."
Jaylen browns gotta be up there. Or Jae crowder
"Don't forget Jae ""all I do is make teams better on the cheap"" Crowder"
It just goes to show Jae Crowder deserves all the credit for the Heat‚Äôs run last year
Also: Ayton is just better this year (along with mikal). They also added Jae Crowder who has been a big pickup for them.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong CP3 is great.  I watched him take my team to the playoffs last year I know. But he‚Äôs not the only reason for that swing
"PG - Jamal Murray  SG - Mikal Bridges  SF - Michael Porter Jr  PF - Jae Crowder  C - Ben Simmons  If he's gonna be shit at shooting even free throws, small-ball 5 it is for Ben."
"My apologies to the Jae Crowder bandwagon, no disrespect intended y'all"
"Yeah, and the Suns are a much better team. That's my point. Chris Paul got a MVP votes because voters thought the Suns' best player deserved them. Same reason Rudy Golbert got votes. Chris Paul getting 5th in MVP voting in no way means that anyone serious thinks that he is the 5th best player in the NBA. Suns got better because of Chris Paul, and also because Ayton wasn't suspended for half the year, they got a new coach, Mikal Bridges got better, and they signed Jae Crowder."
The bubble of reality?   Do you think advertisers give LeBron and Steph and KD millions even though the casual fan is sick of them? They could save that money and give it to Kevin Huerter and Jae Crowder who the casual fan loves.
"I think you seriously lack reading comprehension. Those big men allow their perimeter players to defend the 3 better because they don't need to worry about drive-bys. Are you really this dense? Also last time I checked, Jae Crowder, Ben Simmons and Rudy Gay aren't big men."
"Or a not close win, that would be nice too.  I‚Äôm on board for Jae Crowder hitting 7 threes"
Marcus Morris v Jae Crowder is the real main event
Yeah because he didn‚Äôt have anthony Davis to carry the load. He was relying on jae crowder as his running mate
"Probably could‚Äôve have traded Ben to Memphis for the #2 pick (Ja Morant), Jae Crowder and other fillers."
usa should take jae crowder
"In this order:  Suns &gt; Hawks &gt; Clippers &gt; Bucks  Mostly I'm rooting for the Suns; I'd like to see CP3 get a ring. Plus I'm also rooting for ex-Celtic Jae Crowder. Then, it's hard not to root for the underdog Hawks (who just knocked TF out of the Sixers). Clippers coz they've never won, and Kawhi's a beast. Then, the Bucks."
"Wow you are clearly delusional. We were up 2-1 when AD got injured. Again, we won the chip in October. How does that make Lebron washed‚Ä¶? Y‚Äôall were looking like some clowns in game 3 remember when Lebron daddied Jae Crowder? And the Suns players were so mad they kept making dirty plays? Keep in mind Lebron was still dealing with an injury too‚Ä¶."
Is that Jae Crowder or Michael Jordan?
Leading scorers Jae Crowder and Marcus Morris.
Jae crowder just palming the ball and gently giving it to the referee.
"Jae ""Klay Thompson"" Crowder"
I love watching Jae Crowder and Marcus Morris go off in game 6 of the WCF     Not
Jae ‚ÄúMicheal Jordan‚Äù Crowder
Is this the Jae Crowder game?
The Jae Crowder Game.
JAE CROWDER
jae crowder looks like his breath stank
"Jae Crowder and Pat Bev have done nothing else this series, wym"
This sarcasm is hilarious coming from a team that employs Jae Crowder.
Thanks for that great analysis on Jae Crowder brought to us by Toyota.
Jae Crowder
If we had to suffer Jae Crowder scoring a lot so do the Clips. Fair is fair.
Jae Crowder vs Marcus Morris just like we all expected
And here is more proof that Jae Crowder was truly the driving force of the heats bubble finals appearance.   #YouFuckingNeedMe
I‚Äôm sorry Jae Crowder appears to have a massive penis.
Imagine grinding the whole season and getting bounced by fucking Jae Crowder lmao
Booker is forcing some tough shots. PHX is shooting well as a squad &amp; Jae Crowder is providing some offense tonight.
Lmao! The Clippers getting eliminated because of Jae Crowder would be the most Clippers thing ever
If you get beat by 2021 Jae Crowder you deserve to lose
"Wet like I'm, Jae Crowder?"
"Jae crowder game 6 vs lakers and clippers. Damn can‚Äôt miss. Though part of me is starting to hate this getting hot or cold from 3 is so crucial to winning these days. Last year it felt kinda nice since lakers didn‚Äôt rely on it much, but that was also my first year watching. I wonder if NBA nerfs the three at some point."
Jae Crowder is a GOAT
We‚Äôre gonna get a Jae crowder vs Clint capela finals
Jae crowder is the ‚Äú NOT THIS GUY‚Äù type
Jae Crowder vs Marcus Morris
Does Jae crowder only get hot in game 6?  Suns are so hot shooting right now prob carries them to win
Jae crowder has to be up there for players who freak out when obvious foul calls go against them.   *Gets all arm*   *Cue freakout demanding a coach challenge*
"Jae crowder been dirty all playoffs, nobody is fixing shit. Calls have gone both ways."
Jae crowder is the true emotion lesbian
jae crowder is literally god tier as far as 'foul? me? never in my life' players go
A team with Jae Crowder and Chris Paul on it is complaining about calls. I‚Äôm shocked...shocked I tell you
I swear Jae Crowder has never missed an open 3 in the playoffs
Jae Crowder acts like somebody ran over his dog every time he gets a foul called on him
Jae crowder out here playing football and wonder why he keeps getting called for a foul lol
Jae Crowder has the most hilarious post-foul reaction every damn time
Jae crowder dressed like it's winter in the staples center
Jae Crowder trips Batum. Checks on Batum ‚Äúhey you okay buddy?‚Äù
Somehow Pat Bev is getting plaudits for his offensive game and Jae Crowder is getting hate for being dirty.  Pat Bev redemption tour starts tonight
Career dirty player Jae Crowder has never fouled anybody in his life
Jae Crowder dirtier than Pat Bev.
"These playoffs are ass  Im watching cameron payne, luke kennard, jae crowder, terrance mann, and abdel nader in the fucking conference finals."
jae crowder brick
jae crowder is gonna go like 7 for 9 from 3 tonight isnt he
He's only wearing them to protect himself from Jae Crowder eye pokes.
Jae crowder looks like a rough lover
Lets say bucks will their way to the finals without Giannis. Jae Crowder clamps Khris Middleton and gets the FMVP . That would be wild as hell
I don‚Äôt understand the concern about the stars if teams are playing good team basketball.  Someone jokingly said the finals would be PJ Tucker vs Jae Crowder and I personally thought that sounded like a good series.
"PG Steph  SG Tyler Herro  SF Kevin Durant  PF Giannis A.  C Rudy Gobert   Bench: Ben Simmons, Jae Crowder, Montrezl Harrell"
Jae Crowder for sure. Hated him.
"Yh but jae crowder is a role player, role players are allowed to be streaky  Khris is the 2nd star of the team, at times he‚Äôs the first option when it comes to scoring simply because he can shoot. Him being so streaky as the 2nd star is just unacceptable.   They are both so streaky tho it gets ugly sometimes."
"Lol, and so is Jae Crowder. If their first 2 shots misses, you know it's going to be a bad night for those two."
"But where do you get this sympathy towards the Clippers? I for one can't see it at all. Even the German commentary on DAZN terms to praise the Sun noticeably more than LAC.  Which is baffling to me, as I really don't get the hate towards these Clippers, if not for bandwagonism, because for every Morris that tries to step on Luka's ankle last year (last year I repeat) there is a Booker pushing LeBron midair, for a Pat Bev that plays hard and crashes both booker and Paul (the former was, imo, just bad timing on both of them, the latter was Paul flopping, no discussion), there is a Jae Crowder intentionally poking PG's eye. Or Saric pushing (albeit very slightly). Si please tell me, how is this Suns team more likeable? Just because you sucked for years?"
I find Jae Crowder extremely enjoyable as a neutral fan.
Jeff Van Gundy also was also trying to argue why Pat Bev committed a flagrant against Chris Paul but apparently what Jae Crowder did to Paul George wasn't.
nah more likely that jae crowder will make sure he pokes PG‚Äôs eye out next game
he got hurt stfu jae crowder
The Jae Crowder
"Wizards are a terrible defensive team lmfao. Murray, KCP, Marcus Morris, Jae Crowder, Schroeder, and Turner are literally all better defenders than most of the guys on the Bulls or Wizards. Plus Powell and Wood are worse defenders than most of the guys I named. The worst defender on my roster is Ingram. Also, if Ingram isn‚Äôt good enough to create for himself, then what‚Äôs Ben Simmons? Who is going to be the number one scorer on your team?"
i swear u don‚Äôt even know who tf jae crowder is on your team
I like everyone on the Suns except Jae Crowder. I like everyone one the Grizzlies except for Grayson Allen. But damn do i hate Grayson Allen a helluva lot more than Crowder.
bro you have jae crowder taking eyes like he's itachi
What about jae crowder lmfao hypocrite ass bitch
"I hate Pat Bev as much as I hate Jae Crowder. Whoever wins, I hope Milwaukee stomps them both"
"I don‚Äôt disagree but with a couple better defenders on whatever squad Ingram is on, they‚Äôd easily be in the playoffs in the East, at least over the Wizards. IE, Ingram, Brogdan, Turner, Smart and Jae Crowder is a playoff team in the East. That was easy to do but pointless nonetheless"
Jae Crowder is the dirty player...  Looked like he meant to make Paul George go blind in one eye... It was a pointed and intentional attack..
Giannis is actually a little bit dirty or at least reckless.  The kyrie undercut can definitely be seen as an accident but look at the reaction for Jae Crowder when he poked PG in the eye and compare that to when Giannis poked Trae. Crowder is getting crucified but no one cared when Giannis did it. Trae was pissed at that play for a reason. I think people have a hard time attributing motive to a good guy like Giannis but you have to realize that even good guys can be super competitive and slightly dirty. See Chris Paul as well.
why lakers fans are obsessed with jae crowder is beyond me
So an obligatory fuck Jae Crowder thrown in here also
"Net rating of Ayton with him on is -11.2, with him off it's 22.9, with jae Crowder it's -10.5 and 14.5, with Chris Paul it's -12.4 and 3.0"
Jae crowder has been dirtier than bev this post season
"Totally agree. I‚Äôve never seen a DPOY candidate get all the love without really looking as dominant on the court. It‚Äôs like people say he is a PG and he has the size of a PF and athleticism of a SF, so people just kind of assume he should be able to guard 1-5, but he really doesn‚Äôt to the level of someone like Draymond.  Tbh, I‚Äôd rather just have a traditional swing, 3 and D guy like Jae Crowder or PJ Tucker, because at least those guys all play great defense and hustle their butts off. Plus, they actually bring an offensive threat. I don‚Äôt care how great a passer your athletic PF is if he never takes advantage of his size to score‚Ä¶"
"Chris Paul jumps into Pat Bev while he fights through a screen. Proceeds to jumps sideways ""naturally shooting motion"" and kicks his leg out like hes sending his shoe to the arena rafters. Then to flop like a magikarp and hurt himself even more.  While Jae Crowder literally looks into PG eyes and pokes his eye.  Can Suns fan explain?"
Jae Crowder got a tech for much less when doing the salsa
Jae Crowder got a technical for salsa dancing in general with LeBron in the vicinity
[wonder how he feels about jae crowder intentionally trying to poke PG in the eye](https://twitter.com/tomerazarly/status/1409715052307906561?s=21)
Wtf?? Bev was fighting through a screen. Paul flopped like most players do on that play to get 3 fts but his ass flopped so hard he fell on his ass. I get how you can say fuck Bev because of his history but this eye poke was a controlled dirty ass act.    Fuck jae crowder
"&gt;No it‚Äôs not, the team with the better players win, that‚Äôs how basketball works.  Did losing Jae Crowder change the heat from the best team in the East last year to getting swept in the 1st round this year? lol.     The Bucks/Nets betting odds were like 66% in favor of the Nets when all 3 were healthy.  Sports-betting odds are notoriously accurate and hard to beat.  Better players give you better chances, but you can't guarantee how teams are going to perform on any given day or in a given series.   This isn't really debatable."
Yo fuck Jae Crowder. Pussy move couldn't handle getting beat. Fucking sore loser bitch. GTFO
"TBH some of the best 3&amp;D role players in the league have been found outta nowhere. The Jazz already found one in Royce O'Neale. There's also guys like Jae Crowder, Dorian Finney-Smith, Danny Green, Josh Hart etc."
i can't stand jae crowder. he's always had this bitch mentality from the get go. i really want morris to put him on his ass one time
Jae Crowder.
"I believe Dame wants Portland to help build a competent team around him. He had one of the greatest series‚Äô performances of all time but those around him just flat out underperformed. Gotta look to move CJ to potentially get a 3 and D player, a Jae Crowder type. And they have to make a move for a veteran point guard off the bench. Interesting to see if Portland will be iso heavy under Chauncey how they were with Stotts."
Shit thats Jae Crowder
Y‚Äôall got Jae crowder and y‚Äôall know exactly what he was doing.
"Clippers and Lakers fans unite to agree, Jae Crowder a bitch"
The Official NBA YouTube description of the video: &gt;	DeMarcus Cousins takes it coast-to-coast for the major facial on Jae Crowder  lmao
Ok I‚Äôll say it. Fuck Jae Crowder.
"I‚Äôm a Lakers fan and I am almost rooting for you guys after watching this. I do not agree with this kind of repeated injurious behavior on ‚Äúdefense‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a more deliberate attempt at eye poking. You can literally see his hand motion shift after the shot is released. Fuck Jae Crowder."
"Damn this is fucking dirty. Probably the most intentional eye poke I‚Äôve seen, Draymond ain‚Äôt even that obvious xD  Anyone else not surprised Jae fucking Crowder did this? Same dude that arm barred LeBron last year after he fell?"
"&gt;dirtiest player in the league  Lot of guys who are dirtier and slip under the radar. But that's a whole other discussion. I hate Jae Crowder and his dirty plays as well, and I understand where you're coming from.   Call Bev out when you need to, but acting like he is the perpetrator on every single foul on the opposition is where I call bullshit. CP flopped massively, Bev was pushed by DA, and all I hear is everyone saying - ""Bev dove into CP's legs"", ""But if Bev had the chance, he would have injured CP"" smh"
"Jae Crowder just as dirty as Bev but doesn't receive even a quarter of the hate. He just considered a ""culture"" guy and a tough vet to have in the locker room. That's how you know this sub has a fuckin bias.   The dude tried to injure Lebron last Finals and then fuckin added a push to Schroeder after Booker pushed him mid-air this year."
"Jae Crowder just as dirty as Bev but doesn't receive even a quarter of the hate. He just considered a ""culture"" guy and a tough vet to have in the locker room. That's how you know this sub has a fuckin bias.  The dude tried to injure Lebron last Finals and then fuckin added a push to Schroeder after Booker pushed him mid-air this year."
"They went undefeated in the bubbles, they almost made the offs even with Ayton missing a significant part of the season and they added Jae Crowder. Cmon lol"
"On the other hand, we have Jae Crowder intentionally eye poking people."
"""The eyes are the groin of the head"" Jae Crowder probably"
If Jae Crowder did that he'd have been ejected and suspended.
"&gt; Yep, never thought of Jae Crowder as dirty until that play  you must be new to the NBA or didn't pay attention to Crowder throughout his career which is understandable since hes a bum"
"Fuck, Jae Crowder annoys me but that shits sad. Now I want him to win a championship :("
Fuck that lol I never see people say that shit in pat bev threads. You wanna defend Zaza with that too?  Jae Crowder is an ass and he plays dirty. Hate the player all you want
"So just like the Miami Heat who lost key pieces last year (including Jae Crowder who is now in Finals again), the Hawks wont make it back to the Conference Finals again next year.  I don't understand these owners.  Their millionaires or billionaires and then complain about a couple of million here and there."
"The one on Bryn Forbes was especially bad. I hated that call, if that‚Äôs a foul so is the one on Jae crowder, which IMO was worse than the Forbes one"
"He's talking about last year. But aint no damn Jae Crowder stopping Giannis lmao. You need a combination of elite defenders (Jae/Iggy/Jimmy/Bam, DG/Kawhi/Serge/Gasol) something the Cavs did not have. Giannis would abso-fucking-lutely smoke TT"
"Yeah def. look at Jae Crowder as another example. Dude knows he‚Äôs a cutter, catch and shooter, and a defender. Excels at all 3 bc he knows exactly what he needs to do"
"2 out of 3 were fouls. On Middleton Jae crowder turns into him (illegal defensive position) when contact is made.  The second booker one was also a foul for practically the same reason.  The 1st booker one though is an absolute joke of a call. Body straight arms actually going away from booker, dude swung his follow through into a legal defender and got a foul"
Why not? Jae Crowder did.
I mean Jae Crowder went 0/8 in game 1 and had the highest +/- (+19) out of everyone in the game lol I don't get why people put so much stock into that stat. You can play really well and end up negative still because of who you're on the court with. It's not really a good individual assessment stat
"Seems like saying Chris Paul (and Jae Crowder) is a dirty player gets hate from people here and on Twitter, despite there being literal highlight reels of him doing shady shit throughout his career."
CP3 and Jae Crowder being dirty players makes it much easier for me to root for Milwaukee
I was simply quoting Jae Crowder. I'm friends with Bossman99.
That's Jae Crowder for you. I witnessed this man once elbow Steven Adams in the head while he was in the process of arguing with two other players.
You‚Äôre making that assumption because Jae Crowder texts in all capital letters‚Ä¶lmao
"Its because I honestly can‚Äôt think of anyone  Everyone can hold their own and people just shit on Booker because they think someone has to be the one who is the weakest link  But if the other team shot 1/11 on our ‚Äúworst defender/liability‚Äù then I really don‚Äôt give a fuck who ends up with that label  Jae Crowder had 1 point and ended with a +/- of 19  Mikal never gets talked about because he is just a savy defender, and everyone knows you only think of defenders when they fuck something up  Chris Paul  Ayton just clogs up lanes and works the glass and makes the paint tough to drive into for other teams, and he has the athleticism to cover the pick and roll  And Booker just switches well and smothers other guards. Also the fact that he makes some pretty crazy shots just helps him predict what other shooters are going to do with the ball"
"Stay focused. Your complaint is on the steal, keep it on the steal. Lord knows you aren't doing a great job of defending even that. Yes there was contact between Jae Crowder *and the ball*. Middleton causes the rest of the contact when he tries to recover a possession he is in the act of losing.  I get what you're saying though. I hate it when my team gets good steals called as foul."
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There‚Äôs really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year‚Äôs team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."
Jae Crowder is plenty at creating contact.  Jrue was raked on the wrist for a fast break ez 2 on the other end.
Jae Crowder and Devin Booker
Jae Crowder and Devin Booker
Jae Crowder might regress to Jae Emptier.
Middleton and Draymond  Jae Crowder / Kenneth Faried / Montrezl Harrell
"&gt; It's not that analytics should be telling guys like Jae Crowder not to shoot mid-range, and instead take 3/4 of his shots from 3. It should be that analytics are telling him to WORK on his mid-range to improve his value to the team  Jae Crowder is not offensively skilled enough to be a ball handler in the PnR to get those mid range looks.   And even if he was, he wouldn‚Äôt get to do that since the Suns have Book and CP3 for that already.   The guys with upper-echelon ball skills or that are uber-talented scorers should have a mid range game. If you want to play in the PnR, you need a mid range game.   Guys like Jae Crowder shouldn‚Äôt be handling the ball in those positions, ever. His maximum value is behind the line.  Well, his maximum value is arguably on defense, but on offense, his max value is as a shooter, so that‚Äôs what he does."
"What do Jordan Hamilton, Nick Young, Jae Crowder, Larry Sanders, Zach Randolph, Vince Carter, and Robin Lopez have in common? They‚Äôve all been ejected for taking shots at Steven Adams.  I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad person, but the dude starts shit."
"What's funny about all the defensive comments in this thread that defend the league's increasing rim+3 play is that there's the assumption like dudes can't adapt to become better at the mid-range in their career. Teams just don't work on it.  Meanwhile, Chris Paul SPECIFICALLY worked to improve his mid-range game after the league went heavy on the drop defense, as he [specifically mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Tp71OjwxQ) after clinching the series over the Nuggets earlier this postseason. Dude basically became a mid-range master because defenses gave him that opening.  And many of y'all mean to me others can't do the same? It's not that analytics should be telling guys like Jae Crowder not to shoot mid-range, and instead take 3/4 of his shots from 3. It should be that analytics are telling him to WORK on his mid-range to improve his value to the team.  Problem is that latter isn't being pressed by teams, because they've arrived as this false assumption that the present manifestation of analytics is what's best for them."
Plot twist: Is Jae Crowder and represents himself
"Warriors: Danny Green, Jae Crowder, PJ Tucker, any of those guys. Hopefully Klay hasn't lost his step"
0-5 from 3 Jae Crowder must happen in order for 6-8 Jae Crowder to emerge.
"For every Jae Crowder, there are a handful of vets who have markedly increased their 3Fr in recent years. Heck, even Jae went from 48.3% in his first 6 seasons to 70% in his last 3... including 77.2 this regular season with PHX!  There's no way else to cut it. The league has deliberately eschewed mid-range (especially long mid-range) in favor of rim+3. And it's NOT solely because of the players' talents."
Jae Crowder eating up Middleton/Holiday like Clam Chowder!
Because most players are closer to Jae Crowder than Booker or CP3.
Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder a legitimate bitch. Hate that dude.
*Jae Crowder Intensifies*
"Lol Giannis was healthy. I didn‚Äôt see his knee limiting him in anyway. Jae Crowder and the Suns were able to keep him from the rim and either stopped him or fouled him throughout the game which is why he was 6/11.  It‚Äôs cool though I‚Äôll be back after Game 5. Don‚Äôt get too down after the Bucks lose. You shouldn‚Äôt, considering I gave you a heads up on what was going to happen"
"&gt; Holiday wasn‚Äôt aggressive at all and I didn‚Äôt see him drawing any fouls.  He took 8 shots in the paint and got called for a foul once. He quit being aggressive cuz he was having a horrible game.  &gt; Bucks had to end the game with Bobby Portis  Portis played 25 seconds in the 4th quarter. Seriously dude, what the fuck are you even saying? You're literally just making shit up lmao  &gt; Giannis‚Äôs 20 points in 35 minutes is a far cry from the 28 points in 33 minutes he averaged in the regular season.  Did you not see his significant knee injury 7 days before this game? Giannis performed exceptionally well given his issues. You really do ignore shit and make up other shit to fit some narrative that for some reason, only you can see - which is evident by people calling your bullshit out in your post.  &gt; If you don‚Äôt believe that Jar Crowder affects Giannis go check his stats in the series against the Heat last year.  If holding a man with a significant knee injury to 20 points on 55% FG shooting is what Jae allows then I fucking hope he keeps covering Giannis lmao  &gt; I didn‚Äôt get upvotes because snowflakes you get triggered when the truth gets told  LMAO THERE IT IS. I love how when ignorant people call the dozens of other people pointing out how they're wrong snowflakes instead of admitting they're wrong.   This entire time you've been making shit up and ignoring obvious facts to the point where I can't actually tell if you're serious or trolling. Either you're the dumbest mf alive or 15 years old lmao god damn nephew"
"&gt; Jae Crowder did a good job of limiting Giannis.  The dude went for 20/17/4 on 55% shooting in 35 minutes in his first game back after severely hyperextending his knee 7 days prior. How did Crowder exactly limit him outside the knee injury itself?  &gt; After Giannis it then becomes Booker/CP3 vs Middleton/Holiday. That‚Äôs an easy dub if you‚Äôre the Suns.  Well yeah no shit. ""Team gets easy dub when you remove the best player on the opposing team from the equation."" What a genius take.  &gt; A lot of the players getting fouled on the Bucks were bad free throw shooters anyway.  This is the dumbest thing you've said yet. Giannis is obviously a bad FT shooter but only two players besides him even attempted free throws last night (4 total may I add) - Holiday who's a 79% FT shooter and Lopez who's an 85% FT shooter. Either way, the complaint is that fouls weren't called enough - Middleton took 26 shots and didn't take one free throw. You really think he wasn't fouled AT ALL during 26 shots?   You keep referencing this post you made yet you keep coming out with bad takes and it almost seems like you didn't even watch the game. Listen man, you're not the basketball strategist you think you are. Don't you think if you knew anything or had intelligent opinions, your posts would get at least ONE upvote? lmao you're way over your head kid"
&gt;I was one of the people that was on the analytics side about mid range shots  The analytics would support CP3 and Booker shooting midrange shots. They would not support guys like Jae Crowder shooting midrange shots.
how tf did Jae Crowder finish with 1 point and +19 ??
"You seem to not be understanding that percentages and PPG are different, even though I tried to explain it.  Quite honestly you're off the rails at this point, I don't even know what you're saying.  If you think Jae Crowder will continue to go 0/8 in this series and the Bucks will shoot 45% from 3 then good luck man. Just don't be surprised when it doesn't happen."
I said it‚Äôs irrelevant because no matter how the refs officiated the game there is no way the Bucks would have won. The Bucks struggled to get consistent offense because Jae Crowder did a good job of limiting Giannis. After Giannis it then becomes Booker/CP3 vs Middleton/Holiday. That‚Äôs an easy dub if you‚Äôre the Suns. That‚Äôs what my post was illustrating.   If the Suns only had won by 5 points than you would have a point. But the Suns were up by 13 for pretty much half the game and the Bucks were never able to close the gap. Free throws would not have changed the outcome of the game. A lot of the players getting fouled on the Bucks were bad free throw shooters anyway.
"&gt; You can‚Äôt just look at season averages and blindly apply them.  No but you can make reasonable assumptions.  If you think Jae Crowder is going to go 0/8 every night or the Bucks are gonna shoot 45% from 3, you're going to be very disappointed.  &gt; After all it was just a few weeks ago we got obliterated by the Nets to go down 0-2 in that series.  You do understand that you guys probably don't win that series if Kyrie Irving doesn't get hurt right? Unless you plan on injuring some Suns, I wouldn't use the Nets series as a reason to not panic."
I feel some type of way that PJ Tucker scored more than Jae Crowder
"Let me rephrase it:  Older co-stars seemed to clash with him.    Jae Crowder is a role player, that's a totally different dynamic."
That seems like confirmation bias. Jae Crowder loves him for instance. I‚Äôm sure him and Gallo were cool.
Happy Birthday Jae Crowder.
Taking Jae Crowder props and parlays‚Ä¶a true degenerate gambler and masochist lol
This and Jae Crowder missing that FT had me shaking my head.
"the fact that you pulled that up in less than 5 minutes is very weird.   here in recent years trez, drummond, george hill, jae crowder, IT, jordan clarkson to name a few guys that had some of their worst seasons playing with leracist."
That was the most Jae Crowder thing to do üòÇ
"Well those 7-8 FTs won't all happen in one half.  And it doesn't equal out in a 13 point loss. 7-8 =/= 13.  Plus you're ignoring that you shot 20% over your average for 3 pointers and Jae Crowder shot 30% less than his. That's a ~12 point swing right there.  I'm not sure if you're actually not worried or just in denial. It'd be foolish to not be worried after last night.  You don't have to be ""sky is falling"", but I would be uneasy at the least if I was a Bucks fan. There really wasn't anything good to take from that game except Giannis is alive."
Jae Crowder with  0-8	0-5	1-1	+19 LOL
"Drafted Booker, drafted Ayton &amp; Bridges, Signed Jae Crowder &amp; CP3. Filled out the roster with good role players and brought in a good coach to get everyone to buy in."
"The Bucks should be really worried that they shot 50% from the 3, Jae Crowder went 0-8, and they lost by 13.  Both of those are going to regress to the mean and it's not going to be in their favor.  The Bucks need Giannis to score 30+ for them to have a chance in this series. They can steal a game if CP3 or Book has an off night, but right now their seat is getting very hot very fast."
Final shot. Universe on the line. I want Jae Crowder!
"Ayton was not a surprise given that's how he's been all playoffs but Booker was very unexpected. Jrue went 0-4 and Middleton 1-5 vs Booker 1-1.  Bridges, always a good defender held the Bucks to 3-8 (38%) shooting.   Jae Crowder... yikes. Bucks shot 10-15 against him (Giannis only 3 of those makes).  Bucks shot 5-9 against Chris Paul.   Pretty much everybody abused Jae Crowder today, that's somebody that's maybe worth a little more targeting next game?"
Jae Crowder literally Cam Payne
"Can both not be true? Casual fans probably don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about this series because the NBA does a shit job marketing stars not named LeBron James, Kevin Durant, or Steph Curry. Meanwhile, people who are invested in the NBA beyond pop culture and their own teams recognize that this kind of a Finals matchup (hell, this kind of a championship matchup in most sports) is incredibly rare‚Äîboth teams combine for a total of *six* games in the Finals prior to this year (all through Jae Crowder) and no player on either team has won a championship. Further, the last time either team made the Finals was 28 and 50 years ago‚Äîthis series is incredibly exciting for anybody who pays attention beyond Twitter and the front page of Reddit.  This subreddit has over 4 million people on it. You could have 1000 people agree with the comment you‚Äôre replying to and that still only reflects the sentiments of 0.025% of the entire subreddit. People will only visit the subreddit and interact with posts/comments when they‚Äôre interested in what‚Äôs going on. Don‚Äôt treat this subreddit (and Reddit comments in general) like a monolith, even highly upvoted comments are rarely indicative of the whole population‚Äôs opinions on a subreddit this large."
"Jae Crowder, career 35% shooter and 10 PPG scorer, is not likely to score 20 a game on 50% shooting because his man is covering the lob. Come off it.  It‚Äôs not impossible, but it is absolutely not by any stretch of the imagination an inevitability. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs taking mad contested shots under normal circumstances."
That also sounds like how you make Jae Crowder a threat and allow him to go 5-10 from 3. The Bucks know about that all too well.

Hence why guys like PJ Tucker and Jae Crowder are so valued amongst contenders--their defensive versatility is invaluable.
"Jae ""Marcus Smart"" Crowder"
"I was confused by one play where Jae Crowder stonewalled Giannis, and then I realized Giannis only has 7 pounds on him üò≥  What a tank."
The real legendary stat stolen was that egregious lame foul on Jae Crowder at the end to cause him to shoot free throws and lose the perfect team foul shooting finals record.
Jae Crowder is either 6/8 or 1/7
I only watched a little bit and I'm just reading the box score - Jae Crowder got one point??
"I might be a basketball noob, but how did Jae Crowder get a +19 with his score line and shot percentages?"
"And we're due for a Jae ""Literally Steph Curry"" Crowder game any day now!"
How to produce value in the game of basketball 101  By Jae Crowder
"Giannis was very good today. I think the thing that should be looked at too though is that the Bucks shot nearly 45% from 3 and hit 5 more 3s than the Suns. So even with that huge advantage from 3 Bucks still lost by &gt;10 points. I don't expect the FT disparity to continue but I wouldn't be surprised to see the Suns and Jae Crowder, in particular, shoot better from 3 in the next games."
"you mean jae crowder? irony on the ""drunken"" part lol"
How did jae crowder have the highest plus/minis of the game going 0-8 lmao
"Fuck, Jae Crowder foreverüòçüòç"
"Jae Crowder had the highest +/- of the game (+19), while playing 33 minutes and not making a FG"
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Suns game when gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just Jae Crowder and Jrue Holiday bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!

"ehh to each their own. Imo Dame is better than CP or booker. CJ is not far behind the other #2. Powell is probably better than Bridges, Covington is probably better than Jae Crowder, Ayton is better than Nurkic. It's comparable"
Jae Crowder confirmed to be a clone of his dad
He could get Jae Crowder money:  the MLE for 3-4 years.  Around $10 mil a year.
"Wouldn‚Äôt Jae Crowder also be the definition of such a player? I just don‚Äôt think that Connaughton is on as high a level of vintage PJ Tucker, but then again, he‚Äôs kind of building out the best part of his resume right now, so I admit I could very well be wrong. My own team has the  corpse of Trevor Ariza, who in his own day was a starter level 3 and D guy, so I catch your point.  I guess I never thought of Pat as a 3 and D wing as he is a little smaller than a prototypical wing, but I think that kind of categorization highlights his value."
"PG- Malcolm Brogdan SG- Collin Sexton SF-Jaylen Brown PF-Jae Crowder C-Dwight Howard Bench:  Antony Edward, Derrick Favors, Malik Beasley, Wendell Carter  Overall team ga wouldn't be bad, especially if Dwight was back in prime form."
"That has literally nothing to do with what I said. Yeah there are true centers in the league, but I was talking about the power forward spot which is why I said ""stretch forwards."" Are you going to have a better chance scoring at the rim against Jae Crowder and Ayton, or against Tim Duncan and David Robinson? The power forward position is much ""smaller"" now."
"No dawgy, it‚Äôs based off feet being planted. If Giannis runs into Jae, and his feet are planted then it‚Äôs an offense foul. If Jae steps in front of Giannis and his feet are not planted, then it‚Äôs a blocking foul on Crowder. I‚Äôve been watching Giannis a lot longer than you and I‚Äôve seen many instances of both."
I saw Jae Crowder at the grocery store once
"As a Celtics fan watching this game, man I miss Jae Crowder"
"Jae Crowder is an awful person, he always takes his teams to the finals just to make them lose in 6, disgraceful"

Jae Crowder needs to change his shoes man he keeps slipping
"Is there a player less likable than Jae Crowder? 90%+ of the time, he flops. If there's someone within 2ft of him, he's flopping or pretending he got touched. Fuck him. And he thinks he's hard but plays like a bitch"
"Selling a cal and flopping are two different things. One is exaggerating a foul that happened to ensure it‚Äôs called, the other is what Jae Crowder does every play: flail your body all over the floor praying you get a whistle in your favor"
Yea m. Booker elbows. Jae Crowder sliding all over the floor. CP3 falling from a breeze. Refs are sure against the Suns
Does Jae Crowder not trust Bridges in the corner? Wide open but forces a contested floater instead
Celtics legend Jae Crowder
"this is why Scott Foster is the absolute worst, his crews are always massively inconsistent.  Dudes were practically taking 2x4s to each other in the 3rd quarter &amp; the refs swallowed their whistles, then you call al foul on that weak ass shit (also not like Jae Crowder was getting anywhere regardless).  Call it tight, let them play, just BE CONSISTENT."
Pat does not look like he enjoys playing Jae Crowder.
Jae Crowder biggest fraud in history
Jae Crowder has become one of my least favorite players because of this series JFC
Jae Crowder gets a foul because he has zero handles

Is Jae Crowder gonna be the first player to lose back to back finals since Danny Ainge (Blazers/Suns sorry lol)?
The ol Jae Crowder coin flip. Either he‚Äôs like 6/8 from three or 0/9 total
CP3 is the greatest player ever! Booker is better than Kobe! Jae Crowder is a bitch!
"Sure, but a big part of that is because the Lakers only had 6 weeks off following their championship win and the start of training camps, and AD was recovering from [an injury he got in Game 5 of the Finals](https://youtu.be/M--IRVucDW8) which in retrospect looks suspiciously like it ties in to the injury issues he had this year. AD needed time to recover and then time to get ready for the season, but the scheduling didn't allow it. You'll find out all about that next season with the short break you guys are gonna get after the Finals ends tonight.   Last season the Suns had the benefit of being so bad that they missed the playoffs entirely and got two nice long breaks and were able to come into the season refreshed and ready, and it showed in their health and availability this year. We'll see how you guys do with it next year when your guys are also going on short rest. I'm particularly going to keep an eye on CP3 with his durability issues (isn't he supposedly hurt right now? Could impact his off-season), Jae Crowder (back to back extremely short off-seasons), and Devin Booker, who's going from tonight's game straight to Tokyo to play for the next month. And of course next year you guys will be without Saric and probably Cameron Payne once he gets a bigger offer in free agency. Best of luck with that, no excuses, ok?"
"They have Jae Crowder, who did a damn good job defending him last year in the playoffs. Defending Giannis isn't just a 1 man team, usually the best way to do it is with some sort of wing blunting Giannis's drives and a well positioned defensive center to step in and block off whatever way Giannis tries to go at the rim. Giannis can finish from virtually anywhere within 3 feet of the rim if he gets that close, a singular wing is just too small to block off Giannis's path to the paint and a singular center is just too slow to prevent him from getting in that deep. You need both to work together to prevent him from getting to the paint at all and cut off any passing lane to the opposite side. The Raptors had Kawhi and Marc Gasol doing that, the Heat had Jae and Bam doing that. On paper, Ayton should be a great fit for that center role, and Jae has already been that forward role guy, but it's just not materializing. IMO Giannis has been a lot better at recognizing when to attack and when to defer to Holiday or Middleton as the primary ball handler and work off ball instead. Giannis is playing way smarter than he did last year and two years ago, I'm not sure those teams would fair very well in containing 2021 Giannis"
"Respect the reply but against great teams like Milwaukee and the 76ers the margins are super slim (and unlike most of this sub, I don‚Äôt think the Nets are some impenetrable force), especially with a team that severely lacks in wings over 6‚Äô7.   Is it the end of the world? No. But the Lakers without Kuzma or KCP would be hampered. The Suns without a Mikal Bridges or Jae Crowder would be hampered a bit.   Long story short, it‚Äôs the playoffs so it stings a bit. There‚Äôs only but so many players on each roster that you expect to play well on this stage"
"I think there's only really a small table of elite 3&amp;D swingmen in the league, and Jae is certainly one of them:   * Jae Crowder  * Robert Covington  * Mikal Bridges  * Marcus Morris  * Danny Green  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * OG Anunoby * Dorian Finney-Smith * PJ Tucker"
"&gt;Quite ironic from Crowder, given he was chasing this fake ring just 8 months ago. I'm all for the pettiness though.  Jae was traded as a filler he didn't sign with us."
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick.

fondly remembering when Jae Crowder couldn't handle the pressure of playing on a LeBron team
Jae crowder is slowly taking Pat Bevs place as the most annoying player
Is the bench really -that- terrible?  George Hill has been a solid point guard off the bench for years and is contributing 20 minutes a game for Philly right now. Burks is lighting it up on the Knicks. Bey's a rookie with promise. Ariza is no Jae Crowder replacement on the Heat but he's proving that he's still got gas in the tank. Favors is also one of the best backup 5's in the league.
lmao come next week this will be the second straight postseason that Jae Crowder lost to AD in the playoffs. He needs to learn some perspective
Jae Crowder be doing too much talking lately
I used to get the same thing with Demarre Carrol and Jae Crowder
"Yeah, the bubble magically erased Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk from the team, and Dragic has aged faster because it's not the bubble. Right."
Man I love Dwight Powell but I still hate that we lost out on more of Jae Crowder in a Mavs uniform
"Yeah there's even an addendum in the rules for it.  &gt;Section V‚ÄîConduct  &gt;&gt;An official may assess a technical foul, without prior warning, at any time.  A technical foul(s) may be assessed to any player on the court or anyone seated on the bench for conduct which, in the opinion of an official, is detrimental to the game. The technical foul must be charged to an individual. A technical foul cannot be assessed for physical contact when the ball is alive. &gt;&gt;&gt;EXCEPTION: Kickin' Jae Crowder right square in the nuts."
he told Jae Crowder DAS MAH PURSE I DON'T KNOW YOU

Remember when AD sucker punched Jae Crowder in the face while he was on he floor in last years finals too?  what is going on lmao leave the man alone
"AD answered his critics and aside from kicking Jae Crowder in the nuts, he attacked the paint and actually hit a clutch 3. his defense was awesome down the stretch."
Jae Crowder can slow down Lebron
It's definitely Jae Crowder. He's underrated for what he does.
"The entire Suns‚Äô defensive gameplan was to hammer Davis. Hell, the only reason Jae crowder is on the floor is to batter AD every chance he gets."
Anyone clip Jae Crowder grabbing AD and tossing him?
"Imagine having CP3 and Jae Crowder on your team, and also complaining about flopping"
Did you want Jae Crowder to make that? Because you guarantee he makes it if you do that
The Jae Crowder Experience
MAN I MISS JAE CROWDER
Jae ‚ÄúShooters Shoot‚Äù Crowder
I have become a Jae Crowder stan
"""FUCK r/NBA!""    -- Jae Crowder"
Jae Crowder talking shit to Jae Crowder
JAE FUCKING CROWDER
JAE CROWDER HEARD YALL TALKING SHIT
Fuck Jae Crowder
JAE CROWDER REDEMPTION ARC
Jae Crowder with the law of averages
JAE MOTHER FUCKING CROWDER GET IN
JAE MOTHERFUCKING CROWDER
Jae Crowder playing like he's in Cleveland
Jae crowder is the only nba player that can miss 5 shots in a row and still try and talk shit
Jae Crowder got beat up by Elfrid Payton don‚Äôt forget
Jae Crowder has done nothing all day lol
This is why every player loves Jae Crowder
No reason Jae crowder should be shooting the shots right now
Fuck jae crowder
What the hell does Jae Crowder do well?
Someone tell Jae Crowder to stop shooting 3‚Äôs
Jae Crowder can‚Äôt shoot but I‚Äôd say play him as much as you can bc Saric has been booty both games
If Jae Crowder misses one more wide open three I‚Äôm gonna lose it
"Jae Crowder shot 80% on contested 3s against us last year, ADs dick kick really has put him off"
Jae Crowder is playing awful
Jae Crowder killin the suns tn
I hate Jae Crowder. Love the suns but fuck Jae
Jae Crowder make a 3PT challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
Jae Crowder sucks yo
Jae Crowder bruh
"Jae Crowder is +5 in this game. I know that stat is mostly useless, but man his foul trouble early was huge in this game."
"Jae Crowder and missing wide ass open threes, name a more iconic duo."
Jae Crowder is one of those guys I know can shoot yet I've never seen hit a 3.
I wonder how many more times we gonna hear that Jae Crowder was in the NBA finals last year with the Miami Heat
Why did Jae Crowder only play 6 minutes?
We need Jae Crowder to transform into Jake Rowder in the 2nd half
Lakers have 2 fewer free throws and still up 9. Jae Crowder needs to get their defense going
"Dirty play by AD, but pretty funny people are feeling sorry for Jae Crowder in this thread, a player who has a very large history of dirty plays in his career."
bcus jae crowder shot right after and he keeps possession so there was no need to rebound AD‚Äôs shot if it missed
jae crowder fouled him (didnt look like it to me) but on the shot up he kicked Jae in the nuts so they each got 2 shots. AD shot for a common foul Jae shot for a flagrant foul
They said it‚Äôs unnecessary but it is Jae crowder.. so it was kinda necessary
Jae Crowder got 2 fouls and was kicked in the nuts before a point was even scored. Bruh.
Jae Crowder was the key to this Suns team all along!
Anthony Davis is the last person to complain about this.  Jae Crowder can't have kids now and Anthony Davis is the one upset.
"Have the game on mute so can someone inform me? Jae crowder gets kicked in the nuts, and that results in Lakers free throws?"
This is Jae Crowder and welcome to Jackass!
Are Suns fans mad at Jae Crowder for selling the ‚Äòhit‚Äô? Lol
Does Jae crowder get a Oscar nomination too?
Cause he‚Äôs got [‚Äúfemale tendencies‚Äù](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/01/30/marcus-morris-says-jae-crowder-has-female-tendencies-on-the-court/amp/)
jae crowder died
JAE CROWDER WILL CARRY THE SUNS
Jae crowder and olynk massacred the bucks last year.  Jrue is a huge gain...Bobby Portis is a positive...pj tucker is also positive.  Pat c....God bless his soul...is the 8th man in the rotation this year vs basically being the 6th man last year.   Bucks are a grittier more experienced and more talented team.
The Heat are really missing Jae Crowder in this series
Jimmy regressed slightly.   Bam while he improved is still as passive and cowardly as ever offensively.  Robinson is better.  Dragic is worse.  Herro is worse.  Nunn is better.  Iguodala is so bad now saying that he's worse is an understatement.  Jae Crowder wasn't the only loss. We also got rid of Kelly who was pretty inconsistent but he could catch fire randomly and kept Lopez out of the paint. Dipo played like 4 games too. Derrick Jones Jr was a role player but he sparked the offense when he played.  Bucks definitely got better but don't blame the Giannis injury on them losing last year.
The real tragedy of the Heat is that they replaced Jae Crowder with Trevor Ariza.
"So the players are worse? Because the core pieces of Jimmy, Bam, Dragic, Robinson, Herro, Nunn and even Iguodala are all back and healthy for the playoffs, the only significant loss was Jae Crowder, who has been replaced by Ariza. This team is even better on defense statiscally than last year's team, they were just never that good anyway.  That's what happens when the Bucks get better and Giannis doesn't reck his ankle, you get exposed by what you are, a good scrappy defensive team, but nowhere near a contender."
"The thing is without a Jae Crowder or Olynyk to muck things up, they might just not have the necessary bodies to frustrate Giannis and clog up the Bucks offense."
"Derrick Jones Jr., Solomon Hill, Meyers Leonard, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk. These were tough role players they are missing now. Oladipo‚Äôs addition would have been big this year"
The Heat are missing Jae Crowder shooting 43% from 3 on 10 3PT/G. Dude averaged 15/6/2 with good defense
"I understand that and I agree, but there's no way that the key piece for that Miami team was fucking Jae Crowder"
They also miss Jae Crowder
"I absolutely love Jae Crowder. Even if he's not hitting shots you can count on him to make quick, good decisions with the ball and play solid defense.  I am so glad Miami let him go."
You should reread the thread. This is about Jae Crowder and LeBron. That's undeniably what this is about. That was always my initial disagreement and I didn't start that conversation
this conversation is about LeBron and Jae Crowder is it not?
People talking about bubble as if the heat didn‚Äôt lose Jae crowder and KO and the bucks didn‚Äôt add jrue holiday.
"Honestly, he was the Heat player that scared me the most other than Jae Crowder last year.  He always does well against Giannis."
"Last game Lebron was laughing with Jae Crowder guarding him.     This game, he's crying to the referee.     The difference a game makes."
Jae Crowder plays mad fucking dirty yo
Does anyone act more tough while getting consistently clowned than Jae Crowder? I guess Pat Bev
"Someone should foul Jae Crowder, really really hard, preferably with their fist"
Jae Crowder complained less about that spinning back fist from JR Smith then Lebron does about getting grabbed   Jae was KO tho so that might have been a factor
I'm waiting on the day someone just knocks Jae Crowder out he's been asking for it for years lol
Breaking news on ESPN. Jae Crowder found crying on National TV after Bron cancels Taco Tuesday invitation
only jae crowder could make me a lakers fan
Fuck Jae Crowder and the Suns crying all series
Jae Crowder is a dirty ass player
Jae Crowder is ass.
Mad respect to Jae Crowder mean muggin
That Jae Crowder reaction is him knowing he did something that LeBron has a right to be mad about
Imagine having to root for Jae Crowder
JAE CROWDER IS SUCH A FUCKING BITCH
Fuck off Jae Crowder.
Jae crowder a junkyard dawg
"The Suns best player is injured and Jae Crowder is looking like he'd be the 2nd best player on the Lakers. How about offering some thoughts on defensive adjustments without AD? How to scheme to get role players open?   That said, the Lakers roster is awful. If Kyle Kuzma is your best man off the bench, woof."
If Chris Paul can stay on the floor and Jae Crowder can hit a shot the Suns are a little spooooky
Jae Crowder has a decent game. 1 for 4 so far!
suns legend Jae crowder
Where were you when Jae Crowder dethroned Lebron?
jae crowder out scoring lebron? did they poke the bear last game
Damn Jae Crowder broke Drummonds knees
Yeah LeBron flops so much. That‚Äôs why Jae Crowder has taken more FTs than him this series
So you're telling me Jae Crowder has hit the same amount of 3s as he did in the remainder of this series and the Suns are winning now
Jae Crowder has the attitude of a bigger pat Bev
Jae Crowder falls down on every 3 pt attempt idk why he doesn't get roasted for that shit
"Jae Crowder was playing for us early in this series, so I guess it evens out lol"
i like to think jae crowder has a dark secret addiction to dark souls 3
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, and Chris Paul are all so dislikable.   But Bridges, Booker, and Ayton are all pretty cool.   Weird team dynamics."
Jae Crowder actually hitting 3s and they're only up by 4? Game over. Lakers in 5
the Kobe chant was nice but the Fuck Jae Crowder chant was better
Jae Crowder is so unlikable
Jae Crowder heard you talking about his %'s.
wow hot take lebron james is a better scorer than jae crowder
Man if MJ talked shit to Jae Crowder he would‚Äôve been in tears and retired in the locker room after the game. Bron does and now he‚Äôs out here playing like an MVP. SMH this is your GOAT??   /s......kinda
"Jae Crowder putting it up. Hey there mama, little baby is all grown up. No more diapers, no more late night feedings. Your baby is working full time. College degree. Out on his own. Gainfully employed. Passing, dribbling, shooting the ball. Climbing the corporate ladder. Breaking the glass ceiling. Paid vacation? I don't think so. Severance package? No thank you, I like what I do. I enjoy getting out of bed in the morning. Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care Jeff Van Gundy. Suns up 3."
"Jae ""LeBron stopper"" Crowder huh"
"Well, I'm not sure why we passed up on an easy three on one layup in favor of a contested Jae Crowder three, but I'm not upset with the results."
Oh shit Jae Crowder woke up
Jae Crowder redemption arc @ u/Zephyrion
"Jae Crowder hits a three, America loses."
Jae crowder is back? Yess
"You can tell who's actually hooped and who hasn't. This has been a part of basketball for decades. Historically, teams had designated goons for this stuff but the NBA doesn't want any of this happening at all so that role has been played out. Last one I can think off of the top of my head was the Cavs putting Kendrick Perkins in the game to give Jae Crowder a flagrant after Crowder gave Iman Shumpert a hard foul."
"Anthony Davis 6‚Äô10‚Äù  Jae Crowder 6‚Äô6‚Äù  If Davis does another fadeaway in the post, I might break my television."
Hey put Jae Crowder back in
Jae crowder has been so bad
"Well, Jae Crowder is bricking literally every shot that he gets from 3pt range in this series"
Jae Crowder is so fucking bad.
Jae Crowder is a dumpster. Get that trash off the court.
Is Jae Crowder a bubble fraud?
What‚Äôs worse this staples center crowd or Jae crowder
Jae Crowder is either a god or god awful
"Jae Crowder and bricks, name a better duo"
"I think the bubble fraud thing is a little bit warranted (I think more of it is Herro coming back to earth after a good series and a half against Boston and LA) but also the difference between Bledsoe and Holiday, and then subsequently going from Jae Crowder to geriatric Trevor Ariza are each pretty fucking big."
"I also love how teams are not biting on their opponents trying to rile them up  It was hilarious when Ariza did a push up on Giannis‚Äôs dick and the look of betrayal Giannis had, or when he took that contact and then proceeded to do his best football dribble routine just to mellow out, or when LeBron just spent two possessions fucking with Jae Crowder"
"&gt;	Imagine thinking that adding Giannis to a core of Bam &amp; Jimmy would work, your 3 best players  What kind of shit comment is this to get upvoted? I'm pretty sure replacing Jae fricking Crowder with Giannis in a lineup that made the finals would be pretty good. You get a chance at a talent like Giannis, you figure out the rest later, even if it means you make a trade down the line"
"Not to mention the Heat lost Jae Crowder to the Suns, who was one of their best defenders. And they lost Olynek too who is a great 3-shooter. Add that to the fact that Jru Holiday is MUCH better than Eric Bledsoe and you see the result."
"He‚Äôs also only had one year where he was more than a decent starter. Don‚Äôt think Vic swings this series, though I guess technically you could call him a ‚Äúroster improvement.‚Äù  Jae Crowder gave us fits last year too, he could defend Giannis and nail corner 3s. They missed him more than a theoretical Oladipo."
"As someone who doesn't follow your team, why'd you let your wings walk? Jae Crowder, Derrick Jones Jr. Hell, even Solomon Hill."
Jae Crowder literally averaged 20 in the playoffs for the heat last season... and you mention Kelly O and Avery Bradley?
He‚Äôs is like more well rounded on offense jae crowder and nothing will change my mind.
"Also, this Miami team was not as good. Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro are not playing as well as they were last year. They also miss Jae Crowder."
"Derrick Jones Jr on Blazers, Solomon Hill on Hawks, Jae Crowder on Suns"
"Yeah, people acted like it was some blowout, because they're filthy casuals. That was with that meme-worthy 'guard Harden from behind' defense that everyone clowned on. It actually fucking worked for the majority of the series, insanely.  Houston completely controlled the series, don't get me wrong, but Utah shot like 20% on a fuckton of wide open threes. Jae Crowder, Ricky Rubio, Royce O'Neale, and even Ingles and Mitchell were essentially ice cold.   Hence the last couple years of Utah moves. All offensive based, Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, and adjusting to building even more of the defensive scheme around what Rudy brings to the table.   But Rudy was never played out of a series. It's not like Clint Capela was pulling him out of the paint, or like Harden was constantly getting Rudy on a switch. Wasn't happening like that."
The jae crowder effect?
"Crowder was not that good, but we could use some Jae this year.  The thing is, if Heat players got better because of the bubble, why the others didn't? There is no reason to think it only made ONE team better. It's the others teams fault"
No Jae Crowder
"I think the idea of the ‚Äúbubble frauds‚Äù argument (not even making that argument myself, just noting the context you seem to be missing) is that a team who was a ‚Äútrue‚Äù Finals team shouldn‚Äôt get swept in the fashion the Heat just were swept. No matter how good the Bucks are (I guess we‚Äôll see over these next few weeks).   This wasn‚Äôt a competitive sweep. It was a demolition in 3 of the games and the 4th was only close because the Heat outscored the Bucks by 45 beyond the arc despite being a worse 3-pt shooting team than the Bucks all season. I don‚Äôt care how well the Bucks played, a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù contender doesn‚Äôt likely get beaten so badly.   It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that the Heat were a 5 seed last year (on pace for 49 wins in a regular NBA season). They were a 6 seed this year (on pace for 45-46 wins in a regular NBA season). They got curb-stomped by a very good Bucks team in the playoffs despite being pretty much fully healthy and only losing Jae Crowder from their top 8 playoff rotation last year.   This was largely the same team that made the Bubble run last year. Which is why people are saying they‚Äôre frauds. 150+ games have indicated that the Heat are likely a middle of the road playoff team in the East, but 30 games in the middle of a wonky environment clearly run counter to that.   I‚Äôm of the mind that they‚Äôre not ‚Äúfrauds‚Äù because they seized upon their opportunity and played well in the bubble. They got hot collectively, stayed locked-in in a very difficult environment, and they went out and won those games. You can‚Äôt take that away from them.. With that being said, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be legitimate contenders in any other context as currently situated. Butler and Bam aren‚Äôt good enough offensively, their role players are too one-dimensional, and they lack size and dribble penetration. Think of it more as lightning in a bottle (or bubble) rather than frauds.   And that‚Äôs not to take away the Bucks. Drubbing a team that badly is impressive, especially since the Heat aren‚Äôt some 8 seed who was below .500 all season."
"the bucks are definitely better but this Miami team is a far cry from the bubble heat. their offense was bad all year, they didnt have Jae crowder shooting like 50% from 3, jimmy looked like he wanted to go on vacation, dragic lost a step, etc."
Shout out to Jae Crowder. His presence alone is sparking Lebron James‚Äôs offense.
Respect to Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk
"Yeah, replace Jae Crowder, Derrick Jones Junior, and Kelly Olynyk with just 35 year old Trevor Ariza. That‚Äôs a significant roster downgrade. Especially when the other team did the exact opposite, signed 3 key players Holiday, Tucker, Portis. A significant roster upgrade."
The year after DeRozan's best season they had him below Jae Fucking Crowder. They're jokes at best.
"There's a million little things. Jae crowder wasn't there to go nuclear, Middleton played better, Giannis didn't get injured, our team didn't stage a walk out one week ago, none of our players are recovering from covid, we had home court advantage, ECT."
"They retained most of the players. I think the only significant losses were Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk. Y'all got Ariza which would seem to make up for the loss of Crowder. Now if Olynyk was still there, they'd probably still lose, just probably not get swept."
"It's too bad they didn't have Jae Crowder, Meyers ""KB"" Leonard"", ""and Big Dick Olynyk."
"Yup, pat riley already labeled it an asterisk and Jae crowder called it a fake ring"
"Jae Crowder leaving was a big loss and the team regressed, they went out sad"
Miami was incredible last year - why are they so much worse now?  Is Jae Crowder really that much of a difference maker?
Heat miss the toughness of Jae Crowder and the clutch shooting of Kelly O Clinic
Jae Crowder shooting 2/20 from three has impressed me
Jae Crowder Tyler herro
bucks got better and Jae Crowder isnt there doing a klay thompson impression
"The bubble environment is not there any longer. So Milwaukee had homecourt and there‚Äôs actual travel going on.   Jae Crowder is gone. He was big in that series last year. Now they‚Äôve got Ariza who is a step back and is not playing well at all.   Bucks are using the Giannis wall against Bam and his offensive output is getting exposed.  Jrue is on the Bucks in place of Bledsoe and that‚Äôs been a clear upgrade.   Bucks have more offensive rhythm. They‚Äôre not just taking quick shots, they‚Äôve actually got a flow and rhythm to everything they‚Äôre doing.   ‚ÄúRevenge‚Äù series for Milwaukee too. I think that‚Äôs motivating them because they actually took the L last year."
"Yeah this is where I was trying to remember how George Hill and Rodney Hood got there but this was it. Jae Crowder also went to Utah, I think, where he immediately played better after being butt for Cleveland lol"
"Lets look at the timeline of events, shall we?  -	Cavs parts ways with David Griffin for‚Ä¶.. some reason -	Interviews none other than Chauncey Billups for the GM job -	Kyrie forces his way off of the team. We get the corpse of IT, Jae Crowder and their first round pick (Colin Sexton) -	New GM Koby Autman starts a signing spree of random misfits: Derrick Rose and D. Wade (both on minimum contracts) -	LeBron calls Trump a bum on Twitter -	D. Rose steps away from the team mid season for personal reasons, considers retirement, had a weird report about him in a gym by himself -	Rose came back. Turned out he got married during his absence? -	Lue takes a leave of absence for health issues -	Cavs hold a team meeting. IT and Wade reportedly called out Kevin Love for leaving a game early due to an illness. Turned out that Love had a concussion -	Report comes out mid season that Kyrie threatened to get knee surgery if he wasn‚Äôt traded -	Love fractures a bone in his hand in mid January. -	An ESPN article ‚Äúreveals‚Äù that LeBron may consider leaving the Cavs to join the‚Ä¶.. Warriors? -	Feb 7: IT pleads the Cavs not to trade him. Says he is tired of being traded -	Feb 8: IT gets traded -	Cavs also trade Wade for basically free and sends Derrick Rose to Minnesota. In return, they received Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, LNJ -	JR smith throws a bowl of soup at Damon Jones -	TMZ revealed TT cheated on a Kardashian -	LeBronto sweeps the raptors -	JR Smith loses game 1 with one of the worst plays in NBA history. LeBron had a historic scoring night -	LeBron punches a white board, breaks his hand. Cavs lose the Finals  Yeah, I‚Äôd say that was definitely a weird team to say the least"
"He needs very special conditions to bring his best. If a team wants to offer him big money, they'd rather make sure they don't expect him to be more than a role player. Also he's a correct three point shooter but probably not enough in today's NBA if you compare him to a guy like Jae Crowder. In the end, we'll see how the Clippers run goes in the playoffs but I see no reason for him to leave, he feels good living there and so does his wife (it matters a lot in his decision)."
&gt;QUESTION: Did the second technical foul have anything to do with words exchanged between Thompson and Jae Crowder or was it simply the butt slap?  MAUER: ‚ÄúJust simply the butt slap.‚Äù  [SLAP ASS](https://youtu.be/9Mlp_Gcc_5Q)
Why did Jae crowder get ejected? A few articles said he kept hawking with the Lakers. So I'm guessing he said something pretty messed up? Or can the refs eject you willy nilly now like in baseball if they feel like it? Genuine question
"Marcus ""Jae Crowder"" Morris"
"It‚Äôs more disrespect than hate. Since his bad campaign at the bubble, he‚Äôs been getting picked on by other players. It‚Äôs like how players b*tch Jae Crowder around, but don‚Äôt necessarily hate him."
"I'm not even saying this because i'm a fan. That's just what i objectively see.  Those last 7 minutes, the Lakers were having a bunch of fun with each other. Maybe Book got in his feelings about that. Dennis wasn't trying to sell contact like he died. HE JUST ROLLED. literally just a roll  and pushups. Dennis gets under opposing team's skin and it clearly works on the fanbase too.  Don't need to get pressed tho. It's literally just dudes playing basketball. I can't tell who's taking it more seriously, you or Jae Crowder.  &amp;#x200B;  When anyone on the Suns team does a single thing ""for show"" i want you to keep the same energy."
I mean I‚Äôm sure they did some scouting. Like Chris Paul is dirty and Jae Crowder can‚Äôt shoot
Jae Crowder is not good enough to be talking THIS much shit against an AD-less Lakers lol
My dislike for Jae Crowder ironically went away
"There's a (bad) take that floats around this sub where people say ""soft is a meaningless insult"". It means the opposite of Jae Crowder."
Video?  Edit: [found it](https://lakersdaily.com/lakers-lebron-james-gets-into-it-with-jae-crowder-proceeds-to-clown-him-after/)
Gassing up Jae crowder lmao
I despise Jae crowder but this is pretty fucking great
"I miss him so much I‚Äôm considering buying a Crowder Suns jersey. I‚Äôve been rooting for them as my west coast team since the Bubble Suns, Jae being there just makes me love them even more"
Or are jae crowder
for sure. ill yell fuck jae crowder all day every day baby but dude balled out tonight. let the man dance. #freejae
"Danny Green is the most overly shitted on role player and I really just don't get it. Yeah, he can be streaky, but he's still gonna give you great defensive effort and he's gonna have games where he will hit 5 3s. It's like Jae Crowder. You live and die with it. They can win you games and lose you games, but that's why they're so important in the playoffs. At least Danny Green has a good looking shooting stroke lol, it was painful watching these Lakers shoot the 3 this series"
"Or, apparently, Jae Crowder"
"&gt;  Bro what, so I'm a bandwagon now cause I hate Jae Crowder? Hes been one of the most dirty players in the league since 2017.   Grayson Allen has entered the chat..."
"Said Chris Paul, DeAndre Ayton, Jae Crowder, Dario Saric, Cam Payne, Cam Johnson......"
"I'm definitely on the Suns bandwagon.  Makes perfect sense. Suns are the closest thing to Heat in this league. James Jones and Jae Crowder, too.  Time to get CP3 a damn ring."
"I‚Äôm not sure he did. My shitty lip reading skills saw ‚Äúwatch out.‚Äù  The ref turns and sees Crowder up in Schr√∂der‚Äôs space and despite the push it becomes an easy double tech to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù things in the moment.  Jae knows what he‚Äôs doing rolling in towards Book and bumping into Dennis, doesn‚Äôt have to say anything naughty."
Maybe if LeBron was more charged he wouldn't have been outplayed by Jae Crowder in an elimination game
"Jae Crowder was in fear of the dreaded popcorn of death, water bottle from hell, and a wad of spit from that hostile CCP approved crowd."
"Jae Crowder didn‚Äôt want any popcorn, water bottle, or wad of spit from those fair weathered fans."
"Nah, fuck Jae Crowder and this classless taunting act, but he was the best wing defender for the Heat and made tons of clutch corner 3s. Seems to be wildly hot and cold on offense but still think he's an important asset on a contending team. Especially when you look at the Suns roster, gives their guards spacing and takes the pressure off their guards on defense so they can save their energy for buckets."
Does anyone remember the player who ended all his tweets with the same thing and sometimes it sounded inappropriate? I keep on thinking it's Jae Crowder but all he does is permanent caps lock.
The gravely impoverished Jae Crowder who only makes 7 million dollars a year. Might as well be homeless
Shouldn‚Äôt have been dancing and talkin shit game 3 bruh. Why wasn‚Äôt Drummond impersonating lebron and clowning Jae crowder last night????
If I was lebron and I just got done seeing Jae Crowder hit the salsa on my ass I'd be pissed too
Jae Crowder don't have the right to taunt anybody lmao
Jae Crowder is the real MVP
CP3 with the Superkick out of nowhere and then Booker so Paul doesn‚Äôt mess up his shoulder throws LeBron through the Barbershop Window while Jae Crowder powerbombs Bronny into a table cackling and staring at LeBron
"&gt;It's hilarious how much Lakers fans hate Jae  Where, on your sub?  I didn't see anyone complain about him on r/Lakers, other than teasing him.  Here, LeBron clowned him the other game, Crowder returned the favor, no problem with this personally, lol.  Otherwise, congrats on your team winning.  Hopefully we won't be injury hell next season and can trade for a couple shooters."
"[Charina] Phoenix F Jae Crowder has been relieved of his duties, received 2 year ban for violating the League‚Äôs Anti-Drug policy"
"I hate how in basketball they gotta hug it out instead of shaking hands.  After I'm battling it out the whole series and getting into it with Jae Crowder, I'm not there to hug my opponent, I would shake hands to show respect though which isn't something you do in basketball. Lebron does seem salty for leaving, but I understand why basketball players sometimes just leave whereas in soccer and hockey, they stay behind to shake hands after, i am not hugging my opponent."
Not claiming to represent every Grizz fan. Just stating I'm not a Lakers fan in any capacity. Fuck Jae Crowder and Chris Paul both. Booker looks like a lost Jonas Brother.
u/losangelesqueens  been shitting on the Celtics for years while jerking off Pelinka and Kuzma.  they just got embarrassed by Jae Crowder and old man Chris Paul while having two top 5 talents dude's crying himself to sleep tonight
"Clippers fan here, fuck Jae Crowder"
I thought that was Jae Crowder who was ejected
Heat legend Jae Crowder üò≠
Jae ‚ÄúDani Rojas‚Äù Crowder
2020 champs and 16 others. Jae Crowder not this year and 0 ever
"Not really, crowder is just dishing back the disrespect they gave him earlier in the series and they deserved it, doing a little salsa dance like Jae did mocking Lebron is not anything like acting like we just won the finals. You just salty, team mocked your team back after they did it to us and that‚Äôs the end of it."
"Bro what, so I'm a bandwagon now cause I hate Jae Crowder? Hes been one of the most dirty players in the league since 2017. I've probably hated this guy longer than you've watched basketball LOL. If anything Cavs fans shouldn't hate him for his stint there, the reason he played bad for was cause his mom died which is understandable but instead of getting hated on by Cavs fans for being dirty he gets hated on cause of that."
I'm going to name my first child Jae Crowder
I was at the game. At least 4 fuck Jae crowder chants.
"We got this fantastic meme and now crowder mocking Lebron with the salsa, Jae delivered some great shit this series lol."
That‚Äôs a video game taunt right there. Jae Crowder just pressed up on the d-pad
Can confirm. Love me some Jae Crowder!
Jae Crowder needs to remember where he belongs.
Jae Crowder lol
[Andre Drummond imitating LeBron James as he destroys Jae Crowder is the most hilariously disrespectful thing I‚Äôve ever seen](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/5/28/22458557/andre-drummond-imitating-lebron-james-destroying-jae-crowder-video-hilarious)
‚ÄúHello LAPD? Jae Crowder won‚Äôt stop dancing‚Äù
"It's already begun. By next month the Lakers will have been playing their best possible basketball right before being trounced by the unshakeable Jae Crowder.   Schrodingers team, depending on whether they need to shit on the franchise or Lebron at that particular moment."
Even after 2 ejections the only thing history will recall of Jae Crowder in this series is Lebron reminding him how little he is in a straight up 1 on 1
You can‚Äôt even get mad about that. Jae Crowder of all people has been waiting 19 seasons to be able to do that to Brons team.
"""came to cleveland"" wtf he was traded there and lebron didnt want him lol. Jae Crowder would be the best role player for the lakers if they had him btw"
Just have to give props to the Lakers for overcoming a ton of injuries this season and this series. I want AD and LeBron to get healthy this offseason.  And Jae Crowder Salsa dancing was one of the highlights of my day.
"LeBron dominated Jae Crowder in both Boston as well as Miami, then Jae Crowder came to Cleveland to join Bron and proceeded to shit the bed. He finally has his win"
"Jae ""Kevin Malone"" Crowder"
The West is more wide open than Jae Crowder was this game.
"Mental toughness for what?   If thats the case, CP3 deserves the fucking franchise. Jae Crowder is a role player and played exceptionally well these last 3 games. There's levels to this shit man."
"idk why he ran off, he should've asserted his dominance by dancing even harder.   What were the refs gonna say? ""Help security! Jae Crowder won't stop dancing!"""

LeBron STILL being a sore loser. I need Jae Crowder to SPAZZ in the conference. Lakers fans were all smiles and laughs when LeBron scored on him twice. Yall ain't had shit to smile about since and he been TORCHING yall whole team

Can't believe Lebron got sent home by Jae Crowder in the first round.
"Chairman LeMao hated getting chirped at by Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, Devin Booker, and the rest of the Suns after showboating Game 3. Did the Isaiah Thomas walk-off and left at 0:00's. Now he got time to push Space Jam 2 for Winnie the Pooh in Shanghai. Still Top 5 GOAT player."

Feels like ages ago when Jae Crowder was getting humiliated by Lebron and the bench. Oh how the turn tables.
"Enjoy you fake ass Summer League championship, whiny bitch gets exposed again. Jae Crowder ate your lunch"
You go Jae Crowder. suns you deserve this shit.
"Jae Crowder, you beauty!"

JAE CROWDER
"I wouldn‚Äôt know who to root for, because I hate Jae Crowder, but I want CP3 to get a ring."
"We traded Kyrie for an injury-prone little person, Jae Crowder, a 20 year old center who isn‚Äôt in the league anymore, and The Nets Pick‚Ñ¢Ô∏è  Someone can get a deal done"
"tbf he got past Giannis last year under a different scheme and this year they switched it up with the (at the time) reigning DPOY guarding him, Herro and Nunn both dropped off significantly and we are still seeing that Jae Crowder is an integral piece to a playoff team, who the Heat lost between last year and this one. Goran was the only player on that team who didn‚Äôt perform below expectation, and Jimmy deserves some of the criticism of his game but he still impacted the game in every way except scoring and like i said he was the main defensive assignment for Giannis who besides KD who is widely considered unguardable, has been an incredible 1on1 defender this year. Jimmy is not the reason that team aint it"
"One of the Heat‚Äôs lingering problems this year was they had trouble plugging in someone into the Jae Crowder role defensively and PJ would have been the closest thing to it.   That being said, it still probably wouldn‚Äôt have turned them into a significantly better team."
The way I understood the title I thought it was Crowder's brother and was just thinking how they are named basically Jae Crowder and C Jae Crowder.
"Dog, Phoenix only needed *one* Jae Crowder. One for each round leading up to the finals? Unstoppable."
"&gt;The only NBA player with an affluent background I remember of is Jose Calderon.  ? Are you not aware of the many NBA players whose fathers played in the league?  Steph, Klay, Tim Hardaway, Jalen Brunson, KJ Martin, Cole Anthony, Jae Crowder, Bol Bol, etc. List goes on and on."
"Jae Crowder, Ayton playing the full season, Bridges breakout."
"They're pretty equal imo. Crowder is feistier, which can be good or bad at times. Still love Jae tho.  Really right now we need 2-3 more Crowders/O'Neales"
Jae Crowder or Jeff Green?
"The old guard of the nba as a whole needs to go.   Embiid is better without Simmons, Lakers are better with AD at the 5, Suns starting PF is Jae Crowder, Clippers start Batum and Morris, etc.   Of the 4 remaining teams, all 4 start 4 catch and shoot 3pt shooters (at least). By catch and shoot I mean if he‚Äôs even remotely open you WANT him shooting it.   I don‚Äôt count Embiid as a catch and shoot 3 point shooter bc an open 3 is not always his best shot, and you don‚Äôt want him taking every 3 he gets .)"
"whats his brothers name, crowder jae?"
they have the scariest player in the playoffs aka giannis eater jae crowder
I'd argue Jae Crowder doing LeSalsa in front of Lakers is much much sweeter.
"Reposting what I posted a week ago about this topic:  &gt; Too many unknowns now to actually answer that question. This team, as a whole, doesn't exist with Luka on it. As in, I'm not really sure there's a Chris Paul, Jae Crowder, even Mikal Bridges. I'm not really sure there's a Monty Williams. I'm not really sure James Jones is the GM. Everything changed AFTER the 2018 draft -- McD was let go october 8th, 2018, 3-4 months after the draft.  &gt; Igor Kokoskov gets a bad year, and loses the respect of the locker room.  &gt; James Jones takes over, sheds the dead weight left in by McDonough, and brings in Monty, and here we are.  &gt; If we draft Luka, best case scenario is a lineup of:  &gt; 1-2-3 SGA Book Luka or Book Luka Mikal 4-5 ??? Capela and Cam Johnson maybe? Kelly Oubre maybe?  &gt; But with Kokoskov likely staying in as coach and McD potentially keeping his job I'm not convinced we're here, 1 game away from the WCF.  And now we're 3 wins away from the finals."
"So Sean Marks shouldn't have been close?   Traded for James Harden, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet. Extended Joe Harris. Signed Jeff Green. Added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in the buyout market. Put together the most stacked coaching staff of all time in Steve Nash, Mike D'Antoni and Jacque Vaughn.  But your saying that Jones adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder to the roster is such an incredible feat, that despite every roster move the Nets made, ""no one should've been close"" to what Jones did?"
Jae Crowder.
imagine a team usa lineup of   trae young devin booker mikal bridges jae crowder brook lopez
Also Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder is such an underrated player. It‚Äôs no coincidence that he‚Äôs always on a contender. His skillset is extremely valuable in the modern NBA.
"Jae ""Joe Harris"" Crowder"
jae crowder took a dumbass shot at the end
Jae Crowder has had some brilliant play-off performances this year.
Jae Crowder gets away with a lot of away-from-the-play contact lmao
I‚Äôd take Jae Crowder any day.
was jae crowder wearing a wwe belt just now?
only a matter of time until jae crowder tries to rip paul george‚Äôs arm out
jae crowder should lead the offense
If Jae Crowder is hitting sidestepping contested threes just give Phoenix the W
Wtf is this new edition of Jae Crowder
feel like jae crowder takes the nastiest shits
paul george &gt; jae crowder
They should put LeBron stopper Jae Crowder on him
jae crowder looks like he always has a poo about to come out of his ass
Feels like I've never seen Jae Crowder make an open 3
Jae Crowder with the crop top? Wtf?
Man cut it out jae crowder has been inconsistent his whole career. That has fuck all to do with LeBron
jae crowder with the crop is sus ü§îü§îü§î
Almost forgot about Marcus Morris vs Jae Crowder lol
Yup he's one of my fav Random esque players (players that casual fans usually dont care about but some of us love) PJ Jae Crowder were my favs to come to the warriors and I hated how good of defense PJ played through out that series simply amazing player
You had Jae Crowder once. That's basically a slightly more offensive leaning PJ.
"Lebron: ‚ÄúThese shoulders were built for this‚Äù  Also Lebron (and teammates): Having fun running around trolling Jae Crowder, feeling all sorts of good  Lebron after the loss: *Oh but the injuries*"
"See, that's key word right there ""right now"", it's not definitive. Kawhi had a good game, they called him the best. Then KD had one, they shifted to him. Steph doesn't really have an argument, didn't make the playoffs, he's top 3 though.  LeBron wasn't fully healthy, and when he was, he was in the MVP race for the majority of the season and definitely better than KD. Plus he's the reigning finals MVP. So you can't really compare a healthy KD to an injured Bron, he was still dealing with ankle pain. Once he's fully healthy, he said he'll be next season, then we can compare. You don't just decline over an ankle injury lol. Even Jae Crowder of all people said LeBron is still the best in the league lol"
"Funny thing is a lot of guys from that shit squad have had career resurgences since then. Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, even Larry Nance are all at least above average rotation players now"
The redemption arch is insane this season!   Jae Crowder finally redeemed against LeBron.  Tucker finally redeemed against KD. Ironically shooting HARDEN on the way out.
"No, since he is not inbounds, this has happened before with either Jae Crowder or Marcus Smart when Crowder was on the Celtics."
I bet Jae Crowder is the one who'll get the assignment.
Imagine having a Jae Crowder as one of your wing defenders
"This exactly. If you put Gobert on this Clipper team, for example, they would easily be the best defensive team in the league even without Kawhi. That's because the Clippers have elite wing defenders. The Jazz front office said fuck it to having any wing defenders and put all the defensive pressure on Gobert. That kind of roster construction isn't going to work in the playoffs. if they had a guy like Jae Crowder/Marcus Smart the defense would be completely different. Also, the coaching was bad too. How were the Jazz defenders so bad on their rotations when the Clippers were running the same play over and over."
"We'll run wit it. jae Crowder has more experience, height, weight, skill, the ability to walk and even run, basic and advanced understanding of basketball, can actually say the word ""basketball..""  Marcus Morris Jr possibly has cuteness on his side but not sure how much that will help on the court."
"Ah yes Isaiah Thomas who was seen as an afterthought before Stevens made him into an MVP candidate. What Stevens is amazing at is turning meh players into great players, see Jae Crowder, Jordan Crawford, IT, Evan Turner. That‚Äôs why he was the perfect coach for us during our rebuilding years and why people considered him elite during those times. Those teams were filled with players trying to prove their worth to the league. However, he struggled when superstars started coming in, when egos started to clash in the locker room. That‚Äôs why I believe he‚Äôs going to be great in the FO; he has shown he has a great basketball mind and can develop players well but he cannot handle a locker room filled with stars, which is what the Celtics really need right now."
"If the Jazz had given us Dante Exum and kept Jae Crowder in the Conley trade, like we supposedly asked for, is the LAC/UTA series headed for a game 7 right now?  Felt like they got absolutely exposed for having only one good perimeter defender."
"Gobert throughout the season has been a great communicator, but there's definitely a cultural issue with the team where they don't take pride in that end of the floor. Jae Crowder used to be the vocal leader for our perimeter defenders when he played for us, but that void hasn't been filled."
"Could you give a list of the players who could have been cheaper and provided better defense, which is what that '17 Cavs lacked when Lebron was off the floor? GSW became more a better destination for ring chasers once they got KD. The Cavs could have used Jae Crowder, but we all saw how that went the following year"
"IMO they don‚Äôt need to do much. They need better wings. Bojan, Ingles, Clarkson while being great shooters absolutely let Gobert get exposed by being beat off the dribble every possesion and when rudy went into the paint to help, their rotations were nonexistent. Even Mitchell was guilty of this but Hes good enough offensively to where hes still a plus on the floor. IMO they need to better 3&amp;D players if they want to keep Mitchell &amp; Gobert together. They cant rely on bad on ball defenders funneling their man towards Rudy AND have dog shit rotations. They need more players like Royce and less like Ingles, Bojan. Someone like Mikal Bridges on the suns would be perfect for this team or maybe a Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig type.   We‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm right next series though. Maybe the Suns get exposed in the same fashion."
Oh sure lebron really raised Chris boshs floor by turning him into a spot up shooter.   Im not a fan of heliocentric basketball and especially not Lebron's system of completely dominating his own team and acting like leGM.   I LOVE seeing jae crowder show out on first miami and then now phoenix.
Ben Wallace made it work with a worse offensive game. Utah's issue is not their offense. They need perimeter defenders. Jae Crowder would have been really good for them to have.
Jae Crowder gyrated in front of your bench on your homecourt. Shut up.
"George Hill and Jae Crowder are basically in the playoffs every season and are nearly always critical players on winning teams. (Hill not so much because he's older now, but he was great before.)"
"Embiid is also bringing an insane amount of money and interaction to philly by being good at basketball, surely silver isn‚Äôt that petty to a MVP caliber player. He needs them since this is a star powered league. You‚Äôre not drawing crowds and interests by having Jae crowder level goons"
And cam Payne and Jae crowder and Torrey Craig and Chris mother fucking paul
Jae crowder lmao
"Nah, got to get Jae Crowder, IT, and coax Evan Turner out of retirement."
There is a disgusting lack of jae crowder love
That sky dunk really showed how hobbled he was. All that giggling and iso on Jae crowder he was super hobbled too there. Damn you‚Äôre right.
Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder is probably in it
Bron gotta be sick watching harden get these calls after wrestling with Jae crowder for two free throws a game all series
Jae crowder hates everybody
I‚Äôm sure Jae Crowder loved Bron
"right now jae crowder, he's been putting on a masterclass in the playoffs"
"I'm not sure how to articulate this as well as I should but in my opinion I think people are a little unfair when they dismiss bigs like that.  If you compare to a mid-level 3 and D player like IDK Jae Crowder or Robert Covington or Patrick Beverley or something like that I think the comparison makes more sense.   They can hit open shots and they can have a 20 point game when they're feeling it,  but they're not guys that can put the ball on the floor and create offense reliably on their own.   If you're relying on Jae Crowder to be your 3rd best offensive player you're going to be very sad when he goes 1/5 from 3, but if he's the 5th guy on a well-constructed roster with playmakers it's an awesome skillset.  The valuation is kind of weird because you're obviously expecting your big to influence the defense in a way that perimeter players can't, but I think from that perspective it makes it easier to understand why people would want that.   If you have a good point guard and if Steven Adams is going to be a one-man defense that takes the pressure off and gives you roster flexibility to play guys that aren't a good fit defensively I think that can really have a much bigger impact than just his individual skill would suggest."
Yeah that‚Äôs totally fair regarding the free agent. It‚Äôs the combination of signing guys who are way past their prime and not drafting anyone that made this team old as shit for like 8 years. Jae Crowder is the only guy we drafted (traded for on draft night to be specific) between John Howard and Justin Anderson that I can even name off the top of my head.  Instead of drafting guys and trying to develop them we would just go after someone like Vince Carter. Or get a slightly younger guy and put together a team full of guys who would normally be a 4th or 5th best player on their team with guys like Aminu or Delonte West or Zaza of Richard Jefferson.
And Mikals developement and Cam Payne and Cam Johnson and signing Jae Crowder and signing Torrey Craig
"The big flaw in the Mavs plan is that they focused on hiring free agents and never got any, all while being pretty horrible at drafting. Who was the last big free agent to change to a team that wasn‚Äôt in New York or LA? Lebron in Cleveland is kind of an exception. Who was the last Mavs draft pick that actually contributed to a decent team before Luka? They drafted Jae Crowder and gave up on him way too fast. DSJ was fun for a season, but other than that it‚Äôs a dearth of talent"
"Honestly, I'm not sure I'd give Donnie that much of a positive assessment.    He's hired in 2005 (shoutout to that weird Haralabob burner account for giving me that date), helps sustain our early-aughts 50-win team success. Eventually culminates in building the 2011 team. Sure, credit there. That team was great, got Dirk a ring.    Since then? Blew up the championship team (allegedly Cuban's call), whiffed on Dwight, Deron Williams, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, others. We've had OJ Mayo, Darren Collison, the god awful Chandler Parsons deal, the god awful Porzingis extension, dumping Jae Crowder (who I always thought was underused in Carlisle's rotations), on and on.    I've been frustrated with Donnie for a while. I think it's time for some new blood. Get Haraladingus out of there too."
Hes like jae crowder or something. He always plays well but gets moved for no reason
"&gt; Traded Grayson Allen, Darius Bazley, Jae Crowder, Kyle Korver and a 2020 1st round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Mike Conley. (1-7 and 15-30 protected)  So a 2018 first round pick, a 2019 first round pick, an elite role player, and an aging vet, and a protected 1st.  Not exactly sure how Thybulle, Maxey, salary filler, and a 1st is far off from Conleys trade value."
"Yeah, the 4's in the playoffs are Jae Crowder, Marcus Morris, Royce O'neal, Tobias Harris, John Collins, Giannis, and Durant. Basically just small forwards or tweeners.   Maybe a few years ago with someone like LMA playing the 4 it would be a problem, but not so much these days"
"Jae Crowder been one of the dirtiest players in the league for a while, I say it all the time but if you're waking up as a Jae Crowder fan, you def weird"
What do you expect from Jae Crowder and this Suns team? He's so tired of constantly being beaten by superior players that he decides to injure them whenever possible. Typical Suns move.
Milwaukee. Chris Paul and Jae Crowder are super dirty players and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to root for them. Plus I‚Äôm a huge fan of Giannis and Jrue Holiday.
Jae Crowder training with Jon Jones
I've never liked jae crowder
1. stay relatively healthy throughout the regular season  2. play injured teams in the playoffs  3. Monty Williams and CP3 connection  4. drafting/developing Ayton and Booker  5. steal Mikal Bridges and steal Jae Crowder (who was contemplating signing with my Mavs)
"Yep, never thought of Jae Crowder as dirty until that play, now I know he doesn't mind injuring players."
Devin Booker developed   They hit on the right picks with Ayton and Bridges   They signed a good veteran in Jae Crowder  They signed Payne who understood his role   They traded for Chris Paul
"&gt;It sure looked intentional, too. I don't like to assume intent with random basketball plays but Jae could have avoided that easily yet he turned away and pointed his fingers down and continued the motion. Absolutely no good excuse for that.  [https://twitter.com/Tim\_NBA/status/1399167872920915969?s=19](https://twitter.com/Tim_NBA/status/1399167872920915969?s=19)  Crowder does this frequently, he does this on a lot of contests, always getting real close to the eyes"
There was a reason Jae crowder tried to take him out lol
I want Jae Crowder to expose me for the sissy boy I am. Show my lowlights to the other boys in the locker room with their bulging muscles. Show them to my family. I want them to know that I'm a sissy hooper
Props to the Clippers who are absolutely spent but another role player keeps stepping up.  PG locked it down too. He's hungry.  The Suns seem like they're always so close to breaking it through but can't seem to get it. Either their two playoff vets man up or get out of the way and just let the young bulls gas the Clippers.  If Jae Crowder gets hot in either of the last 2 games that'll be the difference.
Grabbed jersey on purpose ‚úÖ   Continued directly towards the eye after the shot ‚úÖ   Is Jae Crowder ‚úÖ
"Besides CP, Jae Crowder, and maybe Torey Craig, we‚Äôre still a very young team that doesn‚Äôt have too much experience. This is a learning curve for them"
Either one of the east teams. I don‚Äôt want a team with Pat bev/Jae crowder to win
Remember Jae crowder poked Paul George in the eye at the end of the game. Y‚Äôall know what would be happening Rn if bev did that.
Fuck Jae crowder that‚Äôs some dirty ass bullshit
"Jae ""Ben Simmons"" Crowder"
Patrick Beverly being a better offensive player than either Jae Crowder or Mikal Bridges this series is funny af to me
I cannot stand Jae Crowder. Dude literally gets carried in every team he's in but seems to think he is a critical piece of the puzzle.

Can't believe that after leading four different teams to conference finals appearances in four straight seasons Jae Crowder is about to lead two different teams to the NBA finals in back to back seasons. Will he finally get his ring and be placed into the discussion of greatest of all time?
"Who makes your ""i can't believe they gave them up?"" team from last season. Jae Crowder, Seth Curry"
I want Jae Crowder to get him a ring
Jae crowder shoots like me in Warzone
Jae Crowder and missing 3's. Name a more iconic duo.
has jae crowder been an awesome passer all this time?
Jae clam crowder smashing it
"Jae Crowder, Chris Paul and Devin Booker"
Anyone see that bet on Twitter that a guy wins 20 grand off a 5 dollar parlay if fucking Jae crowder has a Triple double
it feels like jae crowder hasn't made a shot since game 1
"&gt;AD got hurt in game 4  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10004066-lakers-anthony-davis-hyperextended-knee-in-game-3-win-says-injury-feels-fine](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10004066-lakers-anthony-davis-hyperextended-knee-in-game-3-win-says-injury-feels-fine)  Kinetic chain. He had an ankle problem before this, then extended his knee in G3, then extended his groin in G4. Medical professionals will be able to illustrate this for you if it still doesn't make sense.  &gt;Lebron was very healthy when he was head at the rim catching oops off the glass and the bench was clowning Jae Crowder  This makes no sense. This narrative that LeBron was healthy because he made one nice play and did a celebration in front of his bench is pure conjecture, doesn't make logical sense and not based in reality.  Can you not make fun of people if you're not physically injured? Would LeBron not be able to laugh at Jae Crowder if his ankle was truly hurt?  &gt;Goalposts keep moving for you that's kinda sad bro  You're coping with the fact that less and less people are respecting this ring before you've even won it, lmaoooo."
Jae Crowder will be the longest active player to be in consecutive finals with 2 if the Suns win tonight. Iggy was holding the record with 6 before he got knocked out this year with the Heat
AD got hurt in game 4  Lebron was very healthy when he was head at the rim catching oops off the glass and the bench was clowning Jae Crowder  Goalposts keep moving for you that's kinda sad bro
The Jae Crowder special
The lakers could probably find 12 million to give reggie  or he could take a chance that like the mavericks will take a big leap next year with luka  jae crowder gambled on the suns and it looks like a good move
"Really?  KD with prime Wade and Bosh doesn't win 2 rings?  KD with prime AD cant beat the Heat without Dragic and a hobbled Bam?  Really?  KD with Kyrie and Love cant beat the IT less Celtics, whose leading scorers were Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder lol.  KD with just Love cant beat a Kyrie less Celtics team led by 20 year old Jaylen and 19 year old Tatum?  Prime KD with prime Wade and Bosh cant beat 22 year old Paul George and David West, Hibbert, Lance and George Hill?  Really?  Prime KD with prime Wade and Bosh cant beat 22 yo D Rose with Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah?   KD with an almost useless Harden who literally couldn't run and a bunch of role players was a half an inch away from single handedly beating a team with a 2x MVP plus 2 other all- stars.   2007 Detroit is the only time Lebron ever won a series when his team was even close to that under-talented (is this a word? i dk how to phrase it.  basically the gap between his talent and the other team).   And Milwaukee is better than that team (Chauncey, Rip, Tayshaun with no Ben Wallace and 32 year old Rasheed).  KD wouldn't win 2016, but he likely wins 2011 so those cancel out.  I think is is absurd that you don't think KD has any titles if he played Lebron's career out."
"TLDR: Basically the finals streak is when Lebron became Lebron and zoomed past other all timers to #2 on the all time list and some even think #1 (lol). This is when the ""he can drag anyone to the finals"" type arguments started.  But I wonder when this actually happened b/c in almost all of his series wins, he usually had a teammate or two who was better than the other teams best player.  So when you analyze his supporting casts compared to the teams he faced, I think you can make the case that there are a lot of other all timers who would've had a similar runs (10 finals, 4 titles) if they played Lebron's career out.   KD, Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Magic etc.  They would likely make all of those finals except 2007 and win 4 (2011 Dallas swaps with 2016 GSW so still 4).  KD is early teens all-time on most lists.  But I think he would have 4 titles and 9 finals appearances if you swap him with Lebron.  So really the 2007 Detroit Series and the 2016 GSW series is the difference between Lebron being at the top/ in the discussion with those other guys 2-12 or whatever all time and just being automatically, unanimously put ahead of them at #2 without any thought at all.     A huge piece of Lebron's legacy is the finals streak.  You always hear ""Lebron dragged worse teams to the finals"" or ""lebron could drag any team to the finals"" etc etc.   But most of the finals runs, his team was way better than anyone he beat along the way.  It just worked out for him that when his team wasn't what you would expect to be talented enough to make the finals (2017 and 2018), they basically didn't face anyone.  Exception being 2007 when they beat 1 good team in Detroit.  Which is very impressive, but its also 1 series in 10 finals appearances.   IT got hurt in 2017 and Boston's leading scorers were Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder and Lebron had Kyrie and Love lmao.  Then Kyrie got hurt in 2018 and Boston's leading scorers were 20 year old Jaylen Brown (not close to what he is now) and rookie 19 year old Tatum.  And Kyrie was hurt, but Cleveland still had Love.  Forget teams, who are the best players Lebron had to go thru to get to the finals?  Everyone knows stars win playoff series.   Most of the stars he beat were either really young (D Rose 22, PG 22,23) or really old (Celtics Big 3 was 35).   Its just a bunch of borderline ""stars"" like Derozen, Lowrey, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, David West, Luol Deng. I'm sure I'm missing some, but its a pretty weak cast.  Basically, how many series has Lebron ever won where his supporting cast was actually worse than the other team's best players supporting cast?  2, maybe 3?  To compare, KD went nuts, but Brooklyn lost because he had to face a 2x MVP with 2 other all- stars.  Luka went nuts and they lost b/c he played a 2x champ and top 3 guy in the league in Kawhi plus prime PG and a good supporting cast (compared to 22 year old PG with David West, Hibbert, Lance etc but Lebron had Wade and Bosh).   Trae went nuts and beat Philly.  Embiid is way better than anyone Lebron ever beat in the East. and Philly is better than almost all the teams he ever beat.   Joker went nuts, but ran into a team who had 3 guys who are better than his 2nd best guy.  Dame went nuts, but he faced the league MVP.  This is all just this year.  The point is, a lot of stars have had great playoff series and lost, so nobody gives them credit or remembers them for ""dragging a less talented roster"" b/c they ran into great players/ teams.  Lebron just lucked out that when his team was sub-par, the competition was bad.  And when he won, his team was significantly more talented.  How many playoff series has Lebron ever won since he went to miami where his teammate wasn't the best player in the series (other than him)?  A lot of times he had the 2 best players.  Miami he had the 2 best guys in every series other than Chicago with Rose.  15 and 16 with Cleveland every series until the finals he had the 2 best guys in most of those series (prime love is better than Derozen, Horford etc).  Lakers nobody yet (AD best non bron player).   So 2007 Detroit is like the only series Lebron won en route to the finals where his teammate wasn't the best player other than him in the series.  And most of those he had the 2 best guys too."
Jae Crowder
Chris Paul  Jae Crowder  Clippers  Uh oh
"Can't decide who I want to win a ring more between Galo, Jae Crowder, and Brook Lopez"
"I don't think players like Jae Crowder is going to do much to fix the Wolves defense. Rim protectors are so much more impactful than wing defenders, and Myles Turner is one of the best while also being able to knock down the occasional 3. Rim protection takes away by far the best shot in the game, the layup and dunk. With Kat being able to play on the perimeter, I don't see how Myles Turner would be a bad enough fit that we don't try to trade for him. He would impact this team more positively than negatively."
"you need a shot creating PG to get buckets while LeBron and AD rest - Schroder didn't look great in the playoffs but I could see running him back one more time unless their is a cheap upgrade. someone mentioned Dinwiddie, who could be ok, although I think kind of a lateral move  but agree w/ you, you need some solid 3nD PF guy. Someone like Jae Crowder would be absolutely perfect. he's signed for another year and no way the Suns move on form him, but exactly that type of player would put the Lakers over the top. I could see a beneficial swap where a rebuilding team has a nice veteran role player and is willing to take a gamble on a Kuzma reclamation project  idk if this counts, but I'd also get rid of almost all these replacement level big guys and make AD play the 5 more while downsizing at the 4 (again, Jae Crowder type). you just aren't gaining anything by having Drummond or Marc Gasol on the roster"
"someone else posted about trading for Turner. I don't love the fit next to Towns. a good PF next to towns can either space the floor at an elite level, or provide great team defense next to KAT (ideally perimeter based, like a Jae Crowder type). Turner is a good shot blocker, but not good enough at pnr to be a viable fit at PF. I think he just clogs up our offensive and defense more, would not want  Bagley is interesting. I'm not super high on him, but if he's cheap I'd definitely roll the dice on him. I can see him at some point in his career turning in a solid role player, only problem is I doubt the Wolves organization or team culture is really the right place for that to happen. he probably needs to strong vet mentorship"
Jae Crowder
"I know you didn't just say JAE CROWDER is going to gaurd Giannis LMAO  he isn't. And good luck putting ayton on giannis. Giannis is not jokic. Hes gonna attack the paint.   So giannis will either score , or ayton will foul him.  Suns are barely beating the clippers who are missing Kawhi...... Their whole run has been a shit load of luck.  Let's see if they stay lucky  Also, Holiday is gonna be best defender cp3 has seen so far.  So far he's been gaurding by an INJURED kcp, a small Dennis Schroeder. And the Nuggets and clippers do not have good defense from their guards.  Booker has been getting locked up by Patrick Beverly who's defense wasn't even good for a long ass time.. now he will be guarded by Kris Middleton? Lmao we shall see"
Well i just think nurse is a superior tactical coach that has coached up talent to play far above expectations. The raptors last season had no business being as good as they were. I don‚Äôt really believe it‚Äôs fair to evaluate a coach baseed on whether hes made the finals because a lot of the time that‚Äôs related to personnel. Would lue have made the finals with those Celtics teams? Brad took a team with Jae crowder as its second best player to the playoffs and horford as its second best player to the ECF.
"Something about CP3 getting a ring, or even to the finals finally, in a postseason where every team he faced was heavily compromised by injuries is kind of fitting.   I just don't like Jae Crowder so i'm hoping it doesn't happen."
"&gt;Deandre is an anchor on defense which doesn‚Äôt always show up in stats. Not even contested shots would show up. KAT is obviously better from a skillset standpoint on offense by a large margin but what Ayton provides to his team on defense is astronomical to their success.   And you don't think the Wolves would have been a top seed if you gave KAT Jae Crowder,Booker,CP3 and Mikal Bridges?"
"Yeah I don‚Äôt get that.  Who on the Suns is cocky?  CP3 is pretty humble, and Ayton is extremely humble. Maybe like Jae Crowder lol? I‚Äôm not even a Suns fan but I don‚Äôt get that.  Clippers have cockier players in Boogie and Pat Bev"
Suns. Jae Crowder gonna give Giannis nightmares about the bubble and CP3 gonna have the series of his life.
"Didnt Lebron himself proclaim he was healthy and said ‚ÄúThese shoulders were built for this‚Äù  Personally I‚Äôm of the opinion that if you declare yourself healthy beforehand, and then when youre winning, you go out of your way to humiliate Jae Crowder, you‚Äôre healthy. You cant then go back after you lose pretending you were injured all along."
"When LeBron was clowning Jae Crowder in G3 and Reddit became a ""Lakers in 5"" hivemind, I don't recall hearing about how hobbled he was.  Only when they started losing."
Are you comparing Jae Crowder to PG?
Oh yeah and that game winning pass by Jae crowder to Ayton for a dunk
Boogie was starting shit with Jae Crowder at the line the second he checked in too... lol 6 seconds left coulda easily been T'd up!
"Injured forward Abdel Nader yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go!‚Äù Sharpshooter Jae Crowder gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Devin Booker yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Chris Paul hit the locker room door, former NBA great Charles Barkley hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Jae Crowder has been so crucial this run
jae crowder loves just rippin bricks
If Jae Crowder wasn‚Äôt 0-8 this game would be in the bag lol
True but has anyone not named Jae crowder missed
Apparently Jae Crowder has missed all 7 of his shots.
don't forget jae fucking crowder
"Jae Crowder stats so far 0 points 0-7 shooting, 0 assists, 1 block, 2 TOs, 8 rebounds"
Finals Jae Crowder is a bottom 50 player in the NBA
"Somehow, Jae Crowder finds his way to another Finals"
Refs hate Jae Crowder I guess
Jae Crowder going off
Jae Crowder is fucking garbage at offense
That‚Äôs NBA legend Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder... has the most Finals experience on the floor? üòÇüò¨
Jae Crowder is the living embodiment of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather go 0-30‚Äù meme
That Airball on behalf of Jae Crowder gave me secondhand embarrassment
Y‚Äôall see Jae Crowder walk straight to the Bucks bench after the buzzer üòÇ petty af
Stupid suns. Should‚Äôve let Jae ‚ÄúHalf-court specialist‚Äù Crowder take that last shot
"That was a bad 3 even for Jae ""Chuck It"" Crowder"
Jae Crowder needs to stfu. Dude fouls on every play and then airballs
Jae crowder doesn't know how not to flop
Jae Crowder is a certified Bucks killer‚Ä¶hopefully Kaminsky can lose the Finals like he lost the Badgers the National Title (for real though he was a great Badger)
Jae Crowder too
"For a guy that has been shipped team to team and has yet to win anything, Jae Crowder sure does talk a lot of shit."
Jae Crowder is thicc
Was Jae Crowder always this much of a flop? Or is it the CP3 effect?
jae crowder ftw
Nah Jae Crowder was pushing Giannis before lol
lol jae crowder. this is some terrible officiaiting.
jae crowder flop
[lmao yes](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6vexar/charania_cleveland_and_boston_have_agreement_on/)  It was an overpay for a disgruntled Kyrie:  * An All-Star who had just come top 5 in MVP voting * The most valuable pick in the league * One of the best contracts in the league * A euro-prospect who was getting a lot of hype   Would you pay:  * Beal * Houston's 2022 FRP * Jae Crowder * A hyped euro pickup  Especially while Kyrie is working hard to tank his value and refusing to show up to training camp.
The Bucks missing shots is because they don‚Äôt have someone like Jae ‚Äúonly player with previous Finals experience‚Äù Crowder to lean on
"Finals Jae Crowder for you guys... Also, why the fuck is Saric on the court when Giannis is out there? Monty is dumb..."
Reverse Jae Crowder
over/under on how many times they‚Äôre going to mention that jae crowder is the only one with finals experience?
I'm so happy that the best free agent acquisition in the Finals is Brook Lopez/Jae Crowder
"For a 3 and D type player, Jae Crowder sure is ass at 3s and defense."
"Look at Jae Crowder out there, back-to-back Finals appearances"
Looking forward to the inevitable PJ Tucker vs Jae Crowder fist fight üëäüèº
How dare you disrespect international superstars *checks rosters* Jae Crowder and Brook Lopez
Jae Crowder was looking like Dame the other day in practice
Makes sense. Jae Crowder had a similar experience ‚Äî he played two games and posted two triple doubles haha. Guys who are legit at this level don‚Äôt spend long there I guess
"Game 7, 4th quarter, score tied, Bucks lineup exhausted, and Jae Crowder throws Giannis a Senzu bean. Bucks go on a 13-0 run. During a final minute timeout, when questioned about his mind boggling decision, Crowder mumbled something about ‚Äúteaching him humility‚Äù. The decapitated head of Mikhail Bridges nodded in agreement. Crowder steps out of the way to reveal an infuriated Devin Booker.   ‚ÄúLet it go‚Äù cooed Mikhail as his eyes went white.  Devin wails out in anger and re-enters the court. Bucks go on a 7-0 run to seal the game."
"Isaiah Thomas and Rondo for the Celtics. We also have love for guys like Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk."
"'11 the only guy we really lost was Chandler, and he took less money per year than we offered to get a longer contract. After that, Kidd left the season before he retired. Butler never really recovered from the injury. Marion and Terry looked pretty washed after they left. There wasn't a good option there.  More obscure what if: What if we kept  Jae Crowder/Jameer Nelson. That was a really interesting team that fell off the map after that trade."
Happy birthday!   But fuck Jae crowder
I don‚Äôt think Jae Crowder was the sole reason that Giannis struggled against the heat.
"I am super satisfied with the Finals this year, I like both teams quite a lot.  Antics aside, I am rooting for CP3 to finally get one, and Jae Crowder is my guy as a former Celtic.  And it's hard not to like Giannis &amp; Jrue, and even though he's literal nightmare fuel for the Celtics it's pretty awesome that Khris Middleton has taken himself from the G-League to the NBA Finals."
"Oh cool, I share a birthday with Jae Crowder!"
&gt; Crowder   ...Who hates Jae Crowder???
"I am. I'd be fine with the Suns winning (and would be legitimately happy for CP3) but I love Giannis, like the Bucks a lot, and (as a salty Cavs fan) am not all that interested in Jae Crowder getting a ring."
Jae Crowder
"Well technically Jae crowder also played in that game, and he is now a Sun"
Give him a Sun Stone and he becomes Jae Crowder
"yeah your starting five is easily among the best in the league  no weak points at all, when mikal bridges and jae crowder are your worst starters you are in a damn good spot"
"I swear Jae Crowder, PJ Tucker, and Danny Green just pick a random playoff team every year lol"
I was playing MyCareer and the Suns traded Jae Crowder to the Nuggets and they went on to face us in the WCF for 3 straight years. Hated dropping a 70 point quadruple-double on that man.
Jae Crowder was the difference between Miami getting swept in the first round this year and beating the Lakers in the finals this year.
Celtics legend Jae Crowder
"Yea, I‚Äôm thinking guys like Kyrie and some of those champion level role players like Jae Crowder can push it forward. Maybe AD too? I wonder who the youngest player he has played with that could be seen in finals games years from now. Maybe if Talen Horton-Tucker (aged 20) can find himself on the bench of a perennial contender, maybe he can keep it alive lol!"
Jae Crowder versus PJ Tucker.
"It looks like Jae Crowder may have in Cleveland 2017-2018. He was also there last year, but then again, so was LeBron himself lol."
"Yes, significantly. That said, don‚Äôt let Capela‚Äôs 6‚Äô10‚Äù deceive you, he plays like a 7-footer.  Also, there is a good chance Jae Crowder/Torrey Craig/Dario Saric end up guarding Lopez with DA assigned to Giannis."
Other than Jae Crowder I think this is the first finals trip for literally everyone on both teams.
James Harden  Trevor Ariza  Jae Crowder  DeAndre Jordan
"Can't let you get away here. The locker room was toxic and they did well to cleanse it. But I watched every cavs game that season and those traded players soon fell off quite a bit after some early hype wins against the celtics and the thunder   Clarkson was not the same that he is right now. Hill was solid enough and hood was very inconsistent. Those oladipo pacers were good. Oladipo was a speed demon that season , before he fell into the injury hole and those celtics gave a really tough time to the league all throughout the regular season with their defense bult on Jalen , Jayson , horford, smart and Morris   Fact is LeBron was All time All time that season. He is partly to blame because maybe if he kept the locker room under control , the original Cavs squad with Dwayne wade , derrick rose , jae crowder could have given him better support in the playoffs with their experience"
"Jae Crowder will be the most experienced finals player on the court, just as we all predicted"
You had Jae Crowder on your team top 5 dirtiest player in the NBA and biggest crybaby at that.
"It's starting to look like he's lost his spot on our team but he's not nearly as bad as our sub treats him.   His biggest problem is that he's too passive. If a team can get him to come out of his shell consistently he could be a nice rotation piece.   ***  **Shooting:**   From a 3P shooting standpoint, he was as accurate and as frequent as Jae Crowder was for us over his last 2 seasons in Boston, he just played a smaller role.    | 3P%| 3PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi| 36.7 | 6.0 Jae (2015-17) | 36.9| 5.9   The issue is Jae scored a lot more off everything else. He was a much better cutter and more active scorer overall. Semi is too passive outside of his shooting.     | 2P%| 2PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi | 49.2| 2.4 Jae (2015-17)| 53.4| 6.0  ***  **Defence:**   Semi has an incredible defensive body: 6'6, 240lbs, good vert, great lateral quickness, good wingspan, absurd strength and a lot of that strength is in his lower body.    You'll legitimately see power forwards bounce off him. He's the immovable object we often play when dealing with an unstoppable force.   Last season we had a good example against the Knicks. Randle was getting to the rim at will powering through everyone on our roster. We subbed in Semi. Randle bounced off Semi once or twice. Randle stopped trying to drive towards the rim.    The issue again is his passiveness. He's too much of a gentle giant. He's great at using his strength to absorb contact, but he doesn't use that strength to bully anyone.  You see it in the stats, he has a low foul rate (considering the role we have him in) but he just doesn't take any risks [\(eg. 0 blocks all season\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndzqlt/semi_ojeleye_finished_the_season_with_zero_0/)   ***   **Culture:**  You're not going to get anyone less drama-prone. His workouts are the most famous thing about him:   &gt; It sounded like a sledgehammer was hitting behind Al Horford's locker stall inside TD Garden and Boston‚Äôs veteran big man can feel the reverberations as he puts on his shoes. But Horford just smiles and shakes his head. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúI have a lot of faith in those concrete walls,‚Äù said Horford. &gt;  &gt; Boom. &gt;  &gt; These loud thuds became a familiar white noise in the Celtics locker room after games this season. But, by late April, it felt like the noise was getting louder. Marcus Morris‚Äô stall is a safe distance from the epicenter but even he couldn't help but notice the decibel level.  &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúShem, god damn,‚Äù said Morris.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Further across the room, Terry Rozier heard the noise but always figured it was just part of the perpetual construction happening around the Garden. Gordon Hayward, who is as far from the pounding as possible, was more aware of what was happening in the adjoining weight room.   &gt;...  &gt;Those booms were a medicine ball that Ojeleye had repeatedly launched into a wall as part of a CrossFit-like routine that Celtics rehab and performance coordinator Zach Markowitz had designed for Ojeleye on nights he doesn‚Äôt get into game action.  &gt;https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/semi-ojeleyes-wall-rattling-workouts-have-readied-him-giannis-antetokounmpo   So if you want someone who's just going to turn up and work without stepping on anyone's toes, that's Semi in a nutshell. But you're not going to hear reports about him holding players accountable or taking a vocal role in the locker room.   ***  The big issue with Semi is that he just doesn't do enough to justify a roster spot atm. It's not an abundance of lowlights that holds him back, it's a lack of highlights.  You'd be happy with everything he provides, if only he was providing more.  Put him on a team like Brooklyn where Harden can feed him corner 3s and he'll have vets like Green (and potentially Tucker) pushing him to be more aggressive defensively and maybe he could be a really nice piece."
Out of those 3 teams Giannis had his worst games against the Hawks during the regular season. He played really good against both the Suns and the Nets. I wouldn‚Äôt really trust Jae Crowder with being the one to save the Suns from Giannis. He hasn‚Äôt had that great of a playoff run starting with what LeBron was doing to him in the first round. The series is definitely going to be more of a test of what Ayton can really do.
"Jae can defend Giannis really well though, idk I don‚Äôt think Giannis has as much success as he did vs the Nets and Hawks PF‚Äôs.  I think this will definitely be much less efficient Giannis than we‚Äôve seen lately whether Ayton or Crowder is the primary defender."
Now do Jae Crowder
Capela led the league in rebounds and Collins really reminds me of Kevin Love. Like a stretch 4 that has a nose for the ball. Ayton is a force but Jae Crowder ain't outrebounding the Bucks where pretty much everyone is 6'9
Its funny that Jae Crowder could be Lebron's best teammate. He doesn't care if he's 0-8 he'll keep on shooting. He's such a streaky shooter he'll eventually make them.
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
Have you not seen Devin bookers face? Or Jae crowder? Or Chris Paul with the flopping? Not saying I hate em but there‚Äôs plenty of dislike-able characters over there
"The way things change. A month and a half ago, we were super unlucky for drawing the 7th seed Lakers in the first round, so unlucky that we were underdogs. THEN CP3 injured his shoulder and after game 3 everyone counted us out. It took a bounce-back half and AD overcompensating for his already hurt knee for us to get it together and start blowing out the Lakers.   Then the narrative went from ""AD and Lebron are going to the Finals again, Schroder is in Booker's head, Drummond is a monster, Jae Crowder is a bitch"" to ""Suns are so lucky AD went down, Lebron can't win with Schroder KCP Drummond and Kuzma, fake ring, Lakers in 5 if AD never gets injured.""  It's one thing to say ""well the Lakers would have put up a better fight if AD doesn't get injured."" It's another thing to say ""Suns never stood a chance"" and always ignore that CP3 was useless for the first 3 games.   Then after we beat the Lakers it's ""The Nuggets don't even need Murray, Jokic is the MVP for a reason, Ayton can't guard him, MPJ is a monster.""  After we beat the Nuggets it's ""Nuggets would have destroyed the Suns with Murray, if MPJ doesn't hurt his back Nuggets take a few games.""   Then we're matched up with the Clippers -- who we've KNOWN are gonna be without Kawhi for weeks now -- and it's ""Clippers in 6, Ty Lue will coach circles around Monty, and CP3 is out with covid, Suns don't stand a chance.""  After we win, it's ""Clippers are head and shoulders above the Suns, they gave them a fight WITHOUT Kawhi"" and then don't bring up CP3's illness, Booker's nose, Cam Payne's ankle.  It's just funny how we went from ""the unluckiest path to the finals"" to ""the easiest path to the finals, mickey mouse run"" because of who lost. Every time it's saltiness."
"I upvoted you, and you turned out to be right. Your prediction was before the Oladipo trade, which seems to have been a big factor, a lot of people pointing to missing Jae Crowder. Bam and Jimmy also didn't seem right in the playoffs for whatever reason. Hopefully, Pat Riley comes up with something this offseason, and the young guys add some skills."
"Individual player history plays into how we perceive player actions, specifically refs. Giannis is a stand-up dude, clean record. So he gets the benefit of the doubt for a questionable play.  If Raja Bell, Zaza Paculia or Ron Arrest did something it would be seen as dirty.  If Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder or if PJ Tucker did something it would be seen as accident due to their tough defense play style."
"No. Giannis gets reduced from a superstar to a star every post season when they play a team that can keep him from the rim. They nearly got swept last year against the Heat with Crowder. You stop Giannis (all you need is adequate rim protection and a defender big, strong, and athletic enough to keep him from the rim, i.e. Jae Crowder), then it‚Äôs your team vs Khris Middleton. If you have any real star power then the series is over. It‚Äôs how the Bucks have failed every single year because at least a couple of teams are built like that.  The only difference between this year and every other year is the Bucks have played a hobbled Nets team with no rim protection and a hobbled Hawks team with no depth.  Barring injury, the Bucks don‚Äôt really have a chance"
Jae Crowder. Never forget. üò®
"But they wouldn't. They're a VERY deep team and have won a lot of games where book and cp3 were either out or absolutely awful these playoffs because they have great depth. Cam Payne, ayton (ik he's not a depth piece but the point stands) cam Johnson, jae crowder and like four other guys on the roster are capable of putting up numbers when needed."
Jae Crowder.
Jae crowder has been before so no
"Suns/Lakers, I was so goddamn nervous the entire time, such a stressful series that culminated in just a total beat down of LA where Jae Crowder salsa danced to cap it off. It was just everything you wanted as a Suns fan including Book going for almost 50  Outside of that definitely Bucks/Nets, although only 2 games out of the series were actually classics, but my god were they classic"
"Same, they‚Äôre all pretty likable on both sides except Jae crowder can fuck off"
Fuck Jae Crowder
Dont forget about future Hall of Facial Expressions member Jae Crowder
Bucks cause Jae Crowder is a clown
It's a lot of interesting matchups. Jae Crowder can stick on Middleton. Lopez and Ayton will be interesting. If CP3 is elite and can shake Jrue or get him into foul trouble that could be the difference.
"If Jae Crowder can fuck off, I‚Äôm mostly neutral to the outcome of the series."
"I half like the suns  I like Ayton, Monty, Book, Bridges but at the same time fuck Chris Paul dirty ass, Jae Crowder fake tough guy, and Oscar award nominee Cameron Payne"
He should win Finals MVP if Milwaukee wins tonight or Game 7. Jae Crowder is a former Celtic.
"Definitely agree. But this Suns team added Chris Paul who‚Äôs playing as good as ever still, they added Jae Crowder, and even Torrey Craig has gotten some playoff minutes.   Still incredibly impressive"
You could get Denzel to play Jae Crowder and Bruce Greenwood could play Dario Saric
This cannot be true for a team that has Jae Crowder on it.
"Lol yeah cp3's dirty plays are limited to college.. totally bro  Jae crowder legit had two dirty plays in this damn series. Lemme guess you gonn defend him too, right?"
"Personally, I would give him 5 games for the intent and a deterrent for anyone else. That being said, I'm wondering why Booker didn't get shit for shoving Schroder midair. Potentially more dangerous and intent was definitely there too. Give Jae Crowder a suspension while you're at it too"
I will not recognize Jae Crowder as a NBA champion.
Jae Crowder finals MVP is seeming more realistic as the days go by
"&gt; Clamped by jae crowder  Oh this again huh. Delusional ass troll.  &gt;ayton is ridiculous he's better than anyone on the lakers outside of anthony davis, why would you even disrespect the suns when they just clowned you  He‚Äôs not doing shit without a PG...  &gt;says the guy who is apparently unironically claiming the lakers go ""12 deep"" when they cant survive losing a single starter  ‚ÄúStarter,‚Äù also known as Anthony Davis.  Against a 2 seed."
Jae Crowder was not drafted by the Celtics.
"If we‚Äôre doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We‚Äôre lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can‚Äôt think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I‚Äôm leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
"Your points on Giannis‚Äôs playmaking and post game improvement are well taken, but the biggest problem with the Suns building a wall is they don‚Äôt have the personnel. You need three guys with one of them playing tight defense on him before he initiates his drive, that‚Äôs why the Raptors were so good at it, they had Kawhi on him in the front and Serge and Gasol waiting on the back line, that‚Äôs two DPOY‚Äôs and another very stout defender. The Heat wall wasn‚Äôt nearly as effective because of their lack of personnel, they were able to limit him somewhat but he was also injured in that series. Jae Crowder and Ayton do an admirable job but neither of them are in the same tier as Bam defensively."
Ayton and Jae Crowder are definitely qualified personnel to make a wall.  The Nets were actually somewhat successful at making a wall defense with Blake Griffin and whatever other forward was on the floor when the Bucks couldn‚Äôt make a shot during the first couple games in that series.  It‚Äôs mainly big and somewhat mobile bodies. The wall can only truly be successful if the other side players can‚Äôt do anything though
Jae Crowder and Ayton?
Yeah. The few bad calls are the ones suns fans remember when most were fine. The weird one for me was when he ran over crowder in the lane and got a blocking foul. Jae was just standing there and wasn‚Äôt even looking at him
"Lob city. One of the biggest weaknesses of those teams were the lack of quality wing players (Paul Pierce, Lance Stephenson, Wesley Johnson, etc.) If you gave prime CP3, prime Blake and DJ the wings the suns have now? Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, Bridges, Craig? Any of those 4 would be a starting SF for those teams.   Would anyone be surprised if these suns big 3 with the lob city supporting cast couldn‚Äôt get more than a 4 seed in a typical year?"
"Without looking at numbers I want to say he‚Äôs shooting better from the free throw line this series. Also, based off of measurables(size, strength, lateral quickness) Blake Griffin matched up with Giannis much better than Jae Crowder and DeAndre Ayton"
Cam Johnson &amp; Jae Crowder taking turn on ISO‚Äôs in the low post.
"And guys are allowed to play him more aggressively too. Jae Crowder has 2 hands on him holding every single possession. He gets away with stuff but guys also get away with stuff on him. If he got the touch fouls guys like Harden gets, He‚Äôd shoot well over 20 FTs a game."
"They need role players, I doubt that guys like Jae Crowder and Jarrett Allen even got invites. The whole roster of scorers thing only works when it‚Äôs the best guys in the league."
"No calls on that run you‚Äôre talking about are part of what I‚Äôm referring to, as well as some bad calls, like when Giannis literally ran over Jae Crowder and Jae Crowder got called for the foul. Even JVG called that one out."
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
I'm upset that we wasted a good Jae Crowder shooting night on that loss lol
"I just want to point out that the Suns had a slightly higher FG%. Booker obviously didn‚Äôt shoot well, but Ayton and Paul were very efficient, especially in the first half. And Jae Crowder went 6/7 from 3."
"If you compare what he did, to what they allowed to Bucks to do, IE Giannis literally straight blind siding Crowder and somehow Jae picking up the foul, then almost all of them were undeserving."
"He is 3 and D  Also if not him choose from a ton of role players like Jae Crowder, Danny Green, DFS etc"
Lmao gtfo here with that shit Giannis literally trucked over Jae Crowder and Jae got called for a foul. Giannis is SPOILED ROTTEN by the refs. All he does is play physical and crash into others and get away with a level of physicality that nobody else gets away with in this era but him. Look at the way he lowered his shoulder and tackled Torrey Craig the other day to the point where TC had to be carried off the court. There were Bucks fans saying even THAT wasn't an offensive foul lmao. That's how spoiled you guys are.   Dude is at the point where he has no regard for crashing into others and risking injury of others or himself because he knows he's going to get the benefit of the whistle 90% of the time and that physicality he gets away with is his bread and butter. Without it he's infinitely more guardable. But how can anyone be expected to guard someone that big and that athletic if he's allowed to bully you physically and you can't be physical back at all?  And it's probably going to be what leads to his downfall. He may be a freak of nature but he's not invincible. Don't be surprised if he gets injured bad some day on one of these reckless plays.
"Whew! I just know I had the face crack of the century reading the words ""Jae Crowder had to guard Giannis"".   I think this might be the first answer mentioning the back up bigs being hurt so thank you. That's pretty important lol"
"All the Suns back up bigs are hurt. So when Ayton got into foul trouble, Jae Crowder had to play the 5, guard Giannis, and precede to lose the game"
There were some bad ones like the one where he knocks over crowder and the foul was on Jae (when Jae was just standing still)   But yes overall idk about complaining about refs on this one. Giannis beasted and feasted on the mini-Suns line up
I suppose in that scenario we have to assume Jae Crowder hits 6 of 7 from 3 every game too?
"Tell Jae Crowder what he‚Äôs supposed when he is standing, Giannis steamrolls him offball. Both fall. And Scott Foster watching the whole thing.. doesn‚Äôt give Giannis his second foul in the 1q. That was a game changer."
"I think it's interesting to look at some player examples too. Jae Crowder takes over 70% of his shots from 3 and almost no midrangers at all. His shot chart has completely transformed from even the role players of 10 years ago.  On the other hand, if you compare Kawhi and Kobe by shot distance, they take essentially the same number of mid range shots."
To be fair I‚Äôve stayed strong driving the hate bus on Jae Crowder for years now
"You're totally discounting training camps and preseason and acting like AD had all that time off. The Lakers won the title on October 11, and training camps opened on December 1st. Meanwhile AD had been playing through [an injury he got in Game 5 of the Finals](https://youtu.be/M--IRVucDW8) which in retrospect looks suspiciously like it was tied into the right Achilles/calf strain he had this season. He never had a chance to fully rehab that injury, and that's why he came into camp out of shape. On top of that, because he never got to fully rest that injury it made it more likely for him to re-aggravate it.   As for Ayton and the rest of the Suns, training camps open on September 28, which is 78 days from today. Hopefully 36 year old Chris Paul, Jae Crowder with his second straight short off-season, and Devin Booker going right to the Olympics after this, will all get plenty of time to recover before then."
I don't think Jae Crowder has ever missed a three against the bucks
"Anyone got that Jae Crowder ""foul"" on Giannis?"
Lmao Jae Crowder is giving it right back he‚Äôs just not strong enough. Jae has 2 hands on him constantly.
"Yeah, but if anyone should have been in foul trouble today, it should have been Jae Crowder  He played way more physical than Ayton did today"
jae crowder scares me üò≥
"Damn, we wasted a Jae Crowder hitting his shots, game."
Jae Crowder needs help.
Jae Crowder needs help.
the suns really wasted the jae crowder game
"Jae Crowder wasted his hot shooting game on a 20 point blowout, this bodes well for Milwaukee."
Wasted an insane JAE Crowder game  Smh Suns
"Yeah jae crowder IMO is too good to be considered just a role player  he's not a star but he's only a few notches below that level, I'd put him somewhere in the top 50 or top 75 players in the league.  definitely a respectable place to be"
booker wont play this shit every game but also jae crowder wont shoot 6/7 from 3 point every game either  need jrue and khris to be consistently good for the bucks to have a chance this series
wow jae crowder is 6-7 from 3  love me some crowder
i'm sure cp3 still cares  jae crowder cares...players out there care...
"Dam Suns really wasted the ""Jae Crowder can't miss"" game on what looks to be a blowout loss"
Jae Crowder carrying
Jae Crowder cannot guard Giannis
Jae crowder really got called the giannis stopper like
As a Marquette fan it really bums me out that Jae Crowder is such a hoe
We wasted a good Jae crowder game smh
Damn we really wasted a good Jae Crowder game
Somebody has tested jae crowder in every series
Suns wasted their Jae Crowder game
Ur joking right  CP and Jae crowder.. enough said
Kia K: 5  Jae Crowder FG Attempts: 5  Jae Crowder 3 Point Attempts: 5  Chris Paul +/-: -5  Devin Booker Free Throw Attempts: 5  Devin Booker Rebounds: 5  Cameron Johnson FGs Made: 5  Cameron Payne Points: 5  PJ Tucker Points: 5  Giannis Antetokounmpo Assists: 5  Khris Middleton Assists: 5  Pat Connaughton Points: 5  Bucks Steals: 5
Remember that time Jae Crowder got knocked out by JR Smith.  Good times
Jae Crowder is the fakest pussy in the league
How many fights does Jae Crowder average per year lmao
I swear it‚Äôs a miracle that Jae Crowder doesn‚Äôt shoot like 75% from 3. It just seems like he never misses a wide open shot.
I wish Jae Crowder was on the bucks
Jae crowder is Klay Thompson when he‚Äôs not on Lebron‚Äôs team üòÇ
JAE CROWDER MY GOD
"Jae Crowder is the only person on either team that has ever been to a finals before, so no"
Is anyone other than Jae Crowder in the finals for the 2nd year in a row?
Between CP3 and Jae Crowder I just cannot cheer for the Suns. I love DBook and Ayton but the other 2 are such fucking babies lmao
Nice block from Jae Crowder
I'm not sure I've ever seen Jae Crowder miss a 3 point shot
Crowder always yelling it‚Äôs not a foul  We have eyes Jae
Crazy how Jae Crowder has never committed a foul in his life
"Poor Jae Crowder, dude got burned by a pass like 3 times on that play lol"
I don't like Jae Crowder as a person. He's always pushing/pulling/elbowing people.
It is impressive what the Bucks have done without crucial previous finals experience from the likes of Jae Crowder
Jae Crowder has never committed a defensive foul and no ref will ever convince him otherwise
"1 tech and Jae crowder is suspended a game, so watch for a double tech with him and thanasis or some stupid shit like that"
League needs to step in and make Jae Crowder play with mittens on
They didn‚Äôt pick Jae Crowder in lieu of Draymond. You‚Äôre listing all the draft picks they had that year (including their top five pick) and saying it was them or Draymond. Draymond was on the board late in the second round. They had multiple second round picks and could have easily used it for Draymond.
"For anyone who thinks Suns fans are doing normal complaining about referees: That's not what's happening here.  Foster was Tim Donaghy's [betting bestie](https://www.google.com/amp/s/boston.cbslocal.com/2012/06/01/scott-foster-recipient-of-134-tim-donaghy-phone-calls-refereeing-celtics-heat-game-3/%3famp) ‚Äî you know, the guy who literally went to jail for fixing games *against the Suns* and said repeatedly and plainly he wasn't the only dirty referee. Donaghy called Foster more than even the bookie.  This isn't just ancient history, either: Foster also gave Jae Crowder a [phantom technical](https://www.google.com/amp/s/arizonasports.com/story/2700743/suns-win-breaks-losing-streak-of-chris-paul-teams-refereed-by-scott-foster/amp/) that puts Jae at 5 in the playoffs. At 7, you're suspended a game. That gives Foster the power to not only double-tech and eject, but suspend the Suns' starting forward in the following game.  Game 2 of the Clippers series‚Äîthat one that the last few minutes took a half hour‚Äîwas, shall we say, very, very, very generous to LA. The Suns won despite that because of George's missed free throws and one of the best inbound plays of all time.  And it's not just Suns fans that think this: The announcement of the refereeing crew was immediately reflected in Vegas odds.  Scott Foster should be rotting in jail, not calling fouls on the teams and players he hates, in order to extend the series, so the NBA can undermine their own sport to make more money.  As a fan, I try to give referees the benefit of the doubt in general, as they're humans with a tough job, but we have been robbed so many times by actual went-to-jail conspiracies that *implicated this guy specifically*, that, *at minimum*, even if for appearances' sake, Scott Foster should not be calling this game. It's not like he's the only referee available."
"Dirtiness of the clippers loool, I don‚Äôt hear anybody bringing up Jae crowder purposely poking PG in the eye, or when he reached out and tripped batum but ok! I‚Äôm telling you man, suns fans have no place to talk shit this off-season, y‚Äôall gotta keep your heads down and keep it pushing until they play someone real"
"Jordan played against mailmen, he can‚Äôt guard Jae Crowder"
Lennox Lewis kind of looks like Jae Crowder?
Jae Crowder is a bum who played like doo doo for the Cavs in 2018. Then when he got traded he blamed LeBron like it was LeBron‚Äôs fault that he bricked all those open shots. He‚Äôs washed idgaf what his plus minus is. This bum crying ‚ÄúLeBron cost me a shot to go to the Finals.‚Äù
usa need jae crowder
"Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton"
"Most of the players on the Suns have never been the playoffs before, and none of them except Jae Crowder have ever been to the Finals before.   It‚Äôs doable without the experience."
I didn‚Äôt disagree that they chose poorly I was just answering a question. Also Jae crowder was a good selection
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul  4. Khris Middleton  5. Jrue Holiday  6. De‚ÄôAndre Ayton  7. Mikal Bridges  8. Brook Lopez  9. Jae Crowder  10. Pat Connaughton  11. Cameron Payne  12. PJ Tucker
"Cavaliers selected 4 people, with the 4th pick Dion waters, with the 24th Jared Cunningham, the 33rd Bernard James, and the 34th Jae Crowder. None of these guys only played for one year, Jared and Bernard have been on NBA teams, G league and non American teams. Dion waters apart from this year has been in the NBA. Jae crowder was in the G league in 2014. Also Bernard, Jae and Jared were all traded away to Dallas for Tyler Zeller. Who lasted for more than year on various different NBA teams."
"It's literally just scoring points differential unless you have a large enough sample size. It is meant to measure the amount of points generated vs points the other team scores when you are on the floor vs not. If you look at the Suns side, with all their positive players, the stat is telling you that Jae Crowder is worth 14.5 more points than when he isn't on the floor, but the reason people don't like this is it ignores who Crowder is on the floor with. So if Crowder plays 10 minutes and during those 10 minutes, the Suns outscore the Bucks by 15, even if he had no points, he's still going to be a +15 by virtue of being on the floor even if he had nothing to do with the actual generation of those points. Conversely, the more minutes a player plays, the lower that score will obviously be because they will be on the floor more as the score fluctuates.   Tl;Dr It measures how much your team outscores the opponent while you're on the floor vs not."
Jae only has 5 techincals this postseason.        Source: https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jae-crowder-player-stats?seasonType=post&amp;category=misc
"&gt;  but why couldn't a team take a chance on him late first?  He did not put up monster numbers even as a senior.  Him and Jae Crowder both had the issue of it was hard to see him improving a lot more, so they both slid."
"I think Chris and Jae crowder have built reputations as incredible leaders but also have strained relationships along the way. The suns being a group of young guys (book, ayton, bridges, cam), with role players that were given up on and have a chip in their shoulder (Galloway, saric, Craig, Payne) led by two grizzly veterans, one who‚Äôs an all time great floor general and one who‚Äôs a jack of all trades glue guy (cp3 and Jae) allows for all parties to flourish without the past being an issue. This group of guys was able to come together and move toward."
as a cavs fan 2018 playoff crowder.... specifically finals crowder i don't wanna hear jae crowder praise either smh
"It was definitely a con at one point because those guys weren't able to truly defend a position. They were either too small to defend and rebound against PF and not always quick enough to stay in front of perimeter guys. Jae Crowder was a pretty well regarded college defender but if you look at his scouting report, there were doubts about what position he would guard. He's a pretty recent example, the earlier SF/PF than Crowder were definitely dinged for it when the league valued size more.   https://www.nbadraft.net/players/jae-crowder/"
I never want to hear Jae Crowder slander again in my life
I seem to recall alot of people shitting on Jae Crowder but the last year has proven he‚Äôs worth it.
"Until we change this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings_draft_history  No. Booker, Ayton, Bridges, all drafted by the Suns (or traded for on draft night). They swung for the moon with the CP3 trade, in terms of committing to winning NOW. How many aging point guards provide what CP3 has been able to provide? It would be like if somehow in three years, at 35, people are questioning KDs production, and somehow we're able to land him without giving up Fox or Hali, and in this fantasy, Bagley has also started producing up to expectations (ala Ayton). And we hold onto R. Holmes. And Buddy commits to like a Ginobli type role. And 32 year old H. Barnes off the bench too (Jae Crowder type role).   None of these will happen, but in alternate reality, we have some hope."
"Combo forwards went from a con to a pro as the game modernized. Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, Rudy Gay, etc became more relevant players."
"The Bucks have had this same problem with their defense for literally years. Doesn't matter if it's Fred VanVleet, Jae Crowder, or Mikal Bridges: they're getting killed from 3 by opposing role-players every time."
Jae crowder was more motivating
Very similar in all honesty. A great ball dominant scorer in Booker  next to CP3. A fantastic rim running center in Ayton who can switch out and guard wings and guards effectively. Solid 3 and D weapons in Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder. Tho I must say the difference very much lies in those 3 and D wings. Bridges and Crowder are much more versatile than 0-12 and Tuck.
"Um‚Ä¶do they also look at the ref and complain in order to ‚Äúprotect their knees‚Äù do they kick out and fall on their back to ‚Äúprotect themselves‚Äù do they fall down on light contact to protect themselves nah they‚Äôre flopping, it‚Äôs like quintessential Chris Paul, and dont even get me started on Jae Crowder.   There‚Äôs more to skew than just FT numbers, the timing is everything and the Suns routinely benefit from calls at opportune moments in the game. They did it last game and they‚Äôve done it most the playoffs, Refs definitely been helping them out when it counts and thats been bigger for their success then you are acting like it is."
"Well a lot of it is because coming in they weren't those level of player or at least weren't considered that level of player by the league/media. Payne went to China and back. People laughed at the Suns reaching for Cam Johnson. Suns traded away ""the most valuable trade asset in the league"" in the unprotected Miami pick for Mikal Bridges, and even Ayton as the #1 pick has been dogged his whole career because he isn't a 6'7 Euro Point God. Plus Jae Crowder just carries a chip on his shoulder everywhere, he is a living Jordan meme."
Jae crowder straight up hugged Giannis then had the audacity to complain. Like their whole game plan was to make Giannis earn his points at the line.
You gonna forget Jae crowder? A pretty big loss
Relatively unchanged? Jae crowder is a huge missing piece and we are missing KO a lot.
Jae crowder for sure
uhhh Jae crowder does exist yk?
Losing Jae Crowder was a bigger loss than people realize I think. In our series last year he was a big difference maker.
Jae crowder was an underrated loss
"Jae Crowder was absolutely a massive loss, at least against the Bucks."
Who did the Heat replace Jae Crowder with?
anyone would be a fraud if you replace 30 minutes of Jae Crowder with 30 minutes of thoroughly washed Trevor Ariza.
Didnt know Jae Crowder and DJJ are the difference between an NBA finals berth and a 1st round exit
Also I miss Jae Crowder we should of payed him
Jae Crowder was apparently the X-Factor for them lol
The importance of Jae Crowder cannot be understated
"Casuals don't realize these bucks aren't the same team got spanked by Miami last year.  No Jae Crowder, regression across the board for Miami. replacing Bledsoe with Jrue."
Who doesn‚Äôt miss Jae Crowder
They miss Jae Crowder
"I think Gasol is just a little too old/slow to give Ayton too many issues, but if the Lakers decided to slot in Trez at the 4 and AD at the 5, that lineup would be really hard to beat.   Our second best rebounder is Torrey Craig and our two bigs off the bench (Saric and Kaminsky) simply can‚Äôt defend the paint or work the post consistently.   The Suns can pack the paint like they‚Äôve done effectively against Giannis and Embiid, but I really don‚Äôt like the prospects of that in a playoff series.   The Suns can pull it off if our wings get hot from 3. If Cam Johnson, Mikal Bridges, and Jae Crowder are hitting their shots, we‚Äôre very tough to beat."
Dude was getting boxed out by Jae Crowder. Embarrassing
Suns - 32.1%.    jae crowder: 0-7 or 0.0%  rest of the team: 9-21 or 42.9%  Jae will shoot better
&gt;Game was too close today  9 points isn't that super close. Game was pretty much over over in last 2 or so minutes.  &gt; poorly LA played  Chris Paul barely scored anything and Jae Crowder was 0-7 from the 3. With that being said... Lakers are still the favorites.
For a long time I thought that Jae Crowder was Jake Router
"He should get in line with all the other Lebron stoppers like Morris, Stanley Johnson, PJ Tucker and Jae Crowder"
Devin Booker has 0 (zero) playoff wins without Jae Crowder
Might be a brainfart but has jae crowder ever won sixth man of the year? Dude been a spark plug for every team he‚Äôs been on
As a Laker fan nothing is more frustrating than watching Jae Crowder box out Drummond and AD.
Bruh why did I think crowds was short for Jae Crowder at first
Jae Crowder is one of the most underrated players ever
this lineup is very dangerous. If jae crowder can continue to be solid this is a really tough lineup because they're great offensively and defensively. An elite closing lineup is cp3 is healthy.
Good to see my boy Jae Crowder make that shot
Jae Crowder is always on winning teams
"Jae Crowder guys, dude is something else"
AD letting Jae Crowder smother his ass
Miami misses Jae crowder
Lebron is a glorified Jae Crowder
"Why everytime I watch an NBA game, no matter the team Jae Crowder is on the court? ü§£ü§£"
Jae crowder is going to be this generations robert horry or something similar. He is an elite role player.
Jae Crowder that is NOT your game lol
"Man I miss Jae Crowder in a Jazz uniform.  Take care of him, Phoenix.  Also, Drummond is a human anchor on offense"
I miss Jae Crowder ‚òπÔ∏è
Nothing more Jae Crowder than having a 3 ruled a 2
jae fucking crowder
Jae 'Toe on the line' Crowder
jae crowder is so fucking valuable.
"Chris Paul, Jae Crowder and a bunch of kids"
How many times had Lebron knocked Jae Crowder out of the playoffs? I feel like Crowder has to be really sick of seeing his ass at this point.
Yeah stars with big contracts would just opt out and we‚Äôd just be watching Alex Caruso vs. Jae Crowder
"Neither Kemba nor Hayward were bad signings. No one could have known Jae Crowder would destroy Haywards ankle, or that Kemba would decline this hard this fast."
He's absorbed into Jae Crowder
Doesn‚Äôt Jae Crowder? ü§≠
I miss Jae crowder
With Jae Crowder no longer around we might be able to pull this off.
He took whatever Jae Crowder was on last year
"Chris Paul definitely made an improvement to their team, but to suggest that they wouldn't even make the playoffs is not even close to true. Everyone on that teams made big steps from Booker to Bridges to Ayton, and they acquired a good wing in Jae Crowder. The team as a whole is just solid.  This shows in their net rating (garbage time excluded):  Lineup | Off Rating | Def Rating | Net Rating ---------|----------|----------|---------- CP3 ON| 117 |111 | +6 CP3 OFF | 118 | 112 | +6   If CP3 is the difference between the 2 seed and missing the playoffs, we would see a huge discrepancy in net rating like we do with other top teams when their stars aren't on the floor.  UTAH  Lineup | Off Rating | Def Rating | Net Rating ---------|----------|----------|---------- Gobert ON| 120|104 | +16 Gobert OFF | 117 | 114 | +3   LAKERS  Lineup | Off Rating | Def Rating | Net Rating ---------|----------|----------|---------- LeBron ON| 116 |106 | +10 LeBron OFF | 108 | 111 | -3   PHILADELPHIA  Lineup | Off Rating | Def Rating | Net Rating ---------|----------|----------|---------- Embiid ON| 120 |107 | +13 Embiid OFF | 109 | 111 | -2"
"I don‚Äôt care if lebron plays or not, just pretty bullshit how the league decides when and who the rules apply to  Good luck having jae crowder or some shit get away with this"
Jae Crowder and Olynyk killed the bucks last year with their shooting hot streak
I haven't watched the heat much this season but how's dragic been? Him and Jae Crowder were absolutely crucial last time around.   Jrue's ability to create his own shot and his defence imo will be the deciding factor.
"Aah, I get your problem. You think his decision making ""fell apart easily."" Curry was the primary ball-handler and decision maker in almost all of their plays while carrying the scoring load. It's decision making every moment. The turnovers were either him taking chances or just having nowhere to go after having to force plays. He doesn't have to do that if they have guys like PJ Tucker in the corner or Jae Crowder always making the perfect cut to the basket.  It's difficult to imagine if you've never been the primary handler in a team full of mediocre shooters and off-ball movers, but the fact that he even managed to come this far with a mess of that system is insane."
"I mean, I love the guy, but IDK if I'd call Jae Crowder an all-time legend..."
"We gave up Iggy, Solomon Hill, and Jae Crowder.   None of those guys fit with our timeline. We can no pick up Winslow‚Äôs option this off-season and we are all set going forward with a decent amount of cap space."
Take a breath. I didn't call Wiggins a bitch or question his effort or anything. I recognize his limitations and the fact that he had a fatass contract and that the Warriors have the most expensive roster in NBA history.   Wiggins isn't the only problem. He's the biggest sign of the problems with the roster. He's a guy on a $30m/y that can't reliably score points and is a Tier 2 perimeter defender. He put in effort all year. He's solid.   He shouldn't be a team's second scoring option and he showed that all year and especially showed it down the stretch tonight. The loss is on a lot of things. Let's stop pretending Wiggins is even an All-NBA Third Teamer. He's a mediocre offensive slasher with high motor defense. In an ideal situation he''s Jae Crowder.
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"
Jae Crowder has got to be like a 100 of those games right?
"Rough list of things that comes to mind:  * Acquisition of jae crowder (replacing kelly ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù oubre)  * The rise of cameron payne as a high quality roleplayer  * Player development, most notably bridges and ayton  * Monty Williams moving dario from the starting 4 to backup 5, where he‚Äôs more comfortable offensively and defensively   * Vastly improved health. Last year, the suns had many positive indicators when they were healthy like win %, +/- data of their starting 5, and of course going 8-0 in the bubble. Ignoring all the other things in this list, they were setup for a big improvement just from being healthy. And the thing is, not only have they been *extremely* healthy, but leaguewide health has taken a huge dip, with more injuries from the shortened season and players missing time from covid protocol. Health has been HUGE for the suns.  * Last, obviously cp3 has helped quite a bit. It‚Äôs just when you consider all the improvements to the team, a huge upgrade in health, and the indicators last year of an upward trending team, I don‚Äôt see any reason to think cp3 has had MVP level impact."
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
Jae Crowder finally beating LeBron in the playoffs
Jae '2nd round' Crowder
can't wait for the jae crowder career ender
Fuck yeah Jae Crowder
JAE FUCKING CROWDER
Jae Crowder vs. LeBron. Who's the getting clowned now?
JAE CROWDER SAYING NOTHING BUT SINKING 3s OUT HERE
Jae Crowder is exorcising his demons rn lmao
jae crowder looks like. metapod
Celtics ü§ù Suns    Jae Crowder as a solid top 5 guy for a CF team
My old friend Jae Crowder makes me happy
Jae crowder putting this game away
Mikal Bridges?? Jae Crowder??
"&gt; ""Y‚Äôall beat an injured team""   One dude was injured lol.  &gt; Yea but you put Cousins like he was a decent player and he was barely a factor.  Nah he was just putting up a 16 ppg, 8 rpg, 3.5 apg, 1.5 bpg and 1 spg season. Not a threat at all! /s  &gt; but if Lakers ring doesn‚Äôt count, neither does Toronto‚Äôs  Lakers ring doesn't count. Only up against Butler and Bam who were All Stars for most of that series. We're talking two All-Stars versus two all time great players. Then they had to deal with a rookie starter (LOL), G-League 3rd Team Duncan Robinson (LMAO), an average player like Jae Crowder and third stringer Kelly Olynyk. Oh no! Very comparable to Curry, Green, Thompson, Cousins and Iguodala. /s"
jae crowder is worth his entire 30 million dollar contract in this one game
JAE CROWDER JUNKYARD DOGGGGG
If Jae Crowder shoulder checks lebron like that I guarantee he's gonna roll around on the floor like he got sniped
Jae Crowder has finally beaten his LeBad boys
I know.. He's out and LeCCP is losing by 20 pts to Jae Crowder.
this sub mocked jae crowder for being a bubble guppy and he's done nothing but torch the lakers since
Is Jae Crowder Lakers' new daddy?
Lakers fans deserve this. LeCCP deserves this.  Jae Crowder is your new dad.
Jae Crowder makes Eeyore look downright cheerful
Was Jae Crowder ‚Äúgenerally aware‚Äù of being shoved because that‚Äôs a flagrant technical accessory to commit a foul in 2021.
Lakers fans about to call the LAPD on Jae Crowder
"lolol ""fuck jae crowder"" chants lol"
Jae Crowder bout to bust the nut of his life tonight
Jae Crowder screwed both teams /s
They laughed at him but Jae Crowder was right.   Lakers ring last year is fake.
Defeating LeBron wouldn't be possible without Jae Crowder.
Make a difference? Sure. But they were the better team and I can accept that. You're making my point. We already know these excuses. AD wasn't going to do shit but shoot fadeaways on Jae Crowder.
Jae Crowder is doing good with us
remember a few days ago when lebron was torching jae crowder and the lakers bench was all laughing at them. that feels like a year ago
"well considering lebron and AD just came back from injury riddled seasons, and AD has been injured this series, while also having rondo and DG. meanwhile the bucks are completely a better team than miami and have since added jrue and PJ while the heat have lost valuable role players like jae crowder and other guys, I wouldn't say that's valid as the situation's have changed completely."
Lebron‚Äôs bullying transformed Jae Crowder into Ray Allen.
"Shoutout to Jae Crowder for his 3/3 from deep start too before a miss, pretty sure him and Booker are now a combined 9/10 from long range."
JAE CROWDER IS FINALLY GOING TO BEAT LEBRON JAMES IN A PLAYOFF SERIES
Jae Crowder is 3-3 on 3s and Kaminsky just got a block. Lakers fucked
I love jae Crowder. That is all
"I just want someone to punch Jae Crowder, not a huge ask. You guys look damn good."
Maybe Jae crowder really was the lebron stopper after all
Outside of Jae Crowder you can‚Äôt hate on this Suns team.
refs know they gotta foul out jae crowder in order for the lakers to have a chance
Oh they'll be going at him alright. The Jae Crowder special.
Lakers are done lmao. Jae 'the brick' Crowder is on fire
Jae Crowder from the Bucks series makes his return I see
"Jae ""Regression to the Mean"" Crowder"
Could use some of that close out game Jae Crowder energy üî•üî•üî•  *NBA Jam voice*   &gt;He's on fire!
Jae Crowder didn‚Äôt give a shit about what y‚Äôall had to say lmao
laker flaired crowder haters in shambles  go get em jae
"Suns came to play, esp Jae Crowder lol"
I‚Äôd rather get swept than get sent home by Jae fucking crowder
"Jae Crowder to Lebron: who's laughing now, bitch?"
"Jae ""Seth ""Steph Curry"" Curry"" Crowder"
Jae Crowder 50 piece incoming
Trade LeBron for Jae Crowder straight up who says no? Suns probably
We‚Äôre really gonna get knocked out by Jae Crowder
Yeah man the storyline is Jae Crowder. Nothing to do with any injuries.
"Jae ""Game 6 Klay Thompson"" Crowder"
Jae Steph Reggie Miller Curry Crowder
If Jae Crowder is actually going to make 3s this game is already over. Dude was a walking trash can from 3 in previous games this series
Oh we‚Äôre getting the Miami Heat bubble version of Jae Crowder tonight
JAE CROWDER
Jae Crowder woke up today and chose violence.
jae crowder wtf
Boy do I hate Jae Crowder
People who said Jae should be benched after game 3 clearly were not familiar with the Jae crowder experience. You miss everything for several games and then can‚Äôt miss for the next few.
Jae Crowder tryna send them home
Lol from Jae Crowder of all players
"Jae ""Michael Porter Jr."" Crowder"
Jae Crowder heard y'all talking shit
is that jae crowder or dame lillard
Jae Crowder trying to outdo MPJ's start to last game. Holy shit.
The storyline of this series so far is that Jae Crowder genuinely believes he's better than Lebron and I love him for that.
I‚Äôm fine with Jae Crowder being the Suns leading scorer as long as he takes the ball away from Book and Paul lol
JAE FUCKING CROWDER
Is it worth seeing the suns win if you have to see jae crowder win too?
The goat Jae Crowder
Jae crowder doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about AD playin
"MPJ went hot from the 3 at the start of the game and his team won. Jae Crowder is hot from the 3, so that means......"
the suns got heat jae crowder vs the bucks from last year
Jae Crowder heard y'all talk shit and now he coming.
JAE CROWDER: SKYFUCKER
Is Heat Nation living vicariously through Jae Crowder?
JAE CROWDER IS A BAAAAD MAN
Obligatory we should‚Äôve never let Jae Crowder go
Damn Jae crowder knows how to make a 3 now?
"Just got out of a Thai prison, is Jae Crowder the greatest player of all time?"
JAE CROWDER HOLY CRAP
PACK WATCH LAKERS SMOKED BY JAE CROWDER
"ah yes the jae crowder game, what we all expected"
JAE CROWDER!!!
Every time Jae crowder scores I wonder why good things happen to bad people
JAE CROWDER HAS FOUND THE STROKE
"[Wojnarowski] Scott Foster called a technical foul on Cameron Payne for taunting. Payne yelled ""Get him a body bag!"" from the bench as Davis laid on the floor after being fouled hard by Jae Crowder."
"Yeah people don‚Äôt realize it but Atlanta/GA is one of the hotbeds for basketball talent. Dwight, Jaylen Brown, Lou Will, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick Favors, KCP, WCJ, Jae Crowder all currently in the league...then you have Shareef Abdur-Rahim World B Free, Horace Grant, Josh Smith, just to name a few historically"
Jae Crowder to inbound?
"Fuck I hate Jae Crowder, but you can‚Äôt not go for the Suns, fuck the Flippers"
Jae Crowder listening so intently
"Jae ""Clam Chowder"" Crowder"
jae crowder ass
Wayne Gretzky asked Jae Crowder for permission to wear #99
Jae Crowder has been really bad this game.
If jae crowder doesn't make his first 2 shots he's going 1-10
Don‚Äôt think my Jae crowder points prop will hit ......
do you think Jae crowder sleeps on his hair like a pillow?
Jae Crowder Boutta run this bitch
"If Jae Crowder can make some damn shots, we can close it out"
Jae Crowder and even CP3 are not very likable players.
John Collins? Jae Crowder? Marcus Morris.
HEY JAE CROWDER MAKE A FUCKING SHOT
Jae Crowder get that nonsense out of here üò§
"First round it was Book, 2nd round CP3, 3rd round is Aytons turn, Jae Crowder/Bridges Finals MVP?"
Who wouldn‚Äôt want Jae Crowder on their team? He‚Äôs such a great role player
Elite defender Paul George is defender elite offensive superstars Jae Crowder and Cam Johnson lmfao  Defense ranking is 99% about rep rather than active production
Gotta give Jae Crowder and Cam Payne some credit. Payne's been good since the bubble. It wasn't just one trade
"Jae crowder always played dirty against  us. In 2015 we rolled the Celtics and he seemed more keen on injuring people than winning in the final games (blowouts). Then, he came to the Cavs and played like absolute garbage. Fuck that punk."
You need to give team 2 one of Mikal Bridges/Jae Crowder or Myles turner to make this more fair. I think team 1 easily wins with these teams
"I think you're probably right, from the Cleveland perspective, that Durant's bitch-ass going to GSW made it impossible for the Cavs continued success.  That's most likely the reason that he's the #1 enemy. Fuck that guy.  I'll go through Cleveland's honorable mentions, to the best of my ability as well:  Carlos Boozer: He was on his rookie contract.  Had an option for a 5th year (or 4th?  I don't remember... whatever).   Cavs let him out, under the impression that he was going to stay, and sign a real deal for more money.  He reneged on his handshake deal and went to Utah instead, and we never got a young LeBron / Boozer duo.   Fuck that guy.   Jae Crowder:  I'm a little out of the loop on this.  Not sure why Cavs fans hate him.   If someone can fill me, that'd be great.  Kelly Olynk:  Ripped Kevin Love's arm out of his socket, in the 2015 playoffs, making the Cavs 2nd or 3rd best player unavailable in the finals.   Fuck that guy.  Joakim Noah: Is just a generally annoying-as-fuck player who's also explicitly talked shit about the city of Cleveland.   Fuck that guy.  Draymond:  Seriously?   He runs around kicking everyone in the dick.  Fuck that guy.  Terry Rozier:   I'm not sure what the deal is with this one either.  Again, if someone could fill me in, I'd probably happily say ""Fuck that guy.""  Mikki Moore:  Was a dirty ass motherfucker during the Cavs / Nets series in the 2007 conference semis.   Fuck that guy.  Jordan:  I mean, shit.   ""The Shot"" over Ehlo is enough alone.   But aside from that one singular ball-stabbing play, there was a solid 3-4 year window, where the Cavs were really fucking good, with Larry Nance, Mark Price, Ron Harper, Hot-Rod Williams, and a few others that I'm forgetting.   They were never able to get over the hump and play in the finals, soley because of Jordan.  In the same way that other teams have been dad-dicked by LeBron or Kobe... Jordan did that to the Cavs.   But... I can't give Jordan an official ""Fuck that guy.""  I mean... he's just Jordan."
"It wasn't a max contract, but it was the biggest extension they could offer. They had a team of high level role players, and intended to compete for the playoffs. Then management changed their mind a few games into the season when Kevin hurt his toe.   This is the same GM/front office that wasted a year did LeBrons prime by trading Kyrie for Jae Crowder and an injured IT who they knew should sit out the year for hip surgery. Would put nothing past those clowns."
I mean I‚Äôve never liked Chris Paul or Jae Crowder and don‚Äôt want to see his teams win
"Butler didn't ""lead"" that team. He was their 4th leading scorer in the ECF behind Adebayo, Herro, and Dragic. That team also had Jae Crowder, who has shown his value this year as a really good piece for Phoenix. Butler was simply the most famous name of a group of 6-7 guys who all had a big hand in their run. He's an All-Star, but not a superstar."
"Jae Crowder is a star role player imo. There was a good discussion a week or so ago on if that was an oxymoron or not, and I think it was surrounding Crowder.   Anyways, the guys you listed vs Jimmy &amp; Bam are worlds apart. Stars can carry a team. Jimmy has proven he can do that. I can see a debate on whether Bam is a true star or a star role player. I‚Äôve historically leaned towards the latter with him, but there is no debate with Jimmy."
They're good players but they aren't stars. Is Terry Rozier a star? Is Jae Crowder or Miles Bridges stars? Nah it doesn't matter what you're role is. You gotta be a top player to be a star and neither of them are stars.
Jae Crowder looks like Serena Williams
jae crowder is ass
‚ÄúIs Jae Crowder a better passer than Chris Paul?‚Äù ‚Äî ESPN
"Exactly, just like how cp3 and booker's poor shooting elbowed Jae Crowder in the face and dropped him to the ground for a no call.   Both things can be true.  Phx stars played poorly and the refs were biased."
"Does the better team usually get every call, including a retroactive offensive foul?  Which, BTW, we did not get today when Paul George went MMA on Jae Crowder."
"Both were total ass. Book let Bev get the best of him, CP shot bad 3s trying to get the call when refs wasn't giving Suns that many calls. That tech on Crowder was soft as fuck, I know I'll get downvoted for this, but when PG elbowed him, they didn't do shit, PG pushes Jae, refs don't do shit, but they were so fast to call the tech, fuck this shit"
"Bro suns have Jae Crowder, Book, and CP3"
Jae Crowder has fouled out.
Yo is Jae Crowder gonna pull a Draymond?
Fuck Jae Crowder!
How does Jae Crowder already have all those techs?
Jae ‚Äúflail‚Äù crowder
Jae Crowder running after that I love it
I wanna go on a wine tasting tour with jae crowder I bet it would be super fun and he can make that funny scrunchy face when he smells the wine glasses
jae crowder what a nice man helping paul george up  love jae
Jae Crowder has been totally absent this series. He needs to step it up
I kinda tolerate jae crowder while on the suns and i dont care who knows
Mike Breen is going to go hard for that Jae Crowder pass no matter what.
"On one hand Heat legend Jae Crowder.  On the other, FSU legend Terrance Mann."
fake tough guy jae crowder out there flopping like a fish lmao
I miss Jae Crowder. üò≠  Suns are lucky to have him.
Is Jae Crowder the 3rd splash cousin twice removed?
Uh oh Jae Crowder 7/10 3 ball game incoming
There's the obligatory jae crowder falling down 3
Replacing Jae crowder with Barkley? Yes please
I think it's just fatigue from the bubble finals and losing Jae Crowder.
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"Ibaka is a waste of salary for this team. Give me Taj Gibson for the vet min $2.4MM.   I'm gonna get wild with it and move it and move Jamal Murray to the 2 and add De'Aron Fox as a second max player.   Replacing Anunoby with Crowder for the salary savings.  Also, using 2021 salary figures.  PG: De'Aron Fox ($28MM)  SG: Jamal Murray ($29.5MM)  SF: Luguentz Dort($1.8MM)  PF: Jae Crowder($9.7MM)  C: Clint Capela($17MM)  G3:TJ McConnell ($3.5MM)  G4: Alec Burks ($6MM)  Wing3: Dorian Finney-Smith ($4MM)  Wing4: Nic Batum ($2.6MM)  C2: Taj Gibson($2.4MM)"
"&gt;Clearly you weren‚Äôt. LeBron James was moving like post-achilles Kobe in that game.  Clamped by jae crowder  &gt; 2 catch and shoot guys and Ayton aren‚Äôt doing shit without a ball-handler...  ayton is ridiculous he's better than anyone on the lakers outside of anthony davis, why would you even disrespect the suns when they just clowned you  &gt;Jesus you‚Äôre dense.  says the guy who is apparently unironically claiming the lakers go ""12 deep"" when they cant survive losing a single starter"
"This is a pretty new thing, for a team to be celebrating like this before actually winning the title. Maybe Jae Crowder was pissed last year when [the Heat made sure to keep any celebrating to a minimum](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-miami-heat-requested-have-confetti-after-advancing-nba-finals/amp/) when they eliminated Boston and advanced to the Finals. Some teams in the past have definitely made it a point like that to act like there is nothing to celebrate yet, not until you win it all. I guess if Phoenix doesn't win they'll at least have had these times to celebrate."
"See: Jason Kidd, Rajon Rondo, Luka Doncic, Nerlens Noel, Chandler Parsons, Samuel Dalembert, Jae Crowder (not sure if they actively clashed, but Carlisle horribly underutilized him), Deshawn Stevenson, etc."
JAE CROWDER is the ultimate glue man (Glue God?). Watch him on this play and fall in love. He passes with so much intention. I long for a pass like that. The trust he puts in the receiver forces them to take the receipt seriously. The confidence he has in himself and his teammates in unmatched. Like the way he's actively ready to be an outlet receiver if you need it but also not trying to force anything knowing you'll make the best decision.
Celtics legend Jae Crowder putting work in
If it was 2015 they'd give it to Jae Crowder for guarding Giannis but it's close between Paul and Booker rn
Imagine if the Suns second option was Jae Crowder. That's basically the Bucks. They're competitive when he's on a positive streak.
"Jae Crowder is not complaining, he was in the finals this year and last year. Played the full season as well. If anyone were to complain it should be him. In short, play the game you're paid millions to play. Professional athletes get more time off than 97% of the world! Be Professional!"
*Worried deer noises*  Congratulations Suns! That was just beautiful basketball (fuck Jae Crowder too)
Imagine losing to a Jae crowder dagger
Jae Crowder just shot a step back wide open
"Most of what Jae Crowder does is annoying, but to be fair pretty much every player argues with virtually every call against them.  There are at least a few on every team."
Jae Crowder will cut a bitch
Jae Crowder fouls nearly every play it isn‚Äôt anything new.
"Jae Crowder is just a taller, thicker Patrick Beverley."
Why Jae Crowder bitch after every clear foul on him lol
crowder literally grabbing his wrist and then whines to the ref like a baby. my gosh i hate jae so much
Jae Crowder has never committed a foul  -	Jae Crowder
wtf is jae crowder even arguing there lmfao
Jae Crowder doing a better job than Ayton
Jae Crowder should stay on Giannis. Ayton can't guard him.
Gonna invent a glue and call it the Jae Crowder.
Never thought I‚Äôd hear ‚ÄúWIRED Finals Edition: Jae Crowder and Pat Connaughton‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt understand a single word Jae Crowder said
He's having a jae crowder game lmao
Jae Crowder on Double Double watch
Jae Crowder redemption game
Jae Crowder might be the most bipolar player ever
jae crowder plays just like tatum
The Jae Crowder experience!
IS TODAY JAE ‚ÄúOFFENSIVE JUGGERNAUT‚Äù CROWDER DAY?
Its not even worth debating a point with idiotic brigading Bucks fans ITT. Giannis literally practically just threw away Jae Crowder and didn't get called for it.
You think fuckin Jae crowder has a prayer of defending Giannis without fouling?
Dont gamble with heat legend Jae crowder
Good thing it‚Äôs a good Jae Crowder night tonight or they‚Äôd be in trouble
"Ahhh, it‚Äôs one of those Jae Crowder days."
jae crowder played centaur in chronicles or narnia  *of
Alright boys. I‚Äôm having woman troubles. You know what that means.   I‚Äôm headed to the game thread with a Martini to hang with you guys. How sad.   Is this the game Jae Crowder hits four threes? Or the usual bricks eight?
Jae Crowder gives me flashbacks of World of Warcraft if you know what I mean.
Heat lifer Jae Crowder
jae crowder going off tn
"Granted it's a tiiiny sample size but it looks like the hawks core and scoring is solely based on Trae, meanwhile the suns (slightly unfair since they have pointgod Cp3) but booker isn't the focal point of the offense. They have role players like cam and Jae crowder, ayton inside, Cp3 and booker in the midrange. More versatile than the hawks imo"
"Here is why it is a foul for Booker but not for Middleton. Both times Devin Booker went up for a shot, he jumped forward into the defender. Khris Middleton had to jump sideways into Jae Crowder for there to be contact."
"Yes, the suns were probably a playoff team last year if ayton wasn‚Äôt suspended. Devin booker has been a stud for like 4 years now, but only gets credit for two most recents. Jae crowder and CAM &amp; Payne have been HUGE in the playoffs this year."
