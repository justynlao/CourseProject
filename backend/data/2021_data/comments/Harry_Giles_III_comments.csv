Harry Giles III and Georges Niang. You get Giles' defense and and Niang's 3pt shooting.

"Except it is exactly the same just shifted from failing to build around Cousins to failing to build around Fox. 3-4 key young players that have no other talent around them and a terrible coaching staff and an incompetent front office that has done such an awful job that no one in the NBA wants to play for SAC.  Front office just continually either overpays for completely washed (Hassan Whiteside last year, Tristan Thompson this year) big men or takes huge risks on drafting injury prone (Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley III) big men, or pays average role players as if they're stars (Harrison Barnes).   The argument could be made that they aren't focused on big men and are trying to emulate the small ball movement but that doesn't hold either cuz the small ball movement is predicated on good 3pt shooting and players that can defend multiple positions and Buddy Hield is the only good 3pt shooter on the roster and they don't have anyone that can guard more than 2 positions.   Throw in a coaching staff that doesn't even understand what defense is and has to bank on an undersized rookie PG to bail them out with his 1 on 1 ability and it will be another long wait for relevancy."
