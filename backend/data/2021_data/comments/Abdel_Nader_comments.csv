WCS couldn't get anything going in the post against Abdel Nader. Damn.
"Every team Abdel Nader has been on, I’ve tried to convince myself he’s good."
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
"Ok Takeaways:  OKC YESSIRSKI ✅ WE DO NOT LOSE FOLKS DONT FUCKING FORGET IT  That was like watching last years team scrimmage at 100% and CP3 is so good he has the play against all the young guys and Al horford for it to be fair  Abdel Nader - the return, the revenge  Jae crowder is so solid bro  Dort is actually so fucking good pay attention to the man  me telling the refs to T up Chris paul   Poku got some nice run. This is how we make him into the 7 foot sniper guard he will inevitably become ¯_(ツ)_/¯  Diallo is waaaay too tough  Flacko Roby SZN  CP3 is probably so furious rn hahaha  Awesome Shai  Good work OKC. Let’s keep competing"
"I hate losing, but On the bright side, we took the Denver nuggets to double OT without Devin Booker, with Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader combining for 50 minutes. Additionally, Jokic, Murray, Morris, Kaminsky, and the refs were doing everything in their power to will the Nuggets to victory."
Just brutal to play hard for 50+ minutes and have to finish the game with Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader on the court
Next up: Abdel Nader gets the start at the 3 lmao
Celtics Legends PJ Dozier and Abdel Nader
So what are we thinking...Guershon Yabusele or Abdel Nader?
Ummm dude the Suns are in first because of the Abdel Nader trade
"You were fine with Abdel Nader, but Anthony Bennett is just ridiculous."
"Marcus Smart, Paul Pierce, Abdel Nader, OG Anunoby, Anthony Bennett?"
And Jae Crow  And Langstong Galloway  And E'Twaun Moore  And Abdel Nader  Also drafted at 10 Jalen Smith  And picked up the undrafter Ty-shon Alexander
"Yo can we trade for this guy? I feel like Abdel Nader plays the role of Yuta on our team. He just works hard and doesn't care about getting dunked on (yet)   Yuta spot on with that analysis, I remember in high school, I always took pride on defense and in-game I'd occasionally slip on the court but still stayed in it to poke the ball free from the ball hander. Then I'd go to the park and someone slips in similar fashion and they all act like idiots... .thanks And-1 Tour"
1st in DWS and still got worked by Abdel Nader
"Eh, we got lots of dudes to watch in the NBA (so we don't have to watch the Flyin' Pr0-16hms this year). Monte Morris, Georges Niang, THT, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Haliburton. All having solid years, and all but Tyrese on good-ish teams."
He meant to say Abdel Nader. And the answer is yes lol
Abdel Nader absolutely owned Schroeder in the 2nd half. Took the man's confidence.
"You got dusted by Cam Payne, Abdel Nader and Dario Saric my man. Take the L. The Lakers are still the defending champs but we got you tonight"
"KCP and Wes Matthews played 54 combined minutes and scored 4 points on 1-9 combined. Meanwhile Abdel Nader, Cam Johnson, Bridges and Crowder hit 12 combined 3s..   With Kuzma out that’s just not going to get it done"
They couldn't close out Abdel Nader lol
"Abdel Nader, Dario Saric. Good lord."
abdel nader..the lebron stopper
"Very impressive win by the Suns considering their star shooting guard only played 23 minutes, but I guess when you're as talented as Abdel Nader you don't always need to play the full game to propel your team to victory"
"Ah yes, the two Suns all stars: Dario Saric and Abdel Nader"
"Brother Abdel Nader getting them halal buckets, love to see it"
abdel nader is literally just the whomping willow lmao
Abdel Nader time
Abdel Nader has more FTs than LBJ
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
"I'm pretty sure that was a semi-rhetorical question, but I'll go ahead and answer anyways:  Book (36), CP3 (34) and Mikal (34) have all gone over 30 points at least once already this season. DA (27), CamJ (21), and Jae (21) have gone 20+. Antichrist (19) and CamPayne (19) have both missed time, and are just short. Frank, Gallo and Moore all have season highs of 17. That's eleven guys that are no further away than one more made three from hitting 20 in a game this season.  Abdel Nader got some playing time while guys were hurt and topped out at 16; Jevon Carter's had a pretty tough season shooting so far but still hit double figures at 10 in one game.  Only Jalen Smith and Ty-Shon Alexander, the two rooks, have played minutes without hitting double figures for the big club, though I think they've both done so in the G-League."
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
The suns a least for me kinda like everyone on the team except for Abdel Nader when he was getting 20+ minutes a game but he's fine now
"Vassell would've been good, as the Suns only have Abdel Nader as their true backup SF behind Bridges. But Monty has been playing Cam Johnson at lot in those minutes now with Kaminsky/Crowder at the 4."
"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
my first thought personally was Abdel Nader
"Dario Saric, Torrey Craig, Abdel Nader."
Wait until you see Devinader Booker at the end of the game if he plays. Abdel Nader. I get tricked every game.
Abdel Nader. Has the tunnel vision of Oubre without the talent to finish at the rim.  Second pick would be Jevon Carter. While he really only plays during blow outs he takes the most ill-advised three’s pretty routinely (he’s a menace on the defensive side tho so he gets a pass).
"Even then, Langston Galloway or even Abdel Nader as a 10th man is pretty good.  But I image it will just be a 9 man rotation in the playoffs"
"&gt;The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.  Fair enough, but I think given the respective records, it's fairly close.  &gt; You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.  14-7 corresponds roughly with Ayton's availability.  Obviously he's a huge deal.  Yes, the bubble was unique, but just in the last month, as I noted elsewhere, the Suns have wins over: the Davis-less Lakers, the McCollum-less Blazers, the Curry-less Warriors, the Davis-and-James-less Lakers, and the Wolves twice.  They also lost to the Wolves and the tanking Magic.  So I think it's fair to equate this season and last, and even to the bubble."
"The Bubble Suns had $18M of that $24M invested in Oubre, Ty Jerome and Jalen Lecque, who were also part of the trade. Granted we took back Nader, that adds $2M more, so realistically, we would have had $8M extra to spend. Considering we have $-18M in cap space, we would have still been $-10M over and unable to sign anyone outside of minimum contracts anyway.  The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.   You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.   This team is demonstrably better with Chris Paul and a full bench."
"Agreed. I love Cam, but he does have a habit of picking up ticky tack injuries that will sideline him for a week. In the playoffs, that could be 3 or 4 games of a series, so having insurance for that is key. I don’t feel amazing about Abdel Nader being that guy, even as well as he’s played this year."
Can we all take a moment and appreciate that Cam Payne and Frank Kaminsky are playing meaningful rotation minutes on the 3rd best record team in the league?  Shoutout Abdel Nader too
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
Shaking in their boots at the thought of Abdel Nader
"G: Monte Morris G: Tyrese Haliburton G/F: THT F: Abdel Nader F: George Niang  Yeah, probably not going to win many too many games, but all solid role players."
Abdel Nader
Abdel Nader &amp; Mo Bamba
Abdel Nader gave the Suns good minutes this year. Was a short stint as we rotate in and out our bench players and he got hurt right when we got Torrey Craig who quickly stole his spot
You named 3 players who had better careers in other cities. Grant is the only one we saw coming like this.  Dipo was cheeks. And Sabonis played 4 as a rookie.  Where are these guys and what are they doing?:  Josh Huestis   Semaj Christian  Raymond Felton  Kyle Singler  Norris Cole  Alex Abrines (he left by choice but he could maybe play in nba again)  Abdel Nader  Dakari Johnson  Andre Roberson  Joffrey Lauvergne  These are guys who played minutes coming off the bench. Wizards definitely have better talent than this.
"It's more of an underachieving roster than a G-League caliber roster. Their depth really isn't good at all and they have basically nothing on the wings outside of the Jays. Also when Timelord doesn't play Tristan Thompson hasn't been all that great and it kinda creates a hole at the center position.   Also none of their draft picks outside the two stars and maybe Timelord have really hit. Pritchard  is a nice piece and Williams looks good in spurts but both are bit players. Then you have Langford, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Tremont Waters, haven't really worked and if you go farther back and look at picks like Yabusele, Ante Zizic, Jabari Bird, Demetrius Jackson, Abdel Nader, those guys never really worked out. Rozier was a good pick but for the most part they haven't drafted well over the last 5 or 6 years outside of getting the two stars. It's hard when your drafting late in the first round every year but we've seen teams able to get valuable rotation pieces in the 20s where the Celtics have more or less whiffed."
If Abdel Nader was healthy it would be Suns in 4
Idk man our championship hopes tanked the second Abdel Nader went down
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"I dont trust Torrey from 3 enough but i'd put Abdel Nader, Cam Johnson, &amp; this months flavor of Jevon on that list as well."
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
"Yes. people always retort to my comments well how do you explain OKC last year. Well OKC had schroder and SGA. Those 2 with CP3 is quality. that's not to mention Dort playing defense, Galo wasn't washed yet. Steven adams was going down hill but was way better than he is this year. It was a quality team. Even a guy like Abdel Nader who they had and we now have is a quality player who plays his role well for his 15 minutes a game. Unfortunately he has been hurt for a while for us."
??? Over abdel Nader???
"Gentle reminder that the first game Draymond played the Suns after saying this, he dropped 2p4r6a in 25 minutes against the booker-less Suns, ultimately getting blown out by 21 by two guys collecting DNPs, Abdel Nader and Frank Kaminsky, who combined for 28 points, 18 rebounds, and 11 assists.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202101280PHO.html"
Abdel Nader 🇪🇬
Abdel Nader
"Oh yeah, the award has always been about narrative though. A lot of people thought that was it for the Thunder, time to tank without KD. But he kicked it up a notch, averaged the first triple double since Big O, and dragged Alex Abrines, Abdel Nader, Andre Roberson, and Steven Adams to the playoffs lol"
"just abdel nader for us, but torrey craig pretty much absorbed his minutes and probably will keep them."
Abdel Nader
Booker's been filling up the empty shoes of Abdel Nader really well
James Jones turned:  Canaan/Okobo/Melton  Booker/Crawford/Troy Daniels  Warren/Bridges  Ariza/Ryan Anderson/Bender  Ayton/Chandler  Into:  CP3/Payne/Moore  Booker/Jevon Carter/Galloway  Bridges/Cam Johnson/Abdel Nader  Crowder/Craig/Jalen Smith  Ayton/Saric/Kaminsky
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
Imagine if we had the GOAT Abdel Nader healthy
its so infuriating watching khris middleton become abdel nader when hes been michael jordan vs us for the past 5 years
"Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Talen Horten Tucker and Tyrese Haliburton."
"The Lakers were literally less healthy than the suns this series lmao. We had AD miss basically 2 full games, our starting sg miss a game, AC was ruled out for the majority of the game today, and Bron wasn’t 100%. I’m not ignoring cp injury bc it was significant and certainly matters but y’all acting like y’all had it way worse when u didn’t even have anyone miss full games (except Abdel Nader)"
Yeah Suns lost Abdel Nader too.
"&gt; He’s referring to Abdel Nader who has started a total of 8 games in his career   THE Abdel Nader, who missed 4 free throws in a row. Not across multiple possessions, he missed 4 consecutive FTs in ONE possession."
at least one Abdel Nader
"Roll call for Romeo Langford, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye, Kadeem Allen, Jabari Bird, Guerschon Yabusele and Abdel Nader."
"Pritchard at 27 isn’t anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that’s solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn’t like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it’s concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn’t pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
"The Suns have been cagey about injuries all season, so not sure what to make of this. Abdel Nader had a “sore knee” for months and then suddenly had season-ending knee surgery, for example."
Idk how I feel about you disrespecting Abdel Nader like that. Dude is being robbed of 6MOTY and MVP right before our eyes.
on free agency  etwuan moore  langston galloway  frank kaminsky  abdel nader  torrey craig  tyshon alexander  getting traded  jevon carter  jalen smith  cam johnson  dario saric
Abdel Nader
"Commercial break question: Who is the cutest player in the Finals? Jrue and CP3 are pretty darn cute, Giannis has arms to die for, Abdel Nader has a lovely smile - who do you think is the most crushworthy player in this game?"
How is RJ Hunter an F and James Young a D+? Looks like Young didn't do much (if at all) more than Hunter and he was a much higher pick.       I'd also grade Abdel Nader and ETwaun Moore higher. Yabusele and Zizic much lower
"Well, it's kind of the Bucks put us away. But the Bucks only put us away in the 3rd because Monty inexplicably pulled the small ball lineup that cut the lead to 4 in the 3rd to insert... Frank Kaminsky and Abdel Nader. Then within 3minutes it was basically a 20pt lead.   He pulled a similar move in the second when the Suns were up by 6 and watched lead VANISH"
This is why I don’t bet. Imagine having money hanging on Abdel Nader hitting a 3 or not in garbage time.
Lol and immediately gets replaced with Abdel Nader cause he was terrible.  Edit: should add I'm a wisconsinite. Was hoping for Kaminsky to be great but doesn't look like he will even be a role player.
ABDEL NADER SIGHTING
Abdel Nader sighting
Damn Abdel Nader was getting ready to be the small ball 5 this whole time.
"Cam Payne, Frank Kaminsky, and Abdel Nader"
the loss is magnified when the other guys who will get those minutes are Frank the Tank &amp; Abdel Nader.  Both Saric &amp; Craig are versatile players and certainly better thank Kaminsky/Nader or Jalen Smith who is totally untested at this point.
Didn't know my boy:    #ABDEL. NADER.    Was on the Suns.
"Ok I'll give you some facts.   Dude had 2 months to heal, but since the Lakers were so top heavy and dogshit without him he had to rush back not at 100% towards the end of the regular season just for you guys to sniff the play in. Want to talk ""healthy?"" Chris Paul played with 1 arm the entire second half of that game and y'all still lost. Not to mention we were out GOAT Abdel Nader who wiped the floor with you in the regular season.  Get over yourself. Go back to twitter and your #DAME2LA tweets"
Cam Johnson gonna get a lot more minutes. Abdel Nader will get some minutes too
are we talking about the same abdel nader? the one that used to play for the celtics?? is he good now or something?
2nd unit center Abdel Nader
Abdel Nader getting a well deserved rest
abdel nader is the human victory cigar
With Torrey out Abdel nader moves up in the lineup. Honestly wonder if we’ll see some Stix minutes with Dario and Craig both out. Prob a longshot
Abdel Nader at Center time
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
Just three more wins for former legendary Celtic Abdel Nader
We’re good. Maybe Abdel Nader and next years first lol
Abdel Nader going to continue the streak
Ignoring the Abdel Nader injury I see.
He’s obviously talking about Abdel Nader.
Dang he must have been real pissed at Abdel Nader
So Abdel Nader doesn’t exist anymore?
"He put Nader in to switch onto Reggie Jackson and Pat bev, just to give them a different look. And Abdel is the only dude on the team that seems to want to drive to the basket. Like Mikal drives too, but he drives to the middle of the paint, not to the rim"
Dude we made it this far with Abdel Nader injured most of the way. Don’t even act like that’s not impressive
"Celtics Legend Abdel Nader going to the NBA finals.  For real though, I'm happy for all the Suns fans out there. Y'all deserve this more than I deserve winning the bet I put on the Suns in May. Your team is in the fucken finals guys. Celebrate hard today. Fuck anything that moves."
CELTICS LEGEND ABDEL NADER IS GOING TO THE FINALS
STOP FUCKING PLAYING ABDEL NADER BRO LIKE WTF
Imagine playing Abdel Nader instead of Torrey Craig.
"These playoffs are ass  Im watching cameron payne, luke kennard, jae crowder, terrance mann, and abdel nader in the fucking conference finals."
what kind of dirt does abdel nader have on monty?
I wanted a Giannis vs Kawhi finals not Bruno Fernando vs Abdel Nader
Abdel Nader will be Finals MVP. Handsome guy. Big dick for sure.
Jordan Nwora  Kris Dunn  Abdel Nader  DeMarcus Cousins  Vote for your finals mvp
"I'm not sure how many would say Paul is equal in value to Kawhi, but I don't take anyone seriously that says Paul is worth Kawhi + our starting center Ibaka.  Suns losing Abdel Nader probably makes up the difference though."
Celtics legend abdel Nader?
"That's right, and Abdel Nader finally got back un Game 4"
"PG — no likey.  Abdel Nader is just as good.  Not biased at all.  Also, Suns in 5."
I mean we only have had Abdel Nader in the NBA (and few in Egypt care about him or basketball). Basketball isn’t a big sport in Egypt.
"Injured forward Abdel Nader yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Jae Crowder gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Devin Booker yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Chris Paul hit the locker room door, former NBA great Charles Barkley hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Abdel Nader getting playoff minutes?!?!?!?!?
Gamal Abdel Nader
I did not know Abdel Nader was in the Suns now
People forget Abdel Nader has Conference Finals experience
"if Abdel was cleared, then why is he Nader? I thought he would be Der"
Abdel Nader sighting!
Abdel Nader trade coming to fruition🙏
Abdel Nader uuuuugh
"Wow, this is the superstar return the Suns needed, the Clippers are fucked!  (I was just kidding with that comment - Abdel Nader is actually much more of a rarely-used role player than a superstar, so his return is unlikely to affect the series significantly. Happy Friday everyone!)"
"Suns in 3 now that Abdel ""Ralph"" Nader is back"
Who the hell posts an Abdel Nader update without including this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg5h_QKHjWc
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
Celtics Legend Abdel Nader 2 wins away from his first NBA Finals
Suns are the exact same way. Abdel Nader had knee soreness the next thing you know he’s has surgery and is out for the year.   I’d be willing to bet we won’t find out CP is playing until he’s spotted at the arena
"They can give the MVP to Abdel Nader for all I care, just bring home the ring boys!!"
Abdel Nader
"Shout out to Cam Johnson and Jae Crowder too, along with superstar Abdel Nader"
"Yeah we lost Craig, abdel Nader who played hisminutes before we traded for Torrey is pretty comparable though. It's a slight downgrade and he doesn't play as big as Torrey so he won't be as effective in those spot PF minutes, but he was coming off the bench before Torrey for a couple games in the playoffs after missing months with a knee injury, so idk I guess the coaches like him.   Jalen Smith is a PF yes and yes got some tools, but he almost literally didn't play last year. He certainly has the potential to grab those minutes and should be a contributor as thin as we are at the position and with him being a lottery pick, but I think suns fans are going in expecting nothing out of him because we haven't seen anything yet, good or bad.  The shamet trade is pretty good for us imo, and I like javale, but we're mostly just holding par."

Come on guys. Abdel Nader news must always be submitted with [this clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg5h_QKHjWc) It's in the subreddit rules and everything.
"Honestly this is probably the most success Iowa State players have had in the league ever. Monte Morris- one of the best 6th men in the league Tyrese Haliburton- ROY candidate this year, seems to be a key piece for the Kings moving forward  Georges Niang, Abdel Nader, Talen Horton-Tucker- All solid rotation players for playoff teams Plus you have guys like Matt Thomas, Naz Long, Deonte Burton, and Marial Shayok who have all had appearances on rosters for playoff teams.  Ironically, Royce White was one of the highest draft picks and he flamed out, although that obviously wasn't for on-court reasons."
Jordan Farmar  Shannon Brown  Oscar Schmidt  Dino Radja  Arvydas Sabonis  Or...  Monte Morris  Tyrese Haliburton  Matt Thomas  Abdel Nader  Georges Niang
Get Abdel Nader in there!!
Because the Suns were missing Abdel Nader in 3 games of the series. If he’s healthy the whole series Suns likely sweep
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
Abdel Nader
Thad for Abdel Nader? Deal.
"PG: Chris Paul  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Mikal Bridges   PF: Cam Johnson  C: Deandre Ayton  Bench 5: Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Abdel Nader, Javale McGee, Landry Shamat"
jokes on you we're gonna trade yall abdel nader and a conditional 4209 second round pick for ALLL those mfs
Abdel Nader
We were running a garbage time lineup against a LeBron and AD up at one point. If Abdel Nader is sharing the court with two top 75 players that should at least raise a couple of questions
"Bro, who do you think our starters are, Abdel Nader and Cam Payne?"
Bro what the fuck are you doing fouling Abdel Nader in a 4v4 💀
"Why do all the Celtics 15th men go on to become decent rotation players elsewhere? And why can't we keep any of these guys who would clearly be better than many of our current options?   Abdel Nader, PJ Dozier, Max Strus, and now Javonte Green."
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
Larry Nance Jr and Abdel Nader.
"Giannis is a goddamn nightmare for Ayton. We also lost Saric and Cam Payne in the Finals, and had to play Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader for significant stretches. Bucks were just better and deserved to win."
"Giannis went Super Saiyan, and Bobby Portis became Charles Oakley. We also lost Saric and Cam Payne, which meant we had to play Abdel fucking Nader and Torrey Craig for significant minutes. The Bucks were just better than us in the end. Different story this year, I think. JaVale McGee, Shamet, and the development of Bridges and Cam Johnson are all a significant upgrade from last year's supporting cast."
"Abdel Nader, Frank, Dario etc."
abdel nader triple double incoming
"Abdel Nader, hes a scrub on the Suns but he had a monster dunk (with the Celtics i think) and I always rooted for him since"
abdel nader
Abdel Nader
Thats Celtics Legend Abdel Nader to you son.
"Abdel Nader, but only because he’s a rotational player for some reason."
Abdel Nader is definitely the most hated player by the suns fan base right now.
"Counter point, I will give you a abdel Nader for him"
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
I’d take him over Abdel Nader
"Boston and Toronto are the two most biased fan bases in the league and it’s not even close. They hype up mediocre talent more than any fanbase.   Philly fans shit on their team more than anyone. Celtics fans and raptors fans don’t even self loathe to be funny — outside of scape goated players (see Jeff Teague, Abdel Nader, Grant Williams, etc.) They have arguably the worst fans, but OP’s description is just untrue."
Abdel Nader
Abdel Nader or stix
"Abdel Nader, and it isn’t close. He needs to be out of the rotation."
Abdel Nader
"Kobe would hate Elfrid Payton and Abdel Nader, mostly because they are black holes offensively. I feel like he might give Ayton a lot of grief during the expected Ayton slumps but he'd appreciate how often Ayton's in the gym and would be a great motivator for him too. Goes without saying he'd love Book and everyone loves Mikal."
"To be fair Monty gave the Hawks an unnecessary head start handicap at the end of that 3rd quarter playing full bench vs their starters letting them build like a 12 point lead in less than 2 mins.... lol.   I'll never quite understand why Monty is SO intent on sticking with his usual rotations and certain bench guys. Like if we're playing a close af game against a solid team who is playing their starters, maybe switching to a full bench lineup featuring Abdel Nader who's been on the biggest struggle bus ever isn't the best idea if you want to win the game. Maybe just MAYBE letting the starters play a couple of extra minutes isn't always a bad option, especially when Booker has been looking like he can't miss most of the game lol.   Thankfully we won anyways, but damn... I love Monty but his stubborn ways frustrate me at times. I'm sure the load micro-management does help our starters in being less likely to have freak injuries in the long term though. Seemed to work last year, anyways."
