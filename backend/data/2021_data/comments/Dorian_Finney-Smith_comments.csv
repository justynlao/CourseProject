"Nah, more like no Kleber/Richardson/Porzingis/Dorian Finney Smith/Powell for half the year.  JJ Barea hasn't played significant minutes in like 2 years and Curry was a nice piece to have for sure but isn't the reason our record blows.  Hardest schedule so far, someone decided to spread COVID everywhere, and Zingus Pingus is started to do his yearly comeback from injury sucky shooting."
That possesion where they left Dorian Finney Smith wide open from 3 to double Luka and he still bricked can serve as a good description of whats going on with our team
"KP (#2 offensive weapon) was out with the meniscus recovery, Josh Richardson (3a offensive weapon) was out with covid, (Dwight Powell (the only backup center with any pick and roll ability) was out with covid, Dorian Finney Smith (2nd best defender who shot 37% on 3s last year) was out with Covid, and Maxi Kleber (best defender/shooter who is shooting over 47% on 3s this year at the Power Forward position) is out with Covid - all these players have been out at least 9 games. Jalen Brunson (backup point guard and is shooting almost 50/40/90 on 12ppg) was also out with covid protocol for like 5 games."
"It's probably early but maybe Dorian Finney Smith. Last year he looked like an elite up and coming 3&amp;D guy. He averaged 10 PPG, 6 RPG and shot 47% from the field and 38% from 3, oftentimes guarding the opposing team's best wing.  He's been out a lot from COVID and the season sample size from him is quite small, but he's regressed back to a 29-30% 3PT shooter and looks to just be a D guy who is somewhat unplayable if he isn't hitting his shots."
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"2nd-6th best players (Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson &amp; Dwight Powell) have all missed nearly half the season. We've also had the 5th hardest SRS schedule thus far. As of now the remaining schedule is the 29th hardest."
"Tim Hardaway Jr, dorian finney-smith, josh richardson and every pick available"
"Expectation: JRich, Dorian Finney Smith, and Powell return and provide much needed stabilization and shows that the Mavs don’t actually suck.  Reality: The three guys will be rusty and a bit out of shape and may not provide an immediate lift like we want, logically proving to our fan base that we need to blow it up and trade Luka for picks."
"Luka had a slow start and when he started getting going, we lost what I think are four of our essential players in Maxi Kleber, JRich, Dorian Finney Smith, and Dwight Powell for 2 weeks and counting now due to health protocols. The first three are starters and provide excellent 3pt shooting and defensive versatility. Without them, our defense has suffered heavily and with no reliable 3pt shooting for Luka to pass to, teams can effectively swarm him on drives since Wes Iwundu isn’t gonna be swishing anything. Powell can catch lobs, which is something that our replacement WCS can’t do, and Boban, as much as we love him, is an absolute non factor and is a negative on defense.  Our schedule as also been absolutely brutal along with missing a lot of our guys. Obviously there are some games we should’ve won that we lost, but the reason for this rough stretch has been due to us losing our starters."
"&gt; Wiggins’ on-ball defense has opponents shooting 40.0 percent, better than such respected defenders as Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort (43.3), Boston’s Jaylen Brown (43.5) and Toronto’s Pascal Siakam (44.0).  &gt; On shots from 15 feet or further, where many wings thrive, the failure rate against Wiggins is 67.4 percent, roughly the same as Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis (67.5) and better than Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard (61.4) and Portland’s 3-and-D wing Robert Covington (59.3).

Dorian Finney-Smith  We just call him Doe Doe as a nickname. Though I don't know why anyone would outside of our team's sub. I'm used to calling him Dorian here
"&gt; We've been playing without Doe, JRich, and Brunson since the 8th, plus Maxi and DP  Nobody knows who Doe or DP is outside of your team's sub  I can figure out who DP is by looking at the roster but still don't know who Doe is. I mean I guess it's Dorian Finney-Smith but still... come on"
Dorian Finney-Smith is a starter I think
Played way too much 2K MyLeague so I have a lot of useless knowledge of lower rotation guys at most teams. Especially those that keep popping up in the trade finder like Dorian Finney-Smith for an example
If only we had some switchable wing like Dorian Finney-Smith or Torrey Craig to help out our defense. Maybe we can trade for one who knows
"We would have taken Wendell Carter JR, which would've given us a superstar lineup of Dennis Smith Jr, Wesley Matthews, Dorian Finney Smith, Harrison Barnes, and WCJ. I'm sure we would've gotten at least 8 wins that year :)"

Smith-Finney Dorian
Dorian Finney-Smith
Dorian Finney Smith. One of our best 3 and D players. He’s really good and a homegrown player so fans really love him
dorian finney-smith
"Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson are all still out for Covid protocols and have been for over a week now. They’re also our 3 best defenders."
i miss announcers confusing Hardaway and Dorian FInney-Smith
please draymond is a great   simmons is just dorian finney-smith without a jumper and 10 million followers on insta
"who do I have to contact to heal Maximillian Kleber, Josuélito Richardson, Dorian “extinct avian” Finney-Smith, and NBPA representative Dwight Powell"
"Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and then Powell is still out"
"Who of Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges amd Royce O’Neale is a 1 or a 2? Because all three are among the most guarded-by-Dame and guarding-Dame.  Simply, they are all top perimeter defenders who get put on the greatest perimeter threat. That’s why they guarded Dame - not because they’re PGs. These three were also (last season, Mikal has dialled it up now) meh offensively, spotting up in the corner. And that’s why Dame guarded them - even though he didn’t play a minute at SF in any of those games.  This is all to illustrate the “who-guards-whom-determines-positions” is nothing but a way to legitimise heightism and nothing like how modern NBA defences nor offences are structured.  Defensive strategy is based on assignments, not positions. Positions are a thing on offence. Best defenders are set on most dangerous offensive players. Lesser perimeter defenders, especially ones with outsized offensive roles, are stuck on the corner shooter in the hope they don’t have to defend. No NBA coach will just go: PG-on-PG, SG-on-SG etc. in every game they play."
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
OUT:  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson
"I personally prefer dorian finney smith, but its tough to choose the forth. Hardway jr i defenetly the third though"
"Thank you. It's 2021 and people still think you can judge a shooter's skill by their 3P%. Dorian Finney-Smith (who I love, btw), shot nearly 38% from three last year, compared to Young's 36%. But DFS had nearly half of his 3PAs from the corner, and most of those were relatively uncontested. I swear, half of r/nba would take a glance at bbref and conclude that Finney-Smith is a better shooter than Trae."
Dorian Finney-Smith would guard Khris
and Dorian Finney Smith. and Jalen Brunson
"haha yeah he's not this list, but Dorian Finney-Smith on the mavs I thought was a diamond in the rough, turns out he was a top-30ish guy in the nation."
Y’all think he looks like Dorian finney smith?
"yes, that’s the reason why! Because of Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney Smith and Maci Kleber!"
"We don't have Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Bruson and Maxi Kleber. We are missing 3 starters + our backup guard. Even with KP back we are still missing a lot."
"I appreciate all of these points, thanks for the write up OP. I don't disagree with any of them, but points like: ""in 20-21, he is averaging more steals than Covington, PG13, Danny Green, Finney Smith, Simmons, Lowry and Dejounte"" don't add a whole lot from a statistical perspective. Most of us probably know those players are generally considered good defenders, but I doubt many of us really know how many steals per game Dorian Finney Smith is averaging. So knowing that Lamelo has more steals than them doesn't really tell us anything helpful. I think the rankings for each statistic (which you have helpfully included) are much more informative."
"We are missing 3 starters + our back up guard right now. Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Brunson. If this keeps up, we will have Luka + rookies. Josh, DFS and Maxi are literally our 3 best defenders as well. We are so fucked."
"Dallas had one in the bubble last year, starters for a game were   Luka 6’7  THJ 6’5   Dorian Finney Smith 6’8  KP 7’3  Boban 7’4"
"100%.  This smells of 2016. Apparently, people at the time thought it was a ""weak"" class, but it ended up producing some amazing starter-caliber players. Siakam, Brogdon, Simmons, Murray (Jamal and Dejonte both), Sabonis, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Hield, LeVert, Zubac, and so on. Heck, Fred VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith were *undrafted* that year."
"Three years ago he wasn't even a real NBA player. Rick gets a lot of shit for not giving rookies minutes, but look how he turned Maxi Kleber and Dorian-Finney Smith into very good NBA 3&amp;D players. It's unreal how much they both have improved under Rick."
"He was awful offensively in the first half, but to be fair Jamal Murray and Dorian Finney-Smith were the only 2 players on either team really that weren’t awful in the first half lol   His defense was great all game though, and his offense got going later in the game when we needed it most. I highly doubt we would have won this game without JRich"
im clowning he just called Dorian Finney Smith and Josh Richardson both Tim Hardaway so far tonight

"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."

That's why we call Dorian Finney-Smith DFS in mavs circles
Dorian Finney-Smith
Yeah Mavs fandom uses THJ for Tim Hardaway Jr and DFS for Dorian Finney Smith. It’s ok when talking to other Mavs fans but could def see why it would be annoying to literally anyone else.
Tim hardaway Jr and Dorian Finney-Smith. Unless you’re kidding lmao.
Homer but Dorian Finney Smith 10ppg shooting 38% from 3 signed a 3 year 12 mil contract and improved every year he played
Dorian Finney-Smith
Lol this Heat announcer called Jrich and Timmy Dorian Finney-Smith
"Probably thought they could turn him into our next Dorian Finney-Smith. His defense is solid, so if he can develop an average 3pt shot he’d be worth the min we gave him"
"Dorian Finney Smith isn’t a real person,he’s an android created to be the most basic modern nba role player"
"Dorian Finney Smith got an insane steal, shot a dumbass transition 3 and bricked it, then got his own rebound while knocking over his teammate and found an assist. It's like his entire career summed up in one play"
Beal is a really good player but those players really valuable for Mavs.  Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup PGs in the league. Dorian Finney Smith is really good 3D guy and ofc Tingus Pingus. I know his health is a problem but have you ever seen Bubble Zinger or his Knicks Era? Plus three first round picks is kinda too much. Both Brunson and DFS plays for very little money btw.
"Their next 5 after Luka in minutes played are in order: Tom Hardaway, Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jalen Brunson, and Kristaps Porzingis.  Is that really so bad?"
"lol. calm down. in the 80s ppl weren't typing on keyboards (and phones) in hyperspecific online subcommunities.  DFS isn't a ""low effort"" nickname and no one's trying to be ""clever."" It's a frickin' abbreviation so you don't have to write out Dorian Finney-Smith every time (you just have to remember no one knows what you're talking about in a non Mavs-sub)."
"I would really like to watch a compilation of Lillard's drives to see how much contact there was. I get that the refs call fewer fouls on drives if only little contact occurs this season, but there were pretty much no calls. On the other hand Dorian Finney-Smith defends Lillard amazingly for years, he really has his number."
"Dorian Finney-Smith was literally telling the ref ""foul, foul, foul"""
"Dallas:   * Missing 5 of our 8 best players for 10+ games with COVID (Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell), they've been slow to get back to form. * Missed our 2nd best player for the first 10 games due to surgery. Porziņģis has also been slow to shake off rust but is getting there.  * Most difficult strength of schedule to start the season (first 20-25 games I believe)"
"lmao they aren't even considering Portland who is down 2 starters, or Dallas (who OP even failed to mention) who was missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith for 10+ games. That's 6 of our top 8 guys, plus we had the most difficult schedule for our first 25 games."
And there's plenty of role player starters? Ie Dorian Finney Smith
right every time you lose it's just a bad shooting night  2x dpoy hunted by dorian finney-smith all game lmao
Our best player Dorian Finney Smith being clutch again!
You're telling me you don't wanna hear about how Dorian Finney-Smith TOTALLY OWNED AND DISSED Baguette Biyombo?
"Also, regarding Rudy, I think what he does works better in regular season games than in a playoff series. It's good as a base line defense, but we've seen that teams can game plan to exploit the fact that Rudy isn't going to guard anyone on the perimeter. That's why Dorian Finney-Smith said the other night that he knew he was going to get shots because the Jazz put Rudy on him- he knew Rudy would be helping off him constantly, which was true.   In a playoff series, a good coaching staff will find advantages against Utah."
"People who aren't mavericks fans, how much do you know about Dorian finney Smith? I think he's a great 3 and d player that any team would be lucky to have"
"Are you just making shit up, or what?  Kleber was a 31 percent shooter before Luka was drafted. He now shoots 43 percent from 3.  THJ was a 35 percent shooter on the Knicks, he's been shooting 40 percent for two seasons in a row now.  Dorian Finney Smith shot 31 percent from 3, now he's at 37.  Of course these players put in the work individually to get better but if you'd ever watch a Mavs game you'd realize how many of their shots are open."
One word. Dorian Finney Smith.
Best defender in the league wouldn't lose their team a game because they were hunted by Dorian Finney-Smith
Dorian Finney Smith
"They need the production that Dorian Finney-Smith gave them tonight to be the average from his position. Reliable 20+ points, with some 3 point shooting, drives, \~a handful assists and good defense.   They need to find that type of player in free agency or more realistically in a trade."
Just does not match up with the name Dorian Finney-Smith
Dorian Finney Smith had a career night shooting wide open shots  Quit acting like he put it up with Rudy all over him
"A secondary playmaker, a wing upgrade to start over Dorian Finney-Smith, and a legitimate backup big would be the three biggest things"
That’s exactly what was happening so seems like a safe assumption.  Not sure if people thought they had Rudy on him in attempt to shut down Dorian Finney Smith?
And they just clamped Randle into a 5-20 shooting night last Friday and they also Clamped CJ and Dame once Dorian Finney Smith came back from his kids birth
he's assignment was dorian finney-smith who had a season high 23 points
This is worded like Rudy shut them down when in reality he gave up a career night to Dorian Finney Smith because that’s the guy he was guarding
"FWIW, Gobert wasn't assigned to guard either of them. His primary mark most of the game was Dorian Finney Smith, who dropped 23 on 8-17 from the field."
where were you when Dorian Finney Smith made a 2 time defensive player of the year his bitch
Good shit Luka as always. Dorian Finney-Smith take a bow. What a fucking game from him.
Doubtful. My top 15 would be   1. Dorian Finney-Smith   2. Dorian Finney-Smith   3. Dorian Finney-Smith   4. Dorian Finney-Smith   5. Dorian Finney-Smith   6. Dorian Finney-Smith   7. Dorian Finney-Smith   8. Dorian Finney-Smith   9. Dorian Finney-Smith   10. Dorian Finney-Smith   11. Dorian Finney-Smith   12. Dorian Finney-Smith   13. Dorian Finney-Smith   14. Dorian Finney-Smith   15. Dorian Finney-Smith  Because he shoots hot fire.
One word: Dorian Finney Smith
I’ve got one word for you... Dorian Finney-Smith

"This off-season the timberwolves should offer the Mavs Malik Beasley for Maxi Kleber and something - Dorian Finney-Smith and a 1st, Jalen Brunson and a highly protected 1st, etc. Mavs get a scoring guard, which they need, and the wolves get a defensive PF, which they desperately need."

Dorian Finney Smith is going to lead a contender as the first option in a couple years

Dorian finney smith id say
"If you watch a lot of Mavs games you'd know this isn't true, casual fans just think he doesn't because most of the time the guys he passes to clank wide open shots he just created.  There's plenty of examples of Luka's clutch passing. Two examples that immediately spring to mind is he fed Brunson for a wide open dagger three earlier this season vs the Spurs: https://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=30762555  He also hit Dorian Finney-Smith for a go ahead three pointer versus the Lakers last year before Danny Green hit his three to force OT. Can't seem to find a video of that one.  Anyways, those are just two that immediately come to mind. The narrative that he doesn't pass in the clutch is false, he's always trying to make the right play just usually the best play to make is to call his own number."
The best contract in the league is Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi Kleber LOL. Kuz is playing up to his contract tho.

It’s all just semantics   I remember Derek Bodner once talking about how when JJ Redick was in Philly there would be games they would list JJ as a forward in the pre game pressers they give to the media just because Ben was obsessed with being called a point guard. He wanted to be considered a guard he’s one of the two franchise cornerstones on the roster Philly gave him what he wanted   What players want is what dictates this more than actual usage or role. Luka wants to get listed as a guard in the starting lineup that’s why they’ve done it largely. That and also when it’s between him and Dorian Finney Smith you are more likely to classify Doncic as a guard
"I’m a little surprised at all the players in committed relationships who have kids but aren’t getting married. There are two Mavericks (Dorian Finney-Smith, Willie Cauley-Stein) who recently had children with their girlfriends as well. I’m not criticizing their life choices, I’m just curious why you don’t get married at that point."
Dorian Finney-Smith money huh
Dorian Finney-Smith is certainly *not* under 6’6”.

Yep.Our very own Dorian Finney-Smith couldn't hit an open barn door when he signed as an undrafted rookie. Now he's a 40% 3&amp;D wing defender.  Also Jason Kidd is another example of a player who was mocked for his lack of a jumper. Won his chip with us in 2011 as a knockdown shooter from 3.
"I was referencing the famous Luka quote. ""One Word: Dorian Finney-Smith"""
"Dorian Finney Smith couldn't shoot a lick when he got to the NBA. Took a few years but he's more than decent. He rebounds, plays D on the opposing teams best forward, and dunks on people if they aren't careful. He also makes what, 5 mill a year? If he can learn to shoot, so can Ben. I do agree Ben does a lot that doesnt always show up in the box score, but come playoff time, when teams are sagging off Ben to double Joel, that has to be infuriating to their star player lol."
The fact you didn't put Dorian Finney Smith shows me how underrated he is.
"In his last 18 games Dorian ""Joe Ingles"" Finney-Smith has a 68 TS%."
Dorian Finney Smith
Look at Dorian Finney Smith ever since our win against the Jazz and you'll see a beast.
"GG Mavs. Defense on KD was nice. Everyone but Kyrie was ass, especially Claxton and Bruce Brown. Fuck.    Dorian Finney Smith with a +23. Wtf lmao"
"Dorian Finney-Smith played some really stellar defense on KD, super underrated 3 and D guy. one of those players you could plug and play on any team in the league"
What is wrong with this commentator?? Idk what his name is but he just called Dorian Finney Smith Josh Richardson and then claimed Claxton got the tip in on an earlier play when it was Bruce Brown lol
In the past 10 game min Dorian Finney Smith has   Badly gotten beat allowing an offensive rebound to Bruce brown   Screwed up a 4 on 1 fumbling it out   Had a drive even he kind of surprised himself with   Had a great putback on some absurd hustle   Most entertaining player in this game.....exactly what TNT signed up for
rude rudy got styled on by dorian finney-smith
Dorian Finney Smith and I hate all things Mavericks.
Dorian Finney Smith
"Dorian Finney-Smith hands down, when we first got him he wasn’t great at shooting but has always played his ass off. To this day he will sneak around / crash the boards for offensive rebounds"
"Dorian Finney-Smith, although he's been hitting his 3s lately."
"gotcha. well, good. I'd love to see him get a 3-4 year deal that sets him up and is still affordable for the Dubs.  As good as he's been, I see potential for his catch and shoot volume to rise. If he can be a 40% on 3 attempts/game (he’s 42% on 1.5 attempts/game this year), he's gonna turn into an extremely valuable player.   I see some Dorian Finney-Smith in him, but with a firecracker shoved up his ass."
Mavs got a bunch of these underrated guys. Dorian Finney Smith and Brunson also really good.
Dorian Finney Smith is the Mavs 2nd best player.   Yeah I said it.

DORIAN FINNEY SMITH
Dorian Finney Smith
ONE WORD. DORIAN FINNEY SMITH.
DORIAN FINNEY SMITH
One word: Dorian Finney-Smith
DORIAN FINNEY SMITH.
Dorian Finney-Smith - 3 yrs/$12m what a fucking steal
DORIAN FINNEY SMITH
"A 3&amp;D player IMO is a player who plays above average defense or is considered an above average defender (ideally someone who can guard the opposing team's 1st or 2nd best player), isn't really creating a lot of shots for themselves or others with the ball in their hands, and their primary role on offense is limited to taking and making threes. So guys like Danny Green, Robert Covington, Pat Beverley, Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and OG Annuoby would be what I'd consider 3&amp;D players.  Some of the guys you listed are good three point shooters and defenders, but they create too much offense for themselves and/or others to be strictly seen as 3&amp;D players."
Every team could use a Dorian Finney-Smith
"&gt;Those are players who are great shooters in a system that sets them up with wide open jumpers from favorable positions  Yeah, I really like Dorian Finney-Smith, but his 3P% would be a lot lower if he wasn't getting open looks from the corner. For the record, he only has 4 unassisted threes so far this season."
Dorian Finney Smith is up there with top role players imo
"Underrated by analysts: demar derozan. Analysts act like it’s just straight up impossible to build a good team with him on it but I just don’t see why. Yes he’s not an ideal spacer or defender, but he’s an above average playmaker, takes care of the ball, is a very good scorer, and honestly it’s not like defenses treat him like Ben Simmons.  Underrated by counting stats: Jakob Poeltl (homer take but I do believe this), Dorian finney smith, Zubac  Underrated by casuals: Paul George. He does say some things that make him unlikable at times but casuals also treat him like he isn’t a top 15 player at worst.   Underrated season: Terry Rozier, Paul George again, Robert Williams (I think he’s shown promise as a long term starting center), kinda TJ McConnell."
"As a Mavs fan, I want to put forward Dorian Finney-Smith as the most underrated by counting stats. He constantly picks up the toughest defensive assignments leaving it all out there on the court, whilst also being a good 3pt shooter. On top of all that, lately he has been showing more aggression driving to the rim. All that whilst being on a steal of a contract.   Kleber is a good shout, however he has been struggling with finding his rhythm lately after returning from injury, so his production has dropped off a bit. An honorable mention on the Mavs is Jalen Brunson, who is one of, if not, the best backup-PG in the league. He is a really efficient scorer and especially good finisher at the rim considering his size. He also has a good midrange and 3pt shot whilst being a decent playmaker."
Dorian Finney-Smith. He's a super valuable piece to any team.
"That's what they did to us, have Gobert. Guard Dorian Finney Smith and then just sit in the paint. But i mean Dorian is a 38% 3pt shooter so wasn't really a smart move."

Embiid Davis or Giannis wouldn’t have got cooked by Dorian Finney Smith
"AG is a big, athletic wing with some real foot speed, which is right now the best defender against Luka, but pretty much only when paired with another really long player to double team him. That way he can't just throw a (for him) easy pass over his defenders and I don't really like Denvers options for the second guy, because I don't trust MPJ yet to do it smartly. AG would probably do a fine job, but Luka gets his.  Denver has a better way to beat Dallas, than trying to slow down Doncic and that is to kill the Mavs with Jokic owning the post. With his passing, scoring, offensive rebounding, nobody on the Mavs roster seems like a reasonable option against Nikola, except maybe a Boban surprise, but that wouldn't work for a full series.  I've seen Murray in the playoffs, but that doesn't change my opinion very specifically on his effectiveness against the Mavs, he has struggled against Dorian Finney-Smith and even Tim Hardaway Jr a lot. Denver is obviously better with Murray, but they would miss him more against pretty much every other team in the West and even without him they are imo a slight favourite against a fully healthy Dallas roster."
"Would anyone had guess that the Mavs would win by 15 and the 2 leading scorers were Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney Smith, not just for the Mavs but the entire game"
"Generally, it’s less relative to size/position, and more about the other team’s talents. The Mavs plug Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber to cover the other team’s two biggest threats, and Luka will usually cover whichever 2-4 isn’t as big of a problem. Since Luka’s defense has improved this year, I think this is mostly so that he can save more energy for offense.   That being said, he has taken tougher assignments this year (usually not PGs, to answer your question). He did a great job covering Lebron earlier this year."
"Honestly, it hurts to say it but yes.   When he’s on he’s great, but he has one of those good games so rarely. This sounds like a horrendous take, but I honestly believe Dorian Finney-Smith is a better 3 and D wing than J Rich. Doesn’t have big 20 point games like J Rich but he’s a better 3 point shooter and defender on a more consistent basis.  J Rich is a great guy and seems like an awesome teammate, but I think he’s a bench caliber wing that’s viewed as a starting caliber player. He has starter potential but he’s just too inconsistent."

"Dorian Finney-Smith has done a decent job against him the last few years, except for one game last year he had 49 against us."
Dorian Finney-Smith is way better and less talked about.
Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith. No surprise Mavs were shit while both were out with Covid and recovering from it. They do a lot of heavy lifting.
Dorian Finney Smith &gt; Simmons
Dorian Finney-Smith sure surprised me when he got on the mic. Love me some Do Do
"Luka successfully got Kawhi off him, which is why individual defense is one of the most overrated things in basketball. I'd take a decent defender that's a smidge better on offense over a top wing defender. Kawhi was more efficient because he had the better team. I watched almost every Mavs game this season. The rest of the teammates fucking suck. THJ can be good. Dorian Finney Smith is a role player. Porzingis is literally fucking useless. His best role is a decoy. Anyone saying Luka ""misused"" Porzingis doesn't know how bad he is, including our GM."
The Mavs were +5.9 with Dorian Finney-Smith on and -70.1 with DFS off in the first round.  The Clippers are +1.5 with Kawhi on and +24.5 with Kawhi off in the playoffs.  On/off and +/- are filled with noise in small samples.
"Relegate to catch and shooting? Did you want Luka to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands - the same Josh Richardson who had more turnovers than assists? Or what about noted turnover machine Dorian Finney Smith, who can barely dribble at an NBA level? Or maybe he should've let one of our 6 bigs handle the ball and playmake? Or what about Timmy, the guy who will either only shoot or drive for a layup? Maybe Jalen Brunson, who was shut down in the playoffs? That just leaves noted DNP Trey Burke and rookie Josh Green as the last 2 players in our regular season rotation - should we rely on them? LeBron in 2018 was incredible but to say that he could get this team to be more than spot up shooters is asking for a miracle."
"Against Dallas he was able to blow by any defender not called Dorian Finney-Smith any time he wanted, and got a lot of penetrations against non-factor Porzingis and slow Boban. He's not getting that against the Jazz and Gobert, so his scoring will have to revert to pull-up twos and threes (which will for sure be less open). Let's see if he manages to be efficient or goes back to being PG13%"
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O’Neal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn’t mean his contract is a better value."
"The Hawks should give this core another year.    I think they need a defensive power forward.  They should look to move Danillo Gallinari for a defense-first player in my opinion.  They can give the keys to Kevin Huerter to be the number one option off the bench.  Perhaps Serge Ibaka?  Dorian Finney-Smith?  John Collins' value looks a bit low, so they should probably hold and look to do something next offseason via a sign-and-trade."
"It's weird because during the series it seemed that Luka definitely dominated, but he also was kicking out to everyone as well...except Porzingis.     We were seeing kickouts to Jalen Brunson, THJ, Dorian Finney Smith, and even Boban.  It felt like the only time KP got the ball was when the ball would occasionally swing around from and then would reach him from someone who wasn't Luka.  Something is wrong here and I hope the team can address it."
Mavs are gonna have to package his bloated contract with 3 1st rounders and maybe Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi kleber
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
This can't be good for team chemistry. Forget about Luka. Imagine you're Tim Hardaway Jr or Dorian Finney-Smith and just got done playing your ass off for a fraction of KP money while this guy stood around.
The disrespect to Dorian finney-smith
Not even prime Michale Jordan would win with these cats. There was a 11 minute stretch that other than Luka and Dorian Finney Smith the team went 1-18.
8/10 NBA fans couldn’t tell you who Dorian Finney-Smith is.  0/10 people on the street could.  That’s your second leading scorer in game 7 🙃
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"That's true, but it's partially because the Mavs didn't attempt to use him any differently than Dorian Finney Smith. What do people expect him to do if the gameplan just parks him on the perimeter? He's never going to be as good as his contract, but if the Mavs keep him, they've gotta try to get him more involved - to take the burden off Luka and to make the offense less predictable. Get him involved in more screening actions, get him running some DHOs, get him more face-ups at the elbow where he can use his height even more. Take a page out of the T-Wolves playbook for Kevin Love. I get he hasn't been good, but if you play him like he's a second Maxi Kleber, why would you expect different results?"
Dorian Finney Smith had 4 threes. Wtf are you talking about
"You literally didn’t watch the games lmfao.   No the reason this went to 7 was Luka. 45 in game 5 or the series ends in 6.   Was game 5 not on the line?   He clamped Luka to an insane 35/11 on 40% from 3.   “Clamped”   No what won the series, as seen in game 7. One team had lots of talent. One team had Luka Doncic and some role players.   In order of points in game 7   1. Luka, 46  2. Kawhi, 28  3. Marcus Morris, 23   4. PG, 22  5. Dorian Finney-Smith, 18"
"False. Dorian Finney-Smith played his ass off. He's the sole reason why they were close at the half and at the beginning of the third. He was grabbing a bunch of offensive rebounds, making shots, making incredible defensive plays. He was the second best player out there for the Mavs."
"I don't watch a ton of Mavs games, but I feel like a lot of your supporting players are good. I think the only issue is that Porzingis is shit and can't be the second star. Hardaway, Dorian Finney-Smith, Brunson, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, and Boban all impressed me this series. Especially DFS. That's 7 quality players. Even Kleber is a pretty solid player."
Getting defended by Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons with Joel Embiid at the rim versus Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith with no reliable rim protector.
"Not even just the 2 all-stars. All the Clippers role players were great today - Jackson, Morris, Batum, Kennard, and Mann all made huge plays. For the Mavs the only other guy I felt like was making a big impact was Dorian Finney-Smith. Boban was fine in the paint but Carlisle left him in for way too long and they just kept bleeding open 3's."
"Have you seen who he’s playing with? Dorian Finney Smith, KP, THJ, Brunson, Burke, Boban, Kleber.   That’s on the front office lol. It’s a team full of average or below average role players"
it was really a Luka &amp; Dorian Finney-Smith vs the Clippers.     Luka needs more help
"Sometimes star players get shut down because the defense is game planning for them specifically. Like julius randle this year. Siakam in prior years. Embiid against Toronto. This happens every year and while concerning, it's understandable that a team game planning for a specific player can cause trouble.    Whats crazy about this series is the clippers didnt gameplan against KP. He was a complete afterthought in their defensive scheme treated no different then Dorian Finney smith. And he still couldn't score and looked completely lost.       Hes just not good"
Dorian Finney-Smith is my friend IRL
Dorian Finney Smith is playing fantastic today
[Dorian Finney Smith](https://floridagators.com/images/2015/12/14/inline_0i9u.jpg)
Dorian Finney smith has been stepping up defensively and on the boards a lot. honestly if they lose its not on him he has played good defense vs kawhi in a couple of their wins
Offensive boards  Entire Clippers team: 1  Dorian Finney-Smith: 6
Dorian Finney-Smith 2nd best guy on mavs
Dorian Finney-Smith is like Moses Malone on the offensive glass
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."
"Close outs are awful, I agree. He tends to hop from side to side with a wide stance when defending on the perimeter (assuming he's not already beat) so I still think he does a serviceable job on that end. Not sure it says anything about him getting beat by Kawhi when Kawhi is a top 5 iso player on the league and to be honest he had played better defense on Kawhi compared to the ones assigned to him (Dorian Finney Smith and Maxi Kleber)"
Man Dorian Finney-Smith has been AMAZING!
One word: Dorian Finney-Smith
Dorian Finney Smith
"Monte Morris, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Lu Dort are the top 3 contracts in the league imo"
"Uhhhhh  Luka’s team has been basically nonexistent this series. I say that as a massive Mavs fan who has watched every game. The other starters for the Mavs have been, uh, not good. Okay Dorian Finney-Smith has been *okay*."
"Not mental gymnastics when you’re the most offensively efficient team in nba history and lose in the first round. Easy answer to that problem is prioritize defense which we did. Mavs were one of the best defensive teams post All-Star break, starting line up with Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson was eating (average) guards alive. So yeah sure Josh may be missing shots now but I’d rather have him out there and have the whole lineup be super long then have Seth out there score 30 but be a turnstile on defense. Not even saying Seth is horrendous at defense but if the guards bigger and faster then him he really doesn’t stand much of a chance. Don’t just look at the box score homie watch the games lol"
Except we know that Dorian Finney-Smith is not the one driving Dallas’ success. He shares the court with Luka Doncic most of the time. We know that Damian Lillard has for the most part been a god this series
"The Mavericks have a +10.8 net rating with [Dorian Finney-Smith](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612742&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=1627827) on the court (189 minutes) and a -59.4 net rating with him off the court (51 minutes).  Also, small sample on/off stats are close to meaningless."
Dorian finney smith.  Gonna learn his name
Our roster also literally has only 1 legitimate wing in Dorian Finney Smith and he’s not super strong. Everyone else is more of a guard or big. It’s perfect for Kawhi to feast. Same thing happened last year and then Kawhi shit the bed in Denver.  Luka meanwhile is going up against multiple good/great wing defenders. And has a playmaking component that makes him impact the floor much more.
Really? We’ll see about that. Rudy had to guard Dorian-Finney Smith last time because Porzingis kills him.
Shout out to Dorian Finney-Smith for some incredible defense
Dorian Finney Smith. What a great defensive player!
"Commentators shouted out Dorian Finney Smith as the X factor for that very defensive play, he's not going to carry the team and he'll have nights where he's invisible offensively but he really is an X factor type guy that can change the course of a game and series because of plays like that on Kawhi.   And not to mention when he's on he's REALLY on offensively, but he doesn't need the points to be a major presence."
One word: Dorian Finney-Smith
Dorian Finney-Smith
"""You can score over Embiid from there but not Dorian Finney-Smith?"""
Dorian Finney Smith - played his ass off on defense
"Yeah, Luka also gave credit for the game win to Dorian Finney-Smith during his postgame courtside interview. They don't win without Luka tho"
dorian finney-smith is who kawhi leonard wants to be
Dorian Finney Smith!!! Put some respect!!!!
Finney-Smith needs to drop the Dorian and just be Finney Smith
Dorian Finney-Smith had 5 steals.  The clippers as a team had 5 steals.
Dorian Finney Smith is playing like he doesn’t belong in the NBA
Dorian Finney Smith is the best value contract in the entire league and nobody can convince me otherwise
dorian finney-smith is the only dorian that's ever played in the NBA (I think ABA as well but someone check me on that)
God dude why do they even pass to Dorian Finney Smith? Dude’s been gone all series.
"Man, it’s crazy how KP really isn’t a factor in this series. Honestly guys Dorian finney smith are way more impactful"
Dorian Finney Smith. Always liked his energy and toughness
"They already don't have rim protection really, so I think adding Sabonis improves the offense more than it hurts the defense.   Maybe they flip KP and picks for Sabonis, then start Kleber alongside Sabonis as the rim protector and floor spacer.   Luka/Tim Hardaway/Dorian Finney-Smith/Sabonis/Kleber is a better constructed roster imo"
"Sabonis does everything the Mavericks need. He scores at the rim and rebounds, he can pass the ball around and move off ball. His defense sucks, but that's about it. Ignore the ""lol Euro team"" aspect.   Maybe KP a a first for Sabonis? I could see Luka/Tim Hardaway/Dorian Finney-Smith/Kleber/Sabonis being a damn good team  Or maybe sign and trade josh richardson plus two picks for Sabonis. That lets Josh move on and clears up space for the Pacers to start Warren and Turner"
"Dorian Finney Smith was guarding Batum and collapsed on the drive, Luka complained for a second and then got back."
"As a Warrior fan, I’m jealous of the solid role players in these teams.  Brooks was a 2nd round pick. Bane is 30th I think. Niang is a 2nd rounder who can hit open shots. Royce ONeale ks undrafted.  Even Dallas got a guy in Dorian Finney Smith, who is better than fucking Wiseman and half our roster.  But then again the Warriors evaluate your ability to speak Mandarin and how well you wear a suit.   Fuckin despicable bums"

Dorian Finney-Smith.
Dorian Finney-Smith
They know that Dorian Finney-Smith will be gold on his podcast. The best interview on the Mavs.
Dorian Finney Smith was wide open
"Nothing crazy about that, Most of us clippers fans are used to these scenarios, 2014 playoffs against okc, 2015 against rockets, Last year Paul millsap playing big factor for denver in game 5 and 6. This year THJ and dorian finney smith not missing any three."
I'd say so. Our shooting staff has done an excellent job creating 3pt shooters out of nothing. Both Maxi and Dorian Finney-Smith went from non shooters to 40% from 3 over the past few years. Pretty sure Tim even said that Carlisle adjusted his form a little in his first off-season here and he's been lights out ever since.
"I think there's only really a small table of elite 3&amp;D swingmen in the league, and Jae is certainly one of them:   * Jae Crowder  * Robert Covington  * Mikal Bridges  * Marcus Morris  * Danny Green  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * OG Anunoby * Dorian Finney-Smith * PJ Tucker"
&gt;Dorian Finney-Smith on Tim Hardaway Jr.'s throwing the ball into the hoop from far  I think it's on you instead of OP to realize you're in an NBA sub lol
"I'm so fucking angry that Mavricks got Dorian Finney-Smith for that price. Ever single team I like, should have tried to pay for this guy. He should have a much better contract."
"Ty Lue is NOT a good coach, my guess is even after getting waxed in the regular season by the Mavs, he probably viewed the Mavs as: 1 really good player in Luka and a wild card in KP and he favors his duo of Kahwi + George.     The reality is the Mavs are DEEP.  THJr &amp; Jalen Brunson are 6th man candidates.  Maxi, Dorian Finney Smith, and Josh Richardson have become very polished role players.     The Mavs do have a super star, and some nights a wild card star in KP but they are just a really good team."
"Who is better? I’d rather have Luka than lebron from what I’m seeing. Imagine Luka on LA.  Tim Hardaway jr, lebron, dorian finney smith, porzingis, and josh Richardson don’t scare anybody."
"Not a Mavs fan but I watch them quite a bit. It kind of cycles, usually KP, sometimes Hardaway or Brunson, occasionally Dorian Finney Smith."
"Holding him to 9-22 FG, 1-6 3PT is getting cooked?   Last year in the playoffs Kawhi went off but not against Kleber. According to Second Spectrum, there have been 17 different occasions where an opponent has defended Kawhi on at least 100 half-court positions in a playoff series. (Since 2013-14, which is when tracking began.) Kleber in last year's playoffs held Kawhi to his third-lowest effective field goal percentage (41.4) among that group, behind only Malcolm Brogdon in 2019's Eastern Conference Finals (34.5) and Kevin Durant in the 2013-14 Western Conference Finals (39.7).   The other Mav who has spent a bunch of time on Kawhi in that series was Dorian Finney-Smith, and he got torched: Kawhi had 30 points on 66 half-court matchups with DFS, compared with 44 on 115 matchups with Kleber. His eFG% against DFS is 63.2%, which dwarfs the figure he has posted against Kleber as well.  Kawhi is a top 10 player in the league and will obviously find a way to score, but Maxi is making it as hard as anyone else for Kawhi to score."
This is a legitimate problem since Maxi is the main Kawhi defender. I think Dorian Finney-Smith would be the next man up to guard but Maxi has the experience.  I hope Maxi recovers well whatever the case. Anything dealing with Achilles stuff has me nervous so I hope he’s okay
"Guys like Dorian Finney-Smith, Royce O'Neale and Mikal Bridges are going to be such X-Factors during this playoffs. Fantastic 3&amp;D players that allow their teams to space their floor with their fantastic 3 ball but also make an impact on defence."
I mean they just had one of their best games of the year offensively and they’re a mostly offensive team. Dorian finney smith had 18 on a defensive team and he averages less than 10
extension doesn't kick in until next season.  he's making $5.3 mil this season which isn't that bad but is $1.3 mil more than Dorian Finney-Smith so not great either.
"Maxi Kleber, Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney Smith are all great defenders...  You're kind of proving my point."
DORIAN FINNEY-SMITH
"The narrative will be that they choked, but our defense was incredible down the stretch. Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith and Josh Richardson put on the clamps tonight."
Dorian Finney-Smith was undrafted....now dude is hitting big shots in the playoffs.
Dorian Finney-Smith is the best contract in the league and I will fight all of you on this.
Dorian Finney Smith is our 2nd best player
Dorian Finney Smith looks like he could be one of Avon Barksdale's goons
One word... Dorian Finney Smith
"I remembered that when Dallas played the last game versus Gobert, Dorian Finney-Smith said in the interview after the game, that they had to make adjustments just for Gobert. They tried to get him out of the box, so he cannot defend and block shots so easily."
"He did the same thing with Finney-Smith last week. Called him Josh Richardson once or twice, then just silence on a few of his big buckets. The next day on Dallas radio they played ""does Marv Albert know who the hell Dorian Finney-Smith is?"""
1. Luka   2. KP   3. Jalen Brunson   4. Tim Hardaway Jr.   5. Dorian Finney-Smith   6. Maxi Kleber   7. Dwight Powell  8. Josh Green
"Healthy KP and Kleber would put the Clippers in some awkward situations with a lot of spacing, so it's not impossible, but the Clippers offense seems so much for poor Dorian Finney-Smith to handle.   I think it's the typical puncher's chance situation."
Dorian Finney Smith
&gt;Team success matters a lot when it comes to ranking players  There's our point of disagreement I guess  I look at the Mavericks roster and Clippers roster and am shocked that series even went 6 let alone 7  It's like comparing the Grizzlies roster to the Jazz and no one clowned on the Grizzlies or Ja for losing to them  Just as I didn't believe Booker and Trae Young were trash until this year I don't think Luka is bad because he can't beat two hall of famers in their prime with Dorian Finney Smith as his 2nd best player  I can't even believe it was as close as it was
dorian finney smith and jaylen brunson have decent trade value I think
I feared for his wrists so many times. Dorian Finney-Smith tried to murder him and even after the block I thought he still might’ve.
Pat Connaughton is the white Dorian Finney-Smith
You want a Dorian Finney-Smith Jersey lol
It’s not that anybody wants to trade him. He’s just one of the few pieces we have that could provide value in a trade with KP. In order to get a quality player in return in a KP trade I think either Brunson or Dorian Finney-Smith would have to be included since they’re probably our most valuable assets outside of Luka.
"I'm biased but he's really not that bad on defense when he tries (big game, playoffs, etc). Dude is definitely a competent defender when he tries to be. He'll never be elite but he's decent for sure simply because of his size and instincts.  EPM takes into account who is on the court with the player, and Seth shares the court with elite defensive players. The best defender that Luka plays with is Dorian Finney-Smith who is pretty good but not elite. The rest of the Mavs are terrible on defense except Maxi and sometimes THJ"
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Bro Dorian Finney-Smith can actually shoot 3s and he’s only paid $4mil per year. Sixers fans would be lucky to swap Ben for him 😤😤😤
"We need a lot more than just some defense and a back up PG, unfortunately. The only other player we got who I’m happy with his role completely is Dorian Finney Smith. We are really trash outside of Luka"
"I wish I could sticky this to every Mavs thread. The only assets we have from the 2014-2018 era are Maxi and Dorian Finney-Smith (Dwight Powell is a negative asset), players who would probably play on the bench for any contending team.   Getting Luka in 2018 was absolutely incredible for Mavs fans, but it expedited our rebuild way too early and our FO was too incompetent to manage it."
"He was (a) gassed most of the time due to his offense workload and (b) overmatched. He isn't a 2-way player, he will never be a 2-way player, and in that series, of the 4 ""defensive"" guys we have, one was on Kawhi 24/7 (DFS), one was injuried (Kleber), one played himself out of the rotation (Richardson) and one was Porzingis. Luka was never meant to guard PG, just like Harden would not guard Booker in a Nets-Suns final. He held his own with dignity, he wasn't the liability he was in the early seasons and he wasn't being targeted. That's the max you can ask for your only ballhandler on defense.  Beside, this was a single series. He had a couple of really good defensive games. Charlotte, Miami, Lakers, Denver, SA, Boston. Again, he won't be an All-Defender and he won't be the brick wall Harden is, but he will be average to good as soon as next season, specially if he has any kind of help. Our best defender in the roster right now is Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith, and neither are exactly All-Defense nominees."
"Most of these are pretty solid. I’d say Suggs is more Holiday, less shooting but more athleticism. Barnes to me is more like a bigger Draymond/rich mans Rondae Hollis Jefferson to me. Not very sold on Moody, he’s probably more like Dorian Finney-Smith. Sengun to me is more like a better passing Kanter or Boban, skilled and big post scorer but lacking in other areas very important to the NBA game. Maybe ceiling Al Jefferson. Davion is most similar to Donovan in play style. Kispert maybe more similar to Buddy Hield but Joe Harris not bad overall as a comp. Bouknight and Ellis is fine. Giddey is more of a budget Kyle Anderson"
Dorian Finney-Smith at $4m/year isn't bad.
One word: Dorian Finney-Smith
"Powell is my favorite player on our team beside Luka (and maybe Dorian Finney-Smith). I fully understand his shortcomings but that man has never not balled his heart out. And when he was injured he was there on the benches, if he was able to. When his starting position was temporarily taken by Melli he was the first to stand up to celebrate a Melli three pointer (which did not happen...)          Thankfully it looks like his athleticism (arguably his strongest positive) is back. The [Luka/Powell pick and roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkGJa_s--10) was deadly, and I want to see that again next season."
"You think if Bob Voulgaris told Dorian Finney-Smith he was only allowed to score 6 points that night, he'd actually do that and just stop shooting after he hit 2 3s?  How do you think the nba works lmao, front office personnel aren't bribing players to short their own stats just to make money gambling."
Dorian Finney-Smith only making $4mm is highway robbery
"TBH some of the best 3&amp;D role players in the league have been found outta nowhere. The Jazz already found one in Royce O'Neale. There's also guys like Jae Crowder, Dorian Finney-Smith, Danny Green, Josh Hart etc."
He averaged 60%+ FG% against Dorian Finney Smith and Maxi Kleber but only 44% against Luka. Small sample size but it's not like he dominated Luka on offense.
Luka’s most reliable Robin is Tim Hardaway Jr. or Dorian Finney Smith and Jalen Brunson as Alfred.
Dorian Finney Smith
Seth Curry. Dorian Finney Smith.
"Ibaka is a waste of salary for this team. Give me Taj Gibson for the vet min $2.4MM.   I'm gonna get wild with it and move it and move Jamal Murray to the 2 and add De'Aron Fox as a second max player.   Replacing Anunoby with Crowder for the salary savings.  Also, using 2021 salary figures.  PG: De'Aron Fox ($28MM)  SG: Jamal Murray ($29.5MM)  SF: Luguentz Dort($1.8MM)  PF: Jae Crowder($9.7MM)  C: Clint Capela($17MM)  G3:TJ McConnell ($3.5MM)  G4: Alec Burks ($6MM)  Wing3: Dorian Finney-Smith ($4MM)  Wing4: Nic Batum ($2.6MM)  C2: Taj Gibson($2.4MM)"
"The Mavs healthy big three is Luka, Dorian Finney Smith, and Tim Hardaway Jr. oof."
"Come on, you can't be serious, it's amazing Luka even gets 10 assists every night. Just think about it, his scoring options are Dorian finney-smith, Tim hardaway, Jr., Josh Richardson, boban and kristaps, all whom forgets how to shoot a ball every other night. Meanwhile, Trae has Bogdan, Danilo, John Collins, Kevin huerter and Clint capela. Can't compare the two, man."
"Yeah KP, dorian finney smith, and maxi kleber should really be getting more shots! especially given how great they played this playoffs!!    /s"
"&gt; That’s weird because you also just described Dorian Finney-Smith to a T  Dorian Finney-Smith has never been on any all nba team, is not loved by analysts, does not put up the numbers that pat beverly has, and is nowhere near as loved by advanced metrics.   Literally every defensive metric shows Pat Beverly as an above average defender and a good starter. No advance metric shows that for Dorian Finney-Smith. You are so dumb."
Dorian Finney Smith
"That’s weird because you also just described Dorian Finney-Smith to a T and I would love to hear your argument that he’s *not* a role player miscast as a starter.   Dude, there’s nothing wrong with being a role player… Patrick Beverly has a role and he plays it well, weather he starts or not is irrelevant to the fact that he’s a role player. You’re not building your team around PatBev, he’s just a solid role player."
Huh so we're not trading him for Dorian Finney Smith?
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
Dorian Finney Smith is up there as well
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
You surely saw his incredible help as well right?  KP who averaged 12 on mediocre shooting  Tim hardaway who seriously cooled down after his first 2 games  Dorian Finney Smith who is a great role player but come on  &amp;#x200B;  This against Paul George and Kawhi surrounded by a great supporting cast
Wdym we're not trading Ben for Dorian Finney Smith?
"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   “I’m not saying Young or Ayton are better but it’s definitely interesting to see their teams have success…”  Come on bro, it’s not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K’von Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don’t recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he’s so big and strong. He’s an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I’m wrong."
"You are obsessed with hating on Luka judging by your post history. Also you are wrong about Luka having a better supporting cast. Lillard has played with great players like LA, McCollum, Batum, etc. Who does Luka have? An injury prone big and Dorian Finney-Smith? There’s a reason why Luka had to carry so hard in the playoffs.."
"I heard the exact same thing about Dorian Finney-Smith and Royce O’Neale  Only person that can stop PG is himself and that hasn’t been the case most of this post season, plus PG averaged 32/7/4 in 3 games this season against the Suns on 56/60/80   Bridges or Crowder can’t guard him"
"Dorian Finney Smith from the Mavs also torched Gobert at a game in the regular season, the Jazz defensive scheme is about Gobert guarding the weakest shooter on the court, the fact that a non shooter like Mann is just exploding like that its a complete anomaly and really unlucky for the Jazz on a game 7 lol."
"The ONE GAME we played at full strength against Utah this year, Dorian Finney-Smith did this exact same thing to Gobert and had one of the best games of his career in a game we won.  I cannot believe Snyder tried to run that same strategy again lmao, it’s just asking for something like this to happen"
"I feel like this says everything that needs to be said about this metric  11 - Nicolas Claxton  12  - Dorian Finney-Smith  13 - Nikola Jokic  tie 17 - Kawhi Leonard, Ben Simmons"
"Rick is great but he’s old school, he wants shit his way and the players better listen up. Rondo got traded there and quit on the team because he doesn’t like head coaches being so controlling with him.  Carlisle can be tough, there are players that just don’t work with him (like Pop) but the ones who do, he can bring the best out of them. Like Dorian Finney-Smith or Tim Hardaway Jr. I think Giannis would really jive with him."
Luka and dorian finney smith about to be the best duo in the league
"I said this elsewhere, and I’ll paste it here:  As hard as it is for me to say, because I’ve always been a huge Carlisle supporter, this might be a good thing. The Mavs roster wasn’t great this year, but it wasn’t THAT bad. They made the fifth seed in the West, and they have a first team all-NBA player.  KP played the worst basketball of his career this year, and in the playoffs he was non-existent. All of our “Rick Carlisle Reclaimation Project” guys, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Dwight Powell, did NOTHING all series long. They, and especially Jaylon Brunson, looked absolutely unprepared and scared of the big moment in the playoffs. That’s on the coach, plain and simple. It’s not like the guys haven’t been in the playoffs, they all had before! If your team is unprepared, that’s on the coach.  People said KP was in the corner by design. Carlisle has doubled and tripled down on NOT using him as a post up player, or even trying. The KP we saw in the playoffs is who Carlisle wanted him to be. This team is filled with Carlisle guys and the result was the same as last year: first round exit. Yeah, KP’s game sucked this year. But again, who is that on? Coach him up! If he won’t post up, and that’s what you want him to do, sit his ass on the bench and tell him to go lift some weights after the game. You’re the coach, he’s the player.  An extra hard-to-swallow pill is this: Rick got outcoached by Ty Lue. Ty made adjustments, sat starters, went deep in his bench when he was on the ropes. He went and played Reggie Jackson big minutes because he was killing us. What did Rick do? Nothing, he just kept letting Luka play iso ball. No set plays to get his other shooters going, no getting the ball to KP down low. In absolute fact, one could argue Rick lost us the series by sitting Luka when the Mavs were up big in quarter 1 of game 3. We had to foul to get Luka back in the game because the Clippers melted a 20 point lead in like 5 minutes. That, again, is on the coach.  The Mavs were NOT great this year, but they were a solid team with plenty of useful guys that have done things elsewhere. But in the playoffs, they looked like Luka and the Washington Generals. If Rick’s plan was to out-talent the other team, then why do we need Rick? Even I can tell Luka to “go be great”.  The Mavs need a change of scenery. So thanks for 2011, I’ll always love ya Rick, but it was time for a change."

This dude really put Nurkic in the same catagory of free agents as Dorian Finney-Smith and Drummond lol.
Mavs fans love Dorian Finney Smith. Dude plays hard and isn’t afraid of anybody.
2016: Dorian Finney-Smith  2017: Bam  2018: Luka  2019: Lu Dort  2020: Immanuel Quickley
"I wish we could trade out Tim Hardaway Jr. for a starter quality PF.   I like THJ, but Dorian Finney-Smith, THJ, and Bullock all seem to play similar roles, with Bullock probably a middle point between THJ's better offense and DFS's defense."
"Lakers: I really covet Dorian Finney-Smith. 3 and D on a really team-friendly contract, can guard bigger wings, and he came through for Dallas in these last playoffs."
"Damn, seeing these estimates really puts into perspective how insane it is that we got Dorian Finney-Smith (at least average, I'd argue slightly above) on a 3 for 12"
Dorian Finney-Smith is up there
Yes but it’s LUKA’s fault that Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson aren’t all-stars. If Luka just passed them the ball more they’d become great ballhandlers!! /s
"As Dorian Finney Smith would say, They’ll shoot the shit out the ball like they always do"
"[BREAKING] Lakers sign-and-trade Dennis Scrotum to Mavericks for Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, and a second round pick."
Dorian Finney Smith
The Hawks are better. Would you trade Clint Capela for Maxi Kleber? Dorian Finney-Smith for Danilo Gallinari? Tim Hardaway Jr. for Bogdan Bogdanovich?
"If they are a big three. I am really excited for the Dallas Big three of Luka, Boban, and Dorian Finney Smith!"
In no order:  1. bagley 2. Poku 3. Frank Ntilikina 4. Dorian finney-smith 5. LiAngelo Ball
"Next one of these leaks will be Sixers asked for Luka, Dorian Finney Smith and a 2028 FRP for Simmons.   The Mavs quickly turned down the offer."
well offer you guys maxi kleeba and dorian finney smith for lebron or ad
"Except Dorian Finney-Smith has gotten better. He averaged 10 points per game on 61% true shooting. His three point percentage has gone from 31% to 39.4% on 5 attempts per game.   And, Jalen Brunson in his 3rd season got legit 6MotY consideration, he averaged 13/3.4/3.5 on 52/41/80  His true shooting has gone from 55% to 62% in 3 seasons, while increasing his scoring  No, none of those guys will be enticing for a star, but they’ve improved."
"I don't understand why they don't pepper in a few role players in the Team USA roster. Someone like Dorian Finney Smith, for example. Sure, he's not the most talented player in the world, but he knows his role and his talent level compared to other teams in the Olympics is still pretty high."
The only way they’re getting Dorian Finney-Smith is if they send Beal the other way lol
Keep away from Dorian Finney-Smith. He is still under contract at a super cheap rate.
Dorian Finney smith is crazy underrated.   Mavs would be insane to not re-sign him long term.   I would love him on Lakers. Please come DFS
"I watched almost all of the Mavs games during the regular season + playoffs and Josh Richardson had so many opportunities to handle the ball and create for himself + catch and shoot from Luka, he did terrible in most of them, in such a way we had to progressively cut his minutes as the season went on because he was such a liability on offense his defense didnt make up for it. By the time the playoffs arrived he almost got no minutes and his confidence was completely shot.  This has nothing to do with fit with Luka or Brett Brown, the guy is straight up not that good, period, he had the ball on his hands plenty of times to create or assist, he was not Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi Kleber just waiting for a 3 standing still, he was just bad."
"NBA website for defensive tracking. You can go to Luka's profile &gt; Stats &gt; Matchups (Playoffs) &gt; Head to Head. You can see that he held Kawhi to 21 points over 7 games on 43% FG shooting. If you do the same with Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith, you'll see that they let Kawhi score at above 60% FG shooting."
Dorian Finney-Smith. He always plays so hard.
"KP, Finney-Smith, and a few picks, who says no? Shame about Dorian he was ballin"
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
"Not a superstar but he’s shouted out Dorian Finney-Smith, who’s ended up being one of the best role players in the NBA."
"That makes a whole lot more sense lol  I see ""DFS"" in the context of the Dallas Mavericks and I assume it's about Dorian Finney-Smith."
The fuck? What’s your problem with Dorian Finney-Smith? He seems like a very inoffensive person to me.
Luka has been absolutely insane in the playoffs so far in his career against the fully healthy Clippers(who probably would’ve went to the finals if fully healthy)and almost beat them with his second best player being Dorian Finney Smith.
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
 Dorian Finney Smith
My guy Dorian Finney Smith is coming. Best believe that
So since the Mavs main lineup this past season was either Luka/Richardson/Dorian Finney-Smith/Kleber/Porzingis (or THJ instead of Richardson) are you saying that the Mavs did not start or play a PG for the vast majority of their minutes this season? Or is DFS the PG since he was their main PG defender?
No. Dorian Finney Smith plays SF on the mavs
"Some Mavs fans want Dorian Finney-Smith to be Scottie Pippen Mk II so badly. It's like ""He's 28 years old and as good as he's ever going to be, get over him""."
"Obvious answer is Luka, but aside from that probably Dorian Finney-Smith. He's on a super team friendly deal and plugs a lot of the holes that the Mavericks have. I would hate to see him go."
Dorian Finney-Smith
"Current Player: Dorian-Finney Smith     All Time: JJ ""The Lebron Stopper and Miss Universe Slayer"" Barea"
"3P% does not equal three point ability. Dorian Finney-Smith had a higher 3P% than Luka too, but almost all of them were open and more than 90% were assisted."
"I'm pretty sure he means Dorian Finney-Smith, whom probably doesn't deserve to have his name abbreviated like everyone is just gonna recognize it a la SGA"
Royce O'Neal  Dorian Finney-Smith  Jae Crowder
"The Timberwolves need to trade Beasley. Yes he’s a nice in case of emergency scoring option but D Lo, Antman and KAT should be a good enough core. The Magic probably laugh and hang up the phone but I’d love to see them trade Beasley plus McDaniels plus maybe 2 or 3 1sts for Isaac. He would pair up nicely with KAT and be huge on defense and then they could get a 3 and D wing like Dorian Finney Smith."
Dorian Finney-Smith more like Dude Fucking Sucks
"Dorian Finney-Smith: tough defender, 39.4% from 3, good chemistry guy for 4 mil.  Edit: not a Nurkic level player, but bang for your buck wise"
"We’ve never seen Luka play with guys worth passing to. This was the exact same criticism lobbed at Lebron and Jordan when they were both putting up huge numbers as young players while still losing playoff series. They got dragged for not passing enough, even though their team’s objectively stunk. Then they got surrounded by great casts and their team play flourished.  Weak, weak argument to pretend like Luka not passing to Dorian Finney-Smith enough is the problem."
"yes to be honest Dorian finney-smith to me, i dont get why hes a starter"
"Dorian Finney-Smith posted up four times in one game. He posted up twice all last season combined. There are degrees to 2002 BS, and Chauncey is but an amateur compared to Kidd."
"He's been horrible, but it's not because of him , trust me , I was one of the few fans that roasted the shit out of him for his 4th quarters last playoffs and his begging of season. It's the lack of spacing, and how as soon as he doesn't have the ball, literally nothing is being run through him.mf we have been posting up DORIAN FINNEY SMITH IN THE FUCKING POST."
"I'd rather have him post up then 3 and D player fucking Dorian Finney smith. Fuck Me I can't even watch it anymore, this team was literally built for a small ball 5 out offense Pg-luka Sg-tim hardaway jr. Sf-Reggie Pf-Dfs C-tingus pingus   Yes our defense would be awful, but the offense, just please don't make me watch Dfs posting up again."
Great offensive rebounding by Dorian Finney Smith.  He should be rewarded with a post up.
Dorian Finney Smith
Dorian Finney-Smith
Don’t forget Dorian Finney Smith post up. Man was on a mission in the post too
"I know in general nobody should be panicking after one game, but I think in this case the mavs should be panicking  yeah the hawks are good, but they looked totally outclassed as a team  they have the same roster as last year basically.  their big acquisitions were spot-shooter reggie bullock and frank ntilikina who is not a NBA caliber player.   they already have THJ to fill the spot shooter role so why go for bullock  dwight powell is not a NBA starting caliber player anymore and yet they don't have anyone else to start over him.   he gives them almost nothing on either end of the floor.  dorian finney smith is a total crapshoot from night to night what you will get.     KP is actually one of their least concerns because while he's a fundamentally flawed player at least he and luka have really nice PNR chemistry which will probably be their main scoring engine this season  they are not moving in the right direction and they probably don't have any chance to win the championship with this roster.  they don't have enough assets to get a game-changing wing player that they need to replace powell  they have the same issues as last year except with worse coaching, what are their options to improve as a team?   at least the cowboys are good I guess"
"It wasn't because Luka had one bad game. If Luka shoots 11/17, and 7/7 from 3 the Mavs still lose by double digits. It's because the shots that the offense was seeking were really terrible; sending the ball to Porzingis and Dorian Finney-Smith to post-up is terrible."
"Yeah posting up Dorian Finney Smith and Kristaps Porzingis and letting Powell and Cauley Stein take jumpers is the definition of ""great looks"""
"Nobody on our team was hitting anything. Were we supposed to keep forcing it to Dorian Finney-Smith or something?  Give Atlanta their credit, they didn’t let any of our guys get in a rhythm."
"Obviously Luka was terrible today, but if this was any indication of how the offense will look this season, it's gonna be brutal. Fom watching literally the most efficient offense of all time to back-to-back possessions of Dorian Finney-Smith postups (had more tonight than the entirety of last season btw) in a matter of 2 years...  Yeah, of course it's not feasible for Luka to have a billion % usage every game, but trying to tone it down with essentially running back the same roster they've had for the third year in a row that's already shown is incalaple of doing it just is trying to cure the symptom, and not the actual disease. Cuban even fucking said in an interview before the offseason that the main goal was to bring in another ball-handler, and yet this massive glaring issue was not addressed at all. Luka and Dragic were almost begging to play together in the media, but they couldn't even get that done, instead they got in two spot-up shooters, who cannot even do that, because their spacing is fucking horrendous now."
That was not on Tim. Tim is playing defense on Bogdanovic. That was a foul bait on Dorian Finney-Smith.
"That's Dorian Finney-Smith, not THJ"
why is dorian finney smith dribbling
Carlisle:  post up is just not a good play anymore   Kidd:  I will literally call post ups for Dorian Finney-Smith
"This is actually a very interesting question for the Mavs since it was a year post-championship after Cuban didn't bring Tyson Chandler back.  11-12: Jason Kidd / Vince Carter / Shawn Marion / Dirk Nowitzki / Brendan Haywood   21-22: Luka Doncic / Tim Hardaway Jr / Dorian Finney Smith / Maxi Kleber / Kristaps Porzingis   &amp;#x200B;  I think I'd take the current starting lineup over the champion defending lineup, especially since that team was dealing with the Lamar Odom issues."
"Obvious mavs bias here but THJ and Dorian finney-smith, but I don’t really think of THJ a role player cause he’s like our third star."

"[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  So basically overrated is Thaddeus Young and Dorian Finney Smith, while underrated is Giannis in this case"
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
"Cant wait for Luka to drop the most incredible season of all time going 75-7 dropping 40/11/11 in the Finals with Dorian Finney Smith as the 2nd best player, winning MVP and after 3 days, leaks from TMZ expose Luka for being a white supremacist pedophile."
"If we are talking realistic options, then   I'd give you Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney smith, and 3 first.   Honestly. Ben Simmons and Luka don't fit well if Ben Simmons wants to keep the ball in his hands."
"So I'm assuming this includes all the way back to 99  Josh howard Devin Harris JJ barea Jalen brunson Dorian Finney smith Jae crowder   Dallas did fuck up big time though and really messed up. Especially in 2013. We had the 13th pick. Traded down to 16th to save money (missed out on Giannis) then traded down again to save more money (missed out on Schroeder) and ended up drafting Shane fucking Larkin at 18th (missing out on gobert)  And before you say we didn't scout those guys, we wanted Giannis and ended up going a different direction bc Cuban. Shroeder was being talked about in local media. And gobert was being touted as a sleeper pick by several Mavs centric outlets."

Dorian Finney-Smith  Apparently this thread thinks there’s like 10 dudes in the NBA.
This is why it’s important for solid defensive players to figure out what they can do on offense and learn to do it really well. Dorian Finney-Smith for the Mavs came into the league with very little skill on offense. Wasn’t a great shooter couldn’t dribble or pass and would often times looked a bit lost out there. He’s worked on his game every year and now he’s a very good spot up shooter and generally plays smart. A lot of guys in position would’ve been out of the league by this point in their careers but instead he’s a starter that averages over 30 minutes a game.
"Every time I hear about Minny’s package, I’m surprised that they think they can get it done. I would rather have what the Kings are selling, or McCollum or Brogdon.  Hell, if you want Malik Beasley I’ll give you Dorian Finney Smith and call it a day lol (I know cap doesn’t work)"
"Well we need some people on our roster to put the ball on the floor. He also really isn't too bad at it. You cannot have only one guy pressuring the rim and expect to succeed. It's not gonna be Maxi Kleber/Dorian Finney Smith/Reggie Bullock/Dwight Powell/Willie Cauley Stein/Josh Green putting the ball on the floor. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Porzingis need to be able to attack the rim."
"“A PG is the guy who defends PGs” is a very very bad concept. First of all, it requires endless amounts of circular reasoning. Second, it would make Dorian Finney-Smith who’s not really allowed (or able to) dribble or pass a PG — which is just ridiculous."
So is Tim Hardaway Jr or Dorian Finney-Smith our point guard? That makes no sense.
"Dallas runs a Lineup of : Luka, THJ, Dorian Finney-Smith, KP and Maxi  Who is the pg then, if it isn't Luka?"
"Our same role players (Tim Hardaway, Dorian Finney-Smith, Brunson, even KP) are all playing the same role and shooting well below their averages from the last couple seasons. It’s not like Bullock or Sterling Brown handled the ball a lot for the Knicks/Rockets either. If you ask those guys to dribble the ball, you’re in trouble. I have no explanation."
"Willie Cauley Stein became our starting center... He was cut by the 20 win Warriors. Our center rotation is legitmately one of the worst I have ever seen.   Houston and Orlando can barely win games but they still have Wendell Carter, Mo Bamba or Christian Wood, Sengun, and Daniel Theis, all who are infinitely infinitely better than Powell, WCS, and Moses Brown. Boban is effective in very specific situations that come about like once every 10 games.   That being said, I think Dorian Finney-Smith definitely gets minutes off the bench for the Suns and Jalen Brunson is one of the best backup point guards in the league. Issue is Brunson is straight up our number 3 option and third best player and Finney Smith is our main perimeter and wing defender, and honestly one our more important shooters with how bad Hardaway/Bullock have been.   Hardaway and Bullock need to get it going so our shooting can at least start to cover deficiencies some games. I think both are capable of being very solid players as we saw from both of them last season."

"Interesting post. I've been thinking along those lines. Can we just bring CJ on from the bench? I honestly think one of the biggest problems with the starting lineup is there are too many mouths to feed(okay..I know it can't realistically happen).   I'd love a starting lineup of Dame, Norm, Nas(Not saying he is starting quality right now but he is a way better fit as the on ball stopper this team needs with low touches), Cov, Nurk and bench lineup of CJ, Ant(as PG so that CJ doesn't blow up the offense isoing), Nance + whatever works for the night from Snell/Zeller/DSJ.  Re trade- from everything we have heard(podcasts with reporters etc), it seems like the team is primed for a trade to bring the wage below luxury tax. I'd happily swap CJ for 2 role players(Dorian Finney-Smith + Brunsen(too much??)? SlowMo + a good defensive playmaking guard to pair with Ant? Jerami Grant??) I'll take anything...I just can't watch this defense and ISO anymore  &amp;#x200B;  p.s I know CJ is a very very good player...just don't think he is a good fit for the Blazers"
"The duality of Jason Kidd, on one hand he’ll have Dorian Finney-Smith post up, and on the other hand KP is going fucking crazy under him this season"
Who do yall think the Mavs should trade for then immediately release Dorian-Finney-Smith?  * Marvin Bagley * Goran Dragic * Chris Boucher * Bradley Beal * Other
"AKA ""please forgive Dorian Finney-Smith, KP, and Reggie Bullock for any bad shooting."" Those dudes' shots all look like line-drives."
"Do you guys understand Luka is only 22 and on his 4th season?     Giannis didn't even make an all-star team let alone a 20+ppg season until his 4th season. Same thing w/ Jokic.     Luka has 2x all-nba 1st teams already while averaging 25.7/8.4/7.7 for his career. He led the Mavs to 7 games against the Clippers w/ Kawhi and Paul George while averaging 35.7/7.9/10.3. His supposed #2 Porzingis disappeared averaging 13ppg for the series and averaged less rebounds at 7'3"" than Dorian Finney-Smith.  He might not be the 'greatest player of all-time' but he certainly has the tools and drive to be talked about amongst the greats when all is said and done."
Luka  Tim Jr  Tingus Pingus  Maxi Kleber  Boban  Dorian Finney Smith  Jalen Brunson  Sterling Brown
"It’s common, but do most NBA fans that are not Mavs fans know who Dorian Finney-Smith is? I guess it’s possible that a lot of people on the sub do, but it’s not like he’s one of the 100 best or most recognizable players in the league or anything"
Does everyone not call Dorian Finney Smith DFS? I feel like it’s expected to call guys with a commonly used middle name or a hyphenated last name or whatever by their initials.
We’ve been running the exact same starting lineup of Luka - THJ - Dorian Finney Smith - KP - Dwight Powell for two years now and we will continue to do so until the end of time.
"Aside from early championship Steph Curry, probably one of the biggest (non-rookie) bang for your buck contracts that I have seen in the last 10 years. I would say ""that I have ever seen"" but I don't want the uncles to murder me.  &amp;#x200B;  (Honorable mention to Dorian Finney-Smith)"
"Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith and Luka almost play exclusively together. Dwight is a 9th/10th man and DFS has been atrocious shooting the ball early. Luka hasn't been great but it's hard to have a Plus Minus stat that is good when you are playing with two deadweight teammates and +/- is such a team stat."
/r/Mavericks said he was a SG version of Dorian Finney-Smith
it’s especially bad with 3P shooting numbers. people need to see how these guys are getting their shots off. Duncan Robinson shooting 37% from 3 is completely different than Dorian Finney Smith shooting 37% from 3
"No. Luka Doncic spent a total of 14:22 mins on Kawhi, over 7 games, the third highest on Mavs the last playoffs.  He allowed him to shoot 54.5%. Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith spent more time than Luka on Kawhi. Maxi for 38:26, while allowing 63.2% and Dorian guarding him for 29:48, and allowed 68%.   The year before that, Luka spent 9:17 mins guarding him,  4th highest on the Mavs. He allowed 62%, but for only 8 shots. DFS spent 28:12 on him, and allowed 41.4%. Maxi spent 27:07 and allowed 50%, but on a significantly higher number of 56 shots, the most shots he attempted against, besides Jerami Grant.  For Nuggets, Jerami Grant spent the most time defending him, with 56:13, the most by any player. He also allowed 43.9%, attempting 57 shots.  Jokic guarded him for 8:55, allowing 53%, on 26 shots.  Murray guarded him for 8:55, allowing 56% on 16 shots.   So your point about Luka guarding Kawhi for ""good amount of mins"" isn't even true. And it seems that it was Grant who did the most of the guarding on Kawhi, and doing a good job. Grant would probably be the second best player on Mavs. This has nothing to do with Jokic, it's just that Nuggets had a better team."
"Don't forget Dorian Finney-Smith has been horrifically bad too. He gets left wide open more than anyone else in the league and is still shooting like 25% from 3. Two of our starters are complete ass and another one, KP, just doesn't really fit with Luka. We need a shake up so bad. At this point trade anyone other than Luka, I don't even care anymore."
One word: DORIAN FINNEY-SMITH!!
"&gt; Dorian Finney-Smith  Literally said above I would happily pull the trigger on DFS + 2 FRPs for Turner.  A Luka/Brunson or THJ/Bullock/KP/Turner, with THJ or Brunson and Maxi having starter minutes off the bench is our best iteration."
"I've been open to trading either of Turner or Sabonis for ages - the issue is though that if we traded either, we'd be looking for a defensive-minded stretch-4 back and those players are about as rare as someone with Turner's skillset. We got close apparently with the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T.  Here's a list of forwards I'd think be a great fit next to Sabonis - pretty much none of them are available:  Johnathan Issac, Marcus Morris, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith, Aaron Gordon, Robert Covington  PJ Washington is about the only player I could see a realistic trade for.  We'd have to be high on PJ (I am, I don't know if many others are). For what it's worth, Miles Bridges erupting to start the season has made him more expendable. Apparently Charlotte's tried a few times to offer PJ and a 1st for Turner and I think that's a realistic return.  I'd also like Harrison Barnes, but he's on a hot-streak right now."

"You’re right honestly, Jokic + Luka would be insane, IMO Kevin Durant would also be a better fit than Dorian Finney-Smith, Mavs should really work to get a big 3 of them together."
"Not good. He's trying to implement an offense style that just doesn't work with our roster. He doesn't want Luka to be heliocentric a la James Harden in Houston, which I get and think is a good thing, but we can't afford to not have Luka dominate. Instead Kidd is posting up Dorian Finney Smith or Sterling Brown. Additionally he's playing Dwight Powell and Porziņģis at the same time, and we are playing Porziņģis in the midrange/lowpost. The paint is filled 90% of the time which makes Luka's drives useless.  He has good intentions, like passing the ball around, not relying solely on Luka, but so far it's been fairly unsuccessful. The rotations are bad to mediocre and he's dealing with a flawed and injured roster.  He does seem to have really helped Jalen Brunson's game though so that's a plus.   Overall I'd say 3/10. Carlisle was around an 8/10 while coaching Luka. He got every inch from the 19-21 Mavs, but it wasn't sustainable in the playoffs."
Mavs did that for Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith. Also added benefit of making them seem less attractive to other teams since other teams don’t get to see them play as much.
"Honestly have you watched all our games?  Our three point percentage is bad because we’re not generating open looks like we used to. Dorian Finney Smith is not really a great shooter, he just would get a whole lot of wide open shots.   Part of why Luka is having off nights is that Kidd insists on starting Powell who now does not have the athleticism to be a roll man and instead just clogs the paint preventing Luka from being aggressive at attacking the paint when he is in the game."
