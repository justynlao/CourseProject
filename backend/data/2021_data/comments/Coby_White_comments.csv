"Coby White, real name no gimmicks."
"Zach's on-ball defense is actually decent (in spurts) this season. However, Coby White is the 4th worst defender among guards in the NBA - only worse are Lillard, DLo, and LouWill based on Defensive RAPTOR.   Meanwhile, Garrett Temple is the best-rated defender on our team. He should be starting over Coby in order to complement Zach's game. Coby can still play more minutes, but it's not a good idea to play Coby and Zach together"
"Coby White, Garrett Temple, Patrick Williams or Otto Porter Jr, Thaddeus Young, Wendell Carter Jr. Not the worst pretty good."
"This has gotten ridiculous.  The worst offender are Coby White, Luka, Trae Young and Harden. Those guy stop the ball with their hand underneath ten plus times a game then continuation dribble....that is not a hesitation dribble, that is a travel."
You say you hate Coby White or Lauri in Bulls subreddit guys are saying ‚Äúimagine thinking this about 20 and 23 year old players.  You say you want Oladipo to pair with Lavine.    ‚ÄúWhy are you like this?‚Äù  Dudes like players who score.  Even if they are not winning players you may not point out that the offense does not make up for the lack of defense with certain players.  Haters gonna hate.
Harrison Barnes or Coby White for UNC.
Coby White for UNC
"I think Coby White may be a bigger problem than Bulls fans want to admit right now. Not terribly efficient as a scorer, not a good defender... seems like the recipe for a Sixth Man."
"Bulls fan here, and I‚Äôm really high on Coby White. This seems a little unpopular with our online fan base right now, but I‚Äôm excited to see him grow into a starting PG."

Coby white
Coby White is my dudeee
Coby White
"I'm still convinced the Bulls should have drafted this kid instead of Wendell Carter Jr at the #7 pick during that draft year.  The Bulls were just starting their rebuild having blown up the roster the season before, so taking a chance on an injured former consensus #1 overall draft pick was a very low risk, high reward move for them.  They would have had to redshirt him his first year like Denver did, but that would have netted them a better draft pick the subsequent year (it was #7 again, Coby White) and they could have rolled in to last year with Dunn, Markkanen, LaVine, Porter, and a top 5 pick from 2019 heading in to last year."
"So, one more caveat here is that for somebody to negatively impact your team, there has to be a demonstrable negative to playing them...  If you're absolute shit, like the Pistons or Wizards or Wolves, replacing one terrible player with an average guy doesn't really change the outcome of your season.  Secondly, if you're just some minimum-salary scrub pressed into service, there was no opportunity cost to your acquisition. Draft capital, trade capital, or financial capital outlay matters.    With that in mind, some possibilities:  Kelly Oubre. Expensive as fuck because of the tax, cost something to acquire via trade, totally awful.  Coby White. Absolutely terrible on both ends, two years in a row, after being a high lottery pick. Plays a ton of minutes, and they're all bad.  Marvin Bagley. Not only has he been completely fucking terrible, picking him over Luka, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Bridges, MPJ, JJJ...fucking unbelievable.  Tristan Thompson...man does he totally blow. The Celts used their one FA asset on a guy who's been awful."
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3. Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."
"Everyone is allowed to have creative differences.   Here is mine. No one wants to play with a ball hog.  Having 5 assists and 7 turnovers one game then 8 turnovers and 6 assists and then 10 assists and 5 turnovers does not mean you are not a ball hog.   Creative difference number 2. Trae Young puts his hand under the ball, the ball stops and then he continues dribbling almost every time he has the ball.  That was a travel, is a travel in the rulebooks, and was supposed to be a focus of being called the last few years.  Luka is also bad with it.  Coby White packs a suitcase and does it."
"We all know Zach can ball, where's the Coby White highlights"
I‚Äôd say above as well. What about Coby White in a year or two?
"This is super unpopular with the fanbase but I wouldn't mind trading him now for a great return. His value will never be higher and I still don't believe him and Coby White can be success at a high level in the long run  To be fair to him he's improved a lot and his stats this year are insane, but I do believe he's closer to ""empty calories"" than Bulls fans would ever admit. I'm not saying he can't be a winning player or anything in the right situation, but his BBIQ is still really questionable. I kinda hope AK is the ruthless type that isn't afraid to make an unpopular move, if the price is right of course"
You'll take Coby white and Lauri Markennen and like it
"i feel like not enough people talking about my man coby ‚Äúcrabman‚Äù white tho  i swear i can‚Äôt watch him play without my mind telling me he‚Äôs a future star, his game is so fluid and clean, reminds me of jamal murray a lot"
Coby White and Zach Lavine
"Every Dubs game and good national TV matchups. Also some random Bulls and Hornets games bc my fantasy team has Lavine, Coby White, Lamelo, and PJ (+ they‚Äôre actually pretty fun teams to watch this year)"
"Brown benefits from playing alongside Smart and Tatum - two guys who can be primary ballhandlers and let him play off-ball. Lavine plays with a 20-yr old Coby White who isn't a great facilitator (..yet) and a bottom 5 defender in the NBA. Lavine is the better scorer and facilitator so far this season, while Brown is a better defender. Brown still deserves to be an allstar, but it's hard to say he's better than Lavine, who balled out against elite teams like Lakers and Clippers"
"&gt;lauded for it's depth  It's not as deep as 2018 or 2019.  2019 had Zion, Ja, De'andre Hunter, Coby White, Hachimura, Garland, Reddish, Cam Johnson, Herro, NAW, Brandon Clarke, Paschall, THT, Matisse, PJ Washington, Kevin Porter Jr"
It's zach Levine followed by coby white
"From what I've noticed:   Coby White up to 6-5 from 6-4.  Wendell Carter up to 6-10 from 6-9.  BI up to 6-8 from 6-7.  DMitch down to 6-0 from 6-1.  De'Andre Hunter is now 6-8,   Dwight is back to 6-10,   Ben Simmons up to 6-11.   Shai gained an inch (6-6).    Melo down to 6-7.   Derrick Favors down to 6-8 from 6-9.  Surprisingly, Shaq Harrison stayed at 6-7. Mentioning bc he said that he was 6-4 when asked last year.  Kuzma now at 6-10 from 6-8.  Again, possible that I missed people, I only checked the ones that sounded different to me."
Coby white dribbles like he‚Äôs manifested himself into a sidewinder and I love every moment of it
Coby White
Coby White
Coby White. I believe in Lavine more than White and struggle to see a future with both of them
If someone told you that :  -Luka would drop 36/16/15  -Lavine and Coby White would have a COMBINED 10 points  -Porzingis would get 20 points  and still the Bulls win..... I would say this is STILL more likely than the Knicks blowing out Boston by 30 points.
this was a bad game to pick coby white over points
Coby White isn‚Äôt good at that?
"Evaluation year for Coby White to see if he can be our point guard of the future and part of the core. It‚Äôs been a hit or miss (mostly miss) because he‚Äôs a scoring guard through and through, but he‚Äôs also only 12 games into his new role. Growing pains I guess."
"the thing about minnesota drafting is that in 2019 when they traded up for culver, i knew coby white was going to be pretty good."
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Junior, Denzel Valentine, Tomas Satoransky, Patrick William, Gafford (idk his first name)"
&gt; Coby white is a role player that should come off the bench.  Damn. I don't watch Bulls games so what changed so suddenly because I've seen this become a prevailing opinion as of late.
In theory coby white is the exact type of pg youd want ben to play with
Coby white is a role player that should come off the bench.
Lauri Markannen and Coby White need to be traded yesterday.
And Coby White is playing winning basketball?
Kyle Lowry over Coby White üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ. Can't take this seriously.
Yeah he was pretty good defending Shai but then Shai started abusing Coby White
Tell me why Coby White is averaging less of literally every stat known to man on worse efficiencies then
Coby White has been better than Kyle Lowry this year lol
Are coby White or Tyler Herro‚Äôs arms more Trex?
Having Coby White as his point guard is not helping him.
"AD isn‚Äôt the 2nd best player in the NBA lmao. My point is if you‚Äôre not gonna enough to be the 2nd option next to the best player in the world, you clearly are t a true 2nd option for a contender. Why are the Bulls one of the worst teams in the league if Lavine is as good as you think he is? They‚Äôre a very talented team. They‚Äôre playing Otto Porter Jr off the bench. Coby White is for real, Carter and Markannen are having bounce back seasons. Williams is going to make an all rookie team. Young and Temple are real NBA vets."
Coby white food I just wish he was more consistent
Bulls. They‚Äôre playing some great bball. Coby White is super fun to watch

Cuz Coby White has 1/4 the wingspan of SGA.
"The TNT guys are one thing, but it drives me up a wall when the actual analysts and play-by-play guys get names wrong, whether it's pronunciation or just simply not knowing the right name. I watched some of a Pacers game the other day, and I'm pretty sure the away team commentator kept calling Edmond Sumner ""Edwin."" Sure, he's not a star player, but he's been in the league four years and your job is to know this stuff. I hear Coby White get called Colby a lot too."
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
What if we threw in Coby White? You would also have to pick up Otto Porter to make the cap work out. Last year of the deal and has been pretty good when healthy
"Lol. Looks at Mitch Trubisky, one of the bottom 10 QBs in the league. That's like Coby White making it last year."
"Even a committed Kyrie doesn‚Äôt really do much for the Bulls. They‚Äôre fully rebuilding. Kyrie, while clearly better, plays extremely similarly to Coby White, who the bulls obviously want to develop."
"Thats the difference a playmaker and a scorer has on the team. There are plenty of roles in basketball and can you honestly name a scenario where an out and out scorer has ever improved his team more than a team who has a playmaker who's on exactly the same level. For every LaVine you get a Kemba Walker, Kemba walker is more important to winning and can affect the whole team more through his plays, but LaVine's role isn't an uneeded one, I've never seen a team thats come close to contending that hasn't had a 25+ PPG scorer a night on their team. Undoutbedly the Bulls will need someone better than LaVine to be in automatic contention for a ring but LaVine fills a gap we need and we'd be stupid if we think there's anyone in the league we could realistically replace him with.  Coby White has the potential to be a scorer as good as LaVine IMHO but you'd be literally throwing away Zach on the hopes that White is just as good, that doesn't make sense to me. Zach needs to improve his playmaking and defence a slight more and he could definitely be on a contending team, however it would take a stupid offer to even get talks going, we won't be able to replicate what LaVine brings to the table so easily."
Im somewhat surprised that Coby White is top 10.
"Coby White is only one of the lot who has shown anything substantial, the rest are full of question marks.    Pat-Will is still small sample sizes (although I do like what I see), I'm not 100% sold on WCJ even though I'm quite high on him &amp; I'm not convinced that maxing Lauri would be a good move  Idk about you, while I like the young Bulls that isn't exactly a core that screams high ceiling and everyone should be on their timeline."

Coby White and Shaquille Harrison
"Stats doesnt show the whole picture. Coby has been playing better off the ball and he gets a good portion of assist off hockey assist, right now I thinks he is shooting great off ball.   White isnt a great playmaker, but recently Donavon has been splitting playmaking skills between Lavine and Valentine too. This let's coby play to his strengths off shooting and develop pg skills"
"Coby White isn't a pg, he's a sg. Our team is pushing his playmaking development to go along with his offensive skills, so far he's shown to be a great scorer but now a playmaker."
We don‚Äôt do ourselves any favors with turnovers. Also refs fucking hate us for some reason. Zubac nearly killed Coby White and they swallowed their whistles. Our guys are putting their bodies on the line just to get nothing from the officials.
Coby White are you seriously lol
Westbrook isn‚Äôt better than any teammate Lavine has.  Why do you keep saying that?  Coby White is very easily a better player than Westbrook
Coby White is the worst rated defender in the league rn
They looked pretty good against the Clippers. Almost pulled out the win. I really like COBY White.
"Do you think the Bulls are one superstar away from seriously contending? Or should we give them 2 more years for the younger players to learn? I honestly believe in the Bulls, really wish for them to go back to the playoffs again. I'm very excited about Coby White and Zach, and is watching Patrick Williams."
"Dang, I like Coby White."
The refs are not the reason Bulls gonna lose this game. Coby White being unable to handle a basketball  on the other hand.
I NEED THAT ZU REPLAY. HUGE BLOCK ERASED COBY WHITE THEN THUNDERED DOWN FOR THE DUNK
Coby White MIP?
"I wanted us to draft Rui, but I'm happy with Coby White and Pat Will (both who will be better than Rui, Coby already is). I just like his old school playstyle because I'm old school,  call that a ""hive"" all you want idc."
Oof Coby White worst defender in the game
Coby White deserves a shoutout as well
Coby White
Coby white looks like andrew wiggins mom told you have from home
Coby white looks like andrew wiggins mom told you have from home
Now Coby White has Scoreiasis! He caught it from Lavine! Woooo! Someone call up the doctor and get them a prescription for Cosentyx!
Coby White that was incredible lmao
Can‚Äôt convince me that Coby White and Tyron Woodley aren‚Äôt long lost brothers
Ducking Coby White smh
"Lol what are you talking about? You‚Äôre delusional if you think the hawks have exceptionally better young talent. WCJ is only 21, Coby White is 20, Markkannen is 23, hell even Zach LaVine is only 25. Good job losing to the knicks with your ‚Äúexceptionally‚Äù better young talent"
"Coby white for sure has that potential, as does Williams.  That franchise needs more athletes in the front court though"
"His shot is weird, he can‚Äôt get to the rim.   Before the fourth quarter last night he had 2 points and Coby White and Zach Lavine were torching the Kings.  He will be a solid pro for years.   Upside, Idk, he might never average 20 a game.   He reminds me of Mark Jackson."
Coby White played a hell of a game

Dude was randomly crying in the Coby White thread too. Some real dedication to the grift
Coby White is the man. GG
Patrick Williams and Coby White are studs. Chicago has a bright future.
"So happy that Tyrese fell to us. Just hope for health for him and Fox for a lonnnggg time. Also, Bulls fans, Coby White can ball. He was fantastic this game!"
Bagley finally playing well along with Haliburton going off. The Kings need this. Good win but holy shit Coby White. I dig it.
"&gt; I also don't want Lowry since Coby has way too much potential in his second year to just put as the 6th man right now.  OKC last year under Donovan played 3 guards with CP3/Shai/Schroder, see no reason why you couldn't play Lowry/LaVine/White all together."
"You aren‚Äôt factoring in him sitting out games against all the best defensive teams.  Or his defensive rating.   He might be the worst degender in the league.   Him, coby white, or buddy hield."
"The fact that he's starting with Coby White as the PG probably contributes to that, and we're bringing in guys like Thad, Temple, and Sato off the bench who have really been key contributors."
"Wasn't really a surprise if you were paying attention IMO.   National media only ever grades drafts by their top 3. They rarely talk about the draft as a whole. The 2020 draft was justifiably uncertain at the top, which is why the national media was so low on this draft.   How a top 3 looks has very little bearing on how the rest of the draft looks.   When you compare a weak 2020 draft to a stacked 2019 draft, Edwards not being a Zion-level prospect doesn't mean Haliburton is a worse #4-8 (where he was projected) than guys like Garland and Coby White.  More nuanced coverage was always pointing out how much depth there was to this draft. There just wasn't a surefire guy to tie it all together.  The national media did the same thing with the 2016 draft. They declared it a 2-man draft and it's probably one of the deepest we've had in a while."
Coby White  Used to be Denzel but I just feel bad for him.
Defensive ratings like this means the unit is bad not every guy.  Usually it is one or two guys dragging it down. I can promise you Coby White is every bit as bad or worse than all of these guys.
Coby White is a snub as well
Even though his own fanbase hates him Coby White is a snub here
How‚Äôs Coby White been? Think he‚Äôs the PG of the future for y‚Äôall?
Before the game thread gets heated I just want to say I love Zach Lavine and Coby White and think Patrick Williams is going to be a stud
makes sense. coby white stinks. bulls need a legit PG and move coby to 6th man

"Same reason they didn‚Äôt draft Coby White, and took Jarrett Culver instead.  Same reason they took Ricky Rubio (who‚Äôs had a nice career) and Johnny Fucking Flynn before Steph Curry.   The front office is world class dumb, and they don‚Äôt know how to put a team together. Our only success as a franchise is tied to Flip Saunders and Kevin McHale (who was a HORRIBLE GM) taking a chance on a high school kid named Kevin Garnett when nobody else would."
"1. Get a PG - Coby White is not a point guard, and we need someone who can playmake and create open looks for all of our shooters and help get rid of our turnover problem.  2. Get better bigs - Every time we play a team with a competent center, they destroy us inside the paint and on second chance points. Plus Wendell and Lauri are both injury prone. When Wendell went down, we had to start Daniel Gafford, who was awful.  3. Get a second allstar to pair with Lavine - Whether we develop one of our current guys or hit gold in free agency, doesn‚Äôt matter, get Lavine a running mate. This is probably gonna have to come last, especially if we have to wait for free agency."
It should count anyway because Coby White was being a fucking idiot. Smart play by Rubio to draw him in.
I have never seen a worst pg in crunch time than coby white.
I once watched Coby white get 2 turnovers in about 5 seconds. 1 to is ridiculous!
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
"That‚Äôs because coby white is on the floor with him, who is really, really fucking bad at defense. Zach has really been a better defender, not great but really not trae levels of bad like you stated earlier."
Demar Derozan has an equal all star case to Coby White.  Zero percent
I could be mad about Coby White not making it too.  But I‚Äôm not.
"So you telling me Clint Capela, Bogdanovic, and De‚ÄôAndre Hunter are not a better supporting cast than Lauri Markannen, Otto Porter and Chandler Hutchinson?  Our second option is Thaddeus Young and third is second year Coby White."
I know his net rating goes from -9.3 to +9.0 when Coby White isn‚Äôt on the floor.
"I didn't follow him much at OKC but he's been good at identifying each player's strengths and weaknesses and making gameplays according to them. Sounds basic but  here are some changes I saw over these 30 games  1) Lavine's improved shot selection, defence and off ball movement. Lavine is getting better as a defender, active hands and getting over screens well. Sometimes doesn't come as help quick enough but he's learning. He's been given the green light to take mid-range jumpers and he's making them, his 3pt shots have been a healthy mix of catch and shoots and off the dribble  2) Thad young's role as a bench facilitator and post player. Boylen made Thad a spot up shooter but Billy's usage of Thad has been excellent. He's running plays through Thad, where he finds cutters or executes dribble handoffs. If all of those fail, he has enough skill to make his own shot by posting up and jump hooks.   3) Drop coverage defence. We used to get destroyed by pick and rolls earlier in this season due to our centers dropping too deep. Now the guards are fighting hard over the screens and the centers aren't dropping much  making it difficult for the opposition guards to make a decision and this has been helping us a bit.   4) Ball movement has improved a lot, helping us create a lot of open looks for Coby White, Lauri , Temple and Patrick Williams, whose 3pt shooting %s have all improved from last season.   Really excited to watch bulls games as we seem to be making adjustments every game and coming out with a gameplan unlike last season ."
"On/off is misleading. Lavine hard carries the starting line up, especially when he plays with White since their skillsets don't match and the defense tanks when they play at the same time. He's something like +9 in non-Coby minutes and +11 when he plays with Thad Young."
"I think being spoiled by the 90s dynasty may have ruined basketball for my dad. He was negatively comparing Coby White with Michael Jordan tonight, and I was like you need to radically alter your expectations if you‚Äôre holding Coby to GOAT standards lmao"
"I thought Coby White would be a guaranteed sub favorite, but it never really materialized.  I play it on moving away from the awesome fro."
There's a difference between playing the Bulls and the Raptors - notably the Bulls help defenders on a lot of those Embiid post ups were Zach Lavine and Coby White lol. what are they gonna do? The Raptors have excellent defenders all over the floor that they send at guys.
which guy on the nets is blonde coby white
"* Apologies for not knowing John Collins' exact stat line off the top of my head, but I think what I said about him being an efficient, positive player who isn't having plays ran for him holds true. * Fair enough, but I did say injuries were an issue.  * Yeah that's not great, gotta concede on that one.  * I think Gallo's slump has a lot to do *with* Trae. He was fantastic on last year's Thunder with CP3. Why? Because CP3 is a natural playmaker who could put Gallo in good positions. This year, 50.4% of Gallo's shots come from catch and shoots. Last year, on the Thunder, it was only 45%. The year before, on the Clippers, 35%. They're using him like Ben McLemore when he's closer to Khris Middleton. Why? Because Trae has the ball so, so much. I know his sample size is small, but the same thing applies to Bogdan: on the Kings, 41% of his field goals came from catch and shoots, in nine games for the Hawks, it's 64%.  * The Bulls starting lineup is second-year Coby White, Lavine, rookie Patrick Williams, Lauri, WCJ. Otto Porter and Lauri have been injured for stretches, and they have no natural playmakers. They've repeatedly lost close games to contenders. Thad Young is the second best player on their team. Their roster talent is nowhere near comparable to y'alls, yet they're playing better. The Hawks are undeniably disappointing relative to the quality of players they've assembled.   As I said, it's not all Trae. Some of it is injuries, some of it is Pierce. But Trae has been this way since college. The ball is always in his hands, you live and die with Trae. And it makes him easy to scheme against. Look at y'alls first game against us (when most of your team was healthy, bar Gallo) and Trae was held to seven points. Why? Because when one guy has the ball, the issues of switching/rotations, tracking ball movement, positional size matchups, etc because less of an issue. That issue is magnified when the one guy who has the ball is a small 6'0"" tall guard. The Hawks should have feasted on the Hornets; we're a team that can't defend the three, has no inside presence (Capela had 19 rebounds), and a very weak bench. But if you stop Trae, you stop the Hawks, and we did it fairly effectively twice, despite missing Zeller and Devonte being in poor form."
"MVP candidate is probably a stretch, but I think its underrated how little help he's had.  His point guards before this year had been Kris Dunn and rookie Coby White. Their lottery bigs had been injured and inconsistent, neither of whom rely supplied Lavine with a reliable PnR partner. Otto Porter barely played. He was on a roster with hardly any spacing, facilitating, or secondary scoring, and people dismissed him as an empty stats chucker.  What else could he have done??  It seems like has become a better playmaker, but I think the team improving across the board has really opened up the game for him. No one scores at that volume and that efficiently in a vacuum"
"&gt;aren't exactly a loaded bench team  Except this year we've definitely been a loaded bench team. This stat [here](https://mobile.twitter.com/tvbassine/status/1358428769288130561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358428769288130561%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabull.com%2F2021%2F2%2F18%2F22283077%2Fzach-lavine-has-arrived-and-nobody-is-happy) shows that the Bulls' bench have been one of the best in the East.  Plus you need to take context into account. For example, he plays a lot of minutes with Coby White, and I saw somewhere that he was something like -9.1 in those minutes and +9.0 without Coby. Their games just simply don't fit and it hurts Lavine's on/off stats."
"Look at his numbers with and without Coby White on the floor. As someone who‚Äôs watched every bulls game this season his impact has been massive, mans should be all star starter imo"
"Outside of Zach we have Coby White or Markkanen occasionally go off for a good scoring night. They're both way too inconsistent though, so Zach has to put the team on his back."
How do Bulls fans feel about Coby White? I am not a fan.
"Lol, you think TNT has *any* idea who Coby White is?"
"""Avoid Steph Curry in your drafts. Make sure you get Coby White.""   -Josh Lloyd, Yahoo fantasy basketball expert"
"""Oh no, apparently all these ratings and Emmys are meaningless because Yahoo Fantasy Basketball Guy thinks we don't kiss the NBA's ass enough! Whatever shall we do? We should definitely listen to the fantasy basketball expert who said to avoid Steph Curry and draft Coby White in the top 70 - he's apparently so good at his job that he has extra time to tell us how to do ours.""   -TNT"
"Honestly bro if you still fail to see how great Zach Lavine is you should just stop watching basketball. I'm going to explain to you right now why those stupid on/off stats you're referencing are skewed but just know that in the future, so you don't get embarrassed the way I'm about to embarrass you right now, please use stats WITH CONTEXT.  If you're trying to use on/off stats for lavine to prove your point, I hope you realize that billy starts lavine with the young guys not the vets, which is why his on/off numbers are like that. Just look at his net rating when he doesn't play with Coby White, +9.3 lmao.  If you would have seen our most recent game you could literally see it for yourself.  First half billy starts lavine along with the young guys. Coby, pat, and wendell. They trail by 18 at halftime.  Before the second half begins he benches coby pat and wendell and starts thadd sato and denzel with lavine and temple to begin the 3rd quarter. Bulls outscore the pistons by 21 the rest of the game.  See?? Is that too hard for you to understand buddy? Next time use stats with context cuz you look really stupid right now. All of this coulda been avoided if you would have just watched our most recent game because it literally proves my point lol. U clearly dont watch basketball much less the bulls or zach.   People like you that base your entire opinions over stats without context are just pathetic. If u don't know how good lavine is on ur own, then you'll never truly know and thats a shame."
"But none of this stands any scrutiny. The argument has to be that Coby white is sooo bad and damaging, he is causing lavine‚Äôs minutes to be tanked. This clearly isn‚Äôt the case, because they play fine when he‚Äôs out there without Lavine.  If Lavine can‚Äôt fit with him that poorly, part of that is lavine‚Äôs fault.  Also, this stuff gets factored into the impact metrics where Lavine is far behind brown and Trae."
I do watch the bulls -  The bulls are +7.3 when Coby white plays and Zach Lavine doesn‚Äôt.  They are +6.8 when Zach Lavine just doesn‚Äôt play.  No impact metric has Lavine close to being ahead of brown or Trae young either
The bulls are +7.3 when Coby white plays and Zach Lavine doesn‚Äôt lol
"Where are you getting that data from?  Also, it‚Äôs not impressive that he‚Äôs -9 with Coby white. Coby white can‚Äôt be tanking you that much if Zach Lavine is as good as you say he is.  I can cherry pick Trae‚Äôs stats as well and come up with ways his plus minus should be better too, the fact is Trae plays positive basketball, Zach doesn‚Äôt. LaZy TaKe"
Now look at the net rating when LaVine is playing and Coby White isn't
"Lazy take, Zach‚Äôs on/off rating is tanked by sharing the court with Coby White, who is one of the absolute worst players in the NBA based off impact stats.  When Zach‚Äôs on the court with Coby they have a -9 net rating, when he‚Äôs on the court without Coby they have a +9 net rating, an 18 point differential.   If you‚Äôre gonna use on/off stats to tell the whole story without even bothering to watch the Bulls, at least try a little harder to be accurate."
Look at lavines on/off numbers when he doesn't play with coby white. He has a net rating of +9.3 without coby lmao.  Using on/off stats to prove your braindead take on Zach lavine without context is embarrassing.  You don't even need to use these stats if you simply just watch him play. Embarrassing argument from you. You clearly don't watch Zach LaVine or the Bulls.
"Coby White has GOAT meme potential, incredibly expressive"
hard to bring in another ball dominant pg with coby white already on the roster. lavine also needs the ball in his hands. i dont know why bulls are targeting lonzo. they really like the defensive minded pgs. they were high on dunn but he eventually went to atl.
"Anyone who thinks he's an empty stat guy (Hi Bill Simmons) just isn't watching. I have no doubt at this point that he could make up a ""super friend"" group and internally rank them however you want (like Kyrie technically being a ""third option"" or Anthony Davis being a ""second option"" or whatever). But look at the Bulls.. who are the other ""super friend"" guys? Coby White has been ass. Patrick Williams is a rookie who has struggled... Thaddeus Young is a nice player but he's a 25 MPG role player.  The Bulls aren't a ""Zach LaVine just being better"" away from being a contender...  I'm not overly invested in LaVine since I'm about 85 % sure he will likely leave for a better team in free agency so he can be part of a super friend team, it's just amusing how consistently bad takes are on him. You don't score 28.8 PPG on .649 TS% (without even the benefit of superstar officiating) by being some empty stat guy. Any team would be lucky to ad him as a free agent in a couple years."
LOVE coby white but dude always looks constipated üòÇ
"They are a proper PG away from being a solid playoff team imo. Coby White is not a bad player, but he‚Äôs quite inefficient and he‚Äôs not the type of a PG they need. Old school playmaker with defense who picks his shots would be perfect for them imo. Thaddeus Young looks like their best playmaker most games right now."
Coby white  Zach lavine  Patrick williams  Zion  Wendell Carter jr
Coby white Zach lavine Patrick williams Zion Wendell carter jr
It just dawned on me that Coby white thinks he‚Äôs Ja Morant.
Coby White has a resting crying face
"Bulls were down 25 at one point. he scored 15 in the third which got them back in the game. Finished with 33 on 9 of 15 shooting and 5 of 7 from three.   Rookie Pat Williams scored 12 in the fourth quarter. He had a bully dunk over Plumlee and hit a huge 3 under two minutes in the 4th. Coby White, despite a bad game overall, also had a clutch 3."
Coby White is fucking atrocious sheesh
"Thad Young's been their second best player this season, sadly.  Also, the team is incredibly young. Outside of Thad (13 years in the league), Temple (10), Otto Porter Jr. (7, and injured), Lavine (5), and Satoransky (4), everyone else has 3 years of NBA experience of fewer, including starters/rotation players Markannen, WCJ, Coby White, Patrick Williams, Denzel Valentine, and Gafford. On top of that, of the young players, it seems like only LaVine (if he still counts as being young) and maybe Markannen have borderline all-star potential. (The jury is out on Patrick Williams.)"
"Prolly coby white, he was good last night but some other nights he looks turrible"

"you could easily make a lowlight reel that looks more damning for quite a number of players, I mean part of OPs argument for how drummond is the ""worst high usage player in the league and its not even close"" includes the fact that he is in the 40th percentile for various offensive metrics which while not good seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what percentile means if that is the argument you are trying to make.     cursory look through drummond's bref page will show you that this has indeed been his worst season by a considerable margin and even still there isn't much of a statistical argument that he is the worst high usage offensive player in the league this year with the seasons westbrook, dillon brooks, coby white, and terrence ross are having."
I don't watch the Bulls much... I thought Coby White was a traditional PG?
they‚Äôre average enough to be able to make basic reads in pnr which is reasonable to expect from Coby White in couple years
you're playing against Coby White not the refs lol
Coby White might be the worst guard in the league.
What? I just think that the Bulls don‚Äôt really got a legit playmaker. They‚Äôre running Coby White as a PG when he‚Äôs more a SG.
I would not do this! Coby White has lots of potential and is still on a nice rookie contract. Lonzo Ball is looking to get paid.
coby white is nice .
I honestly like Lonzo on the bulls don‚Äôt think Coby White is the way to do it though.
coby white is a bench piece. lonzo is a top 40 player in the league and top 15 pg. of course they would
"Lonzo is legitimately a top 40 player in the league, Coby White is maybe a 6 man type player?? Seems like a no brainer to me"
Coby white just isn‚Äôt a playmaker and Zach Lavine can‚Äôt do everything
Well they technically are. Donovan let coby white be the starting point guard over sato.  https://cashflowsports.com/2020/12/11/coby-white-named-starting-pg-for-chicago/
Just don't get rid of my man Coby White.
"About Coby White...  No disrespect whatsoever but I‚Äôm sorry to tell everybody the truth, the man cannot play the game of basketball"
You don‚Äôt think Coby White will be on the Bulls in 2 years?
"Yeah the net rating with LaVine and White playing together is terrible, it's sinking the team. When LaVine is on the floor without Coby our net rating is actually really good"
Coby White for Lonzo
Coby white is the definition of dog shit. He's a horrible basketball player and I'm tired of people pretending he's not.
Second best is Coby white. Learn his name
I meant just like luck mostly. Like if we woulda lost that coin flip with Sacramento or ended up with a higher pick another year stuff like that. I meant more like we missed out on guys like that not that we passed on them. Instead we ended up with fucking coby white lol. Bummer.
"okay Dwade was attacking the rim and going at people all the time, plus he didn‚Äôt really become Wade until like 05 when the last of the defensive rules were changed to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game (https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf)  Chris Paul is the same as D Wade.   I have multiple comments explaining how Manu Ginobilli‚Äôs flopping is one of the worst thing to happen to basketball and it‚Äôs why the Spurs were so hated in the early 2000s.   Reggie Miller was also pretty well-hated and i didn‚Äôt like reggie as a player then and i don‚Äôt like him now.   Laimbeer is one of the dirtiest players to ever play, what a great example    the fact of the matter is that in the era of the 80s to 2005, it was all about getting into the paint and attacking the rim. yes you had mid range jumpshots, but that‚Äôs when the drive or the post game didnt work. and they didn‚Äôt flop nearly as blatantly. they bitched about calls, but Marcus Smart is embarrassing the way he flops for how good of a player he is. same with LeBron. 100 times out 100 give me guys who drive into the lane and then try to beat some ass like Kermit Washington. watching Jimmy Butler roll around in pain laughing and tickling other players on the court feels like something out of Baseketball    watching guys shoot 36% from 3 isn‚Äôt fun.  they miss 60% of the time and i can get that at my local high school. NBA superstar Trae Young makes 42% of his shots. who in gods name wants to watch that? it‚Äôs just a free throw contest.   and missed jump shots are uber less exciting. what is more fun to watch: 6‚Äô6 220 pogo stick Desmond Mason miss a layup against 6‚Äô10 Chris Wilcox or Coby White and Jordan Clarkson trading pull-up 3 clanks?"
"Yes exactly. I think most people would be surprised to hear that thadd is our second best player buts its true.  Watching the bulls miss out on guys like fox, luka, trae, sga, morant and now lamelo, I'm kinda over the whole ""point guards take time to develope"" narrative people here say. Coby White is just a bad player right now, and I don't think he'll ever get to the level of those other guys.  Imo if the bulls don't end up with one of cade or suggs in the draft, we're just gonna have the same problem in the future too."
"Their 2nd best player is Thad Young, and their other ''best'' players are either hurt or inconsistent. Coby White has been awful outside of the Clippers game."
"the Suns have Cam Payne and Cam Johnson the Pacers have two TJs and two Holidays Bucks have DJ Augustin and DJ Wilson Hornets have the Martin twins, Wizards have Tony Brown and Troy Brown, Mavs have Hardaway and Burke both went to Michigan,  Pels have Zion Ingram  and Redick from Duke, Bulls drafted Markkanen WCJ and Coby White 7th, Pistons have two young French players, Celtics have Jeff Teague and Jason Tatum Grizzlies have Winslow Jones and Grayson Allen from the 2015 Duke team."
"How is it any more special than last years‚Äôs draft or the year before‚Äôs?  Last year‚Äôs draft had Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland, Coby White, Cam Reddish, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro  And that‚Äôs all just the lottery guys. Lot of other gems outside of it too"
"Coby white has been disappointing. His defence really hurts us and when his shots aren't falling in, he starts commiting turnovers, drops his shoulders and it's game over.    I really thought he'd be an MIP candidate after he averaged 30ppg over a stretch of 6 games as a starter at the end of last season. He picked it up in his last 2 games tho."
"Coby White, still see a lot of potential in the guy, but makes lots of mistakes."
We are talking about stats and how they don‚Äôt always mean what they say.   Coby White is putting up respectable counting stats this year because he was playing with the ball in his hands the whole time the first twenty games.  Meanwhile he was also the worst player in the league
the bulls shouldn't trade lavine imo. he and coby white are looking like a great backcourt. now they just need a wing
Coby white is a certified bucket
Ooh boy Coby White can go upstairs now too?
"‚ÄúNot a winning player‚Äù is a bad take. The rest of the team is the problem, not Zach. OPJ, WCJ, and Lauri may as well have a hospital wing named after them at this point and Coby white makes more turnovers than a New York bakery."
"One of the few guys where it looks to be a carry that might actually not.   Hand is on the midline of the ball and he keeps it moving throughout.   Coby White, Trae Young, Luka.....hand under the ball stop, eat snack, resume dribble."
"This is facts. Coby White is gonna be good, probably. The thing is he doesn‚Äôt really do well at point and most importantly his fit with Zach is not exactly the best. Turnovers and defense are the factors for him, but who‚Äôs to say he isn‚Äôt going to get better at it?"
"I say this with all due respect, but fuck Zach Lavine and Coby White"
"Is the OP drunk. Why on earth would the bulls or in fact anyone trade for kemba who has 2yrs + Player option which he'll pick up for sure and his contract also has a 15% trade kicker making it the even worse.  Celtics's picks are gonna be high 20s and no team is gonna trade for kemba and give up assets especially with his health issues.   Coming to the bulls, Coby white has had a rough stretch of games but no way are we trading him before the end of his rookie contract. And Otto's an expiring contract which makes this trade even more delusional."
"/r/nba coming to back us this year is just the best.  In the words of Coby White, ""That's love man"" :)"
"If they ever do a Black remake of Knocked Up, they should get Coby White to play Seth Rogen‚Äôs character."
Even Coby White?
Coby White is all of us thinking we can beat the g-leaguer.
"Or, if you are Coby White, 5 times in 1 game"
"38% from three and 45% from the field for a 20 year old 2nd option on a playoff team that doesn‚Äôt have much spacing with Elfrid Payton and Mitchell Robinson being 40% of the starting lineup is actually rather efficient and in fact, he has a higher FG% and 3pt% than Ja Morant, Coby White, and Tyler Herro while playing much better defense than they are as well. Given his situation offensively being lesser than stellar I would actually say he‚Äôs been pretty efficient."
"Dude c'mon. Patience doesn't turn a score-first, awful defender like Coby White into an elite assist-giver and defensive stopper. Neither of those things are even remotely likely for Coby.  For a realistic answer to your question, the Bulls need Patrick Williams to be a legitimate elite defender, a true point guard who can efficiently distribute while adding 15 ppg (like a CP3-lite), Coby White needs to develop into an *efficient* 6th man who scores without hurting the team. All that plus they need a top 10 player. The contenders right now all have at least 1, the top teams commonly 2 (Lakers have 2, Nets have 3) top 10 players, or are built with insane depth/skill (Jazz).  Either PWill turns into prime Kawhi in the next 2 years, another top player wants out and we somehow trade for him, or Lavine becomes James Harden"
"Denzel Valentine makes the most boneheaded plays sometimes and if he can't make a 3 is essentially useless on the court. Coby White in the same vein, but he probably has a little more upside on offense. He's just not a good pg right now. Also both these guys play terrible defense"
Coby white or denzel valentine cuz they can't play basketball well
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"
Terrence Davis and Coby white imo could be debated
"lol, he is better than Coby White.   but he still won't be a star"
"Coby White. No handle, no passing vision, no passing ability, dies immediately on every screen that is set on him. Pretty much everyone sees Lauri for what he is now but most people still seem to think that Coby is a viable NBA player. He is not."
"It was Wendell Carter Jr. imo, most of us saw very little promise in his play but during that Vucevic trade, the media is acting like Orlando got a stud rising player, which is good for them I guess.  Now, I guess it's probably Coby White based on Reddit gamethreads. Lots of other teams' fans say stuff about how explosive he can be as a scorer and his bright future, but a lot of Bulls fans cannot stand his defense and decision making. In my opinion, he's a 6th man at best"
Yea I mean anyone who watches the bulls knows that lauri is pretty bad. Coby White gets shit on so much but I still think people overrate him lol
"All of these proposed trades are garbage. If the Mavs trade Luka, they need offensive firepower in return. There's really no one better than Coby White for that"
Lol tf are you on about? Is Coby White the Hitler of Asians or something and I didn't get the memo?
Troy Brown instead of Coby White was the difference.  And 30-7 free throws.
Coby White sits...we win  We should try this more often
So   a) Tank a season when LaVine is due an extension relatively soon where no matter what happens there's a decent chance you cant keep the pick   b) Piss off LaVine   c) Sell LaVine on some rookie that he nor any NBA star gives a shit about the way NBA twitter does   d) Pretend like Coby White is the one on that team who should be the 6th man of the year  What could possibly go wrong.
Coby white
"since 2000 Nene, Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, Corey Brewer, Steph Curry, Greg Monroe, Bismack Biyombo, Harrison Barnes, Ben McLemore, Julius Randle, Emmanuel Mudiay, Lauri Markennen, and Coby White have all been picked at 7. Of that group Murray is one of the better players, but ""well above expected value,"" seems like a stretch."
They are closer than you think. They seem confident they have a future star in Patrick Williams. Add one big free agent signing and they will have 3-4 all star caliber players.   If Lauri or Coby White develop into anything worthy than they  are likely contending for 3 years starting 2 years from now
"Williams &gt; Quickley, Williams has a higher ceiling and also fills a position of need for us (3 and D wing). Quickley is more of a combo guard than a true PG, which we already have in Coby White."
Coby White is overrated as fuck
I still think it's possible Coby White turns into a real good player too
"let's go bulls! i love zach and vuc and, uh, coby white (unless i don't love him? not clear on that one yet)"
"I love coby white, but that may be because his hairstyle has made him the most easily recognizable player for me. Plus, i think there's real potential in him as a Clarkson-esque guy who is a live wire off the bench behind LaVine. He's still in his second year"
Overrated.   Coby White.   A lot of people think he is the worst defender in the league.  He is so much worse than that.   Underrated FVV.
"OKC is not getting hot lmao.   Lonzo Ball is interested.  McConnell and Caruso are interested.  Williams will improve.  Lauri will be gone so we might have someone to guard someone on the bench.  Get a point guard and no reason this team cant be a four seed the next two years. Or we can keep getting seven picks and drafting Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Wendell Carter Junior for the next 10 years.  They had to do something.  This is better than standing pat."
"Picks are overrated bozo. We still have our 2nds and that‚Äôs where Karnisovas strikes gold. Lmao the last two teams to win an NBA championship both won by trading for star players. Sad to see this shit coming from a Bulls fan too when our last three lOtTeRry PiCkS have been - Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Coby White lol."
It allows us to move on from all of GarPax previous blunders and keep the one (Lavine) or two (Thad) that ended up being valuable.  It allowed us to also put Lauri in the second unit which was a LONG time coming.  Williams has looked much better in only two games with him.  Bulls might lose a bunch of games still this year.   Badly need a TJ McConnell or Alex Caruso type in the starting lineup instead of Sato or Coby White. The hardnosed defender who can do a little of everything without turning the ball over.  Also we are giving up a pick around 11 this year and hopefully 20 or worse in two years.  Also got off the last half year of Otto Porter.  The trade was necessary for a team that needs an identity.  Thibs is the Knicks identity.
And Kyrie is getting fed by James Harden. Zach is getting fed by... Thad Young? Coby White?
I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever questioned his IQ...maybe getting that confused with Coby White criticism
"Tier of his own: Luka  Tier 2: Trae, Shai, Ja  Tier 3: Lamelo, Sexton  Tier 4: Haliburton, Lonzo, Garland  Tier 5: KPJ, Quickley, Fultz (pre injury), Coby White,  Need to see a lot more from: THT, Theo Maledon, Cole Anthony, Jordan Poole, Kira Lewis,"
"i thought about it and i felt like Herro really is a 2 Guard, i think some players here will probably spend their careers playing the 2 guard aswell but for now it makes sense to have them on this list (Maledon, Quickley, Kira Lewis, Sexton, Poole, Coby White &amp; Cole Anthony, potentially Haliburton &amp; Lonzo too but these 2 are pretty much well rounded guards that probably aren‚Äôt your no.1 ball handler"
"thing is with THT is he is at his best with the ball in his hands, whereas players like Jordan Poole, Sexton and Coby White are SG‚Äôs in a PG‚Äôs body, arguably cole anthony and Immanuel Quickley too"
"that‚Äôs just to speak to how many good young point guards there are right now, i know some of them don‚Äôt exactly fit the PG role specifically Coby White, Sexton and THT, but those are the positions i see them playing for their career"
Luka  Trae  Shai  LaMelo  Ja  Sexton  Lonzo  Halliburton  KPJ  Garland  Fultz  Maledon  Quickley  Coby White  Cole Anthony  THT  Poole  Kira Lewis Jr
"For me, it goes (in order):  Luka, Ja, Lamelo, Trae , Shai, Lonzo, Kira Lewis, Quickley, Kevin Porter Jr, Coby White, Poole, Fultz, Sexton, Garland, Cole Anthony, Talen Horton Tucker, Haliburton &amp; Theo Maledon"
Can I interest you in a trade for Coby White and Lauri Markannen?
"What a disaster your drafting has been recently. Carter out the door, Markinaen soon to follow and Coby White not exactly lighting the world on fire. Kris Dunn was a swing and a miss as well."
markannen or coby white?
You‚Äôre all gonna look mad foolish after Coby White wins MVP
"[Here‚Äôs an article from June 2019](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/20/most-nba-players-produced-by-colleges-kentucky-statistics), since then UNC had Coby White, Nas Little, Cam Johnson, and Cole Anthony drafted. That‚Äôs still less than UCLA"
Yeah I was expecting us to pick Coby White on draft night so I was kinda shocked when we took him.  Yeah it's like he can't really find his rhythm. And to be honest it's quite possible that he just needs a change in scenery. There is a good player in there with fantastic work ethic. He just doesn't fit us and never did
"I am loving it as well.   Last year was hard to watch. I will admit I did not watch a lot of Bulls games.   But I'm loving this team. Everyone.   Lauri needs to stay healthy but when he is, he's been good. He's not the superstar I thought he would become, but he is good.    Lavine is a legit player and his defense has gotten much better, from terrible to average, especially one on one.    Pat Williams is gonna be a star in this league. He can do it all and all he needs is confidence and that will come in the coming years.   Coby White is one of my favorite players in the NBA currently. Sure, he has his flaws, but the dude is fire on offense and is slowly learning how to be a point guard. It's only his second year.    Wendell is another one that needs to stay healthy, but I do enjoy him as a player.    ""Thadgic"" Young is a God-send to this team. Always been a big fan of his, but he really is a catalyst for this team and he's our glue guy.   Been surprised with Valentine as well.    Overall. This team is FINALLY on the right path and I am excited to see where we go!    See Red!"
Coby White
"Kpj, keldon Johnson, coby white"
"Ik this is definitely a bit of a homer take, but Thybulle has to be included on this list. While he has basically 0 offensive game, he is legitimately one of the best perimeter defenders in the league already. I think at the minimum he should be included and take Coby White off, he's too inconsistent."
Coby white too high
How do Bulls fans feel about Coby White lately?
"Coby White, him and LaVine will kill NBA backcourts for years to come."
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
"&gt; But this team just desperately needs a pass first point guard to run the offense.  Coby White is playing out of position and not terribly good at it. Yes, he scores but not efficiently at it.  It's nothing against White as a player but he really needs to be 6th man or at the 2.   The Wolves did the same shit with LaVine as a rookie and once he was moved permanently to the 2 he became a better player. Once White is moved out of point and to the 2, he'll be a better player."
"Coby White isn't a point guard, he's an awful fit with Lavine, he's basically a (way) worse Lavine"
"Good. Coby White is a better,more selfish Jaylen Nowell, he can't run an offence."
"The Bulls arent well rounded enough forvthe Playoffs but too good and competitive for a deeper Lottery Look.    So, work on your weakness and the young core.  Don't touch: LaVine, Williams, Thad Young, Temple.   Bring in a Center who protects the the rim, sets screens and stretches the floor - Myles Turner for WCJ, Chandler Hutchinson and a 2nd Round Pick.  Lonzo Ball should provide pass first and more defense than you get with Coby White. Let him go off the bench as 2 Guard (with Satoransky for example as the PG) . Get Lonzo either for a 2nd rounder plus Denzel Valentine or see if he wants to come in the FA (he is a RFA)   With that you strengthen the bright side: Good tempo, good bench - but work on the efficiency and turnovers in that.  Lauri will have troubles finding his money wish in the contract offers. He's hurt so often and inconsistent. Healthy and ready, he is a cornerstone of the Franchise but more as Tony Kukoc than as Pippen to our Jordan!  Get a SF that gives you 10pts and defense. Get rid off (trade away, or let go): Felicio, Kornet, Hutchinson, WCJ, Arcidiacono, Gafford.   Get a more balanced team with better roleplayers to provide a 2nd Star enough money and Space to go join next to LaVine."
Trade some of the younger talent (aside from Coby White) and picks to SA for Derozan and to Indiana for Turner.  Let Otto Porter Jr.‚Äòa contract ride out and extend Derozan on a max deal.   Move forward with White/Lavine/Derozan/Young/Turner in a chase to become a playoff team/establish a winning culture around Lavine as he enters his prime.
Perhaps swap coby white for lonzo ball
1.Lauri Markannen  2.Coby White  3. WCJ
Coby white/Wendell Carter jr
Is Coby White the worst defender in the league?
"not the guy/girl you were responding to but uhhh let me try for fun.   **Yes/fairly certain are better than Curry:**.  Simmons   Schroder   Conley   Nunn   Holiday   Lowry   Doncic   Ball/Bledsoe   Beverely/Jackson   CP3   Fox   Brogdon   Shai   Dejounte Murray   Westbrook   Harden   Wall    **Maybe:**   Rose (this one I'm not sure about)   Curry (is Curry &gt; Curry or is Curry &lt; Curry on D? idk)   Coby White   Whoever tf is the Magic's starting guard, is it MCW?   Murray   Morant    **No:**   Trae   Garland   Dennis Smith Jr   Rozier   Dame"
Having Paul will make you more efficient. Zach has Coby White and I Love Markkanen.
"How is coby white so high, I don‚Äôt watch many bulls games but wow"
No Coby White? Then I'm not playing.
"He played with Towns years ago and he has gotten way better since then. Im talking about the Lavine we've seen for the past 2ish years.  *It‚Äôs not like Lavine has no good players on his team*  Who? TBH I like the Bulls' future, but they absolutely do not have any ""good"" players besides Lavine.  Markkhannen has been out for over half their games and he is **barely** a ""good"" player.  Coby White is averaging 16/5 on terrible efficiency and average/below average defense  Wendell Carter Jr with his 12/8 is average at best but he's also missed close to half their games.  After that, their next best players are Thad Young, Patrick Williams, and Garrett Temple.  Again, I like the Bulls' future. I think Coby, Wendell Carter, Patrick Williams, and Markkhanan are all going to be really good players. But they are definitely not there yet. I don't know how you can look at this roster and think that is even a halfway decent roster. Even with all that though, the Bulls are half a game from the 7th seed. I truly think they are several games worse if you replace Lavine with Mitchell because while Mitchell would very slightly improve their defense, he doesn't improve anything else and the Bulls would score way less points because he isn't anywhere near as efficient as Lavine."
"Lavine is literally still being called an empty stats player, idk where that he gets a pass shit from. Lavine, Trae Toung, and Booker were. You can literally go to any previous season and check our postgame threads.  And Kenna Walker is a better player than Lavine? Something that isn‚Äôt even disputed. Your point?  Also, that team that should get us 8th Seed, you do know that Porter Jr, and Markannen have been out the vast majority of this season to injury right? So... a team of Lavine, Thaddeus Young, Coby White is supposed to get us to the playoffs.   Zach and Stephen Curry‚Äôs current numbers are nearly identical. Outside of literally turning into Lebron or 2018-2019 Harden, he can only do so much."
"Idk if your purposely being obtuse but even in the East, you need decent teammates.   Bro 2nd best player is Thaddeus Young, with the next being 2nd Year Coby White.  You can scream out it‚Äôs the East but at the end of day, when your next best player averages 12 POINTS, getting wins is hard unless you‚Äôre a superstar."

Did you not get the memo?? Coby white can go upstairs!!
"Lavine, Vucevic, Thad, Temple, Theis, Williams, Sato. Coby White is somewhere in between where if he‚Äôs having a good game he‚Äôll be included in the circle, if not though then he‚Äôll be kept out of it. Recently he‚Äôs been moving more and more into it, but he‚Äôs still on the cusp."
"He had 9 blocks that game, 5 of them were on Coby White. I just don‚Äôt get how someone can fail to realize that what they‚Äôre doing clearly is failing miserably and that they should attempt something else instead of doing the exact same thing the exact same way over and over again."
Coby White
"Remember the bulls game when he blocked Coby white like, 6 times? Good times"
"Haven‚Äôt watched any Bulls games this year, but judging from that game, the Bulls should just pass the ball to Coby White anywhere on the court and have him throw up a shot."
RJ has a worse career 3p% than all of those players except Coby White.  RJ has made less 3 pointers than all of those players  RJ: 175/478 for .366  Coby: 279/786 for .355  Fair to say Coby is also a better shooter than RJ. RJ is a worse 3p shooter than these guys in every way.  What are you smoking?
"He's been amazing, but this prob isn't true  Garland, Coby White, Cam Johnson, Herro, then other borderline guys like Goga, KPJ, Deandre Hunter, Reddish, PJ Washington who Barrett is prob beating out but not by that much"
"Coby White. He‚Äôs been struggling all season, but seems to have found a rhythm when Lavine was out, and he‚Äôs been playing well the past few games with Lavine back too."
Coby white
Coby White always looks like a stranger just yelled at him in a grocery store for talking too loud.
"I wouldn‚Äôt say that, Coby White, Markkanen, Pat Williams and WCJ can all carve out decent careers in the league. Plus this last years draft was our first under the new management"
"They are going to decide whether they want to rebuild or win now this offseason by doing one of the following  1. Trade lavine/vucevic for draft picks/young players (possibly with golden state) 2. Trade Patrick Williams/Coby White for win now players and/or sign free agents such as Lonzo Ball.  Regardless, Art≈´ras Karni≈°ovas track record is pretty good considering how he helped the Denver Nuggests so I think questioning his moves this early in his tenure with the Bulls (aka thinking you know more than he does) is misguided at this point."

"Vuc and LaVine have played great in almost every one of their games. Neither of them are taking bad shots, both are creating for their team as best they can at sg and center. The problem is that no playoff team should have to decide whether to play satoransky or coby white as a starting point guard. The de facto and unquestioned starting small forward is literally a year one rookie who ian't even in contention for roy (no disrespect to pat will, he's a great rookie but it's odd they threw him in the deep end). Thad young has been playing worse since the deadline, and Lauri...well, I was ahocked that he got 4 rebounds tonight, and that should be done in sleep for a seven footer.  The main concern is that there are two all-stars but literally no other starter-level nba players on the team. Add in that both the stars are primarily offense generators, and you have a big hole at playmaking and defending. Literally putting anyone good like Derrick White or TJ McConnell or PJ Washington on the bulls would probably get them to a clear playoff spot. Just bad drafting from garpac over the last ten years coming back to bite them with bad depth."

"It's not just passing ability, it's general BBIQ. I don't see Coby White turning into a floor general just by improving his passing.  Also Bulls defense is way too porous. Should probably keep Theis at least."
"They can all offer max extensions, there‚Äôs just a slightly better one for staying at your team. It hasn‚Äôt been enough to convince many others to walk, but he‚Äôs also not in a small market and at least the Bulls have been very active in trying to surround him with talent. It really depends on the development of Coby White whether he stays I think, they REALLY need a good floor general. I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs got the passing ability for that."
"I think that's why he went and got Vucevic. Him + LaVine is a reasonable facsimile of Jokic + Murray. Not as good defensively because LaVine isnt a very good defender... and honestly Jokic is a slightly better defender than Vuc. But offensively near as good.   The problem is everything else on your team is mostly garbage or ill fitting or super raw. Like, I'm good friends with a Chicago fan and he constantly complains about Coby White and Lauri. Thad Young is a journeyman for a reason, cant really play him with Vuc - too slow. Pat Williams will be a good player, but is a rookie and the youngest one in the NBA at that. Sato/Temple are....... fine. But again, journeymen. The pieces just arent very good around LaVine/Vuc whereas Tim Connelly has had 5 years to tailor the Nuggets roster around Jokic and now Jokic+Murray."
why in the world does Coby White have such a long leash
"coby white is kinda booty, they need a PG"
As someone who sounds like they watch the Bulls‚Äîwhat‚Äôs up with/what happened to Coby White?
Tank commander coby white reporting for duty!
"Lots of people here clearly don‚Äôt watch the bulls. Zach lavine and vucevic have been good, their weakness on defense hasn‚Äôt been our problem. Vucevic, Theis, and Troy Brown jr have all been great pickups. Our problems are due to the fact that five players on our roster (Markkanen, Coby White, Thad young, satoransky, and Patrick Williams) have been absolutely useless when they had been decent or good earlier in the season"
No because we‚Äôre keeping him. He‚Äôs miles ahead of coby white in every factor
Better - Caruso Worse (much worse) (worst in the league who plays minutes) - Coby White
"That looks like the biggest flaw atm, although I think Coby White has some upside, I think investing in Lavine means his time is up.     Lonzo, Devonte at the top of the list would you say? Or maybe Lowry / Conley or DRose reunion?"
Fire Fries Coby White.   Not because it is a good name but because there was still hope for him at that time
Medium Answer:  we will toss in Coby White and you can have them both for the very low price of cash considerations.
"lauri needs a fresh start, maybe somewhere else or maybe a coach that would give him a role completely different to what has been given to him up until now    coby white... he'll always have a role as a microwave shooter off the bench in any time"
We tanked to two straight 7th ovr picks (WCJ and Coby White) and one 4th ovr pick (PWill)‚Äî Lauri was a 7th ovr pick from the Twolves. The ping pong balls werent kind to us.
"I never understood the reasoning behind this trade. You're giving up 2 picks and a young asset for Vooch. Best case scenario they would've been around the 6 seed (which is already out of reach now), and would've lost to the Bucks in 5 or 6 games. BUT Billy Donovan hasn't been able to figure it out, so they're just barely in the play in. Now what? They make the 7th or 8th seed and loose in 5 games to the Nets or 6ers?  This trade was a desperate floor raiser which fans reacted well to because they wanted to see some winning. Even if the Bulls go on a run now and make the playoffs it'll still be a bad move in my opinion.  Imagine two years down the line when Zach will be 28, Vooch will be 32, and you're still only a borderline playoff team. Your best bet now is to hope Patrick Williams becomes a star and you find a trade for lost causes like Coby White and Lauri for some draft capital.  Overall, this not how you approach a rebuild and it would've been waaay better to have your 2021 pick in a class as stacked as this one. Feel for yall Bulls fans..."
" Coby White, Lauri, Patrick Williams"
"Scary Terry, not mentioned as often as Ball and Hayward while talking about Charlotte's success.   Nephews here talking about Westbrook like he's a bad player, so put Westbrook on the list because he's still fucking awesome.   Tobi Harris!   Coby White is really nice"
"No, Cam and picks for Coby White"
Coby White and picks
Literally the people at BR must hate the Hawks because the trades they post are literally always us either trading for bad players (Coby White) or giving away Collins for nothing
Why would we trade cam for coby whiteüòÇ
Jesus that Coby White trade is terrible for the Hawks
"I didn‚Äôt love the cam Johnson pick but I definitely didn‚Äôt think much of coby white so while I never directly compared the two, I can say I liked cam for Phoenix more than Coby for anybody."
"I'd love to have Simmons on the Bulls, Lavine is a scorer whilst Pat Will and Vuc can space the floor and Coby White is more of a microwave scorer than a playmaker.  And if we have the same issue as Philly rn I'd be happy to get to the second round vs fighting for a 6-8 seed with two big contract all star level players and less picks."
"Well I wasn't necessarily talking about trading for any etc. I think Vooch is a better passer in the paint than Embiid but a less dominant figure, which helps Simmons rush paint. Likewise LaVine and Simmons works a billion times better on paper than Korkmaz and Simmons lmao.   And C White just got surgery. Will be the third missed/altered offseason (previous cause of covid) so this makes it a lot harder to know where we stand at PG.   Sooo in a world where CHI can keep Lavine/PWill/Vooch/maybe even Coby, and we could get Simmons, yes pls"
"Lol if he‚Äôs this bad with Embiid, Harris and Curry. Is he gonna be better on the Bulls?  You‚Äôre better off developing Coby White, Patrick Williams and keeping Lavine and Vucevic"
"Coby White tore his labrum last week, during basketball activities, and is out until October at the earliest."
"That the Bulls didn‚Äôt overpay for Vuc. And that it was good giving Gafford away for peanuts even though Theis isn‚Äôt coming back and is 5x more expensive for the same backup center position. That Coby White worked as a point guard.  That AKME didn‚Äôt fuck up and it‚Äôs three dimensional chess us fans could never understand. With Lonzo we become a top five seed in the east and is worth 4/120 for a glorified role player. I could go on, but it‚Äôs too pathetic to keep going."
Coby White robbed
"Coby White can probably fill the Clarkson/Payne role, but he can‚Äôt be a starter, they need to go get Lowry and throw the bag at him. Keep Thad Young at all costs too, that dude is a gem of a role player who is vital if you want your team to be good, not unlike a Crowder or Ingles."
"I assume bulls protect Lavine, Vuc , Patrick Williams, Coby white, Thad Young, Troy brown Jr, Theis + Lauri ( if both re-sign) ."
Protect  -Patrick Williams  -Coby White  -Thaddeus Young  -Zach Lavine  -Nikola Vucevic   -Daniel Theis  -Troy Brown JR  - Tomas Satoransky
"The Bulls really want to acquire a top point guard.  Whether they can or not is another matter.  There would have to be a trade involved and they have limited assets.  But they surprised people when they traded for Vucevic.    Vucevic, LaVine, and, say, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, or Chris Paul doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the Bulls an instant title contender, but it would go a long way towards making the Bulls a legitimate playoff team.  If they get Lowry or Paul the hope would be that the aging superstar mentors Coby White."
&gt;a PG next to LaVine who isn't a good primary playmaker/facilitator  sounds like you're describing Coby White
Kemba to the Bulls. Bulls need the picks and they can move Coby White or Satoransky to fill the position.
"coby white for lillard straight up, who says no?"
Lillard swap deal for Coby White: CONFIRMED!
"Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams, Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Lebron James  Lebron instead of Vucevic cuz Vuc has proven he can be a championship number 1, Lebron can‚Äôt anymore needs AD"
"as a fellow bulls fan who watched most of our games I would have to agree. there were a few games and many moments throughout games where this bulls team looked really, really good. like borderline contender good. however, they are still way too inconsistent. some games only Zach shows up to play. also the most hot and cold shooting team I have ever watched. they gotta smooth out their game.  to me, next season will be won or lost on the shoulders of Coby white and Patrick Williams. we know lavine and vooch are gonna ball, but we really need Coby and pat to step up and contribute on both ends of the floor. obviously getting a PG will really help, but we need more from some of our current players too."
Is coby white unknown?
"If the Blazers genuinely took Coby White and Lauri+picks and gave the Bulls Dame, I would very quickly accept that deal, and I'm a massive fan of Coby and Lauri"
Coby white could be my dad and you'd believe it
I like coby white
Would Coby white and markkanen sign n trade plus sato and Thad young to fill in salary cap space work? Win win for bulls and blazers
"I don't think you're using cemented correctly. He was the 3rd best player in that draft this year but these guys are 20-22 years olds. Barrett's performance this year is comparable to Garland, Hunter and by a bit a of stretch, Coby White. I would even venture to say not even Morant has cemented his place in this draft. Any of these guys could develop into stars in the next 3-4 years."
"2019 who?  Zion, Barrett, and many others.  I thought THAT was the loaded class?  Only Ja Morant looks like a world beater.  Darius Garland, Jarrett Culver, Coby White, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  2017 doesn't look that bad but its not good either."
Isn‚Äôt that what coby white is supposed to do
"Coby white, boban, Matisse, rui hachimura, Kelly oubre, dort"
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
"Cam Johnson, Nassir Little, Coby White"
Not sure Bulls want Kemba. They have to pay Lavine.  They have Coby White. I‚Äôd imagine the Bulls would want Lonzo or draft a defensive minded point guard
Coby White? Lauri Markannen? Patrick Williams? Thad Young? I have no fucking clue.
"I would 100% take Westbrook over Coby White if we‚Äôre talking just now and not future potential, and so would anyone with a brain."
Dont say that dude.  I am not watching us next year if coby white is still starting next to my man Zach.  Just tell Zach u hate him and that u  hope he leaves at that point.
"Too tall. For comparison, coby white and van dijk are the same height. VVD is only about half an inch taller than Steph and Westbrook. NBA stars are tall as hell. Giannis would likely be the tallest player ever."
"My team specifically...anything not named LaVine, Vuc, or Williams...so means we ain‚Äôt getting him.   My offer: Coby White, Thad Young, 2 firsts, 2 swaps, and maybe a couple seconds because we don‚Äôt have much to offer outside our 3 top guys."
I always think of the Coby White draft interview whenever I see Cam Johnson make a shot üòÇ
"I‚Äôm not saying all of them are better but I just wouldn‚Äôt take someone we‚Äôve barely seen over proven guys. Here‚Äôs my reasoning  Clippers, blazers, suns, Celtics, 76erswant win now talent because they are trying to   Coby white, Rui, THT, naz, Mann, McDaniels, Claxton have shown much more so I would take them first  Reddish is off of the potential. He just hasn‚Äôt shown enough yet. If we see him in more games than I‚Äôll rank him higher"
So he's like Coby white minus the ability to sometimes get really hot from outside. Yuck
"I give you Thaddeus Young plus Thomas Satoranaky, Coby White and two picks if you throw in Brogdon"
"the only players shooting 90%+ at the line this year are cp3, lillard, gallinari, irving, curry, coby white, and kemba if you round up"
"Very much agreed about the cherry picked stats. I would have called it out myself if you hadn‚Äôt.   That said, this is what Ant fans have been seeing in reverse all year. There was an article from the Ringer a few weeks ago that used rookie stats to compare the top rookies from this class against historic rookies to ‚Äúproject‚Äù their ceiling. For Anthony, they chose his usage rate combined with his FG% and compared him to Dion Waiters, Coby White, and JR Smith. And then for Melo, they did some magic with his stats of like 15-5-5 to compare him to Luka, Trae, and Ja. It‚Äôs just infuriating to see the misrepresentation.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/20/22393182/rookie-comps-lamelo-ball-anthony-edwards-tyrese-haliburton  *edited to correct typo"

"It's hard with so many free agents (Theis possibly staying, Markkanen definitely leaving, etc.) but I'd go with LaVine, Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Coby White and maybe Troy Brown Jr as our only players that matter."
3 pt Fouls - Coby White (probably)
"He doesn‚Äôt even move slow offensively tbh. He‚Äôs kinda like DLo in that regard, where they aren‚Äôt extremely athletic guards, but shifty &amp; crafty enough to get to their spots. He has really long strides and can blow by guys. Definitely looked a lotttt faster since his return from injury.   Here at [1:28](https://youtu.be/1gwMOTES0pM) he smokes Coby White, one of the fastest guards in the league"

Don't you have Coby white?
My boy Coby White
"The weird thing about Bledsoe is that he was solid at running the pick-and-roll and actually an above average shooter on pull-ups while he was on the Bucks. I think if he can stick to those skills and play strong defense, Chicago has enough spacing to make it a good fit. Having him run P&amp;R with Vuc while LaVine runs off-ball is a better game plan than trying to make Coby White a primary playmaker, and they'll probably get an asset out of taking Bledsoe's contract."
Best case scenario trade him to like bulls have bulls give coby white to some team with a decent forward/center and have that center be traded to u and some centers that make sense are boucher if mobley somehow falls to raps diallo rudy gay
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
"I am optimistic since the decision makers for the Bulls are entirely new.  I expect Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic, Pat Williams and *maybe* Coby White to still be on the team next season, but outside of those four, it could easily be a brand new squad."
I like Cam because of the way Coby White reacted when he got drafted
"If they still had a few lottery picks to throw around I could see it. But I think the best offer they could make without gutting the team would be PatWil/Coby White/Tomas Satoransky plus 2025,2027 1sts. Think the Blazers could get a better offer"
I hope they do. The guy's one of the best scorers in the league and yet hasn't made the playoffs once in his career. But that team to me even with Vucevic is just a fringe playoff team. Their young guys like Coby White and Markkanen have been really disappointing so we'll see if they can make some improvements this offseason.
I agree with that.   There is a reliance on White and Williams having a leap to reach contention status.   Vooch might be a bridge to keep Zach happy and develop a winning culture.   There's a year between Vuc's contract expiring and Coby White's contract expiration so they could sign someone good and keep both White and Williams with Bird rights.
1. Lavine   2. Pat Williams   3. Coby White   4. Markkanen 5. Vucevic (cuz he‚Äôll be older)
i think he‚Äôs more of a plan B/C option for teams that can‚Äôt land lowry or something. like the bulls probably don‚Äôt think Coby White is their guy going forward and Pistons could slot Killian/Zo/Cade with Bey coming off the bench or something like that. I think he‚Äôll fill some roll somewhere and get a good offer
"The Coby white reaction all but shows how big of a shock the pick was. He was projected  around 20-30th pick, so Suns get a lot of credit here"
"He said hypothetically without gutting the roster, but I imagine coby white would be involved."
I trade you a barley used marrkenn and Coby White
"What about Lavine, Coby White, and a reunion with Aminu?"
"You actually don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Boucher is a solid help defender. Asking him to guard the massive bigs 1-on-1 is way too much to ask of him. That‚Äôs not his role, he‚Äôs a PF who is forced to play as a center. He shows defensive intensity without about 2 blocks per game/ 2.8 fouls and is decent on switches. Boucher is also a solid offensive rebounder (about 2 a game)  Markannen has 0.6 blocks per game on one less foul lmao. He is a complete defensive liability and shows no effort on that side. He can‚Äôt rebound at all (about 0.7 Offensive rebounds per game). He‚Äôs one dimensional  Why would we ask Gary Trent to be a primary ball handler????? My point is that he would be a valuable player on any team with solid defence (not elite, he has the body but still shows rookie mistakes), good volume three point shooting, can make the extra pass, decent midrange shooter. Any yeah you moron, players take time to adjust after getting traded.   Coby white is a one dimensional point guard. He can score, but he can‚Äôt defend, playmake, or rebound well at all for his position. Take him off a bad team and he doesn‚Äôt have a legit role.  Taking only the PPG and TS% to compare players is beyond stupid because boucher‚Äôs and GTJ primary roles are NOT scoring. They have other facets of their game that make them way.  So yeah, don‚Äôt think you actually watch games"
coby white loving it
Coby White on cloud 9 rn
Lmfao. Sure thing. we'll give you Coby White too and While you're at it take A.K.'s left nut too.
How excited do you think Coby White is right now?
"Well he's worse by about 2 assists. But he's also just a better, more efficient scorer. He's a much better finisher and 3 point shooter.   He's worse than Booker imo. But it'd help if he had Chris Paul rather than Coby White and Tomas Satoranski."
Dude people in this thread are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the guy who dropped 30 in the finals‚Äù like what has Lavine shown that would make someone believe he couldn‚Äôt do the same? People are blaming him because he couldn‚Äôt win with Wendell Carter and Coby White üòÇ
"Getting promptly beaten in the first round after not having a playoffs appearance in forever doesn‚Äôt give y‚Äôall a pass to talk down to teams we don‚Äôt even know if you‚Äôre better than.   The bulls have two all stars that still haven‚Äôt had a full season together, coby white who‚Äôs been promising and is overdue for a leap. And a great wing defender who‚Äôs still just a rookie. Pretty much everything you need on a winning team just still too raw. Talking shit to the bulls makes no sense y‚Äôall are barely better than them"
"Ehh, lonzo doesn‚Äôt exactly provide *consistent* spot up shooting. To me they just don‚Äôt have a lot of choices to make on that roster at point. I‚Äôd like to see them bring in multiple guards or really go full force on coby white to see if they have anything there"
New haircut Coby white and Andrew Wiggins
Same. I think most UNC fans thought that too. Including Coby White.
No I just mean someone like Lonzo Ball or Dejounte Murray. We just can‚Äôt have Coby White as our starter
"Cam Johnson &gt; Coby White, no one said it. Except me!"
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That‚Äôs basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He‚Äôs 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I‚Äôm rooting for them."
Trade everyone and build around a Coby White and Ryan Arcidiacono backcourt
They need a facilitator on that team. Coby White isn‚Äôt that guy but he could be a really good 6 man. They should go after Lonzo because he can both facilitate and play defense which is definitely something that‚Äôll benefit both LaVine and Vuc.
"&gt; in 2019 they also had Cam Johnson, Herro, and Coby White.  I said Cam Johnson already, Herro and White didn't clear the cutoff that you made.    &gt;2018 also had Miles Bridges and Doncic wasnt a good shooter by any means but was more polished in that department than a lot of guys in this class.  I said Miles Bridges already, Luka shot 28% and 33% in the two years before he got drafted, with the 28% coming the year of the draft.  &gt;compared to classes like 2016 and 2017  2017: Fultz, Ball, Jackson(low volume), Markkanen, Smith Jr., Monk, Kennard  2016: Ingram, Dunn, Hield, Murray, Prince  Those classes still only had 5-6 proven shooters."
"Over Coby White and Tomas Satoransky?  Yeah, he is."
The bulls would be my pick. They need Coby White or markinen to break out before Lavine decides to leave.
Zion to the bulls for Coby white
"Satoransky has been pretty darn solid for the Bulls the past couple of years. Imagine if he was backing up someone like Curry, Lillard, or Chris Paul instead of Coby White."
Coby White + Lauri Markkanen + Satoransky/Thaddeus Young + 2nd round pick(s)
Coby white + Thad young + Satoransky + pick  There's no way we're including Zach or Vuc.   Lauri's S&amp;T salary isn't enough. So I guess this is our best offer .   If I were Philly I'm not sure if this is the best package out there. Especially when they're getting brogdon and a pick
As a bulls fan I'll tell u this. If Coby white is the starting point guard next to Zach next year...  The bulls already failed.
I had huge hopes for Coby White. Still do. I'm not selling.
Lol are you serious right now? Where is Coby White?
1. ‚Å†Steph 2. Luka 3. Dame 4. Harden 5. Coby White 6. CP3
"The promised young core are all looking like role players at best, that's why excluding LaVine of course. They've shipped out WCJ and Gafford, Lauri might not even get a second contract from them, Coby White has stalled and he was always more of a scoring guard than a PG. Patrick Williams is the last hope and he's really raw and years away when LaVine's contract is up soon. They're also two picks down, one of which is a lottery pick (not that they've done well with them anyway). It's double or nothing for them, go all in or blow it up."
"There's no rebuilding or retooling phase when you make that Vucevic trade. That's the roster, you build around it, try to maximize things as is. Doesnt mean its a potential title contender but who really cares just have a good team if things go right try to be a 4-5 seed for a a stretch. Just have to hope Vucevic and LaVine stay healthy. I am kind of out on Coby White though which isnt ideal for their long term trajectory. Like Patrick Williams but I also dont know if 3 yrs from now he'll really be a whole lot more than just a nice role player."
I hope you guys can hang on to Coby White and build around him properly. He‚Äôs got a bright future..
Coby White for Ben Simmons trade
I think the bulls can be a solid team with a better pg than Coby white but idk what their cap situation is like
Remember when Coby White was shocked that Cam Johnson only got picked 4 spots after him?
Coby white. Some bulls fans really think he‚Äôs a starting point guard on most other nba teams and is worth a lot more then he actually is trade wise
"If Dame wants out do the blazers blow it up completely?  Maybe the Blazers want young assets?  Disclaimer I realize this isn‚Äôt the best offer the blazers could get, but its just the best i think the Bulls can offer so i‚Äôm throwing it out there.  Bulls can offer:  Patrick Williams Coby White Troy Brown Jr Tomas Satoransky Al Farouq Aminu Future first?  Why the blazers do it:  Patrick Williams is a promising young player, a lotto pick and the 2nd youngest in the nba before the draft.  Star potential.  Coby is another player with star potential who may have been held back by playing next to Lavine.  TBJ is a sweetner as a decent young prospect and the rest are salary fillers   Why the Bulls do it: Sucks to trade Williams, but you can‚Äôt acquire superstars without giving up something.  Dame is a top pg in this league and you hope putting him next to Lavine and Vucevic is enough to become contenders.  You cut 4 mill salary with this move too so you can attempt to keep Thaddeus Young as a valuable glue guy and maybe re-sign Theis to become your starting PF."

"If Cam Reddish has the potential to be an all star, literally anyone in the league can be called that. It would be a meaningless designation. Yes, he's breathing and a professional basketball player so I guess he has a theoretical chance some day.     But the odds are infinitesimal because his growth curve sucks. A few good games in your first two years mean nothing when you have a 9.03 PER rookie year, have eight months off to get better, and then put up a 9.36 PER. He is an inefficient player who actually found a way to shoot worse in his second year than his first.  And not just about anybody who actually watches him play would agree with you.   Here's The Athletic's ranking of the top 50 players on their rookie deals from February: https://theathletic.com/2375978/2021/02/25/zion-williamson-luka-doncic-trae-young-nba-young-talent-rankings-top-10/  Where is Cam Reddish listed? 46th behind ""potential"" all star Marvin Bagley Jr!  There's probably no player in NBA history who has had as two bad of seasons as Cam Reddish and made an all star team. So labeling him the way you do just shows a complete lack of perspective.  Cam Reddish will never be in the top one precent of active basketball players. Seems like so glaringly obvious of a statement but feel free to keep arguing because he was once a minus three in the supposed game of his life against one of the worst defenses in the league. That's definitely enough.   Coby White scored thirty in three straight games once and I would call anyone who said he was a potential all star a moron."

"I think you are too close to see it dude. It'd be like me as a Bulls fan arguing that Coby White is a potential all star because of a few awesome games and only being two years into his career. Yeah, theoretically, it's possible but just because its possible doesn't mean there's a great potential for it with a 12 point PER.   Making an all star is very hard and it's even harder to do it after showing very little in the first two years. Less than 1% of the league make an all star team. Cam Reddish's jumped in PER from 9.03 in his rookie to...9.36 in his second year. That's not the typical growth you'd see from a future all star. If Hunter comes back healthy, Reddish might not even be a starter on his own team next year because Bogdanovic and Huerter have shown way more than him. How's Reddish ever making it as an all star if he is a bench player with a 10-13 PER in year three?  It's easy to have confidence when something is overwhelmingly likely."
Who would Philly accept from Chicago for Simmons? Patrick Williams and Coby White don‚Äôt get it done.
"Coby White, Satoransky, Thad Young for Simmons. Who says no?"
"You know what, they're a better shooting team than I thought. If Coby White can become the closing scorer down the stretch, I could buy it."
coby white &amp; lauri markannen for ben simmons? please?
They should go for Coby White.
"Yeah haha, I know we would probably have to give up Coby White -- I don't like that though.   Lauri would be great on the sixers in my opinion, he would be one of the better 3 point shooters there. But other than Thad no one really creates space."
"I dont actually think Chicago has what the sixers need. Like if youre willing to put Coby White or Patrick Williams in the deal we can talk about Sato+salary filler, but other than that I think Rubio+Beasley+stuff from Minnesota is a lilely outcome."
"I would like to see Chicago Bulls make an offer if he‚Äôs available. They need playmaking, forwards next to Lavine and Vucevic, Simmons is both. They already traded for Vucevic make another splash and get Lavine in the postseason  Not sure if they have stuff that 76ers benefits but S&amp;T Lauri Markkanen and Coby White is on the table.   PG: Free Agency Signing SG: Lavine SF: Pat Will PF: Simmons C: Vucevic"
"Lavine is the reason we would want Simmons so he‚Äôs off the table.  Probably Thaddeus Young, Coby White, and then anyone else not named Zach, Vucevic, or Williams to make the salaries match.  If you guys really wanted we could try and make a sign and trade with Lauri work too.  Bulls take it to pair a 3rd star with Lavine and to address holes in playmaking and defense.  Its not the best haul for the 76ers, but Thad just had a career year and Coby is already an excellent scorer on a rookie deal. I don‚Äôt think thats enough to get it done, but thats the hypothetical."
Coby white for thybulle who says no
Who knew Cam Johnson &gt; Coby White (I did)
"If I want a player to infuriate me I can just watch Coby White masquerade as a point guard  Idk about 76ers fans but if a mf is getting a max, he better not be on the fucking bench in crunch time just because he can't hit a damn free throw"
"IDK if this works salary cap-wise, but i'd say Simmons for 2 of Satoransky/Thaddeus Young/Lauri/Coby White+ 2nd round pick(s)"
"Where is Coby White, Pat Williams, and Lauri Markkanen?"
So was coby white but that didnt stop him
"I am not sure how many he was able to wear and advertise, but Coby White and his sister also did this for black owned businesses and organizations alike. It‚Äôs a very cool concept"
I can offer one Coby White.
"Lavine. Dude‚Äôs had Coby White, Tomas Satoransky  and Kris Dunn as his point guards since he got to Chicago. Ball and Derozan are huge playmaking upgrades. Plus add the attention Vuc and Derozan will take away from him. He averaged 27 PPG on like 63% TS. That efficiency is about to go up even further."
"Coby White.   I think now he‚Äôll be in a position that suits him much better. He shouldn‚Äôt be the main facilitator, he‚Äôs a great scorer, so talented offensively and shows flashes of being a good playmaker. He‚Äôs gotten some hate from our fanbase but he‚Äôs still only 21 and the talent is obviously there, he‚Äôs just not a PG. (Right now at least, especially not sharing the backcourt with Lavine).  When he gets back, I see him lighting some second units up next to Caruso. Some games he can get as hot as Zach. Depending on how quickly he gets back, he could be a dark horse for 6MOTY."
Where is my disturbing Coby White photoshop
"bulls finna b nice this year, yea they got derozan but guess what they got coby white too, dude bout to go off this season with derozan as a mentor"
And Coby White
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"Exactly, even Coby White cooked us."
How about a package centered around Coby White and a Lauri sign and trade?
"The Bulls come to mind. TBF they started horrifically defensively last year then got pretty ok after Vuc. No, seriously. Coby White was the worst defensive player I've ever seen to start last season but he played with more effort later. Still not good, but not worst I've ever seen"
"They're obviously talking about Caruso, Ball and Coby White"
"To be fair, at the time he or coby white were the consensus next pick. It probably should‚Äôve been Coby anyways since we wanted a pg, but even he hasn‚Äôt been great.   turns out we should‚Äôve just held at 11 and got cam johnson but hindsight and all that."
"I know it's not great, but we will give Coby White, Troy Brown Jr, Lauri Markkanen, and 2 pick swaps for Ben Simmons. Thanks!"
Culver was mocked in the top 10 so it wasn't a reach also Cam Reddish and Coby White are 2 very broken players also. We need players who can contribute now not project picks.
"You could‚Äôve had someone like Cam Reddish, Coby White, Keldon Johnson or Kevin Porter Jr and went with Culver thats hilarious LMFAO"
"I think they‚Äôre being slept on idc if I get downvoted. Vuc, derozan, Lavine, are all near-all star level players, derozan is coming off his best seasons, then throw in one of the best passers in the league (Lonzo) and Pwill. 6man coby white. Super solid team, I really only see their problem being defense but the offense should in theory be nasty as fuck of it all clicks together."
"Just LaVine. Even since 2019, just LaVine and Coby White"
"Nah, a lot of the same issues they've always had, it's just now they're more experienced.    If they do become that, it might hinge on Patrick Williams becoming a legitimate stopper to combine with Lonzo.  That type of high level perimeter defense (if they get it) can be a foundation to build on.  Might also need to use a Coby white trade to buttress their offensive stars with more 3nD and rebounding.  White could be a microwave 6th man scorer, but i just think his organizational role is too confused after being drafted as a foundational piece and getting kicked around in a few different regimes.  Prolly best to restart somewhere else."
"Patrick Williams, Michael Porter Jr, and this one may be controversial but if Coby White goes to a place where he can be a first option and primary ball handler he can be VERY good. once his develops his playmaking and consistency shooting the ball he could be a Trae Young type player"
What makes you think Coby White could be top 5 or top 10 in the future
Imagine making this list and leaving Coby White off it. Please watch basketball man
Coby White
In every player highlight video that‚Äôs against the Bulls you‚Äôll see Coby White doing a weak ass layup that gets blasted
Coby White
"Keldon Johnson (not sure if that counts with his USA team status now), Coby White, Cam Reddish"
"Coby White, last chance to get your tickets to Coby Island boys"
Coby White aka Sub Zero
"Coby White, he will win MIP or 6MOTY this year, and will win finals mvp when the bulls go 16-0 sweeping every round in the playoffs"
The Bulls fit is better than people realize.  Pretty much every player in our starting 5 has never played with talent on this level and will flourish now that teams cannot focus their game-plans on them individually.  Bulls finish with the best offensive rating in the league and reach the ECF.    Derozan and Lonzo both average career high in assists.  Lavine and Vucevic average 25+ ppg. Lavine takes the next step in the playoffs and is in the Superstar conversation.    Coby White is in the 6moty conversation.    Donovan gets COTY for making the fit work.
"I‚Äôm super curious too lol. He‚Äôs either putting Patrick Williams, Lauri Markennan, Coby White, or Alex Caruso ahead of Lonzo, which seems wrong until proven otherwise."
Coby White
Coby White
"Of course they should have.   Instead of Butler they have an empty calories Lavine who has them over a barrell for 5 years 205 million contract next summer and busts like WCJ, Markannen and Coby White.   The Bulls will be better with Lavine on the bench next season as all his teams have been for the majority of his career."
"Of course he won't, what the hell?  There is Lonzo Ball and Coby White ahead of him for the PG position while SG is locked by Lavine. He'll most likely come from the bench as a PG with Coby finally being SG. But he is a great defender and playmaker off the bench and he can make points when needed."
Coby White is recovering from shoulder surgery and won't be available to start the year. Ayo will play.
"I could see that happening, but yeah we‚Äôre definitely making the playoffs. 3 20ppg scorers in the starting line up and  DeRozan &amp; Lonzo brings us the playmaking we desperately needed. Coby White will finally have a role that imo fits his game perfectly, I could see him having a breakout season when he gets back. So much talent, we improved immensely.   Hopefully they do end up signing some defensive from court depth because Thad and Theis are big losses."
God damn Wizards fan are haters. How were Lavine and Vucevic terrible together? And our third option went from Coby White to DeMar DeRozan. You think we‚Äôre going to get worse?
"No one's put the context for this clip yet, and that's surprising, considering how much funnier it makes it. The box score you see onscreen is *deceptive* -- this game was NOT competitive. Miami was up 15 practically the entire time. Chicago couldn't get anything rolling, and it looked like it was due to Miami finally digging themselves out of the .500 COVID-inspired slump they'd been in. The whole 101-96 thing comes from a **ridiculous** 4th quarter behind Coby White and Vooch. It was beautiful; and this is coming from a Heat fan. It was this storybook 4th quarter, and I remember being insanely upset that Miami would choke a game as easy as this before Denzel Valentine pulled up and essentially inked a 10-second contract with the Miami Heat with that shot. It was **deflating**. It was glorious. It's a historical 30-footer.  edit: also, denzel valentine is an ELITE basketball name. not a great basketball player though"
Coby White is the point guard of the future for the Chicago Bulls.
To bulls for Coby White
Bulls have Coby white and Caruso that‚Äôs enough.
"Probably not the best, but the Bulls have basically 3 guys who could be 6th man types in White, Caruso, and Lauri if he sticks around. There are probably a dozen teams Coby and Lauri would start on - like, ya know, the 20-21 Bulls."
"Lavine is the new Booker. He was an empty stats guy until he wasn't. And people will claim that Lavine has expanded his game if/when the Bulls make the playoffs. Which could be true, due to his constant improvement, but he was already a much improved player last year. The Bulls really struggled in the second half, part due to Lavine's covid absence, part due to injuries, and part due to a new team not completely getting used to playing with each other. People forget that the Bulls second half defense wasn't a catastrophe like the first half of the season was. You as a Bucks fan, who at least should admit that without the nets injuries you wouldn't even sniff the finals let alone the championship should know, that anything can happen. Especially in the playoffs. If Pat Williams or Coby White makes a significant leap, Bulls could be a complete team with veterans as well as young bloods. Don't forget that the heat made the finals (after killing your team) and I don't think Butler is a superstar or MVP caliber player. Whether or not this team gets stuck in mediocrity is yet to be seen. It's quite possible. But now this team has leverage for potential moves, which is what any GM worth their salt needs"
"The 8th pick... So what, they miss out on the next Laurri Markkanen or Coby White and instead be in a better spot to re-sign a 26 year old All Star. Seems fine to me."
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
I think the bench would look nice with Lauri.   Clear offensive focal points with White and Markkanen and three defense first guys.   Alex Caruso Coby White Troy Brown Jr Lauri Markkanen Tony Bradley
"Pretty much, those are generally the kind of ideal mold they grow into, assuming they can‚Äôt really develop those supplementary skills.   There‚Äôs always a chance that they can grow beyond that and do just enough outside of scoring to more than a bench spark 6th man, but it happens less often.   I think Coby White is a good example of when that doesn‚Äôt happen, and you‚Äôre more destined to a 6th man role, and maybe Colin Sexton is a good look at the upside? He‚Äôs a little too good to be a 6th man on most teams, but he‚Äôs still a tough fit as a starter on a really good team due to the passing/defense shortcomings. But he‚Äôs definitely a starter level player, just needs the right fit (probably a team with a bigger initiator that lets him be the smallest player in your lineup, and doesn‚Äôt need a nominal PG next to him).   Rozier is an interesting case too, seemed destined for a 6th man career, but he developed his off-ball play and movement shooting enough that he‚Äôs a legit starter."
"DDR is not redundant at all on our roster. We were last in the league in FTA and had basically no half court creation all year (Coby White is not a PG whatsoever, Sato is firmly a backup). DDR addresses both of those issues. Even Lonzo is more of a transition creator than a half court creator. I think people will be surprised to see how much DDR will be handling the ball in the half court"
You get Brunson who is a pure scorer at the 1. You throw in Coby White so we get depth at the 1. We would probably have to give you Powell and/or WCS to match salary.
Coby White could have a chance
"I can‚Äôt see DLo winning MIP after having already been an All Star. I don‚Äôt think Caruso will be at a high enough volume even if he improves his shot, he‚Äôs behind Lavine, DDR, Vucevic, Coby White, and Lonzo."
So take a current role player and basically make them the star on a bad team surrounded by young or iffy help a la Jerami Grant this last year?   Malik Monk is a pretty good pick but is probably at least this year with the Lakers away from really being able to explode in that situation.  THT on the same team is a possibility.   Coby White with the Bulls is a likely choice I think. The team would lose but the stats would be good.  Immanuel Quickley would probably put up Colin Sexton like stats on a bad team.
Coby White would be nice in a Celtics uniform now that Lonzo will be the starting PG for the Bulls.  Coby can score and has size so he‚Äôd be a perfect fit for our offense which is sometimes lackluster and too reliant on the Jays.
"No, he's not. He's at 35.6% on 6.8 pull-up 3s per game. That puts him 36th in efficiency out of players that take at least 1.5 per game. Just ahead of people like Will Bsrton and Coby White."
"That‚Äôs one of the middle cases. As a peak? Idk man, they have 3 guys who have been all stars plus super nice players like Lonzo, PatWill, Tony Bradley, Coby White and Caruso. They could really do well if they put it together."
"75% of comments are ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get the hype‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think there is much. Especially Wiz fans. Lol. No one has us, not even our fans, going to the ECF.   Our 3rd best player went from Coby White to DeRozan. That‚Äôs a huge upgrade. And everyone is talking about defense but look at our lineups last season. We‚Äôve gotten better on paper, especially since it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôre not done. (And we were ranked 12th, Donovan is underrated in this instance.)   Regarding Vucevic, he needed time to transition but he played well. Then Lavine got Covid.   Your comments on Derozan is just bullshit. Inefficient? Bad shots?"
"Not sure what the consensus is but I'm really low on the Bulls' offseason. Derozan seemed like a massive overpay (+ they gave up a 1st round pick), and now they just seem to have a huge glut of scoring guards and defensive liabilities that'll peak in the next 2 years, ready for another poorly managed rebuild. Like, they might as well just trade Coby White now before the fact that he gets hardly any touches or playing time just tanks his value."
Lauri and Coby White
"They are a little similar, I agree. I think the Bulls differentiated themselves a bit with their FA moves though. They acquired more perimeter defense (Lonzo) and PoA defense (Caruso) which should help alleviate some of the issues our guards had last year with both of those areas (Zach is still not a positive but trended upwards; Coby White was the biggest weakness in our perimeter defense). I'm not sure exactly what the problem is for the Blazers is defensively as on paper they have some interesting defenders (Norm, DJJ, Covington). Maybe they need someone who's more committed to playing guard defense?"
"Idk man, can he give us the scoring that Coby White gives us?"
"7ft 23 year old who can shoot and if he plays aggressive attack the basket but lacks defense. He just doesn't fit with Chicago because we have Vooch and defensively they can't play together, Vooch can do everything he does and more at an elite level.  Lauri still has a lot potential and people should take into consideration that he has never played with an actual pg in Chicago, Dunn and Coby white. He probably is getting offers, but hes asking for way too much."
"I'd trade Patrick Williams, Coby White, and Lauri Markannen for him.  I'd take that starting 5 of Ball/Lavine/Demar/Simmons/Vuc"
I'd want Coby White along with salary matching but Chicago doesn't have many picks to give.
Coby white for sure
Only if they give us Coby White too. otherwise no need for a pretty inconsistent player with a poor injury record.
"Im high on Coby White, yes he‚Äôs inconsistent but he was so fucking good when Zach was out"
"Bulls are the 11th best defense in the league. Mostly due to perimeter defense, the 5th best 3P defense in the league.  And it sure isn't coming from Coby White, one of the worst defenders at his position, or Sato.  Zach being a terrible defender is outdated, as the Bulls being a terrible defense is outdated."
"Im high on Markkanen becoming a good player if he can get to the right situation, it unfortunately wont be with us. Im pretty low on Coby White compared to some others, kind of one dimensional but he's fun when he gets hot."
idk if i‚Äôm missing a meme or something but coby white and tj mcconnell could not be more different as players
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he‚Äôs traded for some defensive bigs because we‚Äôre in a bad position if we don‚Äôt get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
"Playing with coby white hurt him last season.. that dude is no playmaker. Ofc some blame lays on Lauri for not being physical enough, but with his 3pt shooting alone he should've gotten more touches in some games when he was wide open. He also got injured in the middle of last season and after he came back he got more passive."
"Coby White - Caruso - Troy Brown Jr - Lauri (who is definitely gone but for now) - Bradley isn‚Äôt too far off from what the Bulls starting lineup has looked like the last few years which says more about GarPax than it does our current depth but I digress.   This squad runs fairly deep, the East is going to be a gauntlet. Can‚Äôt wait!"
"As of right now,  Alex Caruso  Coby white Troy brown jr Lauri Markannen Tony Bradley  Ayo"
"Lol Coby White as a PG, we tried that for a bit and decided to run the offense through Point Thaddeus  That should give you an idea that Coby White ain't no damn point guard"
"Coby white could be a Jordan Clarkson type scorer off the bench, Lauri is allergic to defense and can't score over point guards. He will never ever be a core piece on a contender"
I really thought Coby White was the main PG before DeRozan trade with Lonzo as the 3&amp;D wing.
"Zach, Demar, Lonzo, Coby White, nikola vucevic, Lauri‚Ä¶they‚Äôre pretty solid. Need another big but I‚Äôm pulling for them"
who under-delivered? The team that entered last year with a starting lineup of Coby White-Zach LaVine-Patrick Williams-Lauri Markkanen-Wendell Carter?
"Coby White, which he should be coming off the bench this year."
The better question is how the additions to the team will impact the development of Coby White. I really think White has a higher ceiling than Pat Williams (both have a very very high ceiling).
"They also got Ball, a good defender, and Caruso, a great defender, to take minutes from Coby White, a terrible defender and ensure that Denzel Valentine, another awful defender, doesn‚Äôt play anymore"
"Lonzo is such a good defender that Coby White averaged 27 points against us, Zach LaVine averaged 40 against us, De‚ÄôAaron Fox averaged a whopping 41 points against us over 3 games.   He cannot fight over a screen to save his life. He is good at attacking passing lanes but other than that he‚Äôs massively overrated and you‚Äôre about to find that out.  Good luck with the Lonzo stans though!"
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
"If the Raptors trade away Pascal for that return it would be a massive blow. Also, RoCo has kind of plummeted off a cliff, so I think trading for him and only him is a bad move the bulls too. If the Raptors want to trade Pascal, it might be more worth it to go for Harrison Barnes and a kings first. Coby White, Lauri, and Anfernee are all far less valuable than Harrison Barnes, and the Kings are a desperate franchise. As long as Luke Walton is their coach, there‚Äôs a for sale sign on any talent they want to mishandle"
"Thoughts on this three team trade I thought of this morning  Bulls Receive: Robert Covington  Trailblazers Receive: Pascal Siakam  Raptors Receive: Lauri Markkenen, Coby White, Anfernee Simmons, 2022 Trailblazers FRP, 2024 Trailblazers FRP"
And Coby White
"**Offensively, they are a superb fit.**   Zach doesn't need the ball in his hands to do his thing, and for a lot of last season he did not because the Bulls were desperately trying to make PG Coby White work (it did not). When it wasn't Coby, the ball was often in Thaddeus Young's hands to be a playmaker. There is a reason why Bulls fans were so desperate for a PG.  You have to actually watch Lonzo to realise this, but Lonzo isn't a great point guard. He has great vision, but his subpar handle makes him struggle to playmake in the half court and in pick and roll. DeMar can do all of that at a high level. I don't see why you think the offence would stagnate with the ball in DeMar's hands - he's not a scorer that passes sometimes, he's legitimately a good primary playmaker. Lavine is someone who fits in the former category and the ball is definitely better in DeMar's hands for a team offense.   Caruso will be backup PG alongside Coby White, letting him go back to his natural role as a scorer and end the terrible PG experiment. They fit well together. Is 8m or whatever Caruso got too much for a backup PG? Maybe, but that's what they needed with Sato gone.   * Lonzo will thrive when he doesn't have to be the primary playmaker, and he can act as an elite glue guy offensively.  * Lavine will thrive going from 0 playmaking around him to 3-4 playmakers in the starting unit, and the best spacing he's ever had. * DeMar with thrive with 4 shooters around him, giving him space to operate. * Patrick Williams is a guy who can fit anywhere on any team, but we will see how improved he is next season. * Vuc will play with guys who can really collapse a defense and draw attention away from him for the first time in his career. He won't be getting doubled in the post with the shooting around him.  4/5 guys are very efficient offensive players, and I feel like each one of their starters is going into the best situation of their career.  Their bench is a little dicey atm and we need to see what moves they have planned, but I think the Caruso/Coby back court is a great fit.  **Defensively, they will be bad**  Chicago had really poor defensive schemes last year. Vucevic was a neutral defender in Orlando, mostly because Clifford's excellent defensive schemes and our mostly decent perimeter defenders were able to limit situations that were bad for him (i.e. Vuc was rarely caught out in an island guarding a small). Wendell Carter Jr was called a horrible defender by Chicago fans pre-trade, but the situations flipped after the trade. Wendell seemed like a pretty solid defender, if a little small, and Vuc was seen as a horrible defender. The difference is not in the players, but that the schemes in Chicago basically sacrifice the big because their perimeter defense was so bad. Rudy Gobert would be a neutral defender at best on last years Bulls. Lonzo and Caruso were upgrades, but I think they need a new defensive coordinator or something because a couple of good but not great guys aren't gonna fix it. DeMar and Lavine are bad defenders too.  Also to your point about 1on1 defenders, you are right but I think Patrick Williams can be that lockdown guy. He was decent but not great on defense, but that's to be expected for rookies. He has the tools to be a monster on that end.  I expect the Bulls to have one of the best offences in the league, especially if they can shore up their bench (maybe via S&amp;T for Lauri). Their defense will be bad, worse if they keep doing what they were doing last year. We will see I suppose."
"Bulls were 11th last year with Coby Ole White as our starting pg, and lauri in our starting line up many times before the vooch trade.   Replace coby with Lonzo and really our only drop off in defense is losing Thad.  If we sign a decent back up big and Pat Will develops more, we actually got better defensively."
"Dosunmu is a rookie and a 2nd rounder at that, he's irrelevant.  Coby white is not a good player at this point in his career."
"Wait, people actually like this move? DeRozan? A wing from the Jurassic era? What is he going to do for the Bulls? He‚Äôs not going to score, he‚Äôs not going to pass, he‚Äôs going to defend mediocrely, he‚Äôs on the wrong side of 30, they just got Ball who I don‚Äôt even think will move the needle, and they have LaVine, they have Coby White, they have the rookie Dosunmi, what the fuck do they need DeRozan for that they had to fork over 65 million to do it?"
Or Coby White!
"Not quite sure of some of the Spurs' off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner). They preferred going for Jimmy Butler and some cheaper bigs like Millsap and Bro-Lo. Either that or wait a year for Durant in 2016.  - drafting Primo over Moody, Alperen or Kai Jones  - drafting Vassell over Halliburton   Pop's best bet to secure the future would actually be to play all the young guys hard but try and somehow tank for Victor Wembanyama or Emoni Bates."
"He deserves to go out whichever way he chooses.   Although, not quite sure of some of their off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner).

"Lavine, Derozan, Coby White, Caruso, Lonzo  That's a loaded back-court. I guess Zach/Demar can play some small forward, but still. Will be interesting to see how it plays out."
yep and coby white isnt horrible
"I swear to God the Bulls front office just snapped. But I understand, Lavine is his prime now so you might aswell give it a shot, most of their main guys are still young enough to improve next year and at worst be flipped for picks if it doesn't get them anywhere  I'm actually pretty excited with the Bulls with what they got this Off season, let's not forget they have Vuc (cry) so as a group if the coaching is right they really are a Playoff team and might be a sleeper for round 2  PG - Lonzo  SG - Lavine  SF - Demar  PF - Williams  C - Vucevic  with Coby White &amp; Caruso off the bench looks VERY interesting to me, this looks like the kinda team that really take down bigger teams with the right coaching &amp; fluid team basketball"
Where does coby white end up in the rotation after all these acquisitions?
He‚Äôs definitely better than Coby White lol
People forgot all about Coby White
"Bulls incoming. S&amp;T for Lauri, Coby White, and two 1sts"
"LaVine, DeRozan and... Who? Vuc is a solid defender so you couldn't have meant him, Lonzo and Williams both decent as well. Not to mention that last year's team was above average defensively despite starting LaVine, Coby White and Lauri Markkanen.  You're also ignoring that the bench of full of quality defensive players who will spend time mixed in with the starters - Caruso, Brown Jr, Johnson, Green, Jones Jr, Bradley - all good defenders."
"LaVine, Vuc, DeRozen, Ball, Caruso, Coby White... This is a pretty damn talented team. I don't think DeRozen has ever been the 3rd best player on a team since his first couple of years in the league.  I really think that they are gonna be able to compete with some of these teams for the #3-6 seed."
Ah the Alex Caruso and Coby White debate
"Fun thread, thanks for the content.   I would say the 2019 draft doesn‚Äôt have a bust in the top 3, personally. It‚Äôs not like the next 4 picks, Hunter, Garland, Culver or Coby White have shown more than Barrett.   Barrett is still negative BPM but getting 18-3-6 on 44-40-75 for a playoff team at age 20 is really impressive. Seems like he‚Äôs performed as well as could be expected."
1. Coby White 2. Derrick White 3. Hassan Whiteside  4. Aaron Gray 5. Devin Gray 6. Ed Gray 7. Evric Gray 8. Gary Gray 9. Josh Gray 10. Leonard Gray
"I really wanted my Bulls to pick him up with the #7 pick as it was a pretty good situation for them even if he flamed out.  At the time, they had just come off the first year of the rebuild around LaVine (who was recovering from ACL surgery), rookie Lauri Markkanen, and Kris Dunn.  Drafting MPJ and redshirting the entire year (instead of Wendell Cart Jr) would have put more of the focus on Lauri in his second year while seeing what LaVine had left in the tank (hint: a lot) after knee surgery and being deliberately bad while developing the core pieces of your major trade for another season together and maybe netting a top 5 draft pick in the process.   But let's say they end up with #7 again anyway and draft Coby White again. Now you're heading in to that season with 2 lottery pick rookies, in Coby White and MPJ, hopefully some definitive answers on Dunn, LaVine, and Markkanen.   This also would have taken the pressure off Hoiberg to succeed, knowingly redshirting a lottery pick for a year, and perhaps spared us of 20 months of Jim Boylen."
"facts! In a few games towards the end of the season Zach and Vooch looked really good with each other. This was approximately around the time when Coby White was playing his best basketball as the team's PG. Now that we have multiple legitimate playmakers at the guard positions Zach and Vooch should absolutely thrive.  I also think people are still sleeping on Coby White. The dude still has the potential to be a very good starting SG in this league if he keeps his current season-to-season improvement. He gets to go crazy with the bench unit as the main scorer, which is his absolute best role (imo).   This team could go a lot of ways, but it will be fascinating to see how everything fits together"
Coby white :)
As a blazers fan I can tell you right now that Portland is not fucking trading Larry nance Jr (a piece we sorely needed and just traded for ourselves) for coby white. Get that delusional shit out of here.
As a Bulls fan I heard the 1st that became DeMar + Lauri/Thad Young + Coby White was laughed at. I know Sexton is much better than any of that but I remember the sixers being disinterested in Lauri. I doubt hes a piece in it
"Embiid is so dominant that even a slightly above average guard would look amazing.    Sexton / CJ would be great, even a combination of Dragic / Maxey and Coby White would be interesting imo."
He wasted Coby White and Vuc‚Äôs effort to climb back up after being behind 15+ pts all throughout the game lmao   I thought it was one of those Heat losses where we‚Äôd be up double digits only to allow opponents to still win. But this dude saved our asses ‚ò†Ô∏è
"Championship - speak it into existence! More likely a first round exit but I can‚Äôt stand the people saying we gave up our future to be perennial first round exits. We kept Coby White, who averaged 15/4/5 on 40/35/90 shooting splits in his second year!!! We kept our prized possession: Patrick Williams, who we‚Äôre banking on to succeed just like any other team with young talent. We picked up young prospects who still have the potential to be something in this league such as Tony Bradley, Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr. etc...we have two first round picks this year (our own! and Portland‚Äôs lottery protected FRP). This isn‚Äôt me just drinking the Kool-Aid, we‚Äôve been rebuilding for awhile now and it wasn‚Äôt working so the new FO said fuck it, we‚Äôre going to compete and build a team around Lavine, who we believe has superstar potential, while also keeping a solid young core intact to fall back on if this iteration of the team fails."
Coby White for Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn (two Chicago boys). Who says no?
"They should trade for Coby White so they can have Lebron, Jordan and Coby on one team"
"not one of the greatest, but Coby White is one of the most hot and cold shooters I've ever watched"
"If you dont know what a real friend is, look at Coby White."
Coby White is going to ABUSE opposing benches
Coby white
Coby White + Pat Williams + 2 picks   Starting lineup of Ball\Lavine\Derozan/Simmons/Vuc would be deadly and they‚Äôd all be in their prime.
"I don‚Äôt think he is as horrible of a player as everyone else here does but I don‚Äôt see a spot for him on the bulls unless they could get him for super cheap (coby white + filler + picks) but even then, the contact might prevent us from resigning Zach"
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"Roster construction in my opinion is very different. For Phoenix, Ayton took the leap to being a dominant defensive center without which they would not have gone nearly as far. For all his skill, Vucevic is a defensive turnstile and always has been. DeRozan plays an iso heavy midrange game and is on the downslope of his career. Lonzo had a career year shooting from deep and still has a middling efficiency rate due to the fact that he cannot drive, finish, or draw fouls with consistency. Outside of LaVine all the Bulls guys have pretty significant holes in their game. And thats all before we start comparing Chris Paul's PG play to that of Coby White."
"See I get it, but what you're forgetting is Coby White is going to take a huge leap and have an MVP level year this year. He will show everyone why he is the true goat of the Chicago bulls"
We also removed some of our worst defenders from the team (Lauri and Denzel) or from the starting line up (Coby White)
"&gt; They added Lonzo whose a good defender and Caruso, but they also added Derozan who is a huge negative.   We also removed Coby White from the starting line up(who was a worse defender than Derozan was last season) and Denzel+Lauri from the team, losing Thad will definitely hurt tho."
"I was with you generally until the last line. Nothing about this feels like the Rondo/Wade Bulls. The Rondo/Wade Bulls were a terrible experiment by an incompetent FO with two fairly burned out assets that probably didn‚Äôt have good all around talent anyway, but combined that talent with some of the worst spacing in the NBA. That group also had problem personalities which I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt happen,  but this group certainly doesn‚Äôt have a rondo.   We don‚Äôt know how good the team is‚Äî they‚Äôre returning like three players from this time last year... LaVine, Coby White, PWill... I think that‚Äôs it. But even if it fails I don‚Äôt think anyone should look back at it in the same stratosphere as what the Bulls did with Rondo and Wade."
"Other than Lavine, maybe Coby White? Would hate to lose him but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wouldn‚Äôt trade him for an all star lol. Thaddeus Young is one of my favorite players in the league but he already got traded sadly.   The only answer is Lavine. Unless we got like Luka Doncic back I‚Äôd feel like crying lol."
No ‚ÄúCoby White‚Äù is slang for ‚Äúaverage role player‚Äù
"MPJ  But I've been irrationally high on MPJ since he was a senior in high school and projected to be the #1 overall pick the following year until he had back issues.  I *really* wanted my Bulls to scoop him up when he fell to #7 (Wendell Carter Jr) as it was a perfect situation for them to red shirt him his rookie year while developing Lauri, Lavine, and Dunn, their new toys from last year's trade, which would have meant an even worse record than they cobbled together that year, which could have meant an even better draft pick than #7 (Coby White) the following year."
Coby White and Pat Will. I'm a sucker for homegrown talent (altho I was glad when we got rid of Lauri/Wendell tbh cause I didn't like either one that much)
"Bulls finished 12th in defense improving from 24th after the deadline with vuc, lavine, coby white, Denzel valentine, and tomas satoransky playing heavy minutes.  The defense won't be atrocious, especially when you consider coby white was one of the worst defensive players in the league last year according to raptor."
Thad looked great in almost every game he played with us. He played with Coby White as a starting pg among other young and/or poor decision makers.   His +/- is probably depressed from his Bulls tenure.
The cursed NBALM brick Coby White?
Coby White
Was gone say Alex Caruso but imma go with Coby white...if he come back off his injury Nd get it going coming off the bench with that second unit them bulls gone look scary
Coby White baby all day everyday
I really want Coby White to be an allstar in the next 6 years   luka doncic will win a ring in the first season after he leaves dallas
"That‚Äôs nonsenese. Sure he‚Äôs extension eligible but not every rookie goes after the bag before the end of the rookie deal. Particularly one where we have no reason to believe they have a market. Coby White will not be a problem playing on the fourth year of his rookie deal.   Lauri wasn‚Äôt even fwiw, jut needed to move him after the season."
You're a year off. Coby is one year older than PWill (in terms of experience and being drafted) which means his rookie deal covers this year and next year. White will be an RFA after 2022-2023 not this year.
"Hard disagree. I believe Portis and Coby White were good picks.  Portis without injuries could have been more.  The only draft you can consider 'bad' for the Bulls in that era was 2012 when we picked Marquis Teague at 29 when Crowder, Draymond Green and Middleton were all available (all picked in the 2nd round - so everybody else missed too). Yeah Wendell Carter didn't work out but what other 5 could we have drafted that year that's any better? That was what we needed at that time."
"They passed on using their cap space to take on bad contracts/get picks and used some of their own draft capital to acquire veteran talent. Lonzo, Lavine, and Pat Will are all young but every other young player on that roster is probably expendable. They may keep that pick but they seem to want to compete, a mid-first rounder isn‚Äôt going to move the needle, which is what they‚Äôll get from Portland when it conveys.  Attaching that pick with someone like Coby White could fetch you a very nice depth piece. Not saying they‚Äôd do that, just an example"
"The Chicago Bulls are championship contenders. On any given night, nobody is stopping Vooch, Lavine, and DeRozan 1 on 1, and if they double any one of them they‚Äôre getting cooked on that possession. Billy Donovan‚Äôs elite defensive system will hide the defensive deficiencies of the team, and future sixth man of the year Coby White will demolish opposing bench units. And I haven‚Äôt even mentioned future all star Lonzo Ball, who is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical. This team is preparing to be a dynasty, and I cannot wait to see them dominate the overrated Lakers and Nets."
"The Magic have made the playoffs twice in their last nine seasons and have never won more than one game in the first round in that stretch. If I thought the Bulls ceiling was that, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was worth it lol.   You could also ask Bulls fans if the last five years of rebuilding were worth it when Lauri, Valentine, Wendell Carter, and Coby White were the draft selections. Hell, even the Bucks got lucky with a 15th overall pick in Giannis and traded for the surrounding pieces in Khris (a throw in) and Jrue (called an overpay on here). If you trust any team to build a contender through the draft without an absurd amount of luck you have more trust in the draft process than me."
Plus Coby White looks like he'll be a pretty good 6th man for a while
"Coby white, Lauri, Caruso, Troy brown jr, Tony Bradley is no bench?"
I like coby white for these odds
Would it not be Coby White?
"I guess my push back from a ‚Äòbuy-in‚Äô perspective is that at the beginning of last year this was a team that had a younger starting 5 than the University of Wisconsin and aspirations to maybe be the 10th best team with zero career all-stars and now they have three all-stars and a relativity of hope. So in terms of inspired ball I get why Thad is such a floor leader but I think this team is far more excited and willing to push compared to yesteryear.  To me the main thing is simply that anyone who watched the Bulls last year knows how bad the on-ball, point of attack, pressuring of the ball handler was. Teams had such an easy job setting up half court sets and not feeling pressured and getting to set their own tone. Thad‚Äôs IQ and help defense made up for a lot of mistakes. I think the hope is that if they can actually pressure the ball at the point of attack with more than just a Garrett Temple, it‚Äôll make some of those help roles easier.   Perimeter pressure was soooo bad. Interior might have stayed the same or even taken a small step back. But like when people say some overrate Lonzo‚Äôs defense‚Äî I mean they probably do. But the starting 1 for the Bulls this time last year was Coby White. And the difference on defense between Lonzo and Coby is just massive."
Coby White and Derrick Rose seem like the best value picks. Especially if their teams continue to improve and they can build that narrative. Wouldn't be surprised to see Clarkson put up similar numbers again to last season in his role as a microwave scorer but I'm not sure if he'll have the same storyline to drive voters his way.
"For all the shit the Bulls got on defence...the Bulls were ranked 11th last season in defensive rating (adjusted and unadjusted). Thats with guys like Lavine, Vooch, Markkanen, Coby White playing heavy minutes. The best defender in that squad was probably Thad Young."
Cooch for coby white and vooch
Coby White and Vooch could be a dynamic duo. Cooch?
Coby white cause he‚Äôs just such a great dude and a very nice scorer. But I think Caruso will take that spot this season
Coby White has a pretty quick shot
"Because they‚Äôre joining Lavine and Vucevic? Ball family stans do not count (they watched Gelo in the SL and saw an NBA player lol) Lonzo gets overrated by his stans which causes ppl to shit on him and act like he‚Äôs a bum. Reality is he‚Äôs a good starting PG rn and a much better fit next to Lavine than Coby White.   People pretty much only shit on DeRozan lately. He makes team worse defensively, he can‚Äôt shoot 3s, he‚Äôs a playoff choker, on and on. Reality is he addresses our playmaking struggles and our 3rd scoring option went from White/Lauri to DeRozan. That‚Äôs huge. That‚Äôs now 3 all star level players along with a stronger bench. That‚Äôs a playoff team 100%.   It‚Äôs funny that like 60% of comments are the Bulls won‚Äôt be that good, 20% are ‚Äúwhy is everyone overrating them?‚Äù, and the other 20% is saying we‚Äôre a 5-8 seed 2nd round ceiling. Shit is dumb"
"super under the radar answer, but Coby White has a really deep bag.   Some of the moves he used to score last year as only a sophomore were super advanced, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm really high on his future as a microwave scorer. He sucks as a primary playmaker but the dude can get buckets."
Coby white for Evan Mobley confirmed.
"Might be too early to grade but no one is really talking about the Lonzo Ball trade to the Bulls. Pelicans got Garret Temple, and Tomas Satoranski.  Pels are struggling mightily without anyone who‚Äôs able to get others plays. Who knows how long Zion will be out but their schedule is about to get really tough. Temple is not a playmaker, not great on offense and Sato isn‚Äôt even in their rotation. I know Ball was leaving anyways but I‚Äôm a little surprised Bulls were able to get him without losing Coby White."
"Coby white will be the primary ball handler on the second unit, Caruso as good as he is is not particularly well suited to that"
"For the sake of increasing his trade value, from now on, we should all talk about Coby White as if he's the greatest player ever.  Example: Man, I'd give ANYTHING to have a player like Coby White on my team! I have him in the S-Tier along with Giannis and Luka!"
Coby White and Zach Lavine are literally the only players still on the roster from the GarPax era. The GarPax regime has ended and the AK-Eversley Regime has begun!
"If you‚Äôre the bulls and Coby White becomes redundant with what you already have in demar, lavine and vooch adding more role players makes sense"
1 coby white and picks for ben simmons please
Coby White seems like one of those players that one season take a leap to star/superstardom out of nowhere
Chicago should talk to the Spurs about getting Thaddeus Young for Coby White and DJJ.
They‚Äôve rejected 3 firsts for him already. What do you suspect the trade value of a 24ppg 2-way forward on 20m a year is? Coby White for Grant isn‚Äôt nearly enough‚Ä¶
Killian Hayes for Coby White? Highly doubt the bulls would accept this but I‚Äôd be down
"I like that you're high on us. I think when you look at the starting lineup, it doesn't seem like a big deal. When you realize how important the DeRozan stagger is to our bench unit's production, it's huge. Without Coby White, our bench would hurt if we weren't always cycling DeRozan and Zach."
"&gt; Bulls would stick with White regardless of who drafted him if they thought he fit with what they are trying to build. Clearly they don't.  Even more than that, this is a tweet citing unnamed sources *outside* of the Bulls organisation, speculating based on nothing more than hearsay.  Nothing in this tweet is evidence that the Bulls themselves are looking to shop Coby, it's just gossip"
When's Coby white coming back? Maybe step back then
"I think the unspoken rule is that anything north of the belly button is something you ""tough through"", unless it's on your shooting side, a piece of completely-ruptured soft tissue, or a broken bone.  PS and where the hell is Coby White? He's a walking 30-point game when given the chance, and this scenario is literally why you have him on the roster."
"Culver just busted, on Draft Night it was a nice trade. Imagine if Garland slipped (which was probably the main reason they did this trade) or they picked Coby White. sadly culver busted q lot and this trade looks awful"
"He's talking about the construction of the bulls roster. When he said Coby White is doing well, he means since he was drafted. He's doing well as in Chicago did a good job picking him."
Nah coby white
I‚Äôm surprised he knew who Coby White is
he could just like...talk about a detail he DID know. it wasn't like someone quizzed him on Coby White and he had to come up with an answer or something.
"He says Coby White is doing well right after referring to him being from North Carolina. He never says he is doing well **this season**, he means he is doing well in general.       Just easy karma to clown Chuck."
Does this mean that Coby White will be Steph?
"Yeah, people seem to spend a *lot* of time concentrating on what Demar doesn't do - he's a bad defender, he likes to be The Man on iso ball, he shoots from 15 feet in an era where nobody in the league does that unless they have 2 seconds to shoot - and as a result they don't get into what he *can* do. I think as a result of that DDR is lowkey one of the more underrated players in the league.  I've been absolutely loving what he's been in Chicago so far. Last night the Bulls were just getting destroyed by the Raptors' fullcourt press and in a way that looked sickeningly familiar, in spite of Lavine and Pat Williams being the only holdovers from last year (also Coby White but he's injured) - guys trying to do too much, playing too fast, getting weirdly frantic. Then Derozan was just like ""okay, give me the ball"", calmly walked the shot clock down to 8 seconds like it was still 2001, and got a couple of daggers with isolation. It was exactly what the team needed and exactly what they didn't have last season in situations like that.  Demar reminds me a *lot* of late-career Kobe Bryant. Kobe was a much better defender in his prime although TBH by the time he was doing the things that remind me of him when I watch Derozan he wasn't doing much on that end anymore. But Kobe even when he was young had this thing where he'd try to break you down and sometimes you could do your job against him and keep him in the midrange and force him into a fallaway jumper... and he'd *still* manage to hit that, and not only hit the shot but since you knew he was going to hit it you had to still chase after him and when you chase after a guy falling away you're probably going to draw a foul doing it.  I'm sure there will be a time or two when Derozan goes iso-ball late and doesn't hit a shot and everyone, probably including me, will demand that he pass to Zach more. But at least last night, a little bit of calm, Kobe-style ball was just what was needed."
"I'm sorry, what ? Caruso is an amazing bench player, okay. Then afterwards none of these players would play minutes in the playoffs for a contender.   Coby White is the 7th best player on this team and he's shot 40% from the field in his career, he's not a good player. Then who ? Javonte Green is very average and hasn't played a lot of NBA basketball, I know Alize Johnson as a Nets fan, lots of potential but he's still very raw. He has only played in 50 NBA games and it's his 4th season. TBJ is average, Bradley is average and Ayo is a rookie.  You say that's a very good bench, I say that's a very bad bench and in the playoffs you will have to play liabilities a lot of minutes. One major injury and the team falls off hard"
"The starting 5 is amazing but the bench is kinda mid, after Caruso it falls off hard. I hope Coby White can have a better season than last year but even then they're only 7 deep. In the middle of the season when you need to dig deeper into your bench for whatever reason (injuries, B2Bs etc) it's gonna hurt them and cost them some spots in a competitive Eastern conference.   If they can end up top 4 in the east they've overachieved hard, I see them as a 6th, 5th seed tops"
"Some people just gotta see to believe. The Bulls have 3 returning players from last year, not including the trade deadline acquisitions. Zach, Coby White, and Patrick Williams. It‚Äôs hard to put any faith into a team that hasn‚Äôt proven anything yet during the off-season."
"PG defense is probably the second most important behind the Center.  When the other team's primary ball handler can initiate the offense unmolested, the defense is scrambling the whole possession to recover from the open man or mismatch.   What the first action leads to zero advantage and the defense is still completely set, all of a sudden it's the offense that starts scrambling to create a good shot before time runs out.  The difference between Coby White to Lonzo is literally going from bottom 5 to top 5."
"I was pissed when we picked him. I wanted Coby White. We had 2 years hearing about how much of a work ethic he had. But seemed to do him no good. No improvement at all over the 2 years.  You can go ""lolwolves"" over it but we turned Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell and Jordan McLaughlin into legit rotational pieces in the same time period. Dude just straight up sucked"
theyre scrappy and hustle but clearly lacking in offense and chemistry (all new players). I think Derozan will end up playing a lot with the bench unit. Also Coby white should give the bench some much needed shooting when he returns
"I'm a bit concerned for the depth, even with Coby White available there isn't really more than 3 or 4 guys at best I would want on the court for non-garbage time minutes"
But that man is also Coby White
"We definitely need Coby White back so we can have a consistent scorer off the bench, 10 bench points is abysmal."
I thought he was gonna go straight to the G League but he's getting minutes and the bench squad is looking shaky so far so it seems like he has a chance to carve out some minutes. Coby White coming back may limit that though.
Ayo please make Coby White irrelevant
"And in spite of that, the Bulls were a top 15 defensive team last year before we added Ball, Caruso, and DJJ. DeRozan is a bad defender, but is he really a significant downgrade on Lauri, who he is replacing?  If Billy D turned a team with Coby White, Zach, and Lauri getting major minutes into a decent defense, I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs unrealistic to think this team can be too, when you got 2 legitimate plus defenders in spots of need this off-season."
Coby White?
i can offer you one (1) vucevic and one (1) coby white for him
Coby White.
Coby White 6moy
"I agree this isn't a hot take, because it's realistic. I do think bulls at least make it to the play in tourney at seeds 7-10, but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't make the actual playoffs. Like you said they really only have one true all star I'm Lavine. Vooch is good, but he's really not THAT good and DeMar is way past his prime. I think ball will be the perfect fit but things will get awkward with a rotation of ball, Coby white, and Caruso. I do think Patrick Williams could break out, but there's so many average to barely above average guys on this team that the minutes are gonna look really weird. If the bulls focus on developing the younger guys I could see this team being competitive in a few years, but as of right now they don't have the star power to get out of the east imo."
"U are heavily underrating Lavine and Vucevic they gonna be a 6 seed at minimum this year and only going higher with Lavine, Lonzo, Coby White, and Pat Will development"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"I mean, Bulls were ranked better than average on defense with shittier defensive players last year. Don't believe me? Look it up. Why is it when the Bulls defense is concerned, no one looks at the stats? Coby White and Lauri were honestly the worst defensive duo in the NBA to start the season last year. They're no longer starting. This narrative is old and tired and peddled by Friedell, who fucking hates the Bulls but somehow represents the Bulls on national media"
"Bulls have a number of potential scapegoats, probably depends on who exactly plays poorly. DeRozan, Lonzo, and Donovan are the most likely, maybe Coby White gets some hate but I don‚Äôt expect his role to be big enough for that, Lavine could if be underachieves but I feel like people will make more excuses for him than the new people."
"Cunningham: Larry Bird, OJ Mayo  Green: Bradley Beal, OJ Mayo  Mobley: Kevin Garnett, Marvin Bagley  Barnes: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Julian Wright  Suggs: Chris Paul, Coby White"
"Maybe he'll be something someday but 2nd year Patrick Williams is not a ""great"" defender. And to say Coby White or Troy Brown are even average defenders, let alone ""great"" is hilariously delusional. There's no one on the Bulls who can anchor a defense like Capela does."
and I got a guy in my sub saying Coby White is what he is after 2 shortened seasons smh
"I think LaVine's a great answer here. One of these games, when the teams feels comfortable with their record, he'll catch fire, and his teammates will realize that and let him have the ball as much as he wants. Great efficiency, already takes volume, Lonzo/Vuc/DeRozan are willing passers, and Chicago could really use a modern version of MJ to sell tickets. He has enough size and athleticism to beat doubles if needed and can get to the line too. Just don't let Coby White on the floor while this is happening."
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
Don't forget Coby WHITE
"Still missing 3 of our rotation players Patrick Williams, Coby White, and Tony Bradley."
Coby White  Derrick White  Jo Jo White  James White  Hassan Whiteside
believe me the talent level and experience is still there. they know their roles and are better 4th and 5th options than coby white or lou williams
"I think they can do a lot better, even in that scenario, than trading for 2 years of Vucevic, coby white, and a Portland non-lottery first, which is the only pick the Bulls can trade because all their first rounders after 2022 are subject to being traded.   Coby does nothing for them, they don't need him with Cam Johnson, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Cameron Payne on the team already. His role will be very small. Vuc is in no way valuable enough to make that trade work."
"Think about it from the Suns' perspective, Ayton is their best young non-Booker talent and the Bulls can't offer anything in the draft other than a non-lottery Portland 1st and 2nds.   Vucevic is a nice starting point, but Coby white wouldn't even have a large role on their team. I don't think they would make the trade without Patrick Williams involved and at that point the Bulls are out because there's no way they're trading Patrick Williams."
"PF is Patrick Williams (currently injured), sixth man would be Caruso, but I think he meant Coby White(injured)"
And they‚Äôre missing Pat Will and Coby White!
They definitely are but it‚Äôs nice to get a little taste of what the Bulls will look like offensively. This is also without Patrick Williams and Coby White.
"I didn‚Äôt say WE would be top 2 but yes our offense should jump to at least top 7 not just because we got Demar, Lonzo and Caruso but because they‚Äôre replacing Satoransky Coby White,Thaddeus Young as our primary ball handlers. You know it infuriating watching Coby White ‚Äúrun the offense‚Äù last year? Lonzo,Demar and Caruso are ridiculous upgrades over what we had last year. Zach had to try and create everything for us last year and he tried but it‚Äôs not his strong suit, having him play off ball will make him even more lethal offensively. Same with Vooch no point guard to actually utilize him so we were just running horrible pick and pops with him every possession."
"Derozan isn't replacing Thad, he was coming off the bench. He will be replacing Markkanen.   Losing Thad hurts us but our bench also gained a lot this offseason with Caruso and moving Coby White there.  Lonzo is also a good defender that replaces a bad defender in the starting lineup."
"We had the 12th best defense last year and Lonzo will be replacing Coby White, Derozan will be replacing Markkanen. Its possible to defend as a unit even without top defenders."
No he wants to play with Coby white
"Caruso, coby white, Derrick Jones jr are all solid?"
"I say this as a Bulls fan:  The Bulls are completely and utterly unproven which is the biggest reason nobody is talking about them. They have a bunch of high caliber players who have not had playoff success. Both Vooch and Zach are stars on non-playoff teams and its been awhile since Derozan has done much in the playoffs.   The reality is that we haven't seen a roster construction like this before and it is really hard to know what to expect. IMO they will surprise a lot of people and be in the 4-5 seed region.   I agree with you that on paper this team seems really really good for flying this low under the radar. The starting 5 is extremely solid from 1-5 with a great mix of veteran and young players. They have to have one of the most athletic rosters in the whole league, and the bench has some really nice pieces in Coby White and Caruso.   The only way I see this team playing poorly is if Vucevic gets hurt. The center depth is not good and having to depend on Tony Bradley is a recipe for disaster. The guard and wing depth is really good though. I also think that we will se Patrick Williams playing a decent amount of small ball center. He is really strong and has great rim protection instincts."
"Believe me, we‚Äôve watched Coby White die on them for an entire season. We‚Äôre very well aware."
They should be atrocious defensively but I'm excited to see how they look probably more than almost any other team. Lonzo Ball is a good on ball defender but they'll still be really really bad defensively  Edit: I'm also a big Coby White fan but I feel like that's me just liking him more than thinking he will develop a ton
I‚Äôd feel lost too watching Coby White and Lauri play defense
"Lonzo is pretty good with a stretch big like Vooch. And hopefully still improving. Lavine is the closer, and Coby White was a fine bench option. Caruso is actually a competent secondary playmaker.   I just don‚Äôt like the DeRozan move. A lineup of Lonzo - Lavine - Caruso - Williams - Vooch is better than one with DeRozan."
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
How about Coby White?  The white ball sack itch?
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough‚Ä¶ seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I‚Äôd say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he‚Äôs already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"yes, Zach scored about 4 less points per game than Beal on much better efficiency, and has Beal beat in practically every single advanced stat possible  if you look at adjusted shooting too, the difference is MASSIVE, Zach‚Äôs stats being much much much much better. In fact, his adjusted shooting is by FAR better than Mitchell and Booker‚Äôs too.  This is all while having COBY WHITE as his point guard, while Mitchell has Conley, Booker has CP3, and Beal has Westbrook.  it‚Äôs insane how he‚Äôs almost always seen as easily the worst out of that group"
"Come to papa, may I interest you in a slightly used coby white"
"Vucevic had a great game. I hope he can build on this because he's been MIA all season. He had a slow start and was just starting to warm up when he got COVID, sat out a few games, and was cold again when he returned. It's amazing the Bulls have done so well essentially without his help. They will be so much better with his help.  Another Bulls player who started the season late and still isn't in his groove is Coby White. A lot of Bulls fans are calling for rookie Ayo Dosunmu to get more of Coby's minutes, but Coby has played much better than this in the past and it looks like the coaches want to give him minutes so he can get back to form. Even if they ultimately trade him, as some fans are saying they should, they need him to be playing well or no one will want him.  And Ayo, for all his great plays, also makes a lot of rookie mistakes. With the Bulls playing as well as they are, there's nothing wrong with bringing Ayo along a little more slowly.  Alex Caruso has been wonderful on defense but not as wonderful on offense.  He, too, can play better, and his last two games -- really three of his last four games -- have been good offensive games. He needs to keep that going, because it's harder to play him long minutes if he isn't offering much on offense.  It's annoying that the Hornets went on a 19-4 run at the beginning of the fourth quarter to make the game close again, but at least the Bulls responded well and won handily in the end. The Hornets are a good team and this was a great win."
We have Coby White a frp and Troy brown jr available
"Y'all made it scary. I don't know if he's normally way better, but it felt like if you had anyone on the court except for Coby White for those 20 minutes, you probably would have won."
Coby White is way too inconsistent to be the spark plug off the bench type of guy that I was hoping he'd be. For every game where he'll get 20 points he'll have 2 games where he barely scores at all and gets like 5 TOs.
"Chicago fans, what's up with Coby white? I thought kid had potential and seems like he hasn't played that much this year. How do y'all feel about him?"
Coby White is just awful this season. I don't know if that's the effect of injury or other reason. Caruso definitely eat most of his minutes
Javonte green Tony Bradley Ayo dosunmu Derrick jones jr Coby white   Checkmate
"Coby White on 9/11 shooting, +39. Damn."
"Most of the roster is new for the Bulls, so it's tough to get an answer. Vuc got some hate for his slow start but when he was out with COVID and had to start Tony Bradley... All the Vuc love came back.  I'd say the most polarising is Coby White, included in trade talks all the time, but there's probably no actual good answer yet with the Bulls."
Soooooo much Coby White slander
Because he's just straight up not that good right now lol. Also I'm pretty sure Coby white had like 7 threes in a quarter his rookie year or something
I want to say current would be Coby White. Not sure why but there‚Äôs always been people low on him since he was drafted. He‚Äôs breaths the wrong way and fans are calling for his head. Vooch may also qualify but it‚Äôs hard to tell if a lot of the fan base really doesn‚Äôt like him or if it‚Äôs just because of how he‚Äôs played as of late.
Bulls will give you a Portland protected pick and Coby White for him.
how is Dosunmu looking this season? i was always surprised to see him falling into the 2nd round in mocks and was even more surprised to see him selected at 38. Always seemed to have more ability than that.  Also is there any point in playing coby white anymore when u have Ayo?
Coby White as the off the bench volume scorer a la the Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams mold
"Too bad the Kings didn‚Äôt listen to KOC they could‚Äôve had a stacked roster with Killian Hayes, Poku, Coby White and Jarrett Culver"
"Most Bulls fans are aware of his flaws. He‚Äôs not there for scoring. We have Zach, Demar, Vuc and Coby White for scoring. His biggest asset for the team is defense. Him and Caruso set the tone for defense for us and are simply disruptive perimeter defenders who keep the team defense consistently rated top 10."
Lavine   Lonzo  Derozen  Vuc  Patrick Williams  Alex Caruso  Coby White  Ayo Dosunmu
"If you have some playmaking instincts then sure, but if you have none at all like KPJ then you can‚Äôt. We tried this experiment with Coby White last season, it turned out as you would expect, he just isn‚Äôt a point guard"
"The Bulls pulled out another kind of ugly win with no true center on the floor. Coby White scored ten in the 4th quarter, breaking out of his post-injury slump. His teammates were really happy for him, doused him with water during his post game interview.  The Bulls can definitely play better, but I'm holding them to high standards these days. The Knicks tried to shut down LaVine and DeRozan and force other players to beat them and for most of the game, until Coby got hot, the strategy kept them close. White needs to keep it going, Caruso needs to break out of his scoring slump, and Vucevic needs to come back and start hitting threes, which may take a while.  I have December 16 marked on my calendar because it's the Bulls' 29th game. Right now the Bulls are unexpectedly on pace to be a real contender by Phil Jackson's definition -- winning 60 before losing 40. If they can win 20 before losing 10, I think they have to be taken seriously in the East. They really haven't reached their full potential yet, and are still winning."
"Gonna be interesting to see how/when Coby White gets his minutes as the year goes on.  Lonzo played 35, Zach 36, Demar 37, Caruso 30, so I guess it's just a matter of being smart with the rotations.  Don't think Vuc coming back should complicate it too much, since none of those 5 dudes can play his role."
"Coby White, Nikola Vucevic and Patrick Williams missed significant time in this stretch too."
Actually they should trade him to The Bulls for Coby White &amp; the Portland pick.
"Coby white looks either lost or outmatched. Hoping for the former, but watching him go from starter to struggling to get minutes is at least a sign of how much better the bulls have gotten.  The bulls are playing better defense for longer stretches than before and its really great to watch.  Derrick Jones played his ass off last night. Energy energy energy"
when healthy Coby White is extremely consistently inconsistent
Coby White is ass
Coby White to New York for Nerlens Noel and a protected pick?
"Derrick Jones Jr, Pat Williams, Coby White, and Tony Brown Jr for pascal? Lol"
"coby white is a boring name but something about ""Darius Bazley"" is just off-putting to me. dont like the way it sounds or how it feels off the tongue."

"I think I remember some UNC guys going back to the school and just training and messing around with the guys who play there now.   Think it was Coby White and Theo Pinson. It was posted on the Tarheels IG page, so It wasnt like they were trying to hide it."
Coby White???
Coby White for KD?
coby white.
"Move aside bitches, LA has a new owner.  We are so good that we didn't even need Coby White."
"Patrick Williams going down, vooch getting COVID, and Coby White just coming backreally doesn't help the depth.  Vooch will be back soon and Coby will start to get reaclamated should help. He'll be dangerous AF off the bench. Then they could definitely get a backup vet 4."
Coby white kinda sucks
Just getting Coby White back too.. Instant offense off the bench. Bulls best 6 players are up there with any team in the league. My boy Troy! Go Ducks
"&gt;Chicago is without Patrick Williams and Coby White, which is a far more impactful loss than Morris, Winslow, Johnson and Preston, so yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that both squads were pretty shorthanded.  Sir you are delusional if you think patrick williams and coby white are more impactful loss than morris and ibaka"
I'll take 1-2 first and Coby White
"&gt; Are we comparing kawhi to vooch now?  I'm not saying Vooch is *as good as* Kawhi, but he's a two time all-star, a career 17/10/3 guy and a legit player. He costs $24m for a reason and missing him is a big deal.  &gt; Vooch has been struggling all year lol  Vooch had a stretch of 10 bad games. I'm not going to blow smoke and claim he wasn't struggling, but it's 10 games to start the season, relax. He's an 11 year vet, he'll come good, he didn't suddenly go from all-star to washed up over the 4 month offseason break.  What's more, I wasn't just referring to Vooch. Chicago is without Patrick Williams and Coby White, which is a far more impactful loss than Morris, Winslow, Johnson and Preston, so yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that both squads were pretty shorthanded."
&gt;Billy Donovan said Coby White is cleared to make his season debut vs. the Lakers.  Damn good info thank you
Coby White MIP campaign starts now üò§
Coby White!
"my guy Coby White on any given night can either look like a cerebral scorer capable of averaging 30 ppg, or a scrub that would ride the bench in the gleague"
Basically coby white
"Attended the game and it was awesome! It felt like there were almost as many Bulls fans as Clippers fans ‚Äî as a Bulls fan myself, it was a great feeling.  DeMarvelous DeRozan was so dominant all game, but in the first half he was automatic. I‚Äôm starting to see comments here and there about him being a dark horse MVP candidate, and while that‚Äôs an optimistic take IMO, his impact for this team cannot be understated. He keeps the offense afloat when the bench is in (bench mob has a lot of high energy guys but no real playmakers while Coby White is out), and he‚Äôs a real calming presence with the starters which really showed on nights like this. Every time the Clippers pushed to within 5 or so down the stretch, the Bulls answered. When we just needed a bucket, DeMar got one for us. The team was poised under pressure and pulled off a solid win on the road. This sort of thing never happened in the last few years. Usually, it‚Äôs just Zach playing hero ball (out of necessity), and when his shot wasn‚Äôt falling (as it wasn‚Äôt in the first half tonight) we‚Äôd fall apart. But with DeMar, Zach doesn‚Äôt need to force as much and can focus on hitting the big shots he‚Äôs now proving he can hit.   Then add in Lonzo looking like a bonafide sniper and Caruso locking down everyone. Plus high motor guys in Javonte Green and Ayo Dosunmu off the bench. This team is so much fun to watch.   I‚ÄôM HYPE, NEIL FUNK!"
"They both bring different things to the table.  Zach is the more talented scorer given his ability to score at all 3 levels. But due to his hand injury (and tunnel vision that pops up from time to time) his ball handling and passing is suspect when under pressure.  Demar is a more consistent, well polished scoring presence given his ability to calmly get to his spots and score and draw fouls. His superior playmaking ability also allows him to be played alone alongside the offensively challenged Bulls bench unit and get them going offensively.  Once Zach gets healthy and the Bulls get Coby White and Vooch back, Demar's offensive load will lighten up a bit."
Coby White is the answer and you will find that out soon
"With Lebron out right now, THT. But overall it‚Äôs tough because coby white hasn‚Äôt played all season. I‚Äôll wait until he gets a few games under his belt. But I like coby"
Holy shit let‚Äôs go.  Gonna grab him from the waiver wire.  THT or Derrick White or Coby White?
"No Vuc, no Pat Williams, no Coby White. Nice adjustments with the lineups to hold this team to 90."
Coby White I miss you
especially with the return of Coby White üòç  pumped
"The Clippers scare me. They're red hot and Reggie Jackson has been fantastic. It's also going to tough to pull it off without so many core players in Vuch, PWill and Coby White"
And Coby White.
That defense was crazy. That is the most frustrated I've seen Zach in like a year and a half. Your team is the only team that has thrown us completely off our game. Hopefully when Vooch and Coby White come back we will be much more competitive. We had an awful shooting night outside of Zach but alot of that had to do with the defense.
"I mean so far since we‚Äôve barely lost not really but I‚Äôm sure this game might start some talk of it   Vuc is a stretch big and Demar has been putting up a few per game, Lonzo is mostly a catch and shoot guy and LaVine obviously does his thing but off then bench we don‚Äôt have much shooting or scoring, which is why we‚Äôre looking forward to having Coby White back"
"It's been like that all season even with Vooch. He's had a rough start. Once Vooch gets his rhythm (he was starting to and then got covid) and Coby White returns, they should have a lot of options for scoring"
"Pat Williams, Coby White, DJJ, the Portland pick &amp; our 2027 1st."
"Yeah basically since the All Star break last year and the first week of free agency the new regime jettisoned everyone drafted by Gar Pax not named Coby White, and I get the impression if he was healthier during their fire sale he may have been included in a deal during that time period."
Coby White is coming back and see him thriving off the bench playing shooting guard instead of point.
"The Bulls really only have their most recent picks. Coby White from 2 years, Pat Williams and Marko Siminovic from last year, and Ayo Donsummu from this year's draft."
If we are counting 2019 klay out can include Coby white too then lol
Chicago. Pat Will n Coby White for Ben.
It's scary that we still have Coby White coming back from injury and we don't really have a place to put him.
So do we. Pat Williams and Coby White might not be Klay Thompson but that‚Äôs more defense and offense we have off the table. This while LaVine is playing with a torn thumb.   Fully healthy we‚Äôre probably not contenders but again don‚Äôt start crowning shit 12 games into the season.
"Its crazy cuz our defense is legit better than our offense rn. Once vuc gets it going even more, lavine gets fully healthy, and coby white comes back, our team will be unstoppable"
Who is homegrown on the bulls? Coby white?
"Coby is needed, he can create his own shot and help with our 3pt issues. There are still plenty of minutes to give white."
"if the only thing you're elite at is blocking you're not worth more than that IMO, a lot of the rest ain't great, be real.  especially on a team with elite team steals/blocks. And you wonder why you're not getting calls for 3 years my guy  you're overvaluing MT as much as bulls overvalue coby white fr"
The Coby White primary ball handler experience is not one I enjoy.  Though I will say this team has been playing smart and I've always thought Coby did not have that in his game. so this will be a good test.
"And what is he worth? More than Coby White + DJJ? Turner's issue is consistency, always has been. Hence why this is his third year being shopped to no avail. White is about our only worthy trade piece, and your backcourt is either unsuccessful or crowded depending on who you ask. And our concerns (as Bulls fans) is spacing with Vooch, a problem you guys have seemingly always faced with Sabonis. Makes it hard to give up anything more than what I said imo"
"Ayo is good but ideally not someone you want to rely on for offense. He‚Äôs a killer in transition, but will probably struggle in the half court and more so when teams start planning for him.  But Coby White can go nuclear when he gets rolling. Very inconsistent and one of the worst perimeter defenders in the league, but we need his ability to get point off the bench. If we had his production we could be undefeated. Our losses have been that close."
"I just don‚Äôt think Coby has ever proven himself to be that consistent himself. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs some tenured 6th man  If you need a scoring punch, you could probably acquire someone better than Coby White in that role"
Bulls fans saying they need Coby White when he just gonna take away minutes from this dude smh
Bulls won't even need Coby White much at all if Ayo Dosunmu keeps going off goddamn
I'm a Coby White fan after he dropped 35 on us just games before we entered this crazy Covid era.
Alec Jacoby ‚ÄúCoby‚Äù White  Obadiah ‚ÄúObi‚Äù Toppin
"Are you really gonna do the Great White Hope, Coby White like that? But yeah, once Harris comes back, the Sixers are a lock for home court if healthy."
Patrick Williams and Coby White but alrighty
Y‚Äôall should trade coby white and some other pieces for Simmons so he can start at center for you üíÄ
Well ur missing that Zach has a hurt finger and obviously steph curry no wait coby white Apperantly equals three starters and a dpoy guy. This my friend is called delusional
"Zach with hurt finger, coby white and low usage pat =\= Simmons, Tobi, green, thybulle, joe hurt knee, and Isiah. Sorry bud take the L move on"
"We're not fully healthy though. Zach is playing with injury, patrick williams and coby white are both out"
I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs at least as good as coby white right now!
"That 2019 draft, all indication pointed to the Bulls drafting Coby White at #7. I was dead set on wanting to trade back with Boston to grab their late lottery pick and one of their late 1st rounders and grab Poole as I thought he was just as good, if not better. Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to be right."
"Ya definitely agreed. Long term this team was built to be around Zach esp. with his ceiling/playoffs potential unknown I just mean right now (esp. w DeMar starting hot) I see them leaning more into DeMar being the main option given Zach's hand. Honestly I'm surprised he's still playing given how rough he looks out there. Clear he had to change his game n stuff but last night man was legit playing with one hand and rebounding a couple times solely with his right hand which I've never seen him do lol, guy looked so uncomfortable I feel it's just a matter of time before he sits out n gets the surgery.   Just a rough situation cause I know sitting out for any period of time is the last thing he wants to do rn finally having a decent team around him. Not to mention we'd be kinda dead in the water without him this month with Coby White still out &amp; the schedule as it is.   Hopefully the plan is just for him to make it thru this stretch &amp; he can get some rest when Coby's back to replace some of the production cause if not I feel it could get real ugly if he intends to play thru it all season."
"You don‚Äôt have to be a hall of famer to be a good point guard or a guard that compliments the future of your franchise.  Bledsoe was a really good point guard  averaging 18ppg and 6apg. His tpg was over 3, which isn‚Äôt really a great ratio, but he was able to take the heat of Booker on offense and defense and let him grow as a player.  Those below average rookies were brought in to compliment Lavine, not compete with him like KPJ is doing with Green right now. You forgot sotaransky with the bulls as well. The bulls kept trying to find a point guard who could fit with lavine. They didn‚Äôt just take a wait and see approach to it. Coby white was drafted 7th and they have already bailed on him after 1 season because they saw he didn‚Äôt fit with lavine.  The rockets should do the same thing and move on from KPJ at point guard and have a veteran point guard come in and run the offense to help Green succeed.  KPJ isn‚Äôt that promising of a prospect. His ceiling is JR Smith. Pretty good wing role player that was as dumb as a box of rocks."
"My man, Eric Bledsoe is not some amazing point guard. He's a great defender and is good at attacking the basket, but is a below average playmaker for his position which is what you seem most concerned with.  Also, Lavine has had a combination of Cam Payne, Kris Dunn, Coby White, and Ryan Arcidiacano as the PG during his time in Chicago. None of those guys are great (or even good) ""floor general"" point guards either.  Having those below average PGs did not hurt Lavine and Booker's early development. TBH, it doesn't seem like you know what you're talking about....  And Chicago and Phoenix resolved their PG situation later down the line after their first developmental options didn't work out. That's great. We can do the exact same thing if KPJ doesn't work out. Trying out the other options first though DID NOT hurt Booker and Lavine's development. Just like trying to develop KPJ will not hurt Green's development.  Bottom line is that it's too early to give up on a promising young player in KPJ. He is not going to hurt Green's development."
Oh yeah I forgot about Coby White. Excited to see what kind of leap he makes this year.
Meh. Coby White will bridge those gaps quick.
"Hey Philly we'll trade you 3 1st round picks, Coby White and Pat williams for Ben simmons. Who says no?"
Is Coby White still part of the Bulls organization? Where‚Äôd that dude go?
since we're on the turner train in the comments coby white + djj for turner
"yeah, that's why I don't get people who talk about trading Coby. the whole second unit is built around what he offers. Caruso, great defender, decent playmaker that let's coby play offball which is where he's strong. DJJ and Troy Brown Jr, both have great defense, not volume scorers. Tony Bradley, defensive minded. like you go through the bench and it just needs an offball volume scorer, oh wait that's Coby White!!"
remember with Coby White its DeWhiteBallZach
"Not a PF but if they just need a backup big to take up minutes and start in case of injury, Derrick Favors seems like a solid fit for them. Could salary match with DJJ and still keep Coby White to use in a potential separate trade or just to play him"
"Haliburton and Holmes stole the show for the Kings but Bagley also had a solid game, 21 points &amp; 12 rebounds to go along with 2 blocks and 2 steals. Career high for Coby White as well with 36 points, lots of young talent in this game!"
Coby white
Coby White is a fucking problem
"Seems like I'm just guilty as the people are now then, jacking up shots does not make you arrogant, I watched Coby White do it last year, not one suggestion he was arrogant."
"I think the biggest thing for the bulls is the backcourt dynamic between white and lavine. Both are more of scorers so it‚Äôs absolutely integral to our offense that one of them operates as more of a playmaker at any given time when both are on court. Tonight was an excellent example of how that can lead to success. Zach didn‚Äôt have it going and he was really looking to create for others. Coby started slow but once he heated up, you could tell that Zach was trying to get him shots. Now the goal for the coming games is that when Zach is inevitably hitting his shots, Coby takes that playmaking role so Zach can get more easy looks instead of having to create for himself. I think if we can consistently have that dynamic working, where those two are always playing to complement each other, then we can be a playoff team this year. Down the line I think a Coby/Lavine backcourt is going to look a lot like the backcourt we just beat in Portland. Two guys who can get a bucket at will, but who know how to work with each other to stagger their scoring/playmaking duties."
Coby white gunna be a star
I‚Äôm a huge fan of Coby White.
Why are they doing Coby White so dirty in his BBRef pic

That Coby White MIP bet looking real good right now
Only been casually following the NBA for the last few years. Whats the consensus on Coby White? He looks really good.
omg Coby White straight looks like discount Andrew Wiggins.
He deserved it over Terence Davis and Coby White imo that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.
Also Zach Lavine popping the fuck off. And Coby White scoring 21 in the second half

mavericks fouling there won me this week's fantasy. I needed 2 extra free throws from coby white to win 5-4 lmaooo
Coby white has been killing us too
Coby White looks real good
coby white in this quarter has been fucking torching us
Honestly they'd probably have a chance in the East; the Bulls have been missing a true lead guard and SGA would do wonders there. Thunder also flush out the depth chart.   PG: SGA / Satoransky / George Hill   SG: LaVine / Coby White / Dort   SF: Otto Porter Jr / Patrick Williams / Justin Jackson  PF: Lauri Markannen / Thad Young / Darius Bazley   C: Al Horford / WCJ / Muscala
"Coby White is way better than last season but still very limited.  Beverley even tho he's almost not a point guard offensively  Schroder is pretty limited  Bledsoe   &amp;#x200B;  Rozier and Sexton are more 2 guards nowadays, but if you want to count them as 1's they may be the 2 worst"
"The Bulls are in a bit of an identity crisis right now.  We have been playing better lately, but our January schedule is rough and I think it could lead to changes being made.  KC Johnson, our beat reporter wrote an article that LaVine might want out if we keep losing.  So to put it simply, I don't know.  We are in awkward spot right now, because we are not good enough to compete obviously, and we are not bad enough to give ourselves a good chance at landing a star.  LaVine also is not the best fit with Coby White either, so I think they may be inclined to trade him, to see what we have with White, because he is a guy that might sign elsewhere in 2022."
"Think it‚Äôs a combination of new coaching staff with little time to practice/prepare, partially turning Kris Dunn minutes (elite perimeter defender) into Coby White minutes (Trae Young level defender), and COVID season silliness. I think we‚Äôre going to see a lot of weird shit this season in general.  The Lauri at center experiment has also been pretty brutal defensively."
did I just overrate Coby White a lot? Bulls fans?

Zach LaVine has been great and probably should be an All-Star this year. I‚Äôm unconvinced on Coby White being our starting point guard though. He had a great game tonight and I‚Äôm tired of tanking but I‚Äôd loooove to see us get lucky with the lottery and draft Cade Cunningham. Also Patrick Williams is actually developing really well
"Why?  Bulls have a monstrous future with the shiny new FO, all new dev staff, Donovan, White/Williams, and hopefully another lotto pick this year.  LaVine is only 26, I‚Äôd wager he‚Äôs a part of their future.  He &amp; Coby just broke the record for the only starting backcourt teammates in NBA history with at least 8 made threes a piece"
Is coby white the greatest bull and guard of all time ?
Coby White.

Coby white with a nice -22

.....Coby White? Come on ...add him. He gonna be good.
Zach did not get touched on the last play.  Stop bitching about the refs. Coby White has been horrendous the entire season.  Worst player in the nBA bad.
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I just don‚Äôt see it with Coby White. One night he will look like the perfect duo to Zach then have games where he plays like 30 min and puts in like 2 buckets
"To use your own point, I wasn't aware that Zach was highly regarded as a defender or passer. Two areas that he's actually improved this year. I think a lot of people, Bulls fans especially, still have high expectations for Coby White based on where he was drafted last year and the promise he showed. He just hasn't gotten any better."
"Zach is ninth in the entire league in PPG and 3PG.  I think a better answer for overrated is Coby White. You're asking Zach Lavine to do things out of his position by asking him to be more of a playmaker (he's up almost a full assist on the season). Steph Curry only averages around 6 assists assists a year. Zach obviously isn't Steph, but that just gives you an example of playing to a player's strengths. Zach is not a great defender (although he's not awful at 1-on-1 defense), but I think Coby White has been an even worse defender.  Coby has got little t-rex arms, gets turned around a lot, and disappears/makes boneheaded plays. He also seems to struggle to run the offense (causing Zach to have to do more). I don't hate Coby White and he's young, but with the way he's playing right now, he doesn't look like an NBA starting level PG. Maybe a good 6th man type."
"This is dumb.  The rule is legal guarding position.  Get your torso in front of the dribbler and don‚Äôt move forward and it is legal, as it should be.  Using a shoulder to dislodge a dribbler?  One of the dumbest ideas I have heard.  If anything go back to calling travelling and carries so the defenders have a chance.   If Coby White, Luka, Trae Young or whoever are allowed to pick up the ball pause and eat a sandwich then crossover...that shit has to be called for defenders to be able to guard someone.   And then the 8 foot step backs, the fly unnaturally sideways in a pure foul bait move.....those are the issues with the game in 2021 and make it at times frustratingly unwatchable."
"Yeah the Vucevic trade baffled me. Patrick Williams is barely 20, Coby white needs time too, although with Lonzo I guess he'll probably be running the bench unit. Theis and Felicio hopefully aren't coming back, we'll see what happens to markkanen.  Bulls lack a real inside presence. Vucevic is definitely getting traded in a year or two, he's too old and expensive and doesn't play inside"
I watched every Bulls game this year. Coby literally improved every aspect of his game this year and you‚Äôre forgetting that it was only his sophomore year under a new coach. Apparently 15/5/4 on 40/35/90 splits makes Coby White a bum in his second year. You‚Äôll be crying and bitching when Coby gets traded and shines. You‚Äôre the one that needs a grip buddy.
Um  U can take Coby white too. Just double up on the busts
"With a bench of Caruso, Coby white, Ayo Dosunmu, and whatever they can get for Lauri"
"Again, our team this year was much worse defensively. So no it really doesn't matter if DeRozan is playing big minutes. Coby White is a worse defender then DeMar, we had Sato getting a lot of minutes.  Our perimeter defense is a million times better with Caruso/Lonzo alone, which is Vooch's biggest weakness when he has to get pulled to the perimeter. Vooch isn't as bad a defender as people think, he just has glaring weaknesses. This covers his.  We are already better."
"I can see the bulls flipping Lauri and Coby White for a big now too. Lotta guards on the roster   (Lonzo Ball, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, Devon Dotson)"
Nah Coby White was straight ass last year
"Too bad our bench is Coby White, Caruso, Denzel Valentine, and Troy Brown lol"
Spurs are dumb for not getting Coby White
"patrick williams, coby white, caruso, this a teaaaaam"
You're bumping Caruso for Coby White!?
Coby White get out of there
Bulls look good  Lonzo/Lavine/DeMar/Pat Will/Vuc  With a bench of  Coby White/Caruso/???/Thad Young/???  Add a wing and a big on the bench and they should be around the 4 seed in the East
They can actually get Derozan ans still have Patrick Williams and Coby white. Markanen and a 2022 1st should be enough to grab Derozan.   Lonzo- Derozan- Levine-Thad-Vucevic   Then if I‚Äôm them I trade Coby White and/or Patrick Williams for Christian Wood
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
"It might not be a championship roster right now, but Bulls still got some young players that still have huge develop potential in Lonzo and Pat Williams. Hell, Coby White still has time to show improvement. As Zach is starting to enter his prime years, Bulls have potential to be elite in 2-3 years."
Will you part with Coby White too?
"It would be. Whoever wrote this article doesn‚Äôt actually watch Bulls basketball. There were times last year where Coby was pushed back to 6th man. He played greater. He somewhat fits the Jamal Crawford mold. Great spark off the bench.   He can‚Äôt play the point because he‚Äôs not a true playmaker. That is why we brought in Lonzo. He is also a bad defender, as of right now, and that‚Äôs why we got Caruso. I think that Lonzo and Caruso will do wonders for his game. We now have Lonzo/Zach 1/2 and off the bench Caruso/White 1/2. Very underrated overall backcourt. Top 5-10."
Coby White is perfect for a 6th man/scorer off the bench type role. That‚Äôs what his role in the league should be so Idk why these signings mean he‚Äôs gotta go lol. All 4 of their guards are 6‚Äô4-6‚Äô6 so a 3 guard line up isn‚Äôt even small by today‚Äôs standards
"&gt; I don't see why a guard rotation of Lonzo, Lavine, Caruso and Coby can't work.  35 mpg for Lavine, 30 for Lonzo, ~20-25 for Caruso leaves... not a lot of play time for White, even it they're running 3 guard lineups"
"I just don't understand why the Pelicans wouldn't take him in the Lonzo deal? They got back Satoransky and a 2nd, surely they could've asked for Coby White considering other teams were in on the Lonzo S&amp;T... he'd space the floor for Zion and BI, I just don't get it"
How much help does Coby White need?
"If we could keep Coby I'd love that, personally I think he's got a role here as a Lou Williams type guy but the injury *might* have changed how the FO sees him. I think back to the White Sox trade for Craig Kimbrel. I thought Madrigal was untouchable but he is now with the Cubs, and as someone said, ""if Madrigal isn't injured he isn't involved in the trade,"" which has me preparing to see Coby's name in a tweet if we do get DeRozan. But again, would love to keep him"
What are the Bulls doing?? Do they not realize they have Coby White whom could very well be better than Both Lonzo and Caruso this upcoming season.
So what happens to Coby White?
Coby White gotta be pissed
Coby white bringing back wing stop
Coby white in shambles
"Naw he got paid. You should be happy for him. He done contributed well for no money.   Pest on defense, knockdown on catch and shoots, smart rotations and plays within himself.   Chicago got exactly the guard to pair with Coby White (volume scorer 2 guard) to run the bench so its smiles all round."
Coby White better get PT
"I personally understand letting Lonzo go considering it sounds like he did not want to stay in NOLA but I feel like they could have gotten more right? I was like 99% sure they'd at least get Coby White or Lauri Markkanen out of this but idk, maybe I am way off base here."
Coby White ass but we knew
So where does Coby White fit in all this?
So rip Coby White?
They have Coby White and just paid lonzo 85/4. Does this make sense...?
Where does Coby White fit in with this roster now
So what's the starting lineup next season?   Lonzo/Lavine/Williams/Markkanen/Vuƒçeviƒá? Or do you consider dropping Lauri for Coby White and sliding Williams to the PF?
"I like the fit with Lonzo and Levine.  Very complimentary pair in a starting backcourt.  Plus Vuc, and Patrick Williams devolping more should make them fairly competitive.  If Coby White can become a bit more consistent shooting wise off the bench, they could become a pretty good team.  I like it.  I'm a Bucks fan, but the NBA is better when the Bulls don't stink."
So Coby White can just get fucked then?
"Patrick Williams and‚Ä¶ Coby White!!! He knows not to foul the three point shooter, right? *Right?*"
How did Chicago get Lonzo without losing Coby White or Markennan? NOP front office not looking great rn
"Ugh. Lonzo/Lavine/Vooch isn't a bad team unfortunately. If the FO can round this squad out then they got a playoff team in the East. Lets see if they can do it. Coby White, Pat Williams, Thad Young, Theiss, and....?"
Coby White will feast
Haha. Last year his defense seemed to take a dive as time went on. Probably from pure exhaustion. Imagine having to help every time literally anyone with a basketball blew by Coby White.
"We're not yet sure if Lonzo Ball is getting moved - New Orleans would have to sign Kyle Lowry for them not to match it (especially if it's only a 4yr/80mil deal) or Lonzo would have to be overpayed. I guess the other option would be a double sign-and-trade as suggested by Hollinger but it's not super likely in my opinion.  The upcoming 2021-2022 season is the final year of LaVine's current contract (19.5mil per year). Ideally they'd have to get someone this year before the Bulls cap out with the upcoming maximum contract for LaVine (5yrs/195mil). This year's draft class is not super strong but Point Guard still remains a position of need for them. And maybe it's just me being high on Lonzo, but I'd really like him there. I do not think Coby White is the option for the starting spot."
"I don't think anyone is under the impression Lauri will be here next year.  The idea is LaVine, Vuc, Williams, hopefully Ball, and depending on this next season maybe Coby White."
If Coby White becomes available I want him
Would you trade Coby White in a deal that gets you Lonzo?   I could see the following trade as being a decent starting place:   Hornets Get:   -	Coby White -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo Ball  Pelicans Get:   -	Devonte Graham   Some smaller pieces might have to be added somewhere though. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind NAW going to the Hornets and other Bulls stuff going to the Pelicans. Maybe:   Hornets Get:   -	NAW -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo -	Jalen McDaniels  Pelicans Get:   -	Graham -	Tomas Satoranski  As a starting point.
"It‚Äôd have to be Coby White wouldn‚Äôt it?   I‚Äôd think about Coby White and Thad Young if I were the GM of the Hornets. That would be around the amount need to match salaries too. It‚Äôd give us another decent Center option and a cheap backup combo guard who can shoot.   I want to keep Graham, but I‚Äôm not sure if I want to pay a permanent backup starter level money. With all the teams looking for a starting PG, Devonte might get expensive quick."
"Not sure I get Chicago‚Äôs game plan if they extend him. Doing this would make it harder to get Lonzo, they‚Äôd have to renounce Lauri Markannan, and now they have money tied up in Vucivic. Is a long term core of Lavine, Vucivic, and Coby White enough to take them to the top? I don‚Äôt think so"
"The Bulls always had to hope that the Pelicans wouldn‚Äôt match an offer. The only way they weren‚Äôt going to do that is if the Bulls give something to the Pelicans or the Pelicans get Lowry.   Now that Lowry seems to be leaning Miami, the Bulls better figure out some kind of sign and trade. Would they be willing to move Coby White and/or one of their vets like Satoransky? I feel like they‚Äôd help the Pelicans a lot."
You don't realise how bad our PG struggles were last season.  Coby white couldn't make an entry pass into the post and Sato was way too inconsistent shooting wise   Having a good 3pt shooter with Zach and Vuc who can actually play some good on ball defence is exactly what we need
Yea y‚Äôall are screwed with Coby white being too much of a sg. I hope we match if it‚Äôs only 20 apy b/c I don‚Äôt want on the dinwiddie experiment
If Zach joins Coby White and the Bulls they might just break the league
What are they going to do with Coby White then?
The five oldest players in the NBA in Vince Carter's last season:  * Rick Mahorn * Herb Williams * Eddie Johnson * Danny Schayes * Dominique Wilkins  The five youngest players in the NBA in Vince Carter's final season (min. 20 games)  * Zion Williamson * Coby WHite * Kevin Porter Jr * Nassir Little * Jaxson Hayes
"Lol, it's so true.  However, I DO think Lauri would fit into a team with a great defensive center and a point guard to get him the ball (we have neither!)... but yeah Murray is on such a great contract, we would have to package Lauri with another solid asset like Coby White to make that work."
"Coby White temporarily changed his name to Kobe White twice against the Celtics this year. Beyond infuriating, but so was most of the Celtics season"
I hope Lonzo goes to Chicago. Been watching Bulls and Pelicans games alot this past year he would be such a good fit with Lavine  Also I don't like Coby White that much
or maybe they have a young developing point guard in Coby White
I still have hope for coby white! I also still had hope for Carter jr.
"Much better then whoever tf they have rn, Coby White?  Might be enough to make the playoffs, which is funny to say considering they have a 28ppg scorer in Lavine and a 20-10-4 shooting big in Vuc and still can't get there"
yep that being said coby white will win a mvp and bring a ring to bulls and some day he will be the best player to ever have put on a bulls jersey just wait
"If Patrick Williams and Coby White continue to develop well, Bulls could be pretty good then. Good mix of offense and defense between their core."
Dumb question but what‚Äôs the plan for Coby White?
White is more of an SG. The Pg experiment with him wasn‚Äôt a success. Arci is likely gone and is a 3rd stringer if that. Ayo can play either spot. And ideal rotation would be Lonzo/Zach then Rose/Coby and Ayo in spots.
"Coby White‚Äôs got game, but Rose‚Äôs experience &amp; leadership would instantly raise the Bulls ceiling. But somehow having Lavine, Lonzo, Rose, and White as a 4-man guard rotation would be an ideal yet difficult time-management. Though I have a feeling Rose‚Äôll take a vet min to pay in his hometown and help chase a chip, so that‚Äôd definitely help the Bulls keep that 4-headed monster at the guard positions."
"Coby is hurt to start the year. Ayo is a second rounder. Each one of Ayo, Ball, and White can slide over to the 2 when needed. Ball can even be a 3 at times. Arci is almost certainly gone. I don't think it would be an issue. Not sure what money ends up left for the rest of the roster though"
"I assure you, if you watched Coby White play you wouldn‚Äôt be asking this question. He does literally nothing well enough to the point of effecting the team‚Äôs roster building"
Imo the Coby white trial run has sorta ended if they get D Rose. He hasn‚Äôt lived up to even mediocre expectations and he‚Äôs gotten plenty of chances to at least show he can be a starter level player in the future but hasn‚Äôt shown that much promise
"It would probably be Thad. However, the Bulls might trade for even more players by sign and trade with Lauri, or by even trading Coby White."
Coby white
Who is Coby White? a nobody
"&gt;The Chamber can only be entered for two days (or two years) at a time, if anybody attempts to stay longer, they will not be able to exit, leaving them in nothingness and not allowing anyone else to use the door.  Sorry, fam.  Best I can do is Coby White."
"Ayo plays SG, Coby White plays PG. Even if they were the same position, why not take Ayo? Some people predicted him as a late first round pick"
I guess they gave up on Coby White?
"Bulls fans rooting for Ayo is like that one kid abandoning his old toy Coby White. They are both SO similar, why would we pick Ayo, other than he played at Illinois lol."
We don‚Äôt need another Coby White lol. I don‚Äôt think Bulls gonna draft him even if he falls to us
Coby White reaction: WOW. BRO WOW THATS CRAZY BRO. WOW.
"Congratulations, attractive Coby White"
"I heard Bulls are offering Coby White, Thad Young, a future first, and Benny the Bull. Presti wants you to throw in a pick."
Your team traded your 1st round pick this year on March 25th the Bulls went on to go 12-16 and completely miss the playoffs. Over that same time period the Wolves also went 12-15. Like why the fuck are you talking about the Wolves dude. At least the Wolves have drafted KAT and Ant over the last 6 drafts who is the best Bull to be drafted in the same time period? Bobby Portis? Coby White?     I guess yall did draft Jokic then traded him away for Doogie McBuckets.
Everyone thats saying its not possible or taht they would only have 4 players and minimus that not true tehy can do like some 3 team trade to send wizards coby white and tht and give the bulls schroder then for kings they an do kuzma and trezz and 22 which is not bad at all for kings bc hield doesn't fit and is overrated and its also not bad for wiz if they decide to rebuild if they don't the they won't do it
"You guys traded picks in a win now move, and the coby white at pg experiment was not the success it had to be. I feel like its absolutely imperative that you get a starting pg before lavine reaches unrestricted free agency. I dont think Chicago has any leverage with a free agent point guard. If you're Schroder, lonzo, Lowry, Dinwiddie you're starting at $20M/yr with multiple years."
Huh I thought you guys had Coby White who was playing well
"Even Coby White, Cam's college teammate, was shocked when they told him during his press conference right after he got picked"
"Players drafted after Culver that may be better than Culver :   Coby White, Hachimura, Cam Johnson, Cam Reddish, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, NAW, Okeke, Sekou, Goga, Bazley, Poole, Keldon Johnson, KPJ, Paschall, THT"
"Aminu, Thad young, Satoransky, Coby white, two top 4 protected firsts and we get some seconds back"
"People are downvoting you but act like we aren‚Äôt currently in the comments section on a post about the Lakers that was upvoted to the r/NBA front page lol, as if ESPN themselves decided to come here and delete every ‚Äòwhat do the Bulls do with Coby White‚Äô post"
"Bro.....my evidence is that it's a sport. Do you really need evidence that most fans would rather have their teams be good, making the playoffs and finals, adding star players? You're just playing dumb at this point although the ""playing"" part is debatable. I've already made my point about teams saying profitable too btw.  And nope, wrong again. we at least have some young prospects in Patrick Williams and Coby White that could be our future core while also having win now guys in Lavine, Vooch and it all depends on what happens next year in free agency. If it goes to shit and we tank, good! I'd rather have that than cling into a middling at best roster for years wasting people's time."
"There‚Äôs always an unlikely source.   Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon for Dame?  LeVert and Sabonis for Dame?  Lauri, Williams, Coby White for Dame?  This may start the framework of some deal, but there are teams and pieces out there."
NAW and Coby White do not have arguments for being better than Poole right now
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
"Chicago could trade for him. Patrick Williams, Coby White, Satoransky, Aminu, and 2 FRP works.  Not sure if it's a great idea, but Lavine, Beal, and Vucevic should theoretically give a good offense at the very least. Would be pretty thin roster wise, but would have Thaddeus Young, could re-sign Lauri, and work on bringing in some cheaper veterans to round out the roster."
"That‚Äôs a good top three, probably good enough for 50 wins if they stay healthy and the rest of the roster isnt a total mess.  Problem is the Bulls sent this year‚Äôs pick to Orlando and I‚Äôm not trying to trade Ben for Coby White, Wendell Carter and some picks in the 20s."
"I‚Äôm curious what happens with Chicago.  They only have three players under contract after this next season: Vucevic (22M), Patrick Williams (7.5M), Coby White (7.5M).  (Note: That might change if they resign Markannen or Thad this off-season) They can max Zach LaVine and still have money available, but they would essentially be paying more money for the same team they have now.   I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre not anywhere close to trading Zach, but if the beginning of the season goes badly, I think they would have to seriously consider where they are headed as a franchise and consider trading LaVine and Vucevic for all the assets they can get."
"Very interesting. I never considered Derozan's fit on the Bulls. I do think a starting trio featuring him, McConnell and Pat wouldn't be ideal for a team that will rely on offensive execution over sound defense.   Also in a hypothetical where you land TJ McConnell, is he good enough to send Coby White to the bench? I know a PG upgrade has been the focus, and McConnell is much more of a true point, but would that be enough of a replacement level player for his role? Im curious because theres going to be a few other tier B PGs on the market that could also fill that need if thats the case."
Need Coby White for AD swap
"They would still have Vucevic with Markanen, Lavine, and Coby White or their rookie from last year depending on who starts"
"Dame for Coby White, straight swap"
Coby white and a first for grant Williams who says no
"Coby white has a place and role on the roster, He brings something that Lonzo, Caruso don‚Äôt bring to the table at a level that he does"
Tbh Coby White is exactly what they need imo  A player who can score off ball off the bench
Coby White and a first is definitely an overpay for a role player lol
"If they can find expendable salary on top of Coby White, a 1st and a 2nd - Tobias Harris can be an option. Otherwise they should look for someone like Jae Crowder."
"A big part in that retooling was the changing of the FO. Karnisovas had no particular attachment to anyone from that roster. The only two players remaining from GarPax are Lavine and Coby White, the rest were traded, signed or picked by AKME."
"As a huge UNC fan that team was far from his fault lol. We lost Coby White, Luke Maye and Cam Johnson and didnt really replace them with any ball handling outside of Cole."
"I loved that Billy Donovan realized Javonte Green was struggling to defend the bigger forwards so he sat the rest of the game for a different lineup.  I like Green, but it wasn‚Äôt his matchup tonight and Billy made the right change to try something different. It will be so interesting when Coby White returns to see what lineups Billy runs with."
"Coby White was out for the Bulls, and we lost P-Will for the season during that game."
"I became a Bulls fan in the 2019-2020 season because Lavine was one of my favorite players to watch, and I was a big Coby White supporter during his UNC days. Watching them grow to what they are now (where is coby?) has been amazing. They're starting the season just like Phoenix last year."
And we‚Äôve got Coby White coming back soon
Been a while since those bench mob days. Just wait until we get Coby White back too
He‚Äôd be nice in Chicago. Maybe something built around Coby White?
"Agreed, and I might also put Ish Smith over Coby White depending on fit/experience needed."
I‚Äôd love Coby White if we didn‚Äôt have a million guards   But Yeah Warriors would have the best offer tbh. Wood would make them so much better
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Lonzo Ball, Demar, Vuc.  Get to keep pretty much our starting lineup while also being able to continue the hopefully future core of Lavine, Ball, White"
Hows coby white doing anyway
Ah the coby white syndrome
"He could be a nice pickup for the Bulls, they need a PF and Wood fits pretty nicely as a lob threat and floor spacer. Seems like his defense is inconsistent so maybe there's concerns about playing him and Vuc at the same time but the offensive upside is definitely attractive  Coby White + Troy Brown + a pick would probably be enough, idk if Bulls fans would want to give up Coby's bench scoring without getting back a similar player tho"
He stuffers from not playing with a true pg. it‚Äôs like the coby white saga all over again.
"I know that this is a controversial opinion thread, but I feel like the Bulls are the least likely of the unexpectedly good teams to be 'frauds'  They have Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozen, and Nikola Vucevic. Three full blown stars. DeRozen was never a 2nd option before, and he's a 2nd/3rd option on this team. Nik was never not the best best player on his team... until he came to the Bulls. Not only that, but they have some insane hustlers in Lonzo and Caruso. Not to mention, they don't even have Coby White back yet, who would boost their bench  Again, I know that this is a controversial opinion thread, but I just cannot see the Bulls being frauds."
"White is not a ball handler. He is a 6th Man of the Year type guy. Right now the team is staggering Lavine and Derozan. When White comes back it‚Äôs going to open up the floor even more. White‚Äôs scoring ability is what is going to help this team reach the next level. Right now Lavine is injured but if Coby was healthy, Zach would be able to rest."
"My main qualm with the ""last year's rating"" stat people keep dropping is that we have three people still on the roster from the start of last season. That argument has gotten even worse with the recent injuries. Lavine (liability on defense), Coby White (hasn't played this year yet), Patrick Williams (out for season).  We've upgraded at perimeter defense, but downgraded the interior. Its a whole new squad essentially."
Coby White. I like the kid but with Caruso coming off the bench there really aren‚Äôt any minutes for him.
So he gets the 9 minutes they gave Ayo. Ok. I doubt  it but you have irrational confidence Coby white will put up numbers in a smaller role than last season. We dogged you in Chicago. You made it respectable at the end and had a nice moral boost for the next game. That's all it's back to losing for y'all though you actually face other strong teams now.
"Randles played like trash what 5 out of 6 games this year üíÄ  Our team didn‚Äôt even have Coby white, who literally canned 7 threes on you because no one on your sorry ass team can guard him on the perimeter."
Where is Coby White?
"Based on the Utah game, those somebodies are Tony Bradley and Derrick Jones Jr.  Coby White still hasn‚Äôt played a game yet either."
"Lonzo has been a surprisingly great performer and an elite defender. He goes for steels every night and so does Caruso. I had mixed feelings with Lonzo at first because I liked Coby White lobs to LaVine but these Lonzo-Lavine lobs have been so amazing, also Caruso too...we have such a deep roster full of talent now that we might just take the East if we keep this up!"
DeMar plays a lot of time with the bench while Coby White deals with an injury. So he's on the court a lot without Zach.
"we've no experience in the playoffs outside of Deebo. So no, not without a lotta fuckin luck and perfect health from this moment on. Likewise, to be title contenders, we'd have to give up on pwill/coby white and maybe something else to get a 4 strong enough to contend with the Giannises of the world, which given our experience in the playoffs, I'm still not entirely sold is the right move.   no play-in, second round is where we stand respectably with not much homer bias imo."
"Zion, Kuzma, Chris Boucher, Coby White &amp; Mikal Bridges are +5000 each to win the 2022 MIP award."
"&gt;I also don't see how there would be no defense when you're adding Caruso.  That doesn't mean it wasn't parroted by every man and his dog all offseason.  LaVine and Vooch are both better on defense than the general public give them credit for. They were good on defense last season as a team, and they went out and signed multiple plus defenders. The narrative didn't make any sense from the start.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't think they're a contender yet either for what it's worth. Unless Coby White comes back and makes a leap or something."
"I‚Äôm excited for when Coby White comes back, he‚Äôll be an extra nightmare for other teams when he comes off the bench"
naybe like a chris boucher for coby white type deal
Coby White and Patrick Williams for Christian Wood
"DJJ‚Äôs contract, blazers 1st, Coby white are the assets they have.   Also If you can trade Otto Porter, Wendell cart jr and 2 first for an all star you do it, we saw what middle of the pack lottery picks have done for them up to this point"
Coby White for Chris Boucher send it in Masai
"Coby White still has value, even with this injury they could still trade Williams too, especially if they are trying to push for it this year, DJJ is decent salary filler for a trade."
I had hoped and prayed we would bring him home this year because he would fill a ton of needs we have off the bench. Him with coby white and Caruso would have been a sick ass bench. Still I am happy he is playing an extremely important role on the knicks and if NY some how made it to the finals I‚Äôd be rooting for Derrick to get his ring.
Hell of a game but holy hell we need Coby White back just to score.
White as in the bust Coby White?  LMAOOO
