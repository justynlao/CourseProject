Luka Dort &gt;  Luguentz Doncic
Luguentz Dort and it's not even close. If you pick Luka then you are a causal fan
Hell nah. Best case would be like luguentz dort or something. I'd eat a shoe if iman ever scored more than 15 a game without the injuries. His career ppg high is 9.5 and he had next to 0 offensive skill with a busted jumper.
"&gt; Wiggins’ on-ball defense has opponents shooting 40.0 percent, better than such respected defenders as Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort (43.3), Boston’s Jaylen Brown (43.5) and Toronto’s Pascal Siakam (44.0).  &gt; On shots from 15 feet or further, where many wings thrive, the failure rate against Wiggins is 67.4 percent, roughly the same as Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis (67.5) and better than Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard (61.4) and Portland’s 3-and-D wing Robert Covington (59.3). The failure rate against Mavericks forward Dorian Finney-Smith, considered a “defensive specialist,” is 63.9."

"As a wing defender I couldn't give you a definitive answer, although Ben Simmons is definitely up there. but on the topic of Lu Dort he seems like he could be comfortable switching to forwards. Luguentz is already elite at covering guards though. The guy looks like he was tailor made for stopping guards. He has good length and is built like a truck (The War Rig from Fury Road, that's the type of truck we're talking about) at 6'4. He fights through screens, doesn't gamble a lot on defense and takes no plays off (coaches must love to see that level of effort in the defensive end) Before seeing him play starter minutes last year I thought he would struggle against shiftier, quicker ball handlers but the guy has elite lateral movement even if he looks like a human fire hydrant. Or a tank. Or both. He does a great job against guards but I haven't seen him guard a lot of forwards, so I wouldn't be sure if he's great at it yet but he definitely has potential there.   So OKC, you have a great player with All Defensive Team chops."
"[Found this article from the Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1040676/2019/06/21/head-scratching-how-did-asus-luguentz-dort-go-undrafted-thursday-night/) (I'll quote some stuff since its paywalled).  Perimeter shooting.  &gt;Although Dort’s touch improved as last season unfolded, he shot just 30.7 percent from 3-point range. Among the eight guards taken in Thursday’s first round, none shot lower than 35.3.   Also, if you were wondering why he wasn't taken in the second round this article also explains that.  &gt;He said they turned down four teams wanting to draft Dort in the mid-to-late second round because they either wanted to draft and stash him overseas or draft him and send him directly to the developmental G League.  As painful as it was, they decided that going undrafted and signing a full two-way contract was the best option, especially considering Oklahoma City’s reputation for player development.   Pretty cool to be honest."

"So Jarrett Allen and Joe Ingles are #1&amp;2 in the league this year at about 70% &amp; this “objectively “ means they are more efficient scorers than let’s say  Lebron who is at #82 &amp; at 59.1%.  Or Blake Griffin who is ranked #188th &amp; at 49.1%. That’s objective in deciding who’s more efficient at scoring?   So if it’s “objective” then its the same measure as FT% where Chris Paul &amp; KAT are #1&amp;2 at 97.2% &amp; 94.6% The 82nd ranked player is Luguentz Dort at 74.7% How about even the 110th ranked since I can’t even look up the 188th quickly enough, Marvin Bagley at 54.5%. That’s the same equivalent?   Somehow we change a measure of efficiency by just adding up nonsense &amp; averaging out and giving it a lie for a name.  It’s not “true shooting” it’s FALSE shooting.   GTFO!! with what ever idiot taught people this trash.  People who watch and follow the game forever &amp; know what it’s about would never even look at TS% as a real stat.   It’s another nonsensical advanced statistic that doesn’t measure anything just some stupid number we can add to try to act like baseball advanced statistics."

That fucking step back with four mins to go in the fourth was insane. Really awesome to get to the line and go 3/3 at the end of regulation  Lebron so fucking good it’s crazy. Just an unimaginable passer and just tossed our guys around. Such a scary shooter  The refs called a lot of BULLSHIT on Luguentz Dort. Hate to see it   Forgot how quick Dennis hits the jets. He adds such a layer of dynamism to the Lakers on offense   Okc needs size so bad. Cannot stop Trez, he got what he wanted. Anytime Baze was on him he was toast    Good ass job Okc. Let’s keep competing"
Luguentz Dort is not someone I would want to be guarded by
Dort is his last name to be fair but Luguentz is even better lol

Luguentz Dort could do it
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State’s Andrew Wiggins, New York’s RJ Barrett, Memphis’ Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort, Houston’s Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans’ Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana’s Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  “There is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,” Canada senior men’s program general manager Rowan Barrett said. “Our players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.”     Let's go"
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"

"I saw this from his end of season presser  &gt; If healthy, Gilgeous-Alexander said he wants to play for Team Canada this summer in the Tokyo Olympics. Thunder teammate Luguentz Dort, from Montreal, is also expected to play.   &gt;But Canada has yet to secure a bid. It will compete in a qualifying tournament in late June for a final spot in the Olympics.   &gt;”Getting 100% healthy, first and foremost, before I do that,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “So it's not a no, it's not a yes. Me and my people still gotta figure out timelines for when I'm there, and then from there we'll figure it out.”   &gt;Daigneault said the organization will support Gilgeous-Alexander’s decision.   &gt;”He's going to prioritize getting healthy, so we're completely aligned on that,” Daigneault said. “Everybody is on board with that. Everyone knows that that's number one for every player, especially for him coming out of the season.   I guess I’m more of an optimist but I got it at 50/50"

"Yes by ""he"" he clearly means the same Luguentz Dort who the title of this post refers to. I am 99.9% sure that the interviewer is not also named ""Luguentz Dort""."
"&gt; Luguentz Dort actually reads us on Reddit  ?? He doesn't even acknowledge the reddit part, only the reporter brings it up"
"I can't believe hall of famers Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luguentz Dort all played together for one season :O"

"Due to the shortened offseason, teams can trade recently-acquired players just 19 days after acquiring them.   **I am aware that the following would never happen. I just got a kick out of thinking about it and wanted to share.**  Imagine if Brad Stevens decides to blow it up and does this in a few weeks:   Thunder get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Jayson Tatum  Celtics get:   * Kemba Walker  * Luguentz Dort  * Theo Maledon  * Aleksej Pokusevski  * 13 1sts (the max OKC can send at this point)   Celtics basically inherit the OKC rebuild, minus Shai. Meanwhile OKC now goes forward with Shai/Brown/Tatum/Bazley/Bradley. I'm sure they could improve with free agent signings or other trades, too."
"Ibaka is a waste of salary for this team. Give me Taj Gibson for the vet min $2.4MM.   I'm gonna get wild with it and move it and move Jamal Murray to the 2 and add De'Aron Fox as a second max player.   Replacing Anunoby with Crowder for the salary savings.  Also, using 2021 salary figures.  PG: De'Aron Fox ($28MM)  SG: Jamal Murray ($29.5MM)  SF: Luguentz Dort($1.8MM)  PF: Jae Crowder($9.7MM)  C: Clint Capela($17MM)  G3:TJ McConnell ($3.5MM)  G4: Alec Burks ($6MM)  Wing3: Dorian Finney-Smith ($4MM)  Wing4: Nic Batum ($2.6MM)  C2: Taj Gibson($2.4MM)"
"Cade, like every other person on the planet, has a significant crush on Luguentz Dort, sources say"
So…  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don’t grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don’t think they will?

"Reporter asks Luguentz about his phrase ""Dort man gets paid."" Luguentz responds: ""I used to say that back when I was in high school and college, wanting to get to this league. It's about working hard, outworking your opponent."""
"Yes, he literally did. His agent told 4 teams not to draft him.   https://theathletic.com/1040676/2019/06/21/head-scratching-how-did-asus-luguentz-dort-go-undrafted-thursday-night/?source=user-shared-article"
"I've got to disagree. People keep posting trade ideas and writing trade idea articles involving SGA as if the Thunder want to move him just so they can get more picks in the future as we hunt for a superstar.  I don't think they get just how good SGA is. He's not just a good looking young prospect anymore. He put up 24/5/6/1/1, with two fouls and three turnovers per game, shooting 51/42/81 from the field in 34 minutes. On a tanking team with the worst spacing in the league, creating practically all of his own shots for himself. With the next best offensive player on his team being Luguentz Dort, who while I love him is still an undrafted sophomore defensive specialist. That's wild."

He is the best offensive player ever and  he is at the complete mercy of Luguentz Dort.
He may be one of the best offensive players ever but you can’t outrun Luguentz Dort. He is inevitable

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"This sub loves piling on the Suns, but why is no one talking about the defending Retirement Home Champion Lakers being 6-5?  I didn’t realize until now that the Lakers are currently 6-5.. why is no-one talking about this?  They lost to a mediocre Suns team a couple weeks ago and lost after leading by like 30 pts to the Thunder with a struggling (checks roster) Luguentz Dort *twice*. And from what I know they’re just about fully healthy.  For anyone actively watching the Lakers this season, what’s the main reason for the early season struggles? You would think they’d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after signing a bunch of dudes way past their prime this off-season..."
