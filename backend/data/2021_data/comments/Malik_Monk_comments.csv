&gt; Reminds me of a Malik Monk out of college  eh...maybe malik monk without the shooting ability....which is really not a good player haha
"Did he try to work on it tho? Reminds me of a Malik Monk out of college, but fortunately for us Malik is a grinder despite all his faults."
"I think we need to see more from everyone before we know.   I think it‚Äôll be more of a question of Malik or Terry. Devonte‚Äô has better playmaking than both of them, all three of them are big threats from the outside, but Monk and Terry are much better finishers than Devonte‚Äô.   So yeah, if we want to cover as many areas as possible, it‚Äôs really between Malik and Terry. Hopefully te will want to stay and be a 6 man but maybe someone will pay him. Borrego really loves Devonte‚Äô."
"I've always been a fan.   And honestly, with a name like Malik Monk...he should be a superstar. That's a superstars name"
"I‚Äôve been preaching this for a while, tho I haven‚Äôt had any chances this season since HE LITERALLY HASNT PLAYED. But, *Malik Monk is going to be a star.* You may think that‚Äôs a hot take but it is not if you are as insightful as me. He will be a 23 PPG guy on good efficiency. This has been his guaranteed future since Kentucky. Fox was always going to be a little better, but Monk was also always going to be a star. Don‚Äôt underrate my man. This isn‚Äôt just a fluke performance when he got hot, this is his future. Give him his minutes!"
I really hope Malik has his breakout season this year. Fox and Monk were two of my favorite guys to watch in college

Malik Monk is a walking bucket. He needed to mature a little but his dnp-cd‚Äôs at the beginning of the season were frustrating to say the least. Give the man some run

Malik Monk!!! AYE! I'm so hyped for him. Here's hoping he builds confidence going forward.   In before he gets drug tested tho lol.
"Malik Monk more like Malik Devil, kill me."
"Malik Monk is such a man's man. You look at this guy, and at first you might not think he's much, but you have to take a second look to break it down and really appreciate this lad. Bulging chest muscles, hulking quads, the jaw of a Greek God. Everything about him is dripping in masculinity. Lesser people look at this man and say they don't know what the big deal is, but they wish they had half the juice that Monk has. There has never been a more gorgeous, freakish specimen that's made of 110% virility. God has blessed Monk, and through Monk, had blessed us."

"Malik Monk with ~~cocaine~~ ice in his veins, Jimmy Butler finally missing a game winner against us, Devonte/Gordon exposing Tyler Herro. Couldn't have asked for a better way to end a game against the Heat. WE STREAKING BABY!"
"That was this year's Malik Monk game, see you guys next year when he drops 50"
Letting Malik Monk handle and shoot the ball more has definitely helped over the last few games. Cody Zeller's return has also been huge.

Welcome to the Malik Monk show
Malik Monk has arrived.
What does Malik Monk usually look like? Cause this shit is ridiculous
Malik Monk taking more advantage of Melo starting than Melo is. Monk making a statement that he needs some minutes.
Malik Monk been balling
you act like Malik Monk isn't a 30-point scorer or something
Malik Monk has been unbelievable
I'm enjoying this shootout between Malik Monk and Max Strus.
Imagine playing the Martin twins over Malik Monk.
Malik Monk is on some sniper shit
"Pleasant: LaMelo Ball for sure. I was expecting a disaster of inefficient shot launching, being very ball dominant, lack of effort on defense, and LaVar Ball losing his mind that Melo wasn't starting over Graham/Rozier. I'm happy to admit I was wrong about *most* of that. Still a long way to go, but the tools are definitely there.  Unpleasant: Honestly... I'd have to reach to shit on any of our players aside from the Martin Twins, who basically are who we thought they were- fringe rotation guys who can sometimes give you a boost but sometimes be total shit. I'm most disappointed in James Borrego's unwillingness to stop playing so much damn zone, and that it took him almost 15 games to give Malik Monk the light of day. To nobody's surprise, Monk has been far better than a Martin could dream of being."
"The only thing that doesn‚Äôt make that draft pick more infuriating is that DSJ and Malik Monk didn‚Äôt pan out either. Bam and Mitchell were misses, but they weren‚Äôt really projected to go that early if I remember."
I don‚Äôt think Malik monk or devontae graham are so good that we shouldn‚Äôt think about different fits for the team. Undersized guards who don‚Äôt play defense well and are streaky shooters at best can‚Äôt be thought of as roster locks for the foreseeable future.
Oh yeah. Malik Monk finally cracked the rotation again so I‚Äôm waiting for his first Melo alley oop highlight.
They need to play him 30+ a game. Coach complains about his turnovers but without in game experience how tf u supposed to fix it. They already screwed Malik monk so just let melo go.
Hopefully Terry is okay and they can get a solid big like Drummond at the deadline (Malik Monk upping that trade value lately). I was high on them this off season so I hope they make the playoffs.
malik monk - Dalai Mamba
**WE NEED ANDRE DRUMMOND FOR MALIK MONK AND ZELLER**
"His midair footwork is one of a kind except Malik Monk does the same but it looks so sick. I think Donnie is the best in game dunker in the league and not because of the difficulty of his dunks, but his style."
"A trade I'd be a big fan of is:  **Cavs trade:** Andre Drummond.   **Hornets trade:** Miles Bridges, Malik Monk, Cody Zeller.   Monk is out of favour there, Bridges has lost his starting job to Hayward, and Zeller expires at the end of this season just like Drummond.   Cavs get another wing in Bridges and the chance to take a swing on Monk."
"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"
Malik Monk.  I still think he can be at least an 18 PPG scorer somewhere that gives him the opportunity.
"Malik Monk, though I‚Äôd rather the Hornets just give him PT"
Malik Monk
"""So based on the fact that only Malik Monk and James Young are really the only busts on this list the way Keldon Johnson, Tyrese Maxey and Immanuel Quickley are playing you pretty much have a 12/14 chance of drafting a high level rotation player or better you draft a Kentucky guard I have figured out.""   Yup. Thats how statistics work."
james young and malik monk
"Hornets fan here.  I'm still holding all of my Malik Monk stock. I made this point not too long ago in our sub but when he's actually played extended minutes he's been pretty good.  In his career so far, in games he's played 20 or more minutes he averages 14 PPG on decent 44/36 splits. Only problem is he's only played 20+ minutes in only about 40% of the total games in his career. When you increase the minutes to 25 or more his averages go up to about 18 PPG on slightly better splits than that. When he's been on the court for extended time he's been pretty serviceable, he's just been on an EXTREMELY short leash here for some reason.  Long story short, when Malik (hopefully) finds a new team that will give him 25+ MPG I predict a MIP caliber season."
Prolly Malik monk too
\#FREE MALIK MONK
"Malik Monk, I was ridiculously high on him when he got drafted"
"Because he still has the potential to be a good scorer and above average defender. I also really do think he‚Äôll start to shine alongside a great playmaker like LaMelo, and could be a great value contract near the end of his next contract if we buy low after this year.   What I‚Äôd really love to see is (assuming Malik approaches his scoring and defending potential) a Rozier/Monk/LaMelo/Bridges/Washington lineup with Graham handling playmaking duties for the bench unit. Or even a LaMelo/Rozier/Bridges/Washington/(any center but Biyombo) lineup with Graham and Monk respectively giving us playmaking and scoring off the bench.   There‚Äôs obviously a reason he‚Äôs only started 1 game in 3 years, and I think it‚Äôs mostly maturity. Monk is a flawed character, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but sometimes you have to take those gambles as a small market team that‚Äôs not immediately on the top of any big name FAs list. It‚Äôs a similar reason we overpaid Rozier and Hayward"
I have to apologize to the Hornets community. Last year I was spewing nonsense that Malik Monk is the best dunker on the team. It's Miles.
"Willie Cauley-Stein, Malik Monk, Immanuel Quickley, Jarred Vanderbilt..."
Malik Monk is hella talented.
"As a Hornets fan, I‚Äôd love to do Cody Zeller for Drummond. Would the Cavs be interested in Cody and Malik Monk?"
"People that say that fall mostly into two camps: (1) people who are pissed LaMelo is not stating yet and (2) people who are pissed Malik Monk isn‚Äôt getting any run.  I do think JB uses the Martin twins far too much given their current abilities, but he is nowhere near as bad as people make out."
"And we did it despite not having our 2 franchise cornerstones and future max-contract guys in Cody Zeller and Malik Monk. LaMelo who? Kid will never play big minutes once Malik is unleashed.  And Cody is the OG ‚ÄòBig Handsome‚Äô, not Gordon Wayward"
"Wait, what happened with Malik Monk?"

Malik Monk cuts the lead to 26 with a buzzer beater!

"My MIP pick for the season isn't even getting PT... I just knew Malik Monk would thrive next to Lamelo, but the pick isn't looking too good rn lol"
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
Maybe too early but I was clowning teams who passed on Malik Monk
Malik monk would‚Äôve caught that pass by LaMelo
A day doesn‚Äôt go by where i don‚Äôt cry at the fact that the Martin twins are getting played more than Malik Monk üòî

I'll admit I don't watch Hornets games but isn't Malik Monk trash?
Malik Monk and Dennis Smith Jr. I was so pissed when the Bulls took Markkanen instead of one of those guys in the draft.
"Before the draft I had my own little board and I had prichard 14, flynn 16, and maxey 29. Now that I've seen maxey play, I can honestly say I would've had him higher if I knew what I know now. I'm not sure though. I think prichard is the best player right now, maxey has the most potential, and malachi is probably better than maxey but doesn't have the upside. Maybe I'm biased but after seeing maxey play I think he'll end up the best player. He's insanely talented on ball, like I thought he was gonna be more malik monk with daron foxes jumper but he's way further along as a lead guard/playmaker than I thought. I wouldn't trade maxey for those guys. For what it's worth maxey kinda showed up prichard in preseason."
"Kings Reset Moves.   Buddy Hield to the Knicks for Knox, Ntilikina and Dallas's 2021 1st Round Pick.  Harrison Barnes &amp; Whiteside  to the Celtics for 20211st Round Pick (Use Trade Exception)  Nemaja Bjelica &amp; Two 2021 2nd Rounders to Philedelphia for Matisse Thybulle  Marvin Bagley to Charlotte for Malik Monk and a Future First"
Would kings fans entertain Malik monk for bagley? He was foxes teammate at Kentucky and has been underused by the hornets. I still have hope for Malik but our coaches really didn‚Äôt give him a fair shot at all his first two years. Bagley also fills a need at center although he might not be that good rn there‚Äôs still some potential
The sixers were playing against Malik monk tonight
"UK guards drafted since 2010:  2010: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  2011: Brandon Knight, Josh Harrellson, Deandre Liggins  2012: Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb  2013: Archie Goodwin  2015: Devin Booker, Andrew Harrison  2016: Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis  2017: De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk  2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Hamidou Diallo  2019: Tyler Herro  2020: Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley"
"It's not even been 10 games yet, a guy like graham has earned the right to work his way through wobbly form, considering last season.  It's also malik monk we are talking about, totally possible he's on some fuckshit in practice or equally ‚ùÑÔ∏è.  Borrego knows what he's doing."
Borrego wouldn‚Äôt play the Martin twins over Malik monk then
"Sure. But can someone please ask Mitch Kupchak and JB what the hell are they trying to do with Malik Monk?? Contract year, already free from COVID, Graham playing shit - and he still can‚Äôt get ANY playing time damn"
malik monk will break out with an increased role
"Malik Monk has been doing really well lately.  Though, I'm not sure how udner the radar he is considering how hot/popular the Hornets are and have been.  He's been great from 3."
Imagine if Kyrie gets paired up against Malik monk and has a bad day? They're all pros and a superstar could have a bad day and get smoked.
"I believe the Vuc rumor, not the Fournier rumor. I'm not sure what purpose Fournier serves when you already have Terry Rozier, Devonte' Graham, Malik Monk with that same kind of skillset. We need a center and a bigger defensive wing.  Also, as bad as it sounds, we are like 0 for 3 on acquiring French veterans in their primes. It never works out for us lol. 0-4 if you include drafting Alexis Ajinca in the first round in 08."
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn‚Äôt have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year‚Äôs. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte‚Äô Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We‚Äôve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he‚Äôs definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he‚Äôs still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We‚Äôre still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we‚Äôre young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we‚Äôve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
Malik Monk is wet?
Stark difference in the Hornets offense when they give Lamelo the ball vs when Malik Monk starts the possession.
"Bro Malik Beasley is currently suspended by the league lol, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd invite them to a marquee event such as the 3pt contest, but maybe the other Malik, Malik Monk from Charlotte has been shooting lights out lately from deep"
"People calling him a bust last season didn't know what they were talking about. His first two years were rough, being a young raw prospect that got stashed under MCW with Clifford and had his role jerked around a bit in Borrego's first year as we tried to make the playoffs in Kemba's contract year.   Dude had a pretty good all around season last year after bulking up a lot and making enormous strides as a finisher, becoming a competent defender, and an improved ball handler and passer. But his shot got super flat and he bricked all his 3s. Aside from that he had a really solid season last year. It was pretty clear to me (and others on the Hornets sub) that he'd have a big season if he got his shooting touch back, and this year he has after recovering from COVID.  Is he going to be Donovan Mitchell? No, but that doesn't make him a bust. Even last seasons version of Monk wouldn't be considered a bust, because you expect a quality rotation/6th man level guy from the 11th pick and that's what we had from a 21 year old Malik Monk. He's taking that next step now."
MALIK MONK
"The NBA is a star driven league and to be blunt people do not care about seeing Malik Monk or Terrence Furgeson dunk.  If it was Monk who dunked from the free throw line instead of Jordan, do you think itd be the iconic moment it is today? People care because it used to be a showcase of the most athletic stars in the game, and it was both captivating to watch and marketable because of it"
I‚Äôd rather watch guys like this who have crazy athleticism but don‚Äôt get the moment to let it shine.  Guys like Terrence Furguson &amp; Malik Monk too.
#GET TERRENCE FURGUSON AND MALIK MONK IN THERE PLEASE.
"People seem to think you're only allowed to have two good guards on the roster and that we'd willingly let Devonte' Graham or Malik Monk walk away in RFA.   It's good to have depth, Devonte' has already said he's cool coming off the bench behind LaMelo and Terry, Monk has been excelling as a scoring spark plug, and some of our best offense comes when two of Graham/Monk/Terry are out there with LaMelo."
Rozier is good but the Hornets can fill in his spot with a guy like Malik Monk. Lonzo‚Äôs defense is heaps ahead of Rozier. Both are 40% spot up three point shooters. I would take Lonzo if I were the hornets.
Who is starting over Lonzo? I can‚Äôt think of a franchise that would take Devontae Graham or Malik Monk over Lonzo Ball right now
I was dunked on by Malik monk before he went to Kentucky. Have always been a fan since then
I‚Äôm indifferent but they‚Äôve praised Hornets plenty. Great passing. LaMelo being dope. Don‚Äôt leave Malik monk. Bridges and LaMelo are a highlight reel. That‚Äôs just in the past couple minutes
Malik Monk aka JR Smith the 2nd
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There‚Äôs also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"Malik monk for the win, as expected"
You have Terry Roizer and Malik Monk  on your team my friend.
"It‚Äôs not even a rule change, that was just a ref intentionally being awful. Suspension or some accountability needs to happen, not only for this particular call but for the countless other awful ones throughout the game.   Malik Monk got called for a T after a dunk when he let out a normal hype yell in celebration. Booker got called for a T for a little bit of jawing toward the hornets bench after a fast break dunk. There was a no call when Frank kaminsky slashed Rozier across his cheek on a 3 point attempt and a no call on a LaMelo 3 attempt when two defenders clearly fouled him.  Just atrocious."

doing tricks in an alley poor if we're talking malik monk and klay
"James borrego is far from perfect tho, we gave the jazz their 3 pt record twice within 3 weeks giving them 26 threes the first time and 28 the second time and we have given up over 20 threes in a game like 5 or 6 times this season. He refuses to adjust and its kinda infuriating. It also took him like 17 games to finally play malik monk who is killing it right now. While he is doing better after fixing a few of the problems, undermining brad and saying borrego is a real head coach is a stretch,"
"Eh, Malik monk got a tech for screaming into the air after a dunk"
Terry gets hit in the eye and no call. Melo get tackled at the end of the 1st half and no call. Malik Monk gets a T for yelling at nobody. The charge that Zeller clearly took on Booker that was reversed. The offensive foul on Booker that wasn‚Äôt reversed when the Hornets challenged.
"What about Wiseman and Wiggins for Hayward, and Miles Bridges/PJ Washington/Malik Monk?"
Malik Monk?
"Because he's one of the worst defender in the league and he's not as good as Steph/Lillard/Harden on offense  He's ranked as bottom 10 defender in 5 year DRAPM (out of 900+ players)  only guys worse than him are players like Jamal Crawford, Trae Young, Isaiah Thomas or Malik Monk"
Malik Monk is a scary microwave
Dr. Malik Monk... o shit doesn't work
Why isn‚Äôt LaMelo handling the ball every time he‚Äôs in? I‚Äôve seen Malik Monk bring the ball up as often as LaMelo
"We‚Äôre asking the same question   Since Malik Monk, Amir Coffey and some guy named Daquan Jeffries popped off against us"
Did i just saw malik monk?
malik monk
"Counter-point: Malik Monk for Bamba, straight-up. Monk's contract is up and Borrego's never been a fan of him even with the improved performance. Even if Mo doesn't break out, it's not a huge gamble for us."
"Zion, Probably Ben Simmons if he doesn't get hurt.  Plus there are also college teams that had multiple players that were atleast very solid contributors in the NBA. The 2017 Kentucky Wildcats had Bam, De'aron Fox, Malik Monk, and a few other guys that have bounced around in the G-league. You really think they'd lose to the worst team in the G-league?"
I'm glad I never left Malik Monk island. We're still here!
I thought Malik Monk was gna be one of the best players in his class but he barely got playtime his rookie year etc. but things are looking better now i guess.
Fuckin Malik Monk. Dude's a pest all game
That's Malik Monk
"Hornets 8:  LaMelo, PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, Gordon Hayward, Malik Monk, Devonte Graham, Rozier, Zeller"
Honestly either LaMelo or Malik Monk
Max Strus vs Malik Monk. Maybe if Spo believed his power enough Heat would have won
"Lamelo is best served by reliable shooters. Terry rozier and Malik monk are both better shooters than lonzo ball this season. Plus, if we're gonna trade for someone, the position we least need to trade for is a point guard.   Maybe we can sign lonzo in 5-7 years in order to make lamelo happy and keep him in Charlotte if he becomes an MVP caliber player. But for now, let's worry about winning."
Nah. MJ/Mitch Kupchak(GM) had the bases loaded and needed a clean up hitter.   &amp;nbsp;  Draft Sleepers &amp;nbsp;  Malik Monk 2017  Miles Bridges 2018 traded draft day  Cody Zeller(Questionable addition) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Expensive Mercenaries(Surprisingly from the Celtics) &amp;nbsp;  Terry Rozier  Gordon Hayward
"2017 draft on the other was pretty bad tho lol Lonzo, Fultz, Josh Jackson, Ntilikina, DSJ, Zach Collins, Malik Monk, Luke Kennard, all didn't pan out. Imagine if I told you that that you your team has a 57% chance at drafting a disappointment"
"Dawg he‚Äôs played like 10 NBA games. Do you seriously not see how disrespectful it is to put him above Tatum  and Donovan, two guys who‚Äôve been LEADING franchises too the playoffs since they where rookies. Tatum went head to head with Lebron in the ECF as a rookie.   Lamelo is the third leading scorer on a mediocre team that has no superstars, and no other player who‚Äôs going to even make an all star game anytime soon.... and both Malik Monk and Devonte Graham are only a single 3 pointer per game away from averaging more than Melo as well.   Melo - 15.9 ppg - 5.9 reb - 6.1 ast - 1.6 stl   Graham - 13.9 ppg - 2.8 reb - 5.1 ast - 1.1 stl   Graham isn‚Äôt even on the list and his numbers aren‚Äôt far off from Melo‚Äôs.   Putting Melo ahead of Mitch, Tatum, Simmons, Booker, Bam, Murray just feels wrong to me"
Malik fucking Monk cost Miami Aldridge. Change my mind
Malik Monk
"Not two players, but MJ smacked the f out of Malik Monk when he was chewing him out on the bench"
Malik Monk
Forgot Malik Monk

Hope Malik monk is ok prayers up that looked bad
Malik Monk
"This year is showing how poorly we handled Malik Monk those first three years.  I think the only changes that anyone makes here are based on team needs (Maybe Bam over Mitchell, or Fox over Bam).. or Monk over DSJr and Collins."
"If this org was smart we would trade Terry this offseason at his peak value, re-up on the younger Monk for a longer duration of time and have him be our SG next to Ball for the next couple of seasons   I would much rather have Malik at 4 years for whatever 12-16m he's gonna ask for than letting him walk and re-upping on Terry in 2022 for another inflated contract in the 20-25m range   Terry is not irreplaceable. Malik can do a lot of the things Terry does but also does things that Terry can't (ie defense and playmaking potential)"
"We always shut down RJ, but get constantly lit up Malik Monk. Makes sense"
I 100% think Malik Monk should be above people like Luke Kennard.      Monk has proven this year he can be a big time shooter and creator.
If we just had Malik Monk we probably win
"There‚Äôs a number of moves we can make. Lonzo is a nice one but so is Devonte Graham who is balling right now and is criminally underpaid. Also Malik Monk I believe will be a FA too. There‚Äôs also lots of veteran guards that we can go after if we wanna do a Chris Paul/Suns type move, like Lowry. There‚Äôs a lot of flexibility for us and we can probably outbid most teams. Really like our position so far."
Malik monk hates you guys
We got cockblocked by Malik Monk you hate to see it
"No wait, this may explain why Malik Monk fucked me out of a $500 parlay last night. He got his powers from those alien fucks."
"He literally gave Fultz the starting job over DJ after like 10 games I believe. That ""he doesn't play young guys"" stuff is literally Hornets propaganda to explain why Malik Monk wasn't a superstar in his rookie season."
"They also have PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, Terry Rozier, and Malik Monk. Not saying they have a better future, I‚Äôm just saying they‚Äôre the only team you guys have competition with for that title"
Yeah leave the Heat outta this. Let the Sixers and Bucks fans worry about the Nets while we worry about Malik Monk shooting lights out against us.
"LOL, they saw Malik monk fuck em up and he was like oh hell nah"
Mike has been good recently to be FAIR  Rozier + Hayward + LaMelo all paying off  Malik Monk + PJ + Devonte too  We don't talk about Batum or that absolute bum Biyombo
"This is my exact trade. They‚Äôre both expiring and I don‚Äôt know if we can extend both Graham and Monk. Since I‚Äôd rather have Malik, I think you offer this deal...you probably offer either to Indy though. Zeller + 1st + choice of Monk/Graham."
"He is, but he‚Äôs also gonna hit fa next yr and he might get a bit overpaid like 25m. Also terry is probably our most tradeable asset rn cause he‚Äôs over performing and we can actually use his contract to match salaries. Malik monk has also shown he can basically fill terry‚Äôs role in increased minutes."
Malik is eating a 12 game suspension though lmao. Something like 5 games KAT and DLO has played together since Dlo got traded to the wolves. Shit is actually bananas. Hornets have 3 of the top 5 players between these two rosters imo. Hornets are kind of a sneaky deep and versatile roster.   Terry-Lamelo-Monk-Grahm are all starter or borderline starter quality players. Hayward is awesome. PJ Washington and Miles Bridges are awesome. And regardless of how much shit Biyombo gets he is a servicable big.
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
Malik Monk. I was so glad we got him instead of Donovan Mitchell because all my friends really liked Donovan Mitchell but I thought Malik would be better. Smh
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"Helps that Hornets games have just been super fun overall. Malik Monk, Terry Rozier, and Devonte Graham can all light it up on any given night. The whole team tries insane passes every night as well, even when they maybe shouldn‚Äôt."
"Baby discount warriors vibes  Rozier = Monta ellis  Lamelo = curry  Malik monk = no defense discount klay  Pj Washington = dray  Cody zeller = white center (David Lee, zaza, bogut)"
I just remember that time he smacked Malik Monk
The one that stands out to me was the guessing the players first names segment. People really think he doesn‚Äôt know Mitch Robinsons first name? Or Malik Monk?
"[Pretty sure he wanted #1, even Zo tried to get him that number](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2919068-lonzo-ball-campaigns-for-malik-monk-to-give-lamelo-ball-no-1-hornets-jersey)  This story of a promise looks legit. I wonder why the Dubs reneged. Maybe they really thought Wiseman would end up being a bonafide stud"
"Aww. Analytics guy can‚Äôt figure out why the numbers  don‚Äôt give him an answer lol    I kid, but it‚Äôs simple he‚Äôs undersized. Not only in height but he‚Äôs rail thin. So he can‚Äôt finish. You can have all the hops in the world but even in today‚Äôs modern game that‚Äôs smaller you‚Äôre not gonna just get to the cup uncontested.  Then you factor in mid range: 1) not all players have this skill set. Not everyone can shoot a floater, for example. Some of these young kids grew up never taking m mid range shots, 2) Basically role players aren‚Äôt even allowed to take mid range shots anyway. So the end result is why 5 of his 7 shots per game are threes.   Plus, he isn‚Äôt a playmaker at all , and I‚Äôd imagine he can‚Äôt defend bc of his size, so not much reason for him to be on the court  other than a catch and shoot guy.   If he gets stronger his best case is Lou Williams, or perhaps more reasonable, Malik Monk."
Ill give ya malik monk and a second üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"terrence ross, garrison mathews, malik monk"
Yeah I think Heat fans tend to get overboard with the RSHK thing but Malik Monk actually owns our franchise
"**Skill Boost**: Miles Bridges. Bridges has developed a really good jumpshot and really good defense. If he had a better handle he‚Äôd probably be a perennial All-Star.   **Athleticism Boost**: LaMelo Ball. He‚Äôs not bad athletically, but a more athletic LaMelo would be pretty similar to LeBron...  **Length Boost**: PJ Washington. He‚Äôs been our best defensive center this season, but is a little small to play the position full time. If he added a few inches in height he‚Äôd be able to play the position full time and would fix our biggest weakness.   **Other Contenders:** A 6‚Äô4‚Äù-5‚Äù Terry Rozier would be a beast. A 6‚Äô7‚Äù Malik Monk has a lot of potential. An athletic Vernon Carey Jr would be a really good rookie. If the 6‚Äô10‚Äù McDaniels had a really good handle and playmaking he‚Äôd be super interesting, especially since he‚Äôs already a good shooter."
You clearly haven‚Äôt reached the videos of Malik Monk and Miles Bridges dunking yet
Malik Monk
Malik Monk too but we took care of that last game
Malik Monk sold. He has 0 chemistry with Lamelo.
More like Malik monk did.
Malik monk is such a ball stopping issue for this team. Has 0 chemistry with Lamelo
"&gt;LaMelo is a driving force and the best playmaker on a team going to the playoffs  So Graham,Rozier,Hayward,Miles Bridges,PJ and Malik Monk had nothing to do with your success this year it was all LaMelo?   &gt;Edwards is an inefficient chucker on a terrible team.  I mean check the stats in the past 2 months and you get a different picture."
"&gt;Devil's advocate; first half of the season also counts (Melo was a lot better pre-All-Star break), and Melo has helped a team that wasn't meant to sniff the playoffs reach that level;   This is the narrative from when he was drafted. Since then they signed Hayward. LaMelo helped a lot sure but a career year from Terry Rozier and the arrival of Hayward were bigger factors not to mention improvements from Malik Monk and Miles Bridges."
So you're telling me Malik Monk lifts weights
"i just got woke up from my best dream in weeks where we defeated malik monk, don't think i'm ready for this shit yet"
WE BEAT MALIK MONK! Hallelujah
Oh boy can‚Äôt wait for Malik Monk to have 50 tonight
"The real question is what Malik Monk is doing, probably letting his nuts hang tbh"
Malik Monk  Monte Morris  Marcus Morris  Markieff Morris  Mike Muscala
A little disrespect to peak Malik Monk if we‚Äôre being honest here
They don‚Äôt even have Malik Monk who literally turns into prime Kobe when he plays us
"monta averaged 22+ ppg for 5 years in gs and was a top ten scorer across the league for like 3 of them while never making an all star team. it's tough to come up with a guy like that rn but i think CJ is probably the closest thing. Having said that, i think malik monk and dion waiters could be that guy too in the right environment."
"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
Malik Monk with a 20 inch vert
I disagree Stephen Curry is a glorified Malik Monk and deserves the hate IMO
"He's kind of plays like a taller, less skilled Malik Monk (before his 3 point shot), but he's got real athletic potential and is a really hard worker. Also by all reports a great locker room guy. I'm rooting for him."
Anything but Malik Monk
Malik Monk
"1 and 2 are huge mistakes. 3 is over-blown. He had a better deal but it fell through, not his fault IIRC. 4, Drafted Chriss and traded for Papagiannis and Bogdanovic. Out of the next 5 picks after Chriss only Sabonis is better than Bogdanovic. Donovan and Bam were the last 2 picks in the lottery, it wasn't the obvious choice like Luka. The Kings were more likely to drafty Malik Monk or Luke Kennard. Yes, Vlade is a bad GM because he did not predict Devin Booker would turn into an all-star. Do you think the 14 teams that passed on Giannis were idiots also?"
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
People on our sub think Malik Monk will be a top fifteen player in the nba.
I remember someone said that Malik Monk came from the ‚Äústreets‚Äù and just from knowing his life story he‚Äôs from middle of nowhere Arkansas lol.
Malik Monk
"Not really IMO. Like a Malik Monk, TJ Warren, Spinder Dinwiddie level player. Just someone who can initiate offense, and create their own shot. Also could prolly use a Jae Crowder lol."
"Not really IMO. Like a Malik Monk, TJ Warren, Spinder Dinwiddie level player. Just someone who can initiate offense, and create their own shot. Also could prolly use a Jae Crowder lol."
Charlotte drafted Malik Monk two picks before Donovan Mitchell.
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"Right now, it's Malik Monk"
"To be honest if I remember that draft correctly, Malik Monk was the guy I thought most of at that point in the draft"
Thats just so false.  MPJ talent is hard to deny.  It's not like Malik Monk who is a 9th man on most teams if we are being generous.
"He‚Äôs a tough guy to trade since he‚Äôs not consistent. He‚Äôs shown flashes but he doesn‚Äôt really have player identity. There‚Äôs a small market for him since he‚Äôs still young and other lakers have thrived on new teams. I could see kuzma for Malik monk, josh Jackson, reddish."
"Nobody that plays for the Lakers is under the radar lol  If Malik Monk played for the Lakers you'd see people talking about him as a 15-20M guy, rather than the 9-12 he will probably get and deserve."
Watch out for Malik Monk!
why is there always a random scrub that absolutely COOKS the heat. Malik Monk now Bryn Forbes wtf is this
the great part is it's basically all Miles Bridges with Malik Monk and Terry Rozier scattered in there.   PJ and Zeller can get mean occasionally but neither gets a lot of air.
"Caruso is a legit defender. Waaay under selling him. Zeller is garbage, always will be. And how do we have plenty of scoring? Who we talking about Malik Monk or something? Cause I count Hayward as the only above average scorer on the team. Bridges got better as season went but rozier, ghram, PJ, Lamelo just ain't getting it done scoring wise. We don't have plenty of scoring like it's freaking abundant"
he falls behind Malik Monk in the all-time rankings
"Don't expansion teams automatically get the top pick in the draft? Like Seattle gets #1, Vegas gets #2, then Vegas picks first from the player pool?   If you're Seattle and you go in knowing you have Cade, that changes things dramatically. I also think you focus on free agency (you have crazy money to work with, starting from scratch) and use the expansion draft to round it out.   I'd get Cade, then pursue solid guys in free agency who I know are probably going to go for the bag, or young guys you could overpay and gamble on. Guys like Otto Porter Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Cody Zeller, Doug McDermott, Lauri Markkanen, Malik Monk.   Then in the expansion draft add Winslow, Thompson, Okogie, Okpala, Holiday, Arcidiacono  Cade/Payton/Arcidiacono  Monk/A. Holiday/Okogie  Hardaway/Porter/Winslow  Markkanen/McDermott/Melli  Zeller/Thompson/Okpala  I think this team has a good balance of young guys and vets, it makes up for a lack of star power with depth, it'll be about as competitive as an expansion team can be.  Good spacing, good size, nobody too old."
"I‚Äôm so done with terry. He‚Äôs an undersized guard who sucks at everything other than catch and shoot 3s. Terrible effort when things get tough, piss terrible defender, ball hog extraordinaire, the whole works. Just the total opposite of a vet you want leading a rebuilding team  Actually I‚Äôm not done with him because I‚Äôve known he was shit since the day we overpaid him. And now we lose Malik monk for free because this franchise is run by morons"
#FREE MALIK MONK
I‚Äôm starting to wonder if Malik Monk was a good draft pick.
It‚Äôs all fun and games till Microwave Malik Monk comes in
"malik monk was actually in the rotation against you guys, at full guard health borrego has a boner for devonte graham and doesn't split the minutes. Yet our fans wanna keep both for some reason."
Fucking Malik Monk every time. He's always trying to show up Bam.
Malik Monk off the top of my head ahaha
"Kobe did not build the culture and style of play in LA, that was Phil Jackson with the triangle, pat Riley Shaq lebron had a lot to do with the culture of the heat, culture changers are rare that‚Äôs my point ant is a rarely gifted athlete and scorer but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them a culture changer, your mistaking being the best player as opposed to being to catalyst for established a culture as a team   I never said lamelo was a culture changer because of an assist number but the way he plays making the extra pass it‚Äôs extremely infectious and it has helped turned the hornets culture into one that is all about ball movement and quick decisions   I am purely talking about the way they effect the style of play which is the culture of the team the hornets simply play different when lamelo is in they average 3 more fast Break points a game when he plays, and there are quotes that everything starts with lamelo why we play as happy as the hornets do and share the ball  from people who have been on the hornets for years I never claimed this was. A stat thing quite the contrary i stated that ones style of play effects the way the whole team plays and did establish a culture   And one thing to notice about your first two points that Kobe‚Äôs and Wade‚Äôs culture there‚Äôs an outlier there you aren‚Äôt considering to as Shaq was on both  One last thing the wolves started winning when they got KAT and DLo back so it‚Äôs more reasonable to argue they are the culture changers   Link for Malik monk on lamelo culture comments   https://youtu.be/AoCc-pht3O0"
Cam Reddish  Malik Monk  ‚Ä¶..kuzma
Malik Monk in SHAMBLES
"Oh, yeah, that is a good point about the cap holds.  Although maybe just let Hart walk then and keep Ball and I think team could have some space if it could trade Adams without taking back money (which is obviously a huge if).  Yeah, actually getting someone good in FA could be tough. DeVonte Graham might be moving in FA.  Malik Monk.  Duncan Robinson.  Talen Horton-Tucker.  Dennis Schroder.  Some slim pickings."
"Aside from the obvious 23‚Ä¶  0 gives you Lillard/DiVincenzo/Miles Bridges/Tatum/Love. D‚Äôlo is also there but that defence is already pretty rough so I‚Äôd have him off the bench to slaughter worse lineups with DiVincenzo starting.  00 could give you Lonnie Walker/Devin Booker/Anthony Edwards/Zion. Centre sucks, it‚Äôd be Mike Scott by default but Zion might actually be the best option there, but you‚Äôve got guys like Malik Monk and TJ Warren and Bruce Brown to fill in the gaps."
"Wait, what happened to Malik Monk?"
"Grant wants to be in Detroit, the FO will look bad if they trade him.  Hayward is attainable, but the Hornets have LaMelo, Rozier, Graham and Malik Monk. They need a center and good defensive players, CJ isn't what they need at all."
Malik Monk is gonna go to the Raptors and have a break out year.
"John Collins- Hawks, they‚Äôll likely match whatever, and it‚Äôs better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he‚Äôs in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that‚Äôs even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I‚Äôll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
"I think itll be Malik Monk, in OKC"
I like Malik Monk but he isn't on their level
"That‚Äôs not what insiders say. So according to (either KoC or Zach Lowe, I can‚Äôt remember). They mentioned it‚Äôs not an instantaneous. You get suspended first and need to comply with NBA protocol (going to counseling, rehab stuff). If you get caught a couple more times. That‚Äôs what happened to Malik Monk and that was after several violations. He complied and was reinstated a few months after.   To get banned for a year means there were several violations and this is really the final step. The instaban is really a myth, it‚Äôs a lot more complicated"
Also to build on some stuff. I think that you actually have a couple strikes before you get straight up taken out of the league (e.g Malik Monk).   So this means there was probably a pattern and he failed multiple drug tests
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Malik Monk
Malik Monk.   I just have faith in him and would love for him to be a Bull.
"Still early in his career but Cam Reddish. He just plays with a bunch of other wings, Atlanta prob still likes him. Another player who‚Äôs a FA we dont need to trade is Malik Monk..  he has potential as a 6man scorer, Hornets gotta pick between him or Graham to re-sign"
You could be talking about Malik Monk and I wouldn‚Äôt know any difference between whoever you‚Äôre talking about lol
"You forgot RFA Malik Monk on the Hornets list. Wanamaker is UFA.  Priority #1 should be getting a solid starter at C, or at least a young player with a good chance at being one. If trading for a good one requires pick #11 and/or Hayward going back the other way, do it. (*coughs Myles Turner's name*)  Priority #2 should be bringing back RFAs Malik Monk and Devonte' Graham. Anything under $15M a year should be an automatic match for either player. None of our other FAs except Zeller will receive more than a minimum offer elsewhere.   My ideal off-season is trading Hayward+#11 for Turner+Lamb, and having ~$15M to go after a SF in FA, or stay above the cap, re-sign Zeller as the backup C, and use the MLE on a solid role player SF.   Turner/Zeller/Carey/Richards    Washington/McDaniels   Bridges/Otto Porter MLE (or Oubre at $15M and no Zeller)   Rozier/Monk   Ball/Graham   and picks 56 and 57 and mins to use as roster filler. I guess one or both Martins can be kept too, but preferably not playing.   That's just about the best case scenario for next season. Aside from the backup C and SF that we use cap space on, the whole team would be 27 or younger, Rozier being the oldest of the bunch, most of them being =&lt;23"
ben simmons for rozier and malik monk
The absolute disrespect from Malik Monk fans‚Ä¶
Terry is instrumental to that team right now I think with that contract they'd probably only budge on a guard like Malik Monk and offload Hayward as well for Simmons and picks
"Hey now, I haven‚Äôt seen Malik Monk or Peyton Pritchard go off on ANY other team this season üòî"
He‚Äôs in a slump.. he‚Äôs not performing but you are acting like he‚Äôs Malik monk or something
"Watched Malik Monk go supernova at Kentucky and thought he'd be a top 5 pick. Fell in the draft a bit and hasn't looked great, but he came on strong at the end of the year so I still have hope!"
We‚Äôll take him as a backup C. Sign and trade with Malik Monk?
"Not the worst I've seen, but I wouldn't do this. Lopez isn't getting faster as he ages. He's a good player but has his limitations and isn't a long-term solution at center. If someone like Graham is going out, it needs to be for that long term answer. Also who plays backup PG for us? Rozier is not a point guard. At all. Malik Monk is a slightly better facilitator than Rozier but not really a lead guard even off the bench. Devonte' has his limitations but he's needed here unless one of those two guards is able to become a legit PG, because nobody else on our bench can create for themselves or others, guys like McDaniels have to be spoon fed buckets.  Graham would be insanely good for Milwaukee though- he is a great PG to have next to a Giannis type who dominates in the paint.  Also your point about LaMelo making Biyombo look good doesn't make sense because Devonte' is actually the only Bobcat or Hornet ever to consistently throw passes that Biyombo can catch. Biyombo was among the worst players in the league this year, and almost looked ok offensively a year ago with Graham running the show."
"Younger Westbrook, Rose, Wall  Zach lavine, Donovan Mitchell, maybe Fox   Malik monk, DSJ and any other recent guard dunk contest participants"
"Derrick White   John Wall   Malik Monk  Manu Ginobili   Tim Duncan   Super small ball I guess lmfao, ima Kentucky fan hence Monk and Wall"
I personally believe these Nets at full strength are a full step above these Lakers at full strength. Unless Malik Monk turns into the GOAT.
"Carmelo Anthont doesn't play defense. So doesn't Ariza, Ellington, and Malik Monk. Kendrick Nunn was such a defensive liability last year that the heat had to bench him for long periods of time."
"Malik Monk, I guess? He‚Äôs gotten a tiny bit better every year."
"Don't worry they have Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunnn, the Andre Drummond of gaurds!"
"&gt; monk  As a Kentucky fan, Malik Monk was a better shooter than Jamal Murray and Devin Booker in college.  The talent is there, but I don't know where his head is.  I expected great things out of him when he went to Charlotte, but they barely used him.  The Lakers bench is soft and I can see Monk outshining the other shooters on the team."

Malik monk
Even that's a stretch because fox was a ball dominant guard with a questionable jumper. Simmons was coming back after his broken foot and the hype was all about his guard skills. I remember dickheads saying we should have reached and picked monk because of his shooting ability. Malik monk at third overall is a crime.
"wayne ellington, kendrick nunn, malik monk"
"1. The Utah Jazz were a fluke last year, and won't finish higher than a 5th seed this season. 2. Westbrook will not be the starting point guard for the Lakers by the midway point of the season (possibly starting at the 2, with Malik Monk starting at the 1 to provide spacing). 3. The Nets won't get a ring with their big 3.   As a side note, I disagree with your Michael Porter Jr. assessment. I think his lack of ballhandling and distributing ability cap his potential. His defense is also lacking at times, and he is very streaky. I just don't see him being more than a sub allstar volume scorer unless he's handed the keys to the offense fulltime and given a chance to grow into that role. I don't see that happening with Murray and Jokic.   I think he gets traded within the next couple of years to provide the pieces the Nuggets need to build around Murray and Jokic."
"MJs real obsession is just with college guys who were NCAA tournament stars or who had lots of hype in college.   Since he took over with final basektball say in 2006   2006: Adam Morrison---NCAA star tons of hype   2008: DJ Augustin--1st team all American, SI cover boy  2009: Gerald Henderson--Dukie well known commodity especially amongst people in North Carolina   2011: Kemba Walker: Tourney hero rare pick that worked out like this   2013: Cody Zeller: All American, on a no 1 seed Indiana team  2015: Frank Kaminsky: Big name on a Wisconsin team that made the Finals  2017: Malik Monk: SEC player of the year, shooting/scorer on an elite 8 Kentucky team.  The scouting drafting process is akin to what I wouldve done in high school ""Who was the flashiest biggest name most recently on a stage like the NCAA tournament that's left? That's who I want""."

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
This is just sad. Why don‚Äôt you just focus on the Lakers rookie Malik Monk instead of digging into one summer league game
Ok. Lakers can sign players on the Vets minimum. Malik Monk is on a vets minimum. He could have made more somewhere else. Same thing with Kent Bazemore.
"They have been aggressive. Look at their roster. Malik Monk, THT, and Kendrick Nunn can replace Caruso."
Malik monk would be 15
"Everybody is slating Schroder for not taking the bag, but why didn't Malik Monk and Nunn take their bags?"
"Malik Monk and Nunn arguably wouldn‚Äôt have come if Westbrook wasn‚Äôt here lol. Two guys in their 20s capable of starting, on a vet minimum. It would‚Äôve been hard to foresee if I was Dennis Schroder because, as we all know, I am no Russell Westbrook lol"
"like deadass I might rather have Malik Monk over him right now straight up, much less for the discount they got. Schroeder was lucky to even get that contract, because it's be like when Reggie Jackson got his big one with Detroit. you're lucky to even get that, bro, like I can't imagine how overconfident you need to be to end up in this position. 20 million as a maybe-star for the Lakers is worth more than 30 playing for the Magic because of all the endorsement money."
"Yeah, they were hating on Malik Monk last year because ""he stole Melo's number"" although he was there well before Ball"
Are the odds for this up in Vegas yet. I could see Malik Monk. Jaren Jackson Jr. Zach Collins. Time Lord. Kris Dunn.
Malik Monk who?
"Lebron, russ, and ad also get chills playing with malik monk"
curiosity annoyed me enough to look it up. Malik Monk started 2/25/20 against the Pacers. it's his only start in 233 career games.
"I feel like they have 3 guys who I would be comfortable playing over 25 minutes in a playoff game.   One of them will be 37 years old, another is injury prone and the third is Russell Westbrook.   Who else is there? Malik Monk and Dwight Howard are in your best 5? 36 year old washed up Ariza?   They are one of the shallowest contenders that I can remember."
So take a current role player and basically make them the star on a bad team surrounded by young or iffy help a la Jerami Grant this last year?   Malik Monk is a pretty good pick but is probably at least this year with the Lakers away from really being able to explode in that situation.  THT on the same team is a possibility.   Coby White with the Bulls is a likely choice I think. The team would lose but the stats would be good.  Immanuel Quickley would probably put up Colin Sexton like stats on a bad team.
The lakers have done a good job surrounding Malik monk with talent
He gonna say Malik Monk like he‚Äôd take a vet min in Milwaukee
"well your team also started drafting good players, the young guys drafted during the Clifford years were mostly busts and bad players.  The best player you drafted during his tenure was who? Malik Monk who is still a below average nba player."
"In that case, I hope Malik Monk has a spectacular season, and everyone else on the Lakers absolutely sucks so they get knocked out in the first round again."
"as someone who knew malik monk in high school, i don‚Äôt see what everyone else sees. i mean if the guy hadn‚Äôt gone to LA, he‚Äôd probably be out of the league in a bit. i understand he hasn‚Äôt had much playing time in charlotte, but to me, he‚Äôs always been an andre drummond type that just makes so many mental mistakes and defense he‚Äôs a blow by/ foul trouble. i just think lakers fans freak out about everyone, just like they did drummond. not saying the guy can‚Äôt improve and have a good year in a good environment, but he‚Äôs definitely gonna have some frustrating moments throughout the season."
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
"Players who are better per 100 possessions than Evan Fournier out of the min players on the Lakers roster. Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kendrick Nunn, Dwight Howard (arguably), and Wayne Ellington. Like his raw stats are better, but he isn't actually more efficient with the possessions he gets than pretty much any of them. He just has a larger role than any of them."
They Malik Monk. Bench is going to be nice.
"So a list of ring chasers compared to a solid young player (Fournier) who is leading his country (France) to the gold medal match in the Olympics.  What's your point? Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk are puzzling signings because they could've signed elsewhere for a lot more, but they decided to take the easy way out and ring chase."
"Ah yes, NBA vets Malik Monk, Kent Bazemore and Kendrick Nunn"
"Are we really under the notion that Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Carmelo Anthony is going to be some superstar combo in comparison to KCP Kuzma and the 22nd pick? Seems like a wash at best imo"
Must have missed Malik monk and Nunn signing
garrison mathews and malik monk show up in my nightmares
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
"Is this LOLKnicks? I don‚Äôt think the Fournier contract is a bad one and he is exactly what the Knicks needed. The contract for randle was a good one. Walker is a steal for them. Overall and where they are i think the Knicks had a great free agency.   Also, I don‚Äôt know what Malik Monk was thinking. Good for the lakers i guess."
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
https://www.complex.com/sports/2017/07/five-questions-with-malik-monk-steal-of-nba-draft-2017  Russ was his favorite player growing up and AD his top player from Kentucky. Plus he gets to play with LeBron for a season. As others have mentioned there should also be plently of minutes avaliable if he is able to play well
"We were obscenely great in clutch situations last season and sneaked a lot of wins against bad or similarly average teams like that  With two out of 3 our clutch bucket getters gone (Te' and Malik), I expect a regression to the mean and more young team losses. Also we downgraded several positions in the short term at least. Zeller to Plumlee (Plumlee defense is significantly worse but his health and offensive game is quite similar which is cool). And Graham/Monk to Smith/Bouknight is also a current downgrade.   Also a lot of teams that are generally good and have better rosters than hs (Toronto, Indy, Boston) *should* be better.  Especially Toronto and Indy. Indy because of Carlisle and Toronto because well they actually get to play home games and still have a great defensive roster when not ravaged by covid and injuries should be fighting consistently for a mid playoff spot imo. Their C position is worrying though     Forgive me though as a Hornets fan I've learned to become pessimistic and expect nothing"
The (next) Malik Monk redemption story starts now. I actually think this is low-key the best signing they've done so far. Monk could end up being the MIP if he can pull it off.
Malik Monk
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  ‚Äú The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.‚Äù"
Malik monk is not good
He also thought he had a lot of leverage until players like Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk were taking the min or close to it to come to the Lakers.
"Can they use it to extend JTA's contract? The only other options I see are using it on an international player or overpay a RFA like Jordan McLaughlin (they need another PG...). None of these contracts are final, so they could also try poking at a guy like Malik Monk, who may have more of a diminished role than he initially thought when signing with the Lakers (though I think this would have long term consequences for future dealings)."
"Your exact quote was that their moves were only enough to keep them competitive. That, to me, sounds like they are just middling contenders and not the most talented team in the league like I think they are. Ok, that is fine to compare those 4 players in a vacuum (Melo and Dwight vs KCP and Kuzma). But those two acquisitions are at the end of the list in terms of the Lakers most important (in my opinion). They added Malik Monk, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, and Ariza on top of that. That kind of bench depth with athleticism and versatility, on top of their new big 3, is what makes them the most talented team in the league. Again, imo"
If Malik Monk has a career year it's probably because he is getting consistent minutes.
"&gt; I would understand the Lakers, since they should be desperate for a PG  Should they be? They're starting Russ, so they only need like 10-12 minutes per night to back him up there and most of those 10-12 minutes are likely to feature LeBron, so you'd rather play two off-guards anyway. I'd imagine they're content with Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk for that role or at least certainly aren't ""desperate""."
same with malik monk... i was so down on a lot of the names being thrown around... i didn't even know monk and russ were on the table.
"[Spears] AD yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Westbrook  gave a look of pleasant surprise. Malik Monk belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Dennis Schroder hit the locker room door, ex- teammate Lebron James hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúThat's tuff üî•üíØ‚Äù"
Lakers already have Malik Monk. They could be buddies
"Malik Monk needs to start showing some stuff to really get paid. His defensive metrics are awful right now, even with his offense coming along last season."
Malik Monk bout to take OFF
Are Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk really the difference between a disaster and a sure fire team then? These dudes made their stances clear already and the receipts are there
"bro what? u guys have two top 10 players, added russell westbrook an all star level player. and got  dudes to sign cheap when they could‚Äôve gotten more money somewhere else like malik monk and kendrick nunn. then a bunch of useful vets. You and the nets are easily the favorites it‚Äôd be a disappointment for either team to not reach the finals. It‚Äôs just funny to make memes about the lakers but the expectation is for sure at least a finals appearance"
&gt; without room for discussion  You don't think Malik Monk is a better off ball guard to pair with Lebron? ;)
"Malik Monk - So insanely talented that the team that drafted him and is trying to rebuild it good young talent didn't even extend a qualifying offer to him.   Kendrick Nunn - So insanely talented that the Heat stopped playing him in the playoffs when they made a run to the finals.   Kent Bazemore - So insanely talented as a 32 year old he average a whopping 7.2 ppg and averaged a single made 3 pointer per game. I mean, damn, where do you get that kind of production?!  Wayne Ellington - On his 10th team he's bound to find consistency and success. This insanely talented sniper who turns 34 this year has shot above 40% from 3 exactly one time since 2014 -- last year in a 40-something game sample. The previous year he shot 33% on open catch and shoot 3s. I'm on the edge of my seat to find out if this middle aged shooter will find consistency in his 11th stop of his career!"
Malik Monk
"&gt;You think that such a small sample size like 50 attempts is enough to call someone a good shooter?  No, luckily we have four seasons of data on Caruso -- including that one, where he shot 48%.  &gt;Malik Monk took close to 200 shots more hen that this year and you‚Äôre discounting him as a bad shooter.  Because he has shot 33.9% for his career.  This is not difficult.  You seem unable to distinguish between taking shots and making them.  Almost literally anyone can take threes.  &gt;You‚Äôre not even constant with your own debate  Yes, I precisely am.  Monk is a 33.9% shooter.  That's not good.  Caruso is a 37.7% shooter.  That is good.  Shall I use even smaller words, until you understand?  &gt;Yup that busted hand is what prevented him from ever shooting more then 2 threes in a game for his career so far.  He attempted 2.4 per game this year.  Acquainting yourself with the facts of the situation might give you a chance here.  And yeah, having an injured hand is precisely going to cause a player to shoot less frequently.  Again, this is extremely simple material.  &gt;Well looks like Curry isn‚Äôt the GOAT shooter.  Well, he's not, but that's an entirely different topic.  Dozens of players throughout history would shoot like Curry, or better, if allowed to take unlimited steps beforehand.  That allowance has only occurred in the past decade, so comparing any modern shooter with those who played earlier is prone to errors like the one you just made."
You think that such a small sample size like 50 attempts is enough to call someone a good shooter? Malik Monk took close to 200 shots more hen that this year and you‚Äôre discounting him as a bad shooter. Why not talk about him 30% on 43 attempts? Its less then a 10 attempt discrepancy so why not talk about that?You‚Äôre not even constant with your own debate  Yup that busted hand is what prevented him from ever shooting more then 2 threes in a game for his career so far.   Oh so percentages are all you care about ok. Well looks like Curry isn‚Äôt the GOAT shooter. This season alone 18 players shot better then him and 6 players shoot better for their careers then Curry has. Good thing context doesn‚Äôt matter to you and percentages are all you care about.
It's one dude. Malik Monk. Dude got caught with cocaine.
"The Lakers have traded Russel Westbrook, Malik Monk, and Kendrick Nunn for Bradley Beal"
Yes because Pelinka is the reason why 23 year old Malik Monk signed for the minimum /s  Why didn't any of the other 29 teams think of doing that?
"Malik Monk is taking a huge gamble.   Monk tweeted on July 31 ""Bet on Yourself""  And that is what he is doing here he is going to have stiff competition to become a primary part of the Lakers rotation.   Yes he shot 40+ percent from three and looks much improved, but Carmelo, Nunn, Ellington, Bazemore, THT.   These are all guys he is going to be competing with for shots and to be the most trusted 3 point shooter especially come playoff time....will that be him? Over Ellington? Over Melo?  It could be!!! He could end up being the new KCP   Or he could regress to 35 percent from 3 and the Lakers won't even include him in the postseason rotation.   This guy is taking a massive gamble on himself. I personally think it will pay off and he will be the go to shooter as part of a crunch time lineup. But that is far from a given."
I swear they think that other teams have the ability to sign Malik monk for pennies but don‚Äôt think of it
Lakers because of Malik Monk. Hate every other laker with every fiber of my being though.
There are random RSHKs that dont do it consistently. Then there's guys like Terrance Ross and Malik Monk who play like top 10 players against us.
"I get when old vets are ring chasing but cmon, Malik Monk doesn‚Äôt need to be chasing"
"Maybe this is overly nitpicky, but ""replacement player"" is a defined term when talking about NBA players (statistically). Malik Monk and THT are considered replacement level players while Caruso and Nunn are a bit better  Replacement level players are guys that any team could pick up at any time without much trouble, and Caruso is a bit better than that (low level starter/top 2 off the bench)  You can ignore all this if we're just talking in general that his skill set is replaceable :P"
Probably better than any vet on the Lakers but Malik Monk was a fantastic steal for LA imo
I think Malik monk was the huge steal.
"Maybe the individual players seem better, but the sum of the parts is sketchy.  Aging lebron, injury prone AD and Russell - no spacing.  Gasol, Melo, Ariza, Dudley all on the verge of unplayable.  Dwight at this point - solid backup center.  Ellington can shoot the lights out, but cant defend. Bazemore is solid defender, shoot OK, offensively challenged.  At.This point both are barely replacement level veterans .  Malik monk - worth it to take a shot and get some more youth, but he's been a legitimately bad player so far.   As for ""almost beat the champs"" - the 2014 Mavs took the Spurs to 7 games in the first round.  The next year, with 36 year old Dirk, monta Ellis, Tyson Chandler, Richard Jefferson, rondo, jj barea, Chandler Parsons (woops), Amare, Devin Harris, Raymond felton, charlie V, they won 50 games, hobbled into the playoffs and got stomped by a young harden rockets team. Old teams get injured, young teams improve.  The Lakers are contenders, but I don't see them as favourites by any stretch.  Injury issues, bad spacing, and spotty play from role players all gonna be prominent"
Milwaukee literally just won a title we aren't getting Malik Monk on a min.
"Malik Monk puts in effort. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs elite, but he‚Äôs responsible enough that he‚Äôll probably be + on net scoring."
Future MiP Malik Monk
Yo y‚Äôall signed Malik Monk. Also you better not get Dipo. Most likely done with FAs until midseason buyouts
"Does Malik Monk make his team worse or is he signing WAY under what he's worth? If you find Charlotte to be reasonable in pulling his QO, then you must figure his value is less than 7 mil  His min is slightly above 1 mil  So what was your cutoff line for the outrage? 4 mil? 5 mil?  Evidently there must not have been a meaningful market for him unless he hates money  And yes, if you don't want a player to enter into free agency, generally that means re-signing that player lol you can't have your cake and eat it too"
"They signed both to exceptions that allow teams to exceed the salary cap  Malik Monk- veteran's minimum deal, you can sign an infinitely many number of these as long as you have not incurred a hard cap on yourself and you are willing to pay luxury tax if required  Kendrick Nunn- taxpayer (or ""mini"") MLE, 1 of these, usually a 2 year deal, I don't know much more about it. 5 mil-ish range. differs from the full MLE, which was about 9.5 mil this year, in that it does not incur a hard cap"
That's cool and all but Malik Monk go blrrrdd
Malik Monk and and Anthony would put up an inefficient 20 points. Mills when hot is unstoppable from 3
Malik Monk already has the JR position breh
Lmao sign Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn and lakers fans acting like they got KD
"I mean Malik Monk isn't the reason, but I would say the Lakers are clearly a superteam. Two top ten players, and another on All-NBA."
"You already got him, but he spells his name Malik Monk."
"People on Twitter and IG are unironically citing the Lakers getting Malik Monk as proof of it being a ""superteam."""
Lol I really wanted Duarte in the draft‚Ä¶got Malik Monk who is younger than him
Kendrick Nunn? Malik Monk?
"Lol. I‚Äôd consider Russ molding into the system, Lebron returning to dominance, and even if Malik Monk can keep up his shooting consistentcy and have a breakout year as more interesting."
"&gt; This year they have a group of alpha guys who never played the second and third roles on a team.  Who are you talking about? Dwight and Rondo played roles on the '20 title team. Melo played a role last year with the Blazers. Bazemore, Ariza, and Ellington are journeyman role players. Malik Monk has started one game in his career. Kendrick Nunn is going into his third year and took less money for an opportunity to win.   Westbrook is an alpha for sure, but he also played point beside KD for five scoring titles, so I'm not that worried about him finding a way to amplify greatness."
Malik Monk is going to be the 3rd most important player on the Lakers roster this year.  Nickeil Alexander-Walker makes the all star game.
"Avoiding Star players here‚Äî-  Watch: TJ McConnell, Harrison Barnes, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart  Don‚Äôt Watch: Malik Monk, Aron Baynes, Eric Bledsoe"
Similar to Malik Monk and Jordan Poole last season.
"If there was an expansion draft before this season, I think Malik Monk or Talen Horton Tucker. The Lakers are in win-now mode so probably can't afford to protect either, but I think both would do well on a team where they had the chance to have a big role (Talen Horton Tucker more so but I think he's likely to get protected first)"
Apparently Charlotte offered PJ + their first for Turner and I never thought that was a bad offer honestly.   I'm also super surprised Malik Monk went for such a cheap deal on the Lakers. I get that he's a microwave type of guy and he's had some consistency issues but I figured he'd be worth more than what he got.
"Since pretty much the whole lakers team is slept on, ill mention a few.   Carmelo knows he has this is his last chance and is finally playing alongside ""the old also slept on LeBron"". Strictly for offense and you'd be surprised his defensive intensity pick up to as Vogel is good at instilling defense. I.e. Kuzma, KCP, THT, Trez.  Kendrick Nunn doesn't get enough attention. Solid player that damn near took the lakers to 6 in the finals. Perfect balance of shooting and his defensive prowess.   Malik Monk. We are forgetting he was hitting his stride last year after being in the league 4 years now. Hes only 24 years old and is a talent ready to explode this season.   THT had a very good rookie season and an okay 2nd season. He has shown flashes of being a downhill unorthodox finisher at the rim, especially with his reach. He will be mentally stronger and more assertive.   The list can go on but these are my picks from my teams."
Mad Malik [Monk](https://imgur.com/a/EZs1f8Z)
I mean how good of a prospect could he be if he can't beat Malik Monk out of some playing time?  You're acting like he's stuck behind prime Jason Kidd.
On the Lakers it doesn‚Äôt matter. Where will he get any playing time? There‚Äôs not even a guarantee he‚Äôll play more than Malik Monk. He could be the best prospect in the world and you‚Äôll never see it pan out. It actually works out in the Lakers interest to put him in a package for a veteran. For some reason Lakers fans don‚Äôt understand this.
"That was my point. Are you agreeing with me there ?  And it culminated in him averaging an inefficient 14/11. Which is fine but far from standout. Not even liking at FG, TS isn‚Äôt great either. Why does age matter?  I listed several teenagers that dominated in summer league. Noah Vonleh was one. Malik Monk had just turned 20. DSJ. Tony Bradley absolutely dominated and he was 19 or 20. Simons was 19 or 20.   Ante zizic couldn‚Äôt score? He averaged 20... how was bam good in summer league ? He had awful efficiency and his defence wasn‚Äôt a fraction of what it is now. And I still listed a wide variety of players that played like shit in summer league and ended up becoming elite players.  I‚Äôm tired of you dancing around my point. The FACT, is summer league is a tiny sample of 4-7 games (4 in Sengun‚Äôs case) against rookies and players who are trying to get fringe rotational contracts, aka not nba level talent. It means literally nothing. It‚Äôs irrelevent. Historically we‚Äôve seen countless players dominate summer league and do nothing in the league or struggle and become stars. It doesn‚Äôt matter. It means nothing. No GM‚Äôs put any stock into it. Nobody cares."
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
Who cares. Good players are on max contracts. Is Malik monk on a max? Would u rather have him.
PEOPLE FORGET 14 YEAR OLD MALIK MONK WAS A BUCKET üò§
14 year old Malik Monk üò§
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
Malik monk
Well let‚Äôs assume the big 3 ball out next year and are averaging over 25 PPG. Now imagine one night AD just doesn‚Äôt have it and he goes 25% from the field. Then imagine if it didn‚Äôt matter because Malik Monk ends up pitching in 22 points and Carmelo and Howard each pitch in over 10 points and the Lakers win by 15. Now that is unfair. A role player dominating for them or bailing one of the stars out is unfair. I know I‚Äôll be salty if Westbrick shows up for a whole playoff series and the Lakers still win in 5 because their role players pick up his slack.
"Well just agree to disagree ig. We‚Äôll see how he looks defensively in Brooklyn.  What? There was a literal log Jam between he AG and Jamychal green, all players that aren‚Äôt very effective at any position but the 4. The fact that he played less against the suns just proves my point that Jamychal green was given priority due to his shooting and their need for offence, since Portland was a much worse defensive team than Phoenix was and they didn‚Äôt need to squeeze every bit of offence they needed to out of the team.   There were 4-5 teams that gave millsap interest in FA based upon reports. It‚Äôs possibly they all offered the minimum, since A- he‚Äôs old and B-  few teams had cap left, but it would also make sense for millsap at his age to settle for a minimum to compete for a chip. Guys like Blake griffin and Malik monk took pay cuts to ring chase."
Malik Monk he still has time but I was 100% sure he was gonna ball tf out. And be another JR Smith. Uber athletic shooter
"Malik Monk..he‚Äôs a good player but I thought he would be doing what Donovan Mitchell is doing‚Ä¶that being said you can‚Äôt tell me Malik Monk won‚Äôt be an allstar eventually, idc."
Harry Giles and Malik Monk come to mind.
The Celtics are not signing Juwan Morgan or Jabari Parker for the same purpose that the Lakers signed Malik Monk.
I just spit out my tea..  This is why the Lakers are a superior franchise.   The Celtics sign players like this guy and jabari Parker while the Lakers get Malik Monk Ellington and Dwight Howard for the minimum
"I like CJ, but I like him in the same way that I like Malik Monk and Jamal Crawford."
Malik Monk really interests me. He‚Äôs kinda small so defensive as a SG with Westbrook that‚Äôs a minor concern. He‚Äôs very athletic and coming off a career shooting year but his shooting was terrible in seasons prior. He can be the best 4th man in the league or he can be taken out the playoff rotation.
"Lakers had the best offseason by far.  People's heads are going to explode when they all get cooked by Malik Monk next season.  Celtics, Warriors, and Bulls also had nice offseasons."
MVP: Luka  DPOY: Gobert  6MOY: Malik Monk  ROTY: Jalen Green  MIP: Kevin Porter Jr
Do you really think Wayne Ellington and Malik Monk will be playing starter minutes and attacking Rudy Gobert at the rim in the playoffs?
idk that sounds a lot like Malik Monk
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."
No. They already have a Malik Monk
&gt;Malik Monk  My boy doesn't belong there bring him back!
"Are their role players better overall? I seriously don't know. You are banking on Nunn, Malik Monk, and guys who have been in the twilight of their careers for a couple years now."
"If the starters are prime LeBron - young Westbrook - prime Melo - prime Marc Gasol - prime Dwight Howard (BPA line-up), that would still leave a bench of prime Rondo - prime Ellington - prime Ariza - rookie AD - young DeAndre Jordan. Very solid bench.  Throw in some minutes for a rookie Bazemore and make sure 12-year-old THT, 14-year-old Malik Monk don't touch the court, and maybe even 17-year-old Kendrick Nunn."
PG: Kyrie  SG: Harden  SF: LeBron PF: Kevin  C: AD  BPG: Russ  BSG: Malik  BSF: Melo  BPF: Blake  BC: Dwight  11M: Lamarcus  12M: Millsap 13M: Bazemore  NP: Chris Paul  NP: Claxton   How much help does Malik Monk need?
"True, the only signing I don‚Äôt like is Malik Monk taking the minimum at 23 years old."
"The Lakers 2 meaningful gets were Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk, and even Monk wasn't that crazy. None of the other guys were worth getting upset about at all. Melo, Dwight, Jordan, Rondo? Melo's the only one of them that was even half decent last year, and even then he's super limited at this point.   People are just reacting off name brand at this point."
"They are not the best  choices I would choose but reality most like these guys will guard them   &amp;#x200B;  Trevor Ariza, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, BRON , RUSS"
Mannnn people really hate on Malik Monk. Dude did ball out with Fox in Kentucky.
"non-traditional, eh?  let's do Dwight Howard at PG, Anthony Davis at SG, Marc Gasol at SF, Malik Monk at PF to show OP why he deserves to play, and Rondo at C     &gt; bring on IT  no"
Hot take:  I'd rather have Malik Monk than Herro
"Lakers also got Malik Monk, Dwight Howard, and Wayne Ellington, also has Aldridge even signed?"
"Kobe's best playmaker was Pau Gasol or Lamar Odom. His best shooter was Derek Fisher or Robert Horry. LeBron, meanwhile, has a collective 59 All-Star appearances on his roster this year, Malik Monk signing for the minimum lol."
Wayne Ellington and Malik Monk
Malik Monk and Bol Bol
Malik Beasley and Malik Monk
"He's an excellent coach, he just hasn't had great rosters especially in terms of offensive talent. I think perception of him would have turned around if we had stayed healthy last season, people look at our 6-2 start and assumed we just got hot, but we had totally revamped our offense and looked like a genuinely good team. I honestly think we could have been a 4-6th seed, but everything was built around Markelle, and then literally everyone else got hurt.   IMO Cliff is one of the most underrated coaches in the league right now. Hornets fans seem to hate on him because he didn't play their golden boy, Malik Monk - who *still* didn't get played after Cliff left and is now on a minimum for another team."
Wouldn‚Äôt call Russ an X-Factor since he‚Äôs a legit star so I‚Äôll go with Malik Monk ‚Äî if his shooting holds up from last season and Vogel is able to get him to take advantage of his athleticism on defense he could be the steal of the offseason
"LeBron has been talking for literally years about how he wants help on his team with more ball handlers, so I'm sure you're right. Also we know he, AD and Westbrook got together and talked about teaming up a couple weeks before the trade happened so clearly LeBron was on board with the trade. After that, no doubt for tax purposes, the Lakers basically just signed a bunch of guys on minimum contracts who they think can probably help this year, and generally that's just a bunch of vets (though they also got Malik Monk this way, surprisingly).   I think the way the Lakers will work is if everyone knows their role (especially Westbrook), and the team stays relatively healthy. Both things are very much in doubt, of course, so it could be a mess. But I think if Vogel keeps everyone's minutes down and everyone buys into the team concept it could work great. I'm excited to see what happens."
Russ ad and bron can all be Allstar‚Äôs this year. Melo And Dwight are still good plus rondo malik monk and the rest of their bench they‚Äôre pretty good. Of their 11 players 7 or 8 of them have been have been Allstar‚Äôs at one point. Which is the most in nba history
Honestly I feel sorry for Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn - they're gonna finish a game and have about seven players trying to give them advice on how to improve their footwork.
Malik Monk
I thought we weren't that old anymore after getting Malik Monk and Nunn. Those 2 guys alone lowered the average.
what about malik monk?
"Could be depending on injuries etc.   I anticipate THT, Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn will play heavy minutes in the regular season."
Bazemore isn't ancient at only 32 and Malik Monk and Talen Horton-Tucker of course are very young.
"Yeah like Melo Dwight rondo Malik monk and nunn weren‚Äôt able to get more than the min from any other team, makes sense lol"
"The hell are you talking about? I'm not talking about the big 3, I'm talking about the FA signings and buyouts. Y'all literally convinced Malik Monk, a 22 year old to take a minimum to ring chase lmao. Just admit it, I'm not upset that the Lakers did what they did, just that we still get shit for it while the Lakers ended up doing the same thing."
"Devonte' Graham will be averaging around 16-18pts, 10ast, over 40% on 3 now that he's playing off Zion and Ingram rather than a team with no interior presence.   Malik Monk will be starting in the playoffs for the Lakers.  Yes I am mad about this offseason as a Hornets fan."
And took Malik Monk from the hornets
"Yeah I'm sure Malik Monk and THT will be like ""yeah damn I can learn the NBA from Lebron, Russ, or Melo, but you know what I really need to teach me good habits ? Yeah a guy who doesn't even bother to be in shape and doesn't deserve an NBA spot, this will teach me the right things"""
"no, Malik Monk is only 23"
"Malik Monk, THT another year of growth, Russell Westbrook"
Malik Monk
"Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn, not to mention Horton-Tucker  they got depth"
"LeBron will still be a top 20 player in 5 years (age 41-42 season)  Devonte' Graham will average close to 10 assists and shoot over 40% on very high volume from deep playing next to Zion Williamson.  Ben Simmons figures it out on his next team, and averages 23/8/8 whenever he's traded.  Kyrie Irving signs his 4 year extension with the Nets, but randomly decides to retire 1 or 2 years into it.  As a result of his 1-year showcase contract with the Lakers, Malik Monk manages to cash in a 4 year deal around $80M next summer."
I‚Äôm really excited to see what Malik Monk will do on the Lakers. He gets to learn with Vets while not really having any pressure on him except as a shooter.  I‚Äôm also excited to see who steps up on the Spurs. I feel like we have a ton of players who could possibly take a leap but Keldon is the most obvious. It‚Äôs now or never for Lonnie. DJ will probably have a bump in production and I think Vassell will show us more.
I agree Malik Monk is a beast but do you really think he beats Kawhi or Harden for that 5th spot?
"Malik Monk.   Third times a charm, one year I'll get this prediction right lol"
Kawhi Leonard - He's a Kawaii  Hassan Whiteside - He's a White Side  Derick Favors - He is a Favor  Lonzo Ball/Lamelo/Liangelo - They are balls  Buddy Hield - He's a Healer  Kendrick Nunn - He's a Nun  Malik Monk - He's a Monk  Harold Miner - He's a Miner  Dragan Bender - He can Bend a Dragon  Devonte Graham - He's a Graham  Dion Waiters - He's a Waiter
Malik Monk - Monk   Marcus Smart - smart  Jrue Holiday - Holiday (mardigra)  Rodney Hood - Hood
"From left field here, does it drive anyone else crazy the way Bill Simmons pronounces Malik monk?!"
"Malik Monk is an undersized shooting guard  What skill does the announcer think he's in the league for, taking a 3 pointer with the game on the line"
"Malik Monk looks like every time the trainer gives him an off-season strength training routine he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, actually. Thanks tho‚Äù"
"Vogel's secrit plays: down 3, 16 seconds left, call the ""Kobe"" isolation for Malik Muthafuckin Monk.  Still, Melo had plenty of time for a jab step or two instead of rushing it, and that would've been cash money."
Horrible shots by Lakers during the 2nd half and towards end of the game.  Like wtf were they doing.  And for no reason every should Malik Monk should be taking a game tying iso 3 point shot.  Holy shit!!
My favorite part of the whole thing is Malik Monk smiling cause I'm sure he's reminiscing of when he did the same thing some years ago after which Michael Jordan slapped him upside the head on the sidelines lolol
Malik Monk took a paycut for this
Cuz it‚Äôs Malik monk lol. If that was Russ or AD it‚Äôd be easy.
We have to lean on Malik Monk to bail us out LMAO that isn‚Äôt good
 The Lakers got Malik monk on a minimum. That‚Äôs fucking crazy
Malik ‚Äúbasically Buddy Heild‚Äù Monk
Malik Monk has been the most underrated in game dunker throughout his whole career
"Nah bro they‚Äôre onto LBJ‚Äôs squid game criticism and Malik Monk ‚Äúhitting a deep 3 to seal the game, something lebron has never done‚Äù or some shit like that lol"
Can anyone give me a feel on what happened for Malik Monk to be +31 in 38 minutes of play? That's incredible. Especially when you look at AD and Russ both at +3 and +1 respectively on similar minutes.
Malik Monk such a great fit it‚Äôs crazy. So fortunate he came over
"Yeah, what was going on in there?  Postgwme interviews and Russ, Malik Monk, and Vogel all making it sound like they were playing at home"
"Malik Monk is +21 overall this year, what in the cap"
That‚Äôs kind of my point. They weren‚Äôt hitting but they don‚Äôt normally hit.   They were basically shooting their averages. Bazemore averaged 7 ppg last year and put up 5 tonight. Malik Monk averaged 11 ppg last year and put up 17 tonight. Melo was off. But it seemed like Westbrook and AD‚Äôs numbers should have made up for that. The fact that the Spurs stayed in the game and scored that much is also surprising considering last year most Lakers games stayed below 100 pts. Like I said it could very well be chemistry since it‚Äôs so early. Just didn‚Äôt expect it.
Can‚Äôt leave out my man Malik Monk
How about that Malik Monk feller with a casual +31
"Malik Monk shot 6 of 15 and was a +31, what a wild stat line"
"Malik ""Steph Curry"" Monk"
How could they possibly think that when he is in the company of great players such as Luke Kennard and Malik Monk.
"With all due respect, Malik Monk does the same thing Buddy Hield does"
We have Malik monk. We don‚Äôt need buddy hield making $22mil more than him
Also Malik Monk literally does what Hield does for 1/10th the money.
Don‚Äôt use logic here please. 37 year old Lebron is going to attack the rim until his ankles turn to dust. And Buddy Heild should be out there doing the same thing Malik Monk does for 10x the price.
"Great win, we didn‚Äôt quit, and kept the intensity.  **Positives**: Russell Westbrook (33,10,8) and Anthony Davis (35 and 17) had big games. R. Westbrook especially made a couple of important baskets down the stretch. Malik Monk was solid also. We didn‚Äôt give up mentally overall down the stretch.  **Negatives**: We have clear defensive issues. We were making Jakob Peotl look like the second coming of George Mikan out there, it was ridiculous. We gotta defend the pick and roll a bit better. Also, we need to do a better job rebounding. We need to go back to the fundamental point of boxing out. We have been giving up too many offensive rebounds, which lead to second chance points (16 to 9 for SAS today), and with the size we have, we have no excuses for this to happen. Finally, we struggled from 3 (26%). LeBron has been our best shooter from 3, and his absence was felt in this area today."
"A monk once asked about the duality of man replied ""Malik"""
&gt; So what happens in the playoffs when ~~Russ~~ Bron can't play with ~~Bron~~ Russ  This game definitively proved LeBron was holding back AD and Westbrook (and Malik Monk)
Malik Monk with the +31 lol
Malik Monk with that casual +31 (and that says a lot about the heavy use of that Rondo/West pairing when he wasn't on court).
Where is the malik monk deep three highlight
"They did, they‚Äôve got a really nice highlight of Lebron coaching Malik Monk"
How good is Malik Monk
Malik Monk looks like JR Smith's little brother
"Malik ""Curry"" Monk"
"Malik ""Minimum"" Monk MMM"
MALIK MONK
Malik monk is a gangster. Holy shit
Malik Monk is +27 lol in a tie game.
Malik Monk
"Yeah! Melo seems obvious but shit man Malik monk showin out rn, always thought he looked good on the hornets but glad to see it translates on a roster with big names. Shout out Austin reeves too"
"""this is my monastery"" -Malik Monk"
"‚ÄúMalik Monk is a baller, boiii‚Äù"
"Malik ""Magic"" Monk"
"Nunn and THT are going to take minutes from Kent Bazemore, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, and Malik Monk.  Nothing to see here."
"Klay Thompson vs Kemba Walker 2018-2019 Regular season  Klay - 21.5 ppg / 3.8 rebounds / 2.4 assists on 57.1% true shooting, 25.6% usage. 78 games played.  Kemba - 25.6 ppg / 4.4 rebounds / 5.9 assists on 55.8% ts, **31.5% usage**. **82 games played**.  Klay - 16.6 PER / 5.3 Win Shares / **-0.3 BPM** / 1.2 VORP  Kemba - 21.7 PER / 7.4 Win Shares / 4.2 BPM / 4.4 VORP  Klay was the third option on a team with 2 top 5 players. Kemba was the minutes leader on a team he dragged to 39 wins. Here was his supporting cast, in descending minutes played -    Nic Batum, in the totally checked-out part of his career   Jeremy Lamb   A 32 year old Marvin Williams   A rookie Miles Bridges   Sophomore Malik Monk   A sometimes healthy Cody Zeller   And to close it out, 8th man, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  You swap Klay and Kemba that season, what do you think happens? I think Kemba gets a ring, and those Hornets don't come anywhere close to 39 wins.  The only thing that's wild to me is that in 2021 people would question this all-nba selection."
"Any team in the NBA could use Malik Monk, especially for THAT contract."
"Malik Monk is criminally underpaid rn, that's a good piece  Probably have to attach some fat filler to get anything back tho and then you'd need more assets for it to be worth it to the other team."
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
you have Malik Monk right fucking there and you‚Äôre running premier Kent Bazemore minutes?
"If you watch there's been some conflict all night. Dwight was yelling at Rondo shortly before this, and LeBron told Malik Monk to ""shut up"" because he was being loud after he got fouled."
I love Malik Monk
i said 20 but ok lets do 5  the LA team is getting all the signings and AD forcing out because lebron is there. simple as that.   lebron is there for his production company and businesses so yes its advantageous to signing the richest basketball player ever with a ton of outside ventures but thats literally 1 player and if the team wasn't in a position to be easily reformed to his liking he would've chosen another despite those outside reasons being a factor in picking the lakers. the truth is the team was just malleable enough for him to do what he's done every season since he returned to the cavs.   it was known kawhi and PG wanted to play in their hometowns basically their whole careers and never got the chance until then. nothing to do with it being ~LA~.   and now all of a sudden trading for russ is an advantage when this sub swears hes the worst piece of shit to ever hit the floor? lmfao ok   its funny how you had to immediately pivot to regular ass players like malik monk and kendrick nunn like every single team didn't sign players of their calibre for cheap contracts.  lets do 20 now though. gives you an even bigger timeline to find examples of what you claim.
"Let‚Äôs just go back to last 5 years. LeBron signs because LA. AD wants a trade to LA. Westbrook wants a trade to LA. Kawhi and PG want to play in LA. Players take pay cuts to play in LA. Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn, two young players just sign there for cheap because they can win in LA.   Their players get more national media attention hence higher chances to make all-star teams and media driven awards.   You give a team like Minnesota 2 stars and then LA the same 2 stars. The LA team is getting all the signings because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ LA."
"The Lakers DRTG in the first half wasn't from elite defense, it was from the Warriors playing badly. They gave up on the 3 and focused too hard on driving to the rim which is bad offense. Malik Monk wasn't the adjustment that saved the Warriors, it was moving the ball on the perimeter and shooting 3s.  Lakers team defense failed them, not Monk alone."
"&gt;Carmelo Anthony and Malik Monk, who were the Lakers‚Äô two most harmful defenders in the preseason,   You don't say."
"If Monk can keep up his vastly improved 3pt% then he's pretty close but he was not an efficient 3pt shooter before last year.  He started his career at 34%, got worse for two seasons ending at 28% and then randomly shot 40%.  I think he could keep it up but it's a huge jump and a lot to ask for.  Buddy has been very consistent for his whole career always shooting between 39-43%.  Also takes about double the threes Malik does."
Malik monk is a slender 6‚Äô3 2 guard so he‚Äôs small for his position and he‚Äôs skinny. He‚Äôs going to be outsized by most guys he matches up against sadly.
"Imo LeBron and WB need to be staggered as much as possible. The tempo needs to be balls to the wall when WB is in. In the minutes they have to share, I would play bron off ball more and get them in two man pnr. I prefer LeBron having the ball but he's so much more effective off ball than WB. We'll see what happens when they're fully healthy. Malik Monk was disappointing for them last night."
"Damn, not Most Improved Player and First Time All Star Malik Monk. I don't believe it"
"Yeah for real. Especially because they got Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn.  Nunn was a great fit at PG when paired with a ball dominant wing in Jimmy Butler. Nunn helped give Butler a rest in running the offense which is what Lebron wanted. Didn't need to boil the ocean by selling the farm for Westbrook.  Monk is a solid secondary ball-handler, and then you have Rondo off the bench. Lakers then get to keep their shooting depth.  Instead they've got Sekou Doumbaya, a looks-to-be-washed Avery Bradley, and whatever that other dude is on the bench."
Please have Malik Monk.
Westbrook -25 was pretty real. He‚Äôs bad for this team and doesn‚Äôt fit when they go big at all. He‚Äôs also bad on defense. They need Malik monk to figure it out
What was Wiggins thinking about attacking the known rim protector malik monk smh
I'm really pulling for Malik Monk. I hope he balls out in LA.
Tired of these bums put in Malik Monk
Where is Malik Monk?
This won‚Äôt last. The fucking 3 point shooting is going to be garbage and once they realize that efficient 3 point shooting teams that are having a good night start blowing them out by 30 they‚Äôll change lineups and start trading people. Malik Monk should start.
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
i've seen him on the magic. He played like a replacement level player given a decent amount of reign. malik monk put up similar production the past two years to fultz on the magic and he got a minimum contract this offseason. magic fans are just insane homers when it comes to fultz for some reason.
weird seeing a hornets fan say this knowing what malik monk did to us game after fucking game last year. 2020-2021 malik monk against miami is a top 5 player in the league's history
Malik Monk wins MIP and gets a contract in the $17-20M range next summer
"Since Fox's NCAA tournament run with Malik Monk and sobbing after they lost, I have loved this kid. He's a gamer. What a cool play here."
Malik Monk
Malik monk
Malik Monk is the signing of the summer.
Malik Monk had two games of career highs in scoring (32 and 36 pts) against us last season. Legit was so annoying lmao.
"Tht won‚Äôt be the one to breakout, it‚Äôll be Malik monk"
"I think it'll be Lonzo. He just looks like such a good fit on this Bulls team. And I think a potential Dark Horse could be Malik Monk, but that will only be if he gets enough touches"
Malik Monk Sixers is that you? ü¶ñ
I'm pretty sure they're also the one who had a big 'Let's congratulate the genius of Rob Pelinka for being the only one to think of signing Malik Monk on a minimum' thing for a bit.
"&gt;And you lost 4  Only ones that played any significant time were Caruso and KCP. The other guys you mentioned production is replaced with Nunn and Ariza.   &gt;Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol  Are we acting like Wayne Ellington and Melo aren't shooters now?"
"And you lost 4. Plus McLemore and Wesley Matthews who can both shoot.   Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol"
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
No they can't lol. Russ has the point guard position locked up. That means there is only the shooting guard position open. Even the Lakers aren't dumb enough to put Kendrick Nunn or Malik Monk at small forward.
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
"Well once again, they brought in Kendrick nunn who is quite comparable and also Malik monk who is young but still experienced, and can produce offensively much better than anyone they had in 2019"
"&gt;There‚Äôs a huge difference between starting over Devonte Graham and Malik Monk and starting over Klay Thompson. No matter what he does he wouldn‚Äôt start. That seems frustrating.  Klay can play the 3. It's not even about starting, it's about PT. They can roll out a Steph/Melo/Klay/Dray/Whoever center as the death lineup and that team will score a shit ton of points. Sure the defense might not be as good but you're gonna smother teams with offense.  &gt;But he will adjust. It normally takes bigs longer than other positions without Covid screwing up practices. And for a big his shooting is actually very promising.  It's not just about the skills, dude looked absolutely lost out there. And it's not even about the fit, it's about production. If Wiseman did produce last year they can either keep him or package him and some salary for a superstar. Now they have no choice but to develop him, no one wants him. That won't be the case with Ball, a shit ton of options would have opened up this year."
"&gt; Ball didn't even start in Charlotte, he had to earn that. I think with GS he would have the same path. The moment he clicks with Steph is the moment he'll start.   There‚Äôs a huge difference between starting over Devonte Graham and Malik Monk and starting over Klay Thompson. No matter what he does he wouldn‚Äôt start. That seems frustrating.   &gt; But even if he doesn't start he'll still provide the continuity of the ball/player movement because of his high BBIQ.  That‚Äôs true but is that good value at the #2 draft pick? A high-end bench player?  &gt; Wiseman had obvious trouble adjusting to the NBA pace, homie can't even shoot. They gave him the starting job outright, and eventually got demoted.  But he will adjust. It normally takes bigs longer than other positions without Covid screwing up practices. And for a big his shooting is actually very promising.  &gt; Isn't this the reason why people are so down on him pre-draft? But still he was stuffing the stat sheet and showing that elite playmaking skill...plus unlike his brother, he doesn't shy away from contact and actually drives to the hoop to try to score and not just pass.  I get that but the shooting and defense is a HUGE concern for the Warriors last season when you know he‚Äôs gonna be a net negative (all rookies are) and you are playing him with Curry on defense and Dray on offense. 3 sub 30% shooters on the court with Curry just isn‚Äôt going to work. Now if he‚Äôs a bench player the only problem is you are using your best pick you want to get for the next decade on a bench player for the next near half decade."
nah. malik monk (23) might start for them. and kendrick nunn it looking like the 6man
"Drove that golf cart to LA, gave Malik Monk a quick slap on the head for good luck then back to business."
"Hey hey hey let‚Äôs not knock Malik quite yet. Monk has actually been pretty good, albeit in preseason. He gives us something the other players don‚Äôt.   James ennis on the other hand. I don‚Äôt see the infatuation with this guy from my fellow laker fans."
"James Ennnis: barely played for tanking team, to be core rotation piece for title contender.  Where have I heard this before? Oh right, Malik Monk"
"i was wondering how this work out, but the basketball gods might be leaning towards a warriors victory, with trevor ariza and THT out for sure (malik monk is also injured but aiming to return for the opener).  but who knows what could happen in 8 days. &gt;.&gt;"
Unbiased but  Cade: Luka  Green: MJ without the defense  Mobley: AD  Barnes: Draymond Green with a jumper/handle  Suggs: Jrue Holiday   Floor  Cade: Kyle Anderson  Green: Malik Monk  Mobley: Jabari Parker with D  Barnes:   Suggs: Cory Joseph
Malik monk is related to Michael Jordan
"Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker, and Kendrick Nunn really bout to go through it this season lmfao"
"we should be fair and slander malik monk for having 6 TOs last game, too!"
Don't need to rely on Malik monk catching on fire
Malik Monk has been a blessing this season
"Holy shit this is like the 4th clip request post for this game, can you guys stop it already and just wait a few minutes?  I mean, the Malik Monk buzzer beater got posted a whole quarter after it happened, just be patient ffs"
Guess Malik Monk is not too much of a bum afterall
malik monk is a joke
Knicks fan here. I was all in on Malik monk over frank ntilikina. nailed it!
For a little bigger picture:  https://go.nba.com/7vs9   Only two players on the Lakers have a positive +/- per 36. Austin Reaves and Malik Monk
"Malik monk, Melo, Dwight, THT , and Ellington are good role players. Quit making excuses ."
Malik Monk thinks he‚Äôs all that bro lmaoo
cant wait for a malik monk dunk to reach the front page
"To the Lakers for Wayne Ellington, Malik monk, Kent Bazemore, and a 2035 protected 3rd rounder."
Imagine if your boss smacked you in the back of the head like MJ did to Malik Monk at 4:21.
That‚Äôs why you involve your teammates. Is malik monk window dressing?
I can't believe Malik Monk went ring-chasing at fucking 23 years old lol
Cold take. We really gonna act like 24/10/3 while average 1 steal and 2 blocks isn‚Äôt All-Star level? Lakers just lacking a good wing defender.   The fact we had Malik Monk out there defending Fox was the issue.
"We didn‚Äôt deserve to win that game.  LAL had them in a position of power late in the fourth quarter, and then LAL decided to go on a stretch where they were unable to score, causing the Kings to naturally come back and force the game to overtime.  Skip Bayless will rightly criticize LeBron for refusing to drive and attempt to draw a foul at the end of regulation, instead settling for a difficult three point shot. He did the exact same thing last game.  Positives: Russell Westbrook, Malik Monk  Negatives: Boxing Out, free throws"
Lmao Malik Monk
malik monk you fucking jerkoff
Malik Monk and Carmelo Anthony anchoring the Lakers' offense in 2021 is a sentence I never expected to type.
"Malik Monk is fucking good, the lakers would have at least 3 less wins without him"
"I'm not really sure what kind of confirmation you're expecting here, almost all sports reporting of this type comes via unnamed sources and snippets of candid moments. If you're going to question the validity of this based on the lack of anybody going on the record and saying ""you know what, screw my career, I'll tell you what a bad teammate Dwight was"" then you might as well question about 95% of NBA news.  Much of the Dwightmare in Orlando has been well documented. Dwight complained about Van Gundy, caused problems in the media and eventually got his coach fired. He threatened to request a trade out of Orlando, then he publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise and made several efforts to re-establish himself there via community events before changing his mind yet again and forcing the trade to the Lakers.  In LA he publicly complained about needing the ball in the post to be effective, blaming his problems on his mis-use, despite playing alongside Kobe and Steve Nash, two all-time greats who thrive in the pick and roll.  In Houston, despite playing well for the majority of his tenure, his complaining about the style of play he was used in once again caused management to lose patience with him. He was playing alongside James Harden as The Beard stepped up into one of the greatest players in the league, and still Howard couldn't stop complaining about not getting to post up enough. So Houston gave up on Howard and he declined $22m to become a FA and sign with Atlanta.  Atlanta seemed to like him, but that didn't stop them trading him for peanuts less than a year later.  In Charlotte there were numerous reports that despite his solid on court performances, Howard was a distraction off the court, and a bad influence on rookie Malik Monk. So they gave up on him after just one season.  I can't make up your mind for you, but the common threads in all of those stints were 1) decent to very good on-court performance when Dwight was healthy, 2) near constant reports of discontent from within the team, 3) Dwight leaving before the end of his contract term every single time.  Obviously he wasn't the only ingredient in any of those situations, NBA basketball is a complex affair with a lot of people and overlapping contexts. But the reports of his attitude issues and causing problems have been so numerous, so detailed and so continuous for so many years that I think you have to be pretty wilfully ignoring it to believe otherwise."
"Despite being an incredibly productive player for most of his career he has managed to alienate himself from no fewer than 4 organisations - Orlando, LA, Houston and Charlotte.   He was traded from the Hornets despite averaging 17/13 on good efficiency, primarily because the locker room hated him and the team was worried he was setting a bad example for Malik Monk, the one young player who apparently had a good relationship with Howard. And that happened *after* he won teammate of the year in Atlanta.  The point is, you can be well-liked by *some* people, in *some* places and still be a bad teammate and a negative presence in the locker room.  I will give credit to Dwight, once he went back to LA for the second time he seemed to accept his role as a support player and he hasn't been seen as a distraction for the past 2 years or so, but for most of his career that reputation was entirely deserved."
He‚Äôs still no Malik Monk that‚Äôs for sure /s
"This team can very clearly play good basketball with Westbrook. The biggest problem inflicting the Lakers is depth. We have about 4 players on the bench who are huge liabilities and can barely play any minutes, Avery Bradley isn't good defensively like he was two seasons ago, Malik Monk had a disastrous final minute and OT, Melo is Melo so that's not too bad but sometimes it can be. This bench needs improvement."
"He won‚Äôt get his shine, but Malik Monk is so important to this team. He might be the best bench scorer we‚Äôve had in years. I‚Äôm going to be really interested to see how he plays when Nunn comes back too"
"THT was 0-for-8, Carmelo was 3-for-14, Malik Monk was 5-for-14.... shut the fuck up lol"
He's better than Malik Monk and Caleb Martin so that's also why they have gotten better this year
JR Smith legacy lives on Malik Monk
Where was this Malik Monk when we played them wtf I hate how well he plays against just the Heat.
"‚ÄúMalik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, THT and Dwight Howard combined for 28 points tonight against the Knicks. Evan Fournier scored 26 points tonight against the Lakers.‚Äù"
I don't know. I think continually missing lay ups and Malik Monk air balling 2 good looks from 3 possibly played just a big a part as THT getting abused on defense. The Knicks really tried to give us this game and we just decided we didn't want it. AD was once again abysmal when it mattered most.
Watched the game at the exact moment malik monk airballed a 3 in the corner TWICE!
Malik Monk taking the same stepback three twice in a row gave me brain damage
Malik Monk wtf was that
Malik Monk the Lakers best player
Malik monk is talented
My guess is that it‚Äôs Malik Monk and he got his Hornets/ex-Hornets confused? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Miles Bridges since Miles is having a great season and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Mikal Bridges since at least Malik and Miles share the Hornets connection
"He seems to have done a great job of being hands off (well except for the time he was literally hands on with Malik Monk, which was perfect for the lols)."
"Let's hear any possible evidence for why Malik Monk is ""easily better"" than Cedi Osman."
They‚Äôre both average to above average starters. Way above ‚Äúreplacement-level‚Äù imo. Also malik monk is easily better than cedi osman
They're both replacement-level to slightly above replacement-level players.   Its like asking if Cedi Osman or Malik Monk is a better player.
"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
Pretty sure Malik Monk is worse
"Outside of the big 3, the only role players that would have any value on the trade market are THT, and *maybe* Malik Monk.  They would have to target older role players on bad teams out of playoff contention looking to sell. So maybe THT for Terrence Ross?  Or Daniel House + Nwaba from Houston to improve their defence? Josh Hart from the Pelicans?  I‚Äôm curious how Laker fans still value THT. I think his trade value was a lot higher one or two seasons ago."
Except Malik Monk
"5 team trade:  NYK Gets: Lebron  NOP Gets: AD, Westbrook  MIN Gets: THT, 1st round pick in 2028  CHI Gets: Carmelo, Malik Monk, and 1st round pick in 2030  LAL Gets: **Julius Randle, DAngelo Rusell, Brandon Ingram, Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball**"
Wish granted. Malik Monk is 17 and THT is 14 going on 15
Bro Malik Monk is a stud!
"Lucky for Lakers they got Malik Monk, a consistent three-point shooters, only against the Heat."
Who‚Äôs giving up anything the lakers would want for 3 months of Malik monk though
"You think it's bad now? Wait till Vogel gets fired and we promote literally one of the worst coaches in NBA history Fizdale to head coach. If we're not looking better by Christmas, this season is finished and at that point who knows what will happen because we have one more year of $45M Westbrook (he ain't turning down that player option), LeBron is a year older and Anthony Davis is locked in 3 more years. No cap space, no draft picks for a long while. This isn't even about Buddy Hield or Caruso or DeRozan. It's about turning over 12 of your 15 man roster and expecting them to just fit seamlessly. We'd still be this bad even if we had traded for Hield instead (especially given his own defensive stats). Our third best player right now is 37 year old Melo who just physically can't play more than 20 minutes a night every game. What was signing Malik Monk for if he is just going to air ball good looks for 3? We have 4 players on the roster that we simply cannot play whatsoever because they're an utter liability.  All we needed was a good point guard and a good center after last season. Instead they TNT the entire roster and think we're in the driver's seat again DESPITE LITERALLY GETTING NONE OF THE THINGS WE NEEDED."
Idk why we didn‚Äôt just get Malik Monk and Blake Griffen for the league minimum? Why didn‚Äôt we just do that? Guys why didn‚Äôt we? Certainly we could‚Äôve just done that.
Unfortunately it's Malik Monk
Malik monk for the heat. Both on the hornets and the lakers
"Kuzma was not seen as a top role player when he was on the Lakers, but now he's an important piece. Literally shot 29% last playoffs  Caruso will be greatly missed, and is an amazing player.  Also they added some good role players to help fill the void. Kendrick Nunn still hasn't played yet, Taken tucker is much better compared to 2 years ago, Malik Monk,  and Carmelo.   Also I wouldn't say lebron is unable to stay healthy q"
Malik monk only shows up against us smh
"Not the best, but the Hornets are pretty good:   PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Malik Monk  SF: Nic Batum   PF: Christian Wood  C: Dwight Howard  Bench of Devonte' Graham, Jeremy Lamb, Garrett Temple, Frank Kaminsky, and Cody Zeller. All in their primes, this is a solid squad."
terrible shot from Malik Monk. wtf was that lol
"Malik Monk has been healthy all year though, so we don‚Äôt know how they would react without him."
I‚Äôve seen him court side at games plenty of times.  Anyone remember when Malik Monk dodged his smack?
"Malik Monk  He‚Äôs built like Lou Will and Jamal Crawford, more athletic than the other 2 tho"
Malik Monk is a good example
"Malik ""Microwave"" Monk"
A Heat v Hornets ECF is a subconscious nightmare. Malik Monk is my sleep demon. I could see LaMelo and Monk turning into prime All-Stars and Hayward returning to his prime. Heat lose the series 4-2 in Miami fashion after winning the first two games. Rip.
The fact that this dude compared keldon to fucking Malik monk tells you everything you need to know lol
i know i‚Äôm a laker fan but i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs universally accepted around the league who people are referring to when they say THT given that this is the guy we refused to include in a Kyle Lowry trade and chose to resign over caruso‚Ä¶ I would get it if people started callin malik monk MM but THT has basically been referred to as such since he came into the league and started playing consistently
"there's gotta be a shooting coach savant somewhere on this coaching staff. Rozier going from the inefficient dude he was in Boston to the insane C&amp;S guy he's been in Charlotte is pretty incredible. Between Rozier, Miles, LaMelo, previously Devonte' Graham and Malik Monk, even McDaniels, Cody Martin... a lot of our team has improved their three-ball drastically after coming here."
"The thing is Dejounte projects to be a low level all-star at best and the rest role players while the players you mentioned may be stars. You need a young player who projects to be a star. I mean someone like Keldon, we just signed someone as good as him in Malik Monk for peanuts this past off-season. We didn't need to wait 4 years. Role players are replaceable and can be had, stars aren't, and you need stars. Tank!  Pop needs to move on and become governor of Texas. He can win."
Kendrick Nunn was starting for Miami the year they went to the finals and was right up there with Herro for most impactful rookie until he caught Covid‚Ä¶.  And Malik Monk was a spot starter in Charlotte.  You don‚Äôt watch basketball (1) or are too eager to get your Laker hate out (2) to be taken seriously after that.
"That is true! Vogel confirmed this too:  &gt; Frank says that it was THT returning and how good Malik Monk and Wayne Ellington are playing that knocked Kent Bazemore out of the rotation.  &gt; Frank told @jovanbuha that Kent Bazemore will still be ""a big part of what we do.""  https://twitter.com/hmfaigen/status/1460020165777637376"
#MALIK MONK OMG
"They‚Äôre 4-2 with Lebron.  Everyone knew going into the season that not making the playoffs was a real possibility if the big 3 couldn‚Äôt stay healthy.  I don‚Äôt think any of that has really changed.  No one really expected Melo to contribute as much as he has, and it is entirely possible that Malik Monk develops over the course of the season to the point as 3 point shooter capable of putting up 25+ if you don‚Äôt respect his abilities.    They obviously don‚Äôt seem like favorites, but it seems dumb to just write them off.  There‚Äôs a non-zero chance that they stay healthy for most of the rest of the regular season.  There‚Äôs a non-zero chance that if they actually get a steady healthy starting lineup, that Westbrook finds his way on a new team."
&gt;he won the game  NOW THIS is some mental gymnastics. Malik Monk is right there  Westbrook tied it with time for two more possessions for the heat.
I don‚Äôt see how two clutch buckets equals a good game. Especially with how he followed up those clutch buckets with a god awful overtime. Malik Monk carried the lakers to even get within 4 of Miami in the first place
Those two buckets (which even the announcers were baffled by) were clutch as fuck. But besides those two instances he destroyed the Lakers offense all of crunch time. Malik Monk is the only reason they won the game
Bradley made some 3s as well but yes; Heat Killer legend Malik Monk was at top form
Malik 'MJ' Monk happened.
"If it's a fight until submission I'm taking the Lakers.     Lebron has shown he's ruthless enough to do whatever it takes, Rondo has always been quick to fight, and I'm sure Malik Monk has been in at least one street fight.    Now if it's a fight to the death the Lakers are pretty old so then I'd take Miami. Jimmy Butler might be the only one willing to kill without a second thought."
"What, can‚Äôt get Malik monk to consistently shoot one million percent from three like he did against the heat"
That Malik monk stat that I saw posted in our sub‚Ä¶how he is versus us compared to the rest of the league.  Like god fucking damn‚Ä¶
Also we probably win if Malik monk plays like Malik monk and not Steph curry
"One in the first quarter on a switch (miss)  One on a broken play where Russ defended the initial action, went for the rebound, Minnesota got the offensive rebound and Malik Monk couldn't rotate in time (make)"
You can probably find him on /r/Lakers discussing whether they should trade rondo OR malik monk for Steph curry lol
"Malik ""FRESH SNOW"" Monk üòÇ"
"Hey, Malik Monk is the Heat killer, that's an unfair advantage"
Oubre was so lucky that he didn't get to experience what MJ did to Malik Monk a couple of years ago.
Or slapped on the back of the head like Malik Monk.
Malik monk him
Oubre bout to get the Malik Monk treatment
Malik Monk against the Miami Heat
"I‚Äôm just going to push back a little here.  He was not a good spot up shooter for us and his playmaking was below average.  It‚Äôs true we have no one that can defend like him, that he was a crowd favorite and that the Lakers were somewhat cheap.  But it was going to effectively cost a lot more than the 10M per year to keep him due to luxury tax reasons.    The Lakers replaced him (and KCP) with Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn - who together cost less in salary than what Caruso is getting.  They don‚Äôt have the defense but are both much better options on offense.  Time will tell to see if they really screwed up keeping THT instead."
Malik Monk fucking hates the heat
Ppl are gonna be shocked at how good Malik monk is. That's a $15-20 million player signed on a minimum deal. He's definitely capable of going for 20-30 every game
Malik Monk sends his regards

malik monk gonna get paid next season
Malik ‚ÄúVaya Con Dios‚Äù Monk
Can‚Äôt understand how someone so trash like Malik Monk can play that way against us. What a fraud.
Malik Monk was their best offensive player down the stretch.
RUSSELL FREAKIN WESTBROOK.   MALIK FREAKIN MONK.   Best win for the Lakers so far. Both teams played a hell of a game. Good game Miami.
is malik monk finished?
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."
"Does anyone have a pair of hands for sale? Asking for Bizmack Biyombo. His relationship with the dreaded gorgon Medusa in his early years has left him with hands of stone. Please send any information to Malik Monk, our team's secretary."
If Malik Monk doesn‚Äôt get minutes tonight then you know something is up and it has nothing to do with the players around him ‚Äúsolidifying‚Äù themselves in their roles.
You really think no one had the money nor the desire to sign Malik Monk to a better than minimum contract? New York  (and I believe at least one other team) offered Nunn more money than the Lakers. FOH. Gary Trent Jr will be worth the $18M. He's better than all those guys you listed including Monk and Nunn LMAO!
"Wait, Malik Monk of all people scared you? Lol"
"This is all literally in front of your eyes. It's not a conspiracy; Kendrick Nunn is worth more than 5/year. Malik Monk is worth more than a minimum. If you're saying other teams enjoy the same luxuries, then I'm asking where the free agents, without history with Milwaukee, signing on heavy discounts are? If your best argument revolves around a loved existing player taking a discount to stay, another player who literally *left the Bucks to play for the Lakers for less money*, and the free agency dominance of signing Marvin Williams, then you need to take a step back and consider that maybe the Los Angeles Lakers have advantages in attracting free agents that other teams do not, due to reasons beside the GM."
"After Monk plays the Celtics: ""Malik Mawnk, are we sure he's good?"""
"If you're a Kendrick Nunn or a Malik monk why the hell wouldn't you want a really good opportunity to become a world champion? If you ever get one, it's going to be on some other stars coattails so may as well do it on your own timeline rather than hope someone comes around to get you there."
"Bobby just signed for a deal because he came off the bench and had fans chanting his name, won a championship with the team, and reclaimed his reputation. If Kendrick Nunn or Malik Monk had that experience with the Lakers, people would get it.  &gt; you got Wes Matthews on a minimum two years ago  Oh shit, yeah, forgot about that. Didn't he leave the Bucks, though? Where'd he go again?  &gt; and you guys were at the front of the line in the buyout market for Marvin Williams  What a slam dunk. Bucks managed to sign 4/4/1, out of the league the year after, Marvin Williams. Truly, these franchises have enjoyed equal advantages on the free agency market.  &gt; But at the same time the Bucks don't have the brand of going all in the way the Lakers and Heat and some other teams do. You did when you thought you might lose Giannis, but now that he's locked up, what happened to bringing back PJ Tucker?  Yeah, the team based in Milwaukee valued at a third of the Lakers has been reluctant to accrue a 60-120 million luxury tax penalty; another mechanism that has benefitted ultra-wealthy teams that enjoy media dominance."
"he was unrestricted.   The irony of a man named Malik Monk taking the minimum salary to win a championhip.   Malik = Lord/King  Monk = Poverty, Chastity, Obedience  He is the ""King Monk"" and in my opinion his decision to forego millions will pay off in a championship. I think he was the missing piece and will deliver the clutch 3's the Lakers need"
"The Lakers have their 2027 or 2028 1st round picks they can offer (only one though, not both). The Kings will obviously try to get the most they can fo Buddy, but it's entirely possible they mainly just want cap relief. The Lakers also will have a couple cheap young players they can throw in, in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn to go along with Schroder on an expiring (if he does indeed re-sign a one year deal with the Lakers)."
"&gt;SG- Wayne Ellington, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker  that's definitely an all time great list of shooting guards"
'Whatever it takes to win' for the Lakers is a lot less than 'Whatever it takes to win' is for almost every other team. I don't know how you're not seeing that right now; pretty easy to do 'whatever it takes to win' when that entails signing Malik Monk to a vet minimum contract. What a horrible sacrifice.
Lebron was healthy during that 2020 run. But was hurt the year before when you missed the playoffs. Was hurt this whole year essentially. I think hes at the point where his body is catching up to him and if you deny that you're not being realistic.   And Malik Monk is not better than Mikal Bridges and if you think that you're high
"Hey Reddit warrior saying BS on a forum doesn‚Äôt make it correct. Lebron the most durable athlete, Injury prone? Lmao and this years roster  is amazing. Malik Monk would be your 4th best player"
"i mean different people are entitled to their opinions but me personally i loved the Russ pickup, u guys need scoring and playmaking outside of ur top 2 and picked up another all star level player. Russ has a lot of haters bc of his statistical success but i thought that was a huge addition for the lakers. the only reason he‚Äôs been not valued much w trades is because he‚Äôs paid an insane amount. If he was just a FA and could be more reasonable deal 30-35 mil maybe then he‚Äôd have a ton of suitors.  I‚Äôm also very high on kendrick nunn and malik monk and u guys added a ton of shooters.  Not everyone hates russ, his haters are just very vocal. He‚Äôs a star level addition. Lakers in 2020 third piece was kuzma u can‚Äôt compare that to russell westbrook"
Lol.. now u get scared if we get malik monk lol
Has ANYONE ever clowned Kendrick Nunn or Malik Monk for that?
Malik Monk it‚Äôs not that good‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so confused by these comments here

Getting Malik Monk on a minimum deal is crazy too lol. I thought he was gonna look for like $30 mil over 3 years or something.
"Nobody is killing Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn or not having a ring come on now lets be fucking real, that standard is only for super stars."
"Hold on! Malik Monk is on the Lakers? He ain‚Äôt great, but he does have the capacity to stand in the corner and wait for open looks."
Yeah Malik Monk and Nunn are old as fuck! /s
"Let‚Äôs be honest, Malik Monk is there to help the rest of team change their pw when they get locked out of their phones/tablets"
How can they afford both Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk?
Five-stat leader Malik Monk when all the old fellas knees turn to dust by game 50
Why does he care about Malik monk so much?
As a fellow Celtics fan and Malik Monk enthusiast I understand where he's coming from
You used literally the most extreme theoretical example possible and just assumed my opinion on it?   Is that scenario that'll never happen even worth talking about?   All I said was Malik Monk should be able to sign whatever contract he wants. Full stop.
"Malik ""Summer Analyst Intern"" Monk"
Malik monk forsure
Malik Monk
I don't understand the salt. Who did we sign that is changing things?   Is Carmelo 27 again? Is Dwight 26? Is Marc Gasol going to decide to show up before the playoffs this year? Carmelo Anthony is like 40.   Kendrick Nunn? Malik Monk? Kent Bazemore?   I'm confused.
Dwight Howard is getting paid $1M less than last year  Nunn going from a $1.6M minimum to $5M/year now  Bazemore getting paid the exact same   Malik Monk is the only one taking a noticeable pay cut here and he was still just getting an MLE
"Remind me, how many all star selections does Malik Monk have?    This is a far cry from every all star signing with the same team for the min. You can't just take an example to its absolute most extreme to try to make a point lol."
"How do the lakers have the cap space for all these moves?? so far it is Melo, Malik monk, THT, Nunn, and someone else I cant remember. It makes no sense, unless it is contracts close to a minumum."
"How do we feel about this two+ hours later and Lakers have added Melo, Malik Monk, and Kendrick Nunn?  Lakers could still retain Schroeder as well considering how much the market has cratered."
"Why not? You‚Äôre acting like Malik Monk is some star, the Hornets didn‚Äôt even extend a qualifying offer to him. Don‚Äôt get your panties in a bunch just because the Lakers are 100x a better FA destination than Philly"
"Who actually took a paycut? Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn could have been *restricted free agents*. Who was paying Bazemore, Dwight, Ellington, or Melo more than the minimum? If it was more than the minimum it wasn't going to be much more."
"I know I shouldn't feel like Malik Monk can still be a star, but for some reason I do.  Getting him for minimum could be a steal."
And Malik Monk
"You just need decent players when you have LeBron, AD &amp; Russ! Shit they got solid young talent now in the form of Malik Monk and Nunn who both signed for far less than they should have."
How is it fair that the Lakers get a bunch of vets nut-hugging LeBron to chase a ring but now they've gotten good young players in  Malik Monk &amp; Kendrick Nunn taking less money to ring-chase in LA as well? How does this not piss off most fans &amp; front offices in the league? They are stacking the friggin deck.
"Is Nunn, THT, Malik Monk, Melo really gonna make that much difference? At the end of the day it will depend on Lebron, AD, And Russ"
Isn't Malik Monk decent at guarding 1s?
Am i missing anyone?  lebron james  anthony davis  russell westbrook  talen horton tucker  kendrick nunn  malik monk  kent bazemore  carmelo anthony  trevor ariza  dwight howard  marc gasol  wayne ellington jr  alfonzo mckinnie (non-guaranteed)
You really think signing Malik Monk and Melo make the Lakers favorites? Lmao
so who is? Malik Monk? THT? lmao

I wanted Malik Monk since he seemed like a realistic target and like he could be solid in our system but he went ring chasing.
"Holy fuck, they have Malik Monk too?!?"
"Terrible take.   First off, Carmelo, Malik, and Gasol took 50% of their threes entirely uncontested last year. Compare with KD, Curry, Kyrie, and Harden who took 20% of their threes entirely uncontested.  Second off, single year 3 point % has a lot of variance; it's generally a much better predictor to use 2 or 3 years of attempts. Carmelo, Gasol, LeBron, and Monk are 39%, 38%, 35%, and 34% for the last 3 seasons, compared with 40%, 40%, 42%, 36% for the other guys who literally doubled their volume.  Considering how easy their shot selection is, Carmelo is probably the only above average shooter in that group, and maybe LeBron since his 3 pt shot selection is pretty difficult."
"Long game: Malik Monk leaves Michael Jordan to start his quest to ruin Jordan‚Äôs life for slapping him.   7 years later: Monk wins Lebron his last title in 2028 with a step back mid range jumper that leaves deangelo russel, bryon russells son splattered on the floor.   Lebron wins his 10th ring at the age of 43. he averages 21 8 and 12 on 28 minutes a game at point power forward. He ends his career with 51,000 points and nobody can remember who that Jordan guy was anymore.   Malik monk retires at 30 with 6 rings and changes his name to Malik Pope.   Jordan becomes the crying meme after getting slapped by Malik Pope  The circle of life"
Malik Monk is better than all 3 of those names you listed.
Malik Monk is at least bringing it down a little bit

23 year old Malik Monk being a bigger signing than 37 year old Melo is extremely obvious isn't it? Trying to say Malik Monk is a bigger signing than Westbrook though... that's stupidity.
Yup great signing. Malik Monk signing definitely tempers the blow.
"Trezz played 5,12,8 mins in games 4-6. Thats not far below his 22mpg.  It‚Äôs never pointless to sign someone if they can outperform their contract. Lakers just signed malik monk for the minimum so we shouldnt do that because of unforseaable playoff matchups?  Trezz had a good year idk why evryone dumps on him"
"Question to Charlotte fans:      Did Malik Monk really find his stroke this last season, or was him shooting 40% from 3pt range on 5 attempts per game a fluke?"
Malik Monk &amp; THT will ensure it‚Äôs def not the oldest of all time
"Dunno how lakers get solid shooting guards year after year. Green, KCP, wesley matthews, now malik monk."
"Acktyually, Malik Monk is 6‚Äô3 making him smaller than Melo."
Lakers new squad:  Russell Westbrook  Wayne Ellington  Carmelo Anthony  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  6th man: Malik Monk
I‚Äôd rather have malik monk over danny
"Malik Monk is going to be their microwave, and I can 100% support it"
"We just got Malik Monk which brings the age down, and if/when we sign THT it‚Äôll go down even further"
"Bro you just signed Malik Monk for a minimum, way worse than anything we did."
"Lakers weren't a ""superteam"" with LeBron &amp; AD last year imo. They now have Westbrook, another superstar player on the team, so they are definitely a superteam now. They just signed Malik Monk for cheap and a few NBA vet ring-chasers. Brooklyn would have EASILY gotten to the Finals if they didn't experience a bunch of injuries to their star players."
Malik Monk must bring their average age way down
"Judging by what you got Malik Monk for, the MLE could probably get you Kawhi."
Malik Monk is going to get a lot of open looks.
What the fuck is Malik Monk doing taking the minimum and playing with two usage monsters in Lebron and Westbrook lmao
Malik Monk signed for the minimum?
"i tried to link something but reddit wouldn‚Äôt let me, but if you search malik monk on r/TheWeeknd you‚Äôll get a lot of results   he wears merch a lot too and you can catch him listening to the weeknd on his story sometimes. too bad he went to my least favorite team but he‚Äôll be my favorite laker now"
Of course the Lakers manage to convince a 23 year old Malik Monk to sign for the min. SMFH
"Malik monk signed for the minimum? Yea, he‚Äôs 100% getting paid under the table this is BS"
"No? Man people be really forgetting what Lebron James is capable of. You guys have done a great job this off season. And this was before i saw Melo and Malik Monk added to the roster. If we get a Nets -Lakers finals, it will be a proper dog fight."
"If the Lakers can have Malik Monk on what appears to be a minimum, a just world will send the Bucks healthy and good Oladipo."
"Hey man if anyone knows it‚Äôs probably the guy with the Malik Monk username, so I‚Äôll take your word for it lol"
Over powered? If anything they're an old folks home and Malik Monk is the fresh out of college nurse taking care of them
Malik Monk is basically D Wade 2.0 and who needs CP3 when you have whoever the Lakers point guard is
LEunderthetable strikes again for malik monk!!  Side note: im a LeBron fan but these are funny
I think Malik Monk has something to say about that lol
He's like the owner of Malik Monk island
rather have malik monk than either of those guys. no idea how we pulled that off.
Did they use part of their MLE on him? Or did LA really get 23 year old Malik Monk on the minimum?
I love how all of a sudden Malik Monk is a superstar. Wasn‚Äôt nobody talking about him until he signed with the Lakers lol
Malik Monk too
"You know I'm something of a Malik Monk fan, myself"
because of Malik monk?
Malik Monk singlehandedly lowering the average age of the Lakers players by a few years.
hating the lakers is all /u/p0tatoman does.  And it aged poorly. Welcome Malik Monk!
LOL WE'LL TAKE MALIK MONK INSTEAD
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
You're gonna re-sign Malik Monk and you're gonna like it!!!
Malik Monk will be a top 4 player on the lakers roster
"Minnesota gets the 5 seed and makes it to the 2nd round, after trading a package of Beasley, Beverley, and several picks a month or so into the season for Ben Simmons.  Also Malik Monk wins MIP and signs a 4/80 contract next summer"
"Malik Monk could end up being the starting 2 for the Lakers, looked really nice"
"Malik Monk, Justice Winslow. I thought theyd both be really good."
The thing should be concerning for Lakers was hustle which was the same problem last year. Warriors were diving for loose balls and super active (even curry had a play in the first where he dove twice on a steal and Malik Monk didn‚Äôt jogged to it and lost it). I think once Russ settles in he can fix that though
"Okay let‚Äôs chillllll  At the end of the day it‚Äôs preseason. Based on the Lakers preseason games would you say Malik Monk is their best player?   DeRozen will get his and is still one of the hardest guys in the league to contest and guard  Vooch missing easy shot outs and jump shots, he‚Äôs been consistently doing that his whole career so I‚Äôm not worried about that"
Malik Monk has looked really good
A little disappointing the Malik Monk doesn't embrace the tonsure.
"The Lakers are starting DeAndre Jordan, LeBron James, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk and Russell Westbrook.  Should be fun."
Malik Monk  The one Charlotte let get away.üëÄ
Malik Monk. 3LONIUS MONK.
Is malik monk going to go for 82 against the hornets?
"&gt; the cesspool that is r/Lakers could do it better   Easy now, let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. I could see Malik Monk being on their list after these last 2 preseason games."
"I highlighted some of the names (like Brogdon) that can play with anyone, but there are guards who haven‚Äôt thrived yet that fit the bill. Malik Monk, for example. Others: Cam Thomas (BKN), Bryn Forbes, etc."
"Harry Giles, Jarred Vanderbilt, Miles Bridges, Wendell Carter Jr., Gary Trent Jr. and Malik Monk"
"I mean he'll be a restricted free agent anyways so we could just match whatever offer he gets. Considering his chemistry with Lamelo I think our FO would be silly to let him walk. We just let Malik Monk walk, I'd be shocked if we let two rfa's go for nothing two years in a row."
The Buddy &gt; Russ people were hilarious‚Ä¶ considering they got Malik Monk at the minimum too lol

"PSA: Malik Monk isn't much better than Dennis Schroder, if at all. Someone notify the Lakers TV guys of this information."
Malik Monk is about to go 75% from range
"I'm not flipping it at all. Malik Monk is a great shooter but he could barely crack 20 mpg in any of his 4 seasons with the Hornets. There's a difference between someone being a good shooter and someone that can be a valuable role player and be a good shooter. I don't think you can rely on the ""shooters"" on this team to play valuable minutes in game because the trade off is too big. They can't afford to be getting in to shootouts with other teams if they want LeBron and AD fresh at the end of the season."
"Unless they want to totally compromise their defense, they will be much worse shooting the ball. That championship team had role players that could defend and shoot at a decent clip. (Danny Green, KCP, Bradley, Morris).   Their shooters now are Malik Monk, Nunn, Melo, Ariza, and Wayne Ellington. Monk is a terrible defender, Nunn is bad, and the other 3 are either old as shit, terrible at defending or both."
"I get what you‚Äôre saying, but with the visibility that comes with playing on the Lakers next to Lebron it could result in an ‚Äúoverpay‚Äù contract in the coming season. And if we‚Äôre being honest Malik monk got suspended for doing blow last year and K Nunn has disappeared against the top opponents, so I‚Äôm not sure how big their other contract offers really were."
nah AD is on a max contract while Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn could easily get at least $5M/yr somewhere else but decided to take the vet min to join the Lakers
"Mostly bad, but that can be hard to differentiate from the fact that Charlotte's defense has been very bad in general since he has been there (22nd, 24th, and 18th in the league last 3 years).  But his offensive plusses are enough that even if the bad defense stuff is true, he was trending towards neutral last year, and poised to jump to a positive contributor this year, even if the defense continued to suck.  Or to say it another way, if the shooting stays above league average or even elite (40%) and Vogel can work his magic, Malik Monk should look very good for the Lakers.  I don't disagree with the Hornets letting him go though.  Rozier and Lamelo are both obviously better (assuming their goal is playoffs this year), and they drafted Bouknight for a longer-term Rozier replacement, so there just wasn't going to be playing time for Monk there."
"No, that's tickets to the finals with or without Malik monk.  There are other teams where a guy like him can make the difference whether they go to the advance deep into the playoffs or be at best a second round exit.  This is not a bet over his next contract, because he can do that with other contenders. This is a bet over a ring and building a brand."
"out of all the players the lakers got, it was Malik monk that really blew our minds"
Malik Monk looks like JR Smith at another resolution.
hey we have ring chasers in their 20's too like malik monk and kendrick nunn
Malik Monk was actually my dark horse pick to win ROTY. Of course that didn't happen but maybe being on a contending team can give him some shine and open up his game
"Isn't Malik Monk a big country boy that loves to hunt, fish, and ride ATVs?"
"He's been scoring about 15 points to go with that, on ~30 mpg. But even the scouting report says he isn't a true point guard.  https://www.nbascoutinglive.com/kendrick-nunn-scouting-report/  Lakers do need some balhandling skills behind LBJ/WB, (one shouldn't count on Rondo for this), but ""shooting guard"" Malik Monk has more apg in lesser minutes   So they may use THT and a by committee approach, but that doesn't fit the joke."
Do you actually think no other team offered Malik Monk more than a minimum contract?
Oh shit I forgot‚Ä¶ they got Malik Monk
"Also Malik Monk, while we‚Äôre on the subject of the Lakers"
Everyone overrating Malik Monk based on one pre-season game LOL
"What are you on about? Plenty of teams would give Malik Monk a look. He went to LA to play with LeBron on the most popular franchise in the league. You win a ring, and you get paid. It's not rocket science or superior scouting. The Lakers just have first dibs to a lot of a players who want to play in the spotlight."
Malik Monk is like a younger dion waiters
I‚Äôm gonna be more scared of Malik monk then the lakers big 3 when we play them dude always destroys us for no reason
reminder malik monk is 23 and is on a vet minimum contract lmao. what a steal for the lakers.
"The Lakers are 1 ) in Los Angeles , 2 ) title contenders and 3 ) had a lot of roster spots open for guys looking to prove themselves.   Thats why Kendrick Nunn and Malik monk signed there"
Malik Monk about to give half this sub some harsh blue balls
Ahead of Ben Simmons behind Malik Monk
I‚Äôm calling it. Malik Monk will be the Laker fans punching bag this season
"I think he has a fair amount of potential and I hope to see him succeed, as I am a UK fan.  Is that a Malik Monk flair?"
LaMarcus Aldridge and Cam Thomas are combining for 70 against Malik Monk and THT
"Melo isn‚Äôt their 4th best player. Malik Monk and Nunn are better, Bazemore is better and so is Dwight."
"I'd take Nunn, THT, Malik Monk, Dwight and Rondo over Carmelo"
"KD vs Malik Monk, Kyrie vs Kendrick Nunn, Harden vs THT. One for the books no doubt"
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
"I played against him all throughout jr high &amp; high school. This dude had the most laid back vibe but will absolutely destroy you on the court.   It‚Äôs crazy because he beat Malik Monk in the state finals in 2013, when both were freshman. He wasn‚Äôt even the best player on his team until his senior year, after he grew ~3 inches over the summer.   I‚Äôm still pissed Arkansas never even offered him a scholarship."
"Something laker fans aren‚Äôt taking into account is the possibility of Malik Monk bringing way more to the table than they expect. He‚Äôs the classic case of needing a fresh start to succeed, he was a bit of an idiot here in charlotte but that won‚Äôt be happening under LeBron and vets. His 3p% has steady improved every year (something it seems like the lakers have basically none of), his scoring ability is amazing but inconsistent. At a weak position for the lakers at SG I could see him taking up a lot of minutes throughout the year and could be a dark horse MIP award winner. Just has to stay consistent and keep improving. Charlotte fans know his potential is higher than most people assume"
"- LeBrOptimus 6th Prime James,  - Carmelo Anthony,  - Wayne Ellington,  - Kent Bazemore, - Trevor Ariza,  - Malik Monk,  - Talen Horton-Tucker,   Lakers wing depth those wondering."
"Melo, Loul Deng, and Malik Monk"
Malik Monk already had #1. He's gone now.
&gt; Kind of surprised Malik Monk isn't starting tbh  Monk's role on a good team is not dissimilar from somebody like Jordan Clarkson.
No shot AD can play the whole year as a center without getting injured. Not a knock on him but that's a really tough thing to ask from a guy with injury history and a thinner frame for a center  Kind of surprised Malik Monk isn't starting tbh
"dude just be yelling lmao.   MALIK MONK, 42 INCHES"
Lakers (guessing their starting 5)  Russell Westbrook (Rajon Rondo) Malik Monk (Lou Williams) LeBron James (Magic Johnson)  Anthony Davis (Kevin Garnett)  Dwight Howard (N/A)
malik monk &gt;
Now it‚Äôs Malik Monk.
Malik Monk
Malik Monk bless us
"subtract him from this team and we're at least 9-3  ignore my username, im not a novelty or stan account, malik monk and additional shooting support from bradley and ellington literally carried us to this win  westbrook playing garbage defense, charging the lane with no plan and handing it directly to heat players, and freezing davis out the entire 4th quarter and overtime really helped us so much though"
"If there's only one constant, it's Malik Monk killing the heat"
Malik Monk would have hit that tho
"Melo and Malik Monk, the Lakers dynamic duo we all expected."
"idk guys, I think Malik Monk is more valuable than Alex Caruso"
Malik Monk single handily won the lakers this after giving away their lead in the third. Huge shots to keep them in it. Lakers playing sloppy though. Adebayo and Herro are such great young players for the Heat. Fun game to watch.
Malik ‚ÄúLou Williams‚Äù Monk
excuse my english  where were you when Malik Monk killed the Heat?
"Why does Malik Monk hate Miami so much? Swear he cooks 'em every time.  Also, found Lebron dressed like Chairman Mao to be very distracting"
"Lakers caught multiple breaks good lord, but thank god for Russell TOOKOVERBROOK and Malik Monk"
Man Malik monk went OFF
Herro and Malik Monk though.
Malik Monk was an insane pick up for the Lakers
I don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore. Thank you refs and Malik Monk I guess
"Amazing game, clusterfuck of an OT besides Malik Monk"
Even on a new team Malik Monk is still a fucking heat killer LMAO
The only people who should be happy about this game are the 13 Malik Monk fans in the world
Malik Monk is winning the game for the Lakers tonight. Well played.
Odds Malik Monk earns a Caruso like contract after his tenure with the Lakers?
Malik Monk thinking he should be everything Herro is and more
I want an investigation by the league. How does Michael Jordan keep getting on the court wearing a Malik Monk jersey against the Heat? It‚Äôs fucking bullshit they keep letting it happen.
I see that Malik Monk still owns the Heat.
The real sixth man of the year Malik Monk
Malik Monk is saving the Lakers from Westbrook/AD shenanigans right now.
Malik monk going off against the heat is nothing new
Lakers are the luckiest team in the nba   Malik monk of all players can‚Äôt miss lmao
Malik Monk and Carmelo saving the Lakers season.
"Um, is Malik Monk actually good?"
Malik Monk is a god!!!
Malik fucking Monk
Malik Monk dicks Miami every fucking time
I hate Malik Monk.
I fucking hate when we play against Malik Monk man.
"Don‚Äôt be fooled, Malik Monk is better than MJ and Bron combined anytime he plays the heat"
Malik Monk hates the Heat
Ahh Malik Monk. Our kryptonite
Malik Monk shooting still scares me
I‚Äôm holding onto my ‚ÄúMalik Monk will be an all star one day‚Äù stock
"I don‚Äôt know what else to say other than I agree. Not even trying to sound like a Lakers hater. I firmly believe you‚Äôre still contenders if Bron and AD are healthy come playoff time. But you‚Äôre contenders in spite of Westbrook, not because of him. The other 2 are just that good.   It‚Äôs really baffling though. You have to think a franchise like the Lakers would invest heavily in guys who understand the concepts of efficient basketball. It just screams going for the big name over the better group of players. I know basketball is more than just stats but watching Westbrook play doesn‚Äôt help his case either.  Tbf this is clearly a declined version of him. He was a legitimately great player in his mvp season. But his decline came quickly.  I will say that Malik Monk was a good signing. Melo has been great too so props to him."
"That Lakers team ultimately goes as AD goes. It's easy to cherry pick on Russ right now, but if AD ain't playing like an all-star what do they really have in the front court?  Lebron took some bad L's when AD was out in previous years.   I'm still of the belief that either Malik Monk or Russ has to go. Too many possession guards who haven't worked on off-ball stuff."
"Malik Monk is good, there to play. The rest... seem like they on a retirement tour."

Malik Monk &amp; Austin Reaves can ride the bus. Everyone else gets to walk.
Malik Monk on a minimum is 10x more valuable than Westbrick lol.
Malik Monk &amp; Austin Reaves can ride the bus back ti the hotel. Everyone else has to walk.
Where is Malik monk?
"Which is surprising to me. Im not disagreeing with you, im sure LeGM had a say in this, but why would he not want Caruso back. He loved him on the court. He fit with our defensive philosophy better than bringing in a shorter Malik Monk. I guess he prioritized shooting and spacing this year rather than perimeter defense."
He doesn‚Äôt suck. He‚Äôs just average. In pretty much every way. Which isn‚Äôt that bad all things considered. On a team with superstars I prefer the guy who‚Äôs average at everything than the Malik Monk type dudes who take so much off the table on defense.
"Yes the roster construction isn‚Äôt that great I agree, but listen to what you said, 5 players combined for 19 shots and missed 17. Westbrook alone took 23 and missed 13. That is why he takes the brunt of the loss, or are we just admitting Kent bazemore, deandre Jordan, or Malik monk should‚Äôve had more opportunities. Or possibly not dribbling into a contested three for the game? I went through this and I‚Äôll tell you, Westbrook making shots in the early game is bittersweet, because then come fourth quarter‚Ä¶"
lol Laker fans were so hyped about malik monk after that spurs game
That all bench lineup was sorta wild to go to on a Thunder run. The best offensive player was Malik Monk.
Thoughts on Malik Monk so far?
"They went 16/42 from 3 compared to the Lakers 6/25. That, the defense still being a major work in progress, and the continued disappearance of Malik Monk are why this game was so close.  I *yearn* for the return of Ellington, THT, and Nunn"
"not salty at all that we lost, but the Lakers looked really bad. LeBron had to go all-out just to beat the Rockets starting 2 rookies, and who didn't really have a good night.  the fit for this ""big three"" is really off, can't be overstated how bad it is. none of them play good defense, none of them can shoot, the only area they excel is in transition, and the big men rarely run the floor to help Russ. otherwise it's just iso and hope for the best in the halfcourt, and it was almost always an easy 2 for us if we got going in transition.  i fully realize LeBron and AD have another gear for the playoffs, but defenses will pick up as well, and there's no outlets on this roster.  btw, Malik Monk late FTs? that's honestly embarrassing lol"
"1) Lakers are really slow, and kind of boring to watch   2) Malik monk, think he's pretty consistent offensively   3) Caruso hurts my soul I don't care how good Westbrook does (which he is playing better).   4) That one dude is decent (don't remember his name)  5) not new, and still the man."
Green is basically putting up the numbers of rookie Malik Monk given playing time.  I have a hard time thinking he is a top five rookie in the class so far.
What‚Äôs up with Malik monk? He looks terrible when he was in (there was a lot of hype around him before)
"Malik ""Unlimited Range"" Monk since declaring unlimited range, 1-9 from 3"
Malik Monk really just looked of Melo and Bron for that shot lmao
Malik Monk
"Unable to watch game rn, but Malik Monk is -11 with only 4 minutes of time. What happened?"
Malik Monk has baby hands
The Malik Monk vs Heat numbers
Pls no I have only just been able to have peaceful nights again knowing Malik Monk doesn‚Äôt play for the hornets
Malik monk is still with us in spirit
"Their 3- point shooting is completely unsustainable this season. Avery Bradley is not a career 56% 3-point shooter (he's at 36%), LeBron is not a career 48% 3-point shooter (he's at 34-35%) Rondo is not a career 44% 3-point shooter (32.3%) , Carmelo is not a career 43% 3-point shooter (35%) neither is Kent bazemore (35-36%), and Malik monk who's shooting 38% is still outperforming his career 34% significantly."
"If you look at exclusively Melo, Bazemore, Malik Monk, and Avery Bradley they‚Äôre shooting a higher percentage then any year the Lebron has been here. Even taking their shooting averages from last season, it‚Äôs still higher than the last two seasons."
Malik Monk can‚Äôt hurt us in Charlotte anymore but I have faith others will rise.
"The most asinine part of it for me is that it's not like anyone needs help figuring out what kind of players to put around LeBron at this point; the formula of shooters + LeBron has been established for over a decade.  Instead the Lakers are relying on Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, and when healthy Wayne Ellington, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor ariza to space the floor because they brought in two non-shooting guards in Russ and Rondo."
"Kings sign Malik Monk.  Kings trade for Bam Adebayo.  Kings trade for Hamidou Diallo.  Bring in Wenyen Gabriel and Isaiah Briscoe.    Fire Walton, hire Calipari."
"I think Malik will get all or most of the full mle from some team, and I kinda have a feeling my Rockets might be the one to offer it to him. I don't love the idea, because we have so many guards already, but the word is that we are looking for a shooter, and my guess is the front office would rather use the MLE to invest in a younger player like Monk who might end up outperforming their contract and becoming an asset, rather than a veteran."
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"

"They weren't going to stick LBJ w/ a ballhandler of Wright's stature. Westbrook is far from ideal, but he definitely takes a ton of pressure off Lebron, which at his age, he needs. Lakers are in salary hell anyways, if they somehow pull off some combination of Patty Mills, Otto Porter Jr, rudy gay Malik Monk, etc, this could work well, but right now I would bet this is going to be a mess. Lakers shouldve trusted what they had was enough w/ minor tweaks, injuries contributed more to their downfall than anything (w/ shooting probably 2nd &amp; they sure haven't addressed that yet)."
"If Mavs want to go aggressive this FA, they could have gone after Fournier (will probably wait it out) or Norman Powell (needs some convincing to leaver the Blazers), or they could've gone for younger guys (and probably cheaper but can still be developed) like Gary Trent Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, or Malik Monk. But Mavs wants to play it safe I guess because once bitten, twice shy. They played the waiting game too many times in the past and got nothing from it."
Surely they try for Malik Monk
"Malik Monk to the Celtics, John Collins to the Spurs, Melo to the Suns."
"Lowry and Derozan to the Knicks Gay, Melo, Dwight to the Lakers Graham to Pelicans Ball to Bulls Malik Monk to Suns Batum to Warriors"
"Ok, I could see that. I think the Hornets might be willing to do just Coby instead, since that‚Äôs give them cap space to target other guys. Thad + Sato doesn‚Äôt make any sense for them.   They‚Äôre letting Malik Monk go, so they‚Äôre going to need some kind of backup PG/combo guard coming back if they give up Graham. Otherwise they‚Äôd just match any offer for Devonte‚Äô.   Maybe the Pelicans would take Graham, Sato, and Thad and the Hornets could get NAW? I don‚Äôt know how much they value him."
Malik Monk is a good bet to outplay his upcoming contract.
Idk why we'd sign-and-trade Devonte unless we got an absurd offer. We just let Malik Monk walk and Terry is an expiring.
"Miami's got their BAE and their non tax MLE. I'd assume they'll be looking at Danny Green, Malik Monk, Nic Batum, Oladipo, etc."
"Bobby Portis. If not, Malik Monk"
if hes too much i think we'll go for Malik Monk. the orginal trade in march was Norm for Monk but the deal fell through when Lamelo got injured
S&amp;T for Lowry.  Full MLE to Portis or Malik Monk.  Re-sign Duncan Robinson and operate in the luxury tax.
I‚Äôll take 1 Malik Monk please
"Tae is better though. Monk and the FO clearly don‚Äôt get along and even though Monk has shown potential, he hasn‚Äôt had a productive season in the 4 years he‚Äôs been with the team. It‚Äôs better to keep Tae, who clearly loves the city and has been a great player, than Malik who is a bad locker room presence that hasn‚Äôt shown that he can actually be consistent.   It‚Äôs definitely not a ‚Äústupid franchise‚Äù move to let him go to make way for Bouknight, who looks great, and not have a 5 guard lineup. It would‚Äôve been nice to have traded him during the season, but with all the injuries I don‚Äôt think that was possible.  I like Malik and I hope he does well, but his time here in Charlotte has come to an end."
Malik Monk agrees
I can't explain it but Malik Monk just looks like a Miami Heat to me
my one wish would've been to bring back Malik Monk smh
"&gt;already having 1 player makes us better than most teams  Yeah I totally agree, I guess I kind of misinterpreted the point that OP was trying to make. Trae is the distinguishing factor, watching the Hawks' playoff run made that pretty clear. You can't consider your young core on par with theirs until you have a superstar at that level.  That being said, I think the rest of the young talent on the Hornets is at least comparable to the Hawks. Miles Bridges/PJ Washington are similar tier prospects to DeAndre Hunter/Cam Reddish, John Collins is a tier above right now but tbh I have faith that Miles can reach that level of production next season. Possible we lose one of them this summer but Devonte Graham/Malik Monk is a similar level to Kevin Huerter. We're kind of just banking on LaMelo having Trae Young-type progression through his 2nd/3rd season to try and be as competitive as they were but obviously there's no guarantee in that happening."
"Jordan Poole, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Malik Monk, hopefully Wiseman, Killian Hayes"
"Very hot take, I like Malik Monk over Graham on Charlotte going forward."
"I think Malik Monk will be a 6moty type guy, maybe even a low level all star. Probably not on Charlotte though since they‚Äôre kind of logjammed at guard."
I'm most curious to see Charlotte's plan with Malik Monk
"Fr people are blown away that plug and play guy was plug and play. He's 25, Rui and De'Andre Hunter are 23, and everyone else from that lottery is 21 or 22. For context, the last four 11th picks before Cam were Myles Turner, Shai, Malik Monk, and Sabonis. They're all younger than Cam."
Malik Monk is absolutely not his floor.
"no way is that his average outcome, Malik Monk is a lot more likely."
"Those aren't really any better or worse than Malik Monk....I'm not which direction are trying to correct the dude in.  Malik's best season:  11/2/2  Brooks best season:  12/3/3   Jordan Crawford best season:  15/3/3  Monk had slightly better efficiency his best year, but I'm not really sure what point you were trying to make here."
At best: bouncy CJ or Dame   Average: Probably Clarkson  At worst: Malik Monk in Charlotte
"He is an athlete in general, which is valuable. Not every player has the ability to jump, be explosive, fast, have shake, etc. He has all of it. Maybe he doesn't jump out of the room and isn't a blur, but he is a complete athlete. He has a little bit of a handle and creates a lot of separation off the bounce. If he can just hit those difficult shots he will be a long-time player. He has the potential to be a good scorer. You also have to remember he's still SUPER young and will develop all-around. Someone who is inconsistent at 18,19, 20 will grow and learn how to be consistent. Not everyone does (like Malik Monk or Andrew Wiggins), but if they have the right mentality and work ethic they should be able to figure it out over time."
"Borrego really likes Garaham while simultaneously not putting much faith in Malik Monk (who I like a lot and would love to keep tbh). So, I think we'll end up hanging on to him and maybe getting rid of Monk, but with drafting Bouknight I would say Terry is 100% gone by the deadline. We can't afford to bring him back so we need to get those assets while the getting is good."
As much of a steal as Malik Monk was on his draft day.
Time for the Raps to scoop Malik Monk üôè
the Malik Monk replacement
I'm getting flashbacks to Donovan Mitchell or Malik Monk and I don't like how it ended up last time
"LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, Mason Plumlee.   Jason Preston, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, PJ Washington, Kai Jones."
"They likely can only fill out the roster with veteran minimum contracts, G leaguers, and the tax payer MLE. That means players have to take a pay cut or get marginal players at best.   Bryn Forbes, Torrey Craig, McDermott, McConell, Bullock, Malik Monk, and Wes Mathews are examples.  It would likely be a thin roster at best when it comes to shooting.  I think the Buddy Hield play makes more sense if the Lakers keep KCP and their pick."
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"Zeke Nnaji, and PJ obviously  Other teams - Patrick Williams, Malik Monk, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane"
Pretty bad take. Malik Monk is 6‚Äô2 while Moody is 6‚Äô7 and known as a good defender. Also plenty  of shooting guards aren‚Äôt know for driving. Klay?
Moses Moody reminds me of a lite Malik Monk coming out of college. He doesn't excel at driving to the lane. How many top SG's can you name who aren't good at driving/finishing in the lane. We already have Grayson Allen who can play that role for cheap
"Nothing, it's just LA so everything is amplified. It's basically like all the dumb homer shit you see on your own subs, except you have national media members unironically saying this shit. I'm not saying THT is shit but if he was on Charlotte or SAS, barely anyone would know who he is unless some national writer like Zach Lowe nerds out about them and memes about it like he did with Khem Birch, Malik Monk etc."
So is Malik Monk officially out then?
"Nah, I would flip the 9th and Buddy for Turner and Bagley for Malik Monk if I were Sacramento"
Yea and Malik Monk turns into prime Kobe against us
