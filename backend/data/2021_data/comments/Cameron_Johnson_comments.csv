"Cameron Payne, Cam Johnson."
"I think he’s fine. A lot of scoring on that team is down by a fairly significant amount, including from Booker and Paul, while Bridges and Cameron Johnson have seen a big uptick. They’re keeping the scoring balanced throughout the team and generally winning games."
This is a great read:  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-film-breakdown-phoenix-suns-chris-paul-devin-booker-mikal-bridges-deandre-ayton-cam-payne-cameron-johnson-contender-western-conference-nekias-duncan
Not as good as the Cameron duo of Johnson and Payne
DeAndre Ayton Mikal Bridges and picks is one ex. Maybe even Cameron Johnson. And this wouldn’t even work because it’s not matching salaries
"Oubre was a part of some of our best lineups (which also happened to be some of the best lineups in the league).  It was not addition by subtraction.  What happened in the bubble was Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson both expanded their games and filled the offensive void that was left when Oubre was injured.  Also, Cameron Payne was brought in and immediately added an offensive threat at PG that could distribute and play aggressive defense.  Add Dario Saric coming in to form and basically being a walking double/double off the bench and it all just kind of came together.  No, Oubre was fine for us.  He wasn't perfect, but he was a plus player on the court."
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
They have a solid team at this point. They got ayton bridges cameron johnson who will be a great shooter when he develops a bit more crowder who can play defense but as of this season i dont see them making it past the first round 🤷🏻‍♂️
"They have had like 10 different starting lineups this season rotating Crowder, Cameron Johnson, Frank, Booker , when he was injured, in and out. That's probably one of the reasons."
Obviously not the best metric.    Sabonis is 212th.  Nicolas Batum is 20th.    Keldon Johnson (who has been great for SA) is 231ist.  Mike Muscala is tied with Dejounte Murray.  Sexton and Siakam are 80 spots behind Cameron Johnson.  Etc.

"I feel like for Mitch McGary he had potential but he literally just failed drug tests constantly. Dakari Johnson might have been good when small lineups weren't a thing but he was basically useless in the time he was drafted.   Cameron Payne has had a nice enough career to at least be on a roster. The rest like Aldrich, Jones, Ferguson, Abrines and Huestis are all busts but you're asking for that with low draft picks. In my eyes at least Ferguson was a good enough replacement while Roberson was hurt and before Dort got there."
"Presti also picked Jeff Green, Cole Aldrich, Perry Jones, Mitch McGarry, Cameron Payne, Josh Huestis, Alex Abrines, Terrance Ferguson and Dakari Johnson.  So, there's that."
Cameron Johnson is building a house this afternoon
"Kyle Kuzma over Hart, Cameron Johnson, Crowder, Portis..lol"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"DeAndre Hunter, PJ Washington, Lonnie Walker, DeAnthony Melton, Cameron Johnson"
Agreed. I think that’s one of the main reasons why Jalen Johnson the forward that was at Duke left early (besides the team being ass). He didn’t get to play in front of the Cameron Crazies which I’m sure was one of the reasons why he even committed there.
Cameron Johnson
J is being slept on heavy here. Take out Josh Jackson and put in Cameron Johnson.  Also would have Dort instead of Dante for D.  For L take out Love and add Lowry. Make Leonard PF.
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
They are all so long. Good perimeter defense and shooting. Cameron Johnson can go 0/7 from 3 and then shoot 4/4. That’s fucking scary. Everyone on the Suns trust each other so much.
"It’s actually disgusting how good Suns role players are, Cameron Payne, Cameron Johnson, Mikel Bridges are all incredible."
"NGL, JVG is spitting facts about James Jones and Suns’ recent draft success   Idk about people underrating Bridges, but I definitely questioned them drafting Jalen Smith and Cameron Johnson"
Tim Duncan &amp; Cameron Johnson
"The Suns have some underrated role players man. Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne. All long boys with insane shooting."

I really really like Cameron Johnson actually.  Can Suns fans give me the scoop on him? I really only watched him this series (and a bit vs. The Lakers)
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
"Bro Cameron Payne just schooled the Lakers, and Johnson is great off the bench."
"I mean at the time it wasn't out of the ordinary, but I could very easily name 20 players from that class that I would rather have. It doesn't help that the three players picked after him were Cameron Johnson, P.J. Washington, and Tyler Herro. Pretty good crop. Cam has dealt with injury though, and has shown flashes through his career. It could completely turn around for him if he became more consistent on offense."
Cameron Johnson  ❌  Frank Kaminsky ❌  Cameron Payne ❌  Dario Saric ❌  Torrey Craig ❌  Jevon Carter ❌  After those guys I'll consider Kuzma
The Cameron Johnson one was not soft.

People talking about the 17-0 free-throws like its black and white. It's not about the numbers but it sure tells a lot. Lakers are driving more but if you watch the game you can see lebron and AD getting FTs for getting touched while lebron literally wrapped up Cameron Johnson at the end of the half and they swallowed their whistles.
it looks like he hit Cameron Johnson when come down
"Nah, I think it was teammate Cameron Johnson."

"Conversely, Cameron Johnson... Suns are -0.12 with and +11.01 without, minus ""low leverage"" possessions... despite being an absolute monster (19/32) in the corner 3 department.  Sometimes, these stats are just weird and don't carry a clear correlation."
\&gt;Giannis got to shoot free throws for knocking over defenders  lmao there's literally a clip from last night's game of cameron johnson doing this exact thing to pj tucker that is on the front page of r/nba right now.  awfully convenient not to mention that while you're whining about giannis
"It was very dumb. He’s the same person that talks about how important HFA is. And with Bucks having only 1 home field loss this entire post season, he doesn’t care to think that played a huge turn in their victory. And consistently talks about how the NFL refs are better than the NBA ones. It’s annoying.   And ever since he found out Cameron Johnson is getting his Masters degree, he’s become the next Michael Jordan in my dad’s eyes."

"Yeah, his teammate cameron johnson"
"It's *either* before contact is made, *or* before the offensive player starts his upward shooting motion - in this case, Cameron Johnson had started his upward shooting motion before PJ established his position. The rulebook defines what a field goal attempt is in a bit more detail but the relevant part is this:  &gt; On drives to the basket or other moving shots, the shooting motion starts when the player gathers the ball and continues through with a shot  Cameron Johnson is already leaving the ground and bringing the ball to the rim before PJ establishes his position."
Nah it was just a JVG thing where he said refs should be able to talk back when players complain for calls. No disrespect to Cameron Johnson.

"cameron ""get the fuck out of my way"" johnson"
Cameron put his Johnson on Tucker's head
Connaughton went to double team Chris Paul (he should not have) so Cameron Johnson got a free run up the court on a long pass
CAMERON FUCKING JOHNSON     now finish that thesis
"Oh mama, there goes that Cameron Johnson!"
HOLY FUCKING SHIT CAMERON JOHNSON YAMMED IT
"Cameron ""Worst pick in the draft"" Johnson just going straight for the glory. Overturned or not, this is exactly what you want to see."
Cameron Johnson     And Kelly Oubre 😏
"The Suns will:  CP3 either, decline his PO and sign him to a 3 year deal, or accept his PO and sign him to a much smaller 2 year extension. That'll be the end for CP3.  Booker is already signed on for 3 years, no sign he wouldn't further extend.  Ayton has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 35 Mil per year.  Crowder has 2 more years left, on a MLE deal. I would expect a much smaller pay packet to extend him further than that for another 3 years with bird rights, that gets him to 36 years old. So 5 years total.  Saric, has 2 years on his deal... but this is a real unknown, he's now out next season as backup centre. He is also going to be coming back from major injury so I'll hold off on any further contracts. Suns have applied for a disabled player exception for next season, 4.5mil. I would expect to see the Suns sign JaVale McGee to fill that spot. The one thing the Suns lacked was that one extra ""BIG"".  Bridges has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 20 Mil per year.  Jalen Smith has 3 years left on his rookie deal, I would expect him to hang around for the duration of that as the 3rd string centre. Depending how he develops will decide whether he stays longer.  Cameron Johnson has 2 years left on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 year 15 Mil per year.  Jevon Carter has 2 years left on an early bird, currently not getting time as a 3rd string, maybe that'll Change next year.  Now the unknowns, I see the Suns chucking Payne a 3 year 15mil total deal. Other teams will offer more, but the Suns will be reigning Champions... so what will he decide...  Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, Craig and Nader will probably get some 1 year minimums.  Ty-Shon will get another 2 way deal next year.  I don't know what the Suns will do with their only draft pick. But it'll be pretty tradeable.   The Suns will basically have the same team for 3 years, maybe changing a couple 3rd string guys adding one more centre like JaVale. Then for the next 3 years still have a core of Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Johnson, Crowder, with unknowns being Starting PG, and some backups."
"Giannis was doing everything he could to keep them in it. Bledsoe tried, but Middleton was bad tonight. Lot of rushed jumpers and in-transition heat checks.  Suns on the other hand were all in sync. Ayton and Paul were a bit off, Bridges and Crowder made up for it. Cameron Johnson reminds of a young Danny Green, he has been pretty handy to have off the bench. Bridges is having a great coming out-party in this role. He plays so well as that 3rd option.  Bucks gotta be less content to settle for bad shots. Middleton especially. Onto Game 3"
"See my other post about correlation to victory. It doesn't ""work"" as well as LMR+C3. Which for the Suns means that Cameron Johnson (and even Mikal Bridges) has actually been the more valuable player in terms of keeping offensive structrual integrity."
"&gt;Kaminsky   Nope. Just more minutes to Torrey Craig, Cam Johnson and Cameron Payne which the Suns are fine with. They adjusted on the fly in Game 1 and it was pretty seamless."
Can I have one Cameron Johnson please
"Man I seriously love Cameron Johnson, smart player"
wtf cameron johnson is not doing a masters right now.... he already has one... ain't know way you can be an nba player and still be grad school  https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2019/12/31/nba-phoenix-suns-cameron-johnson-ncaa-nbl-g-league/
"Cameron Johnson needs more minutes, he is always a positive presence out there"
"By a total of two points split across both games. I'm not someone saying it's a Bucks win, but those regular season games aren't much to base the playoffs on - decided by a single point each time, one off the back of contentious FTs with 1 second to go, while nightmare man Mikal Bridges went 8-10 from 3 and Cameron fkin Johnson had 6 3's."
"Gobert has his faults but his talents are wasted because the Jazz perimeter defenders were ass and couldn’t stop people from getting into the paint for free.   I love Gobert slander but the dude was let down by his team against the Clippers.   There’s a reason why Ayton didn’t look like shit vs the Clippers and it’s because Mikal, Jae, Cameron Johnson and Torrey Craig could actually stay in front of their man."
"Someone already commented it but the Suns wings have also been better on offense, and I think defense is a bit of a wash. Much of that for sure is the offense is completely different.   I also don't know how in a post about Aytons playoff performance you try to wash that away by talking about Capelas regular season performance.   Harden is the big difference maker talent wise here, as Paul is Paul, just different versions of the same player.   Anyway bbref links below. You have to scroll a bit for playoff series numbers. If there is a way to hyperlink to that section I don't know it.   Tucker - https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tuckepj01.html  Ariza - https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/arizatr01.html  Crowder - https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/crowdja01.html  Bridges - https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bridgmi01.html  Bonus -  2018 Conference Finals - https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-western-conference-finals-warriors-vs-rockets.html  2021 Conference Finals - https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2021-nba-western-conference-finals-clippers-vs-suns.html  Tucker and Arizas defensive rating is about the same as Bridges and Crowder but Bridges has a significantly better offensive rating.  If you toss in Cameron Johnson it's not remotely close from the wing position"
Might as well top the list with Cameron Johnson with that logic.
"I wish the Suns could unleash Cameron Johnson on these fools tonight. Cam would be up in there shooting the rock from 40 feet out fuckin draining wet buckets in Staples. Dude ain’t no fuckin pull up from the elbow ass ho, Cam will straight up drain a 3 in your face fuck yo bitch and write a dope rap about it"

Question for suns fans/anyone who’s watched the suns a lot this year: why doesn’t Cameron Johnson start? Is it an overall or specific skill thing? Seems like he’d be a perfect modern PF
Cameron Johnson stock going up during this Suns playoff run
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
SAS called Cameron Johnson “Cam Jordan” this morning lol
Didn't Cameron Johnson appear in High School Musical?
"After our 19 win season a couple years ago, we had the second best odds, fell to 6, then traded 6 for Dario and pick 11 where we reached on Cameron Johnson. I never felt so deflated in my life with this team. Obviously shit has worked out and Cam is awesome, but after watching that shit show of a season and only coming away with an alright player and a guy most mocks had going in the mid 20s, was not a fun time.  Good luck in the lottery though!"
Suns still had bad 3pt defense the last 5 or so minutes.  I'm a huge Ayton fan but he made a couple of Gobert like lapses by sagging off spot up shooters.... And Cameron Johnson falling for a drive attempt where he had backup help to surrender a step back 3pt... Which is an easier shot today.
I love Ayton and like Cameron Johnson... But them sagging off shooters was very bad mistakes... Because that was the trap and they fell for it.  Clippers are so confident on taking 3s off catches off drives that I cannot believe they allowed option 1 to occur.  If Paul George or Jackson nail contested layups or inside jump shots... So be it. Let them exert energy trying to get shots up... But falling for baits was sad...
I fucking hate the baby face that Cameron Johnson has. He makes me feel so old and awful
Cameron Johnson and Craig have really stepped up. Ready for every secondary action pass.
"With this team? What? People still sleeping on the Suns lol. Knocked out Lebron and swept the MVP. ""With this team"". Lol. Ayton, Booker, Bridges, Jae, Torrey, Payne, Dario and Cameron Johnson are better than your team."
Wasn't Cameron Johnson considered a reach for the Suns? It's no guarantee they would have drafted him. Also it's very likely that anybody they picked at that spot would have developed worse under Ryan Saunders compared to Monty Williams.  I agree that it was a bad trade/pick but can't assume it would have worked out if we just reversed the deal
"&gt;Cameron Johnson or Dario Saric could’ve helped the Timberwolves problem at the 4 this season   Dario was desperate to get out of Minnesota, he had a terrible attitude since day 1. And he's a shit defender when forced to play the PF."

"Ayton and Bridges are entering their 4th year, they aren't likely to suddenly get worse. If anything they are likely to continue growing along with Cameron Johnson."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"I was comparing Saddiq to his contemporaries not trying to criticize him.  I was thinking of players versatility like Kelly Oubre, Michael Porter Jr, Jason  Tatum. Jaylen Brown, Cameron Johnson,  Kawhi Leonard,  Paul George,  John Collins etc."

"DeAnthony Melton, Thad Young(he's probably too good for this title), Cameron Johnson, Jaden McDaniels, Reggie Bullock"
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
"Tobias shares the same areas of the court as Embiid, stops the ball consistently, and doesn't provide nearly enough spacing for the team as currently constructed.    He is a talented player who developed his defense into a net neutral this year, but I think looking at his box score numbers fools people into thinking he is a good second or third option for this team, when they'd really be better off with a Cameron Johnson type."
Bro how you you rate Cameron Payne if he was magic Johnson?
Thon maker didn't work. Cameron Johnson is playing very well. These are the biggest reaches that come to my mind in the previous years.
Not gonna judge simply due to Cameron Johnson
"Lowry would have been a better fit they traded all their depth, look how Important Cameron Johnson and Bryn Forbs or Cade was in playoffs you need depth to win"
1. Jalen Green 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Cade Cunningham 4. Alperen Sengun  5. Sharife Cooper 6. James Bouknight 7. Corey Kispert 8. Evan Mobley 9. Keon Johnson 10. Cameron Thomas  Not my top 10 big board. Just going based off how previous drafts have shaken up.
As someone whose fanbase had this same concerns when our GM decided to draft Cameron Johnson and then seeing him make crucial shots throughout our run age shouldn't be a concern
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6. James Bouknight (Oklahoma City Thunder)  7. Jonathan Kuminga (Golden State Warriors) 8. Moses Moody (Orlando Magic) 9. Franz Wagner (Sacramento Kings)  10. Josh Giddey (Memphis Grizzlies)  11.

"But their role players did step up. Cameron Payne and Cam Johnson played great, it’s a shame Cameron Payne didn’t get played more. Granted Jae crowder did go ice cold in some games, but pat connaughton was as well, so suns legitamelly had chances to put all 3 of those games to bed. DeAndre Ayton did have some poor games but he’s playing against a former all star and a back to back league mvp and a Greek demigod"
"The difference is that Suns already had Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, and more importantly - they have shown to the management that they are capable of winning before going all in with CP3 and Crowder. Suns were good enough to be 5/6th in the West with Rubio, but it was CP3 who pushed them into contender status.  In Pelican's case, they have a core of two players who still have to learn to play together and show they can win. Adding a 35-year-old Lowry makes them barely a playoff team with no much room to grow. By year 3, Lowry will be 38 and they'll find themselves without young prospects and not enough meat to make some serious noise.  EDIT: they did get  Valanciunas, and that is a huge plus."
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
I’m pretty sure the suns weren’t outrebounded because of CP3 and book but rather because their starting pf is 6’6” (Jae) and the backup center was 6’7” Torrey Craig’s or Cameron Johnson (6’8” but not that strong). It would have even been better if we had Dario saric and he really is a small ball 5 at 6’10”
If even Cameron Johnson isn’t hitting it’s just not happening tonight
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
Cameron Johnson
Would bank on Cameron Johnson to fill some of Bridges offence. Ben picks up the defensive gap. Booker gets a bit more of the ball handling duties. Reduce the risk of CP3s inevitable regression.
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
"Booker averages 30p and 7a, on 50/40/90 shooting on the best team in the West and is right up in MVP voting.  Ayton averages 20p and 14a on the highest efg% in the league while contending DPOY voting.   Yet... it won't even be either of these guys.  Mikal ""The Warden"" Bridges AND Cameron Johnson will both be 25 and 26 next year, and will only improve from what was a great year for both to become the absolute ""Glue guys"" holding together the defence while shooting over 40% from 3. Propelling the Suns to a comfortable 1st seed.   Mikal will be offered Max level contracts when he enters RFA and Cam will be considered the steal of his draft.  They will both become household names. Mikal will literally be the most desired player in the 2022 off-season if he isn't signed to an extension this season."
"Decades apart, Kevin Garnett took the floor against both Magic Johnson and Cameron Payne. He [scored 11](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/kevin_garnett_vs_magic_johnson.htm) against Magic and [0 against Cam Payne](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201601120MIN.html)."
Cameron Johnson. He just has a punchable face
He was guarding the cherry pick since Cameron Johnson was staying back
Cameron Johnson acts like he just got murdered every time he is touched
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
One good pick out of his last 14 prior to this year's draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis
"I think they can do a lot better, even in that scenario, than trading for 2 years of Vucevic, coby white, and a Portland non-lottery first, which is the only pick the Bulls can trade because all their first rounders after 2022 are subject to being traded.   Coby does nothing for them, they don't need him with Cam Johnson, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Cameron Payne on the team already. His role will be very small. Vuc is in no way valuable enough to make that trade work."
"Dude it’s the opposite. Being on the lakers is what makes them overrated. Kuzma has been talked about more than say Darius Garland the last couple of years even though Garland has star potential. People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   With Kuzma specifically once the Lakers got AD, he became so hyper criticized and got so much shit, everyone now acts like he’s garbage. He received too much attention in both directions because of the Lakers.  The exact same thing will likely happen with Talen Horton Tucker. He is currently in the super overrated stage. Here’s a Twitter account with a million followers saying “hot take that isn’t that hot THT will be a superstar one day.” He also is put in the top 10 in bleacher report’s 2019 re-draft ahead of guys who have shown way more like PJ Washington, Cameron Johnson, and Keldon Johnson.  [tht superstar lol ](https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1440349497096224776?s=21)  [2019 redraft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2948039-2019-nba-re-draft-who-follows-zion-williamson.amp.html)  For fuck’s sake the guy averaged 9 points on bad efficiency. and I’m sure 2-3 years from now when Talen Horton Tucker is a decent back-up guard after being blamed for why the Lakers failed, he will become underrated."
"Nobody is offended about Book.  You're kind of just missing the point.  In general people look at a draft class and generalize that most of the players are within a year or two of everyone's age even though they know it's not always the case.  Considering Booker was particularly young for his class and was a one and done and how much of an impact he made right away it just *feels* like he's been around forever and it feels like Cameron Johnson just entered the league.  Nobody is suggesting any of these are mathmatical anomalies, just things you don't think much about and are kind of wild to read."
Cameron Johnson is older than Devin Booker by some months
Cameron Johnson (2019 Draft Class) is 8 months older than his teammate Devin Booker (2015 Draft Class)
Are you getting him mixed up with Cameron Johnson?
"Cameron Johnson is nice, wish the Bulls had a stretch 4 like him"
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"

"lol thanks, a lot of these Lakers are always fucking ridiculous with their NBA takes and like to shit on other teams/deflect criticism when things aren't going perfectly for the Lakers. Like in my opinion, the Suns have just about everything you need in highly-seeded playoff team, a PG that can run an offense and hit shots in the clutch (CP3), a true three level scorer (DBook), multiple wings and forwards who can play defense and stretch the defense on the offensive side of the ball (Mikal, Jae Crowder, Cameron Johnson, Saric), a good two way center (Ayton), and overall good depth in for Guards and Centers (Payne, Elfrid Payton, Javale, Frank the Tank).
