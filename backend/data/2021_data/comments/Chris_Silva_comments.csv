"Injury Report before anyone asks ""Why are the Heat 6-12?"" tomorrow:  \- Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Avery Bradley, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard, Maurice Harkless, Chris Silva all OUT"
not chris silva lol
Except for Chris Silva LOL
this is like when embiid dropped 45 on the heat — r/nba was chanting MVPiid but his primary defenders were stretch big kelly olynyk and g league mainstay chris silva.
"8 player roster, jimmy only playing 6 games, spo disrespecting bad teams by experimenting with shit lineups on them. man run a chris silva and max strus lineup in the 4th quarter while we were down 10 it’s cool when we’re winning but it is time to end that tradition"
lmfao the Chris Silva Redemption Quarter is being squandered
Oh no it's Chris Silva
"Embiid versus a rookie, Olynyk, and Chris Silva is a recipe for disaster"
All star Joel Embiid vs. future euro league player Chris Silva
I for one was stoked to see the marquee matchup of Chris Silva vs Isaiah Joe or whatever is stupidly happening.
"Embiid is going to have no opposition at all lmbo.  If anyone is still holding Chris Silva stocks, sell em now."
"Sindarius Thornwell, PJ Dozier, and Chris Silva. No relation at all."
There's a lot to like about Chris Silva actually. If the year was 2005.
Can you trade us Dipo for Chris Silva?
"Nunn was poached from the warriors for pennies  Struss was waived by the Celtics, then tore his ACL with the Bulls.  Just dont look into Chris Silva"
olynyk would be replaced by meyers bc salary filler but yeah it would have been harden-bradley-jimmy-bam-meyers with dragic-gabe vincent-kz okpala-chris silva + buyouts off the bench  i think pat riley underestimated the free agency pull of ring chasing as well as harden's superhuman ability to carry teams but i understand why he didn't do it at the time
"As it stands, the salaries don't match (Heat would need to send out more money than just Bradley, Leonard, and Harkless).  Miami would need to include about 1.5 mil more (maybe Chris Silva)."
"I think they'd have to add Chris Silva to the deal (which would work), but I have no idea if he's someone Miami values."
"I could’ve cared less about the character concerns, he always dogged my favorite player Chris Silva"
"It's just roster moves, we go back to our playoff lineups in the 4th. Through the rest of the game our bench gets worked out. These were the first serious minutes Chris Silva has had in a long time, and Okpala also got a lot more play than is typical for him."
"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/12/05/miami-heat-eastern-conference-contenders  &gt;It’s not just the starters who have thrived in this environment. Chris Silva, an undrafted backup center on a two-way contract, has become an essential sparkplug off the bench and is already drawing comparisons to local icon Udonis Haslem for his tenacity. (You can tell whenever Silva is in the game because he immediately begins gobbling up offensive rebounds like a Hungry Hungry Hippo.)"
oof I remember when Chris Silva was seen as a hidden gem last year
"We have Meyers Leonard and Chris Silva, 2 extremely easy cuts, plus Harkless can get cut very easily too"
Harrell on the Lakers. he's a NC guy  Chris Silva on the Heat since he's a Gamecock
didnt he replace chris silva who is equally as garbage
"Completely forgot Chris Silva is on the Kings now  Shame it didn’t work out with Miami, good guy"
"whats even weirder is that chris's opponent in this fight was uriah hall, silvas final opponent. Whats MORE weirder is that Chris was the first person to beat Hall and also the first person to beat Silva."
what’s fucking wild to me is that Anderson Silva broke his leg in almost the exact same way AGAINST Weidman ~8 years ago and now this happens to Chris. super super weird
"some of my favorite UFC nicknames  Mauricio ""Shogun"" Rua  Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell  ""The Axe Murderer"" Wanderlei Silva  ""The Natural Born Killer"" Carlos Condit  Ryan ""Darth"" Bader  ""The Dean of Mean"" Keith Jardine  Rick ""The Ginger With Intent to Injure"" Pfeifer  Chris ""the Crippler"" Leben  Damacio ""the Angel of Death"" Page  and lastly, Jeff ""Scary Nickname"" Nader  MMA has elite names and there's a ton more i can't remember"
"Wouldn't meet the qualifying games played to be recognized.    Otherwise, Joe Harris ain't shit compared to Drew Eubanks and Chris Silva, they shot the 3Ball twice as good as Harris."
"The Heat aren’t sneaky deep, they’re real fucking deep. The only thing sneaky about the Heat are their hands as they steal the rock from these chumps like a kid taking cookies from an unattended cookie jar. Y’all really thought we were an 8th seed or not even bound for the playoffs? Lmao okay. Y’all thought jimmy just wanted to hang and bang on the beach? THAT MAN IS A FATHER NOW AND HE’S READY TO SON THE LEAGUE. Y’all can keep James Hard-on and Russel Westdick, we got ballers that actually defense. When you go up against Miami, it’s going to be a fucking kerfuffle every game. Chris Silva will eat your children. Tyler Herro will bang your mom/daughter, whichever is more age appropriate. Nunn didn’t show up tonight but don’t think he isn’t bout that action either lmao. Culture big baby that’s what we’re about!"

"Chris Paul, Kris Dunn, Chris Silva, Khris Middleton, Chris Boucher"
Exactly lol. Who the fuck is Chris Silva and why is Day’Ron and Cam not there?
Tatum is a bum compared to Luka this shouldn’t be an argument at all it’s like comparing Chris Silva to Shaq
Chris Silva also was in Miami for a bit as a two way guy  Go Cocks!
Chris Silva also known as OprahSide.
Heat legend Chris Silva
"It’s official, Chris Silva is now the greatest shooter of all time."
"Without anything requirements (games played, attempts etc) it's meaningless. 2019-20 Chris Silva shot 0%, 2020-21 he shot 100%."
Worse than Andersen Silva and Chris weird man snapping their legs on a checked calf kick?
