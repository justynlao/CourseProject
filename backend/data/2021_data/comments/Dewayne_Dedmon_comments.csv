Dewayne Dedmon
"It's easy to fill out the 5 spot if you have everything else. Jordan, LeBron and Curry mostly won with nothing at the 5.   Javale McGee and/or Dewayne Dedmon fix up the defense.   Probably the Nets will win the title this year and then everyone will pretend they knew it would happen all along and whine the NBA is too predictable. Same thing every year, people clown around and then skip the shocked pikachu face right to pretending they knew all along."
"he's one of those players that looks good on paper to people who don't actually watch him play, like dewayne dedmon  mavs dumped barnes for nothing"
The lakers sub has made me hate Dewayne Dedmon because of how much I see his name on there
Embiid will feast in the paint and then Lakers fans on youtube videos will say we need to sign Dewayne Dedmon or Skal Labissiere lmao
Dewayne Dedmon could be useful
Dewayne Dedmon was a great role player on the hawks 2 years ago and nets could really use his defense.  Can also sometimes space the floor
They got roster space and cap space to plug some holes. Dewayne dedmon is still available.
Still kind of surprised Dewayne Dedmon isn't on a team yet.
"we need center depth, so this is a good signing I think. Imo should have gone after Dewayne Dedmon"
"I don't see PJ Tucker being bought out, with all the trade rumors around him.  Dewayne Dedmon and Ersan Ilyasova are both tough bigs, getting up there in age so they could be washed. Maybe Tyler Zeller.  For buyouts, its early to speculate. Not too many definite out of the playoff teams except Detroit. Cleveland has 3 centers that are at least rotation players, so I imagine McGee gets bought out. The Sixers have 4, which they like to have for Embiid insurance. But they could drop Pourier/Bradley if a good buyout guard/wing is available (they still have their full taxpayers MLE to use)."
"Dewayne Dedmon, John Henson, Ersan Ilyasova, Ian Mahinmi, Joakim Noah are all free agents. Not the ideal options obviously, but gotta be worth Brooklyn taking a flyer on with a non guaranteed deal right? I mean what do they have to lose. Don‚Äôt have much assets left and these guys could be had for just about nothing. Doesn‚Äôt work, waive ‚Äòem."
"Alright. Cool. Any free agent centres that aren't complete ass? (Checks)  Ian Mahinmi, Skal Labissiere, Dewayne Dedmon, John Henson... yeah, I'm sure at least one of them could be serviceable."
I think this isn't a bad idea by any means. People can clown the idea but at the end of the day the Nets are in desperate need for big depth. If you can get Whiteside for a second rounder then I'd go for it.   Are we forgetting that last year he averaged 15.5/13.5 and lead the league in blocks? I get that his skillset isn't what the NBA is trending towards but I'm still surprised he's rotting away in Sac on a vet min.  There's also the argument to make though that they can easily get someone else that's either more productive or is a free buyout. JaVale McGee makes a lot of sense if they can get him on the cheap. Dewayne Dedmon is a great candidate as a buyout center as well.
What about Dewayne Dedmon?
Why not pick up someone off waivers like Cheick Diallo or Dewayne Dedmon? They're not exactly stars but I feel like they'd be nice fits. I actually don't understand why Diallo is out of the league
Play kyle korver as a sf/pf? come on. It seems obvious to me they need to sign Dewayne Dedmon not Frank Kaminsky who is not a free agent.
"Assuming a finals of Nets/Lakers, I think we'll see a decent amount of KD trying to guard AD.  A big with that skillset that you mentioned is off the table though. There's probably a few FA centers that can be picked up for cheap (I like Dewayne Dedmon).   I think their best shot though is trading for JaVale McGee, he's a cheap rim-runner you could get for a second probably."
Dewayne Dedmon is available.  If JaVale gets bought out it's a decent idea.
"Dewayne Dedmon, he's a free agent right now.  Nets might try to pick him up since they need a center."
Mirotic would not solve their rim protection issues lol.  The best available center is Dewayne Dedmon.
Dewayne Dedmon shot 20% from 3 last season on 2.4 attempts per game
This way he can actually ask the opinion of people who have seen Dedmon play   What nets fans are paying attention to dewayne dedmon?
"""strike gold... Dewayne Dedmon"" what is this guy on"
&gt;Defense will be a issue but if they can strike gold in the buyout market or some free agents now they will be fine. Especially at Center. Getting a Dewayne Dedmon for example.  This is why your whole concept is comedy to me.
Dewayne Dedmon?   He's still available.
"My only issue with this is how few centers are genuinely good shooters and are starting caliber players.  They could definitely get a better shooter than Adams - but will they have to sacrifice in other areas to do that?  Kings signed Dewayne Dedmon to a substantial contract largely cause he could shoot and that ended up being a bust.  But I guess it depends on the trade value for him.  If he is seen as a starting level center, that 2/35 extension is fine imo, that is a movable trade asset for the next three years.  But there are a lot of quality centers, so if he isn't actually a clear starting caliber guy, then it is a bad value.  It isn't that easy to just sign a starting caliber player outright in FA."
Damyean Dotson is a great pick  Dewayne Dedmon is also viable on the topic of ‚ÄòD‚Äô alliteration players
Dewayne Dedmon has more to offer a NBA team right now. Ian Mahinmi too. Amir Johnson
Yeah. Buyout market for a Nerlin Noel or Dewayne Dedmon  I still think a fully healthy Lakers can win big. AD is the üî•. the last time a ‚Äúbig paint defender‚Äù make/break a teams winning chances was...  1999? 2007?
That‚Äôs just Dewayne Dedmon
"They could have traded love for legitimately elite role players such as wings and ball handlers( lets be honest, love wasn‚Äôt really playing well vs GSW). They could have picked up some decent guys in FA like Dewayne Dedmon and Luc Mbah moute.   Im not saying theyd win but the series would have been close and at that point you cant bet against LBJ.   I never said though, the warriors are blessed but its not as straightforward as lot of people are making it seem"
"&gt;  and the guy who brought you luminaries like Alen Smailagic.  Kirk Lacob also signed the following players to the Santa Cruz warriors: Seth Curry, Bazemore, Dewayne Dedmon, Kendrick Nunn, Danuel House  Kirk also pushed the league to adopt two way contracts."
That‚Äôs Piston legend Dewayne Dedmon to you!
"Dewayne ""Sanka, ya"" Dedmon"
Can‚Äôt wait to see ‚ÄúBruce Dewayne‚Äù Dedmon play with Jimmy ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù Butler. When ‚Äúthe joker‚Äù Jokic is in town shits gonna get wild.
" [The Miami Heat are planning to sign free agent center Dewayne Dedmon, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.](https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1379555158019997698?s=21)"
Maybe Dewayne Dedmon? He was pretty disastrous when he played last year
dewayne dedmon charging his phone right now
That's Spurs legend Dewayne Dedmon for you
"In his first four seasons in the league, Dewayne Dedmon didn't shoot threes at all. The next three seasons he shot approximately three a game. He went from shooting approximately 60% of his field goals from within 3 feet to around 30% in that same time. In his 3 seasons at Atlanta he shot .358 from distance, pretty decent for a centre. He was shooting sub 70% from the free throw line early and became a plus 80% shooter."
not sure especially since refs absolutely hate Poeltl  I wouldn't mind a Dewayne Dedmon reunion
Nah we also got a capable defender in Trevor Ariza and size/rebounding in Dewayne Dedmon. We good
"Heat 17-9 without Olynyk, 21-22 with Olynyk. 10-4 with Dewayne Dedmon  Rockets 4-20 with Olynyk, 12-33 without him.  Anybody half decent NBA vet could put up empty stats on Houston. Dewayne Dedmon has been way better for Miami than Olynyk was lmao"
**Miami Heat - Dewayne Dedmon**. He was kinda nobodys trash since he was a free agent but given the fact no team tried to sign him and many thought he looked washed out at his previous stops in Sacramento/Atlanta he's been a revelation for us off the bench just to play big and get rebounds when Bam sits.
Dewayne Dedmon
Dewayne Dedmon
Dewayne Dedmon.
So good to see that last years fluke finals appearance team was just a Dewayne Dedmon away from an early playoff exit in 2021. Gotta be that Heat culture üò§
"I like to think that Greg Oden's alter ego is Dewayne Dedmon, and he's still good at basketball"
Dewayne Dedmon has been so big for the heat
Dewayne Dedmon has been the best waiver pickup for literally any team this year
Nice to see Spurs legend Dewayne Dedmon back in the league
"Dewayne Dedmon, maybe"
"Maybe playing like the D league, but they have legit NBA talent.  Once the playoffs roll around and Kerr tightens the rotations, it's gonna be a scary team. To me they are a Klay Thompson away from being a legit good team with defined roles. Once Oubre is a sixth man, the team would have been clicking.  I'm just surprised the Warrior's didn't even try to experiment with picking up people for this season. All that's needed to me is a decent perimeter player and a center possibly like Dewayne Dedmon who is giving decent back up minutes to the Heat."
What do you mean? Giannis and Embiid are great and all but they‚Äôre no Dewayne Dedmon
No. He's 101 though. I have DeWayne Dedmon over him
GIMME DEWAYNE DEDMON PLEASE

"I love how despite his age, he still loves the current era of basketball and knows the league so well. No other commentator would give detailed analysis of Dewayne Dedmon"
Not only was it a Cinderella run but we literally made no positive moves outside of Dewayne Dedmon all year

"Yeah, KP is in the tier of ‚Äúserious 3 point threats‚Äù, not just ‚Äúbigs who can make wide open 3s‚Äù.  The spacing from someone like KP is a lot more significant than spacing from a big like Kelly Olynyk or Dewayne Dedmon. KP‚Äôs a good enough shooter that his defender is a lot less likely to help off of him, which helps the rest of the team even if KP never touches the ball. Most stretch-5s don‚Äôt actually provide that much spacing because you can help off of them and live off of the one 3 they make per game"
"yep, with a supporting cast of goran dragic, dewayne dedmon and 3 g league players in the playoffs"
"Clips for sure, I really didn‚Äôt expect the Heat this year to be better than last year, what have they done for me to expect better results? All I see as an outsider is a team who didn‚Äôt keep guys who were very helpful in the playoffs (Crowder, Olynyk who put up 24 points in game 2 and 17 in game 3 of last year‚Äôs finals) while not really adding anything other than dudes like Dewayne Dedmon. If Tyler Herro had a breakout year this would be different in my mind, but nah I didn‚Äôt expect the Heat to beat a top 3 seed without a ton of luck."
Where is Dewayne Dedmon on that list? He has to be a couple spots above Bam
There goes the Dewayne Dedmon I remember lol
"‚ÄúDewayne Dedmon was exceptional for the Heat in game 2, also here‚Äôs every made bucket from Bam and Butler.‚Äù"
Heat legend dewayne dedmon? Are you even a fan?
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
Dewayne Dedmon scored a team high 19 points on 8-11 shooting in 20:50 min and was -15.  That is a super weird line.

Dewayne Dedmon.
"Ok‚Ä¶ I guess I could have worded that better. NBA players can not publicly make trade demands at all, because they are under contract and therefore bound by the rules of the CBA.  This is why all trade demands are essentially ‚Äúsources say player X wants a trade‚Äù rather than the player saying it themselves.  https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-fined-trade-demand-nba-official-release  https://www.nba.com/news/dewayne-dedmon-fined-trade-request-official-release"
"I don‚Äôt recall Kobe getting in trouble. Not sure if it was preferential treatment, or more likely just that the CBA rules were different.  Here are some recent examples of players getting fined for this (but also, LOL at Dedmon feeling like he had the power to demand a trade)  https://www.nba.com/news/dewayne-dedmon-fined-trade-request-official-release  https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-fined-trade-demand-nba-official-release"
"Dewayne Dedmon is the answer, played about 6 games with the Kings after we gave him a big contract, was legitimately unplayable (turnover machine, incredibly inefficient shooter, bad defense/rim protection), then got benched for Richuan Holmes who was clearly better and demanded a trade."
"He was clearly referring to the other Heat legend, Dewayne Dedmon."
"They saw him putting up 29-9 while playing with Alex Len, a washed up DeWayne Dedmon, and a 75 year old Vince Carter, and assumed Trae was the reason they couldn't win"
It looks bigger cause he‚Äôs bald. Biggest head has to go to Miami‚Äôs finest: Dewayne Dedmon.
&gt;  Sign Dewayne Dedmon or another vet min C who could stretch the floor and hit the 3 - *Maybe Baynes*  You've been sold a bridge.
"You think he built a team with 2 rookies playing about 30 mpg (Hunter and Reddish), Jabari Parker, DeWayne Dedmon, DeAndre Bembry, Jeff Teague, Allen Crabbe, Alex Len, Vince Carter, and Even Turner....And was seriously attempting to win basketball games? That's what you call tanking buddy."
"First of all, false. Second of all, where were all the people comparing rosters when the Hawks were starting Alex Len, Taurean Prince, and DeWayne Dedmon?"
"His average over the last 3 years would probably be 1 assist higher if he wasn't passing to the all-NBA center rotation of Alex Len, Bruno Fernando, and Dewayne Dedmon"
"Lukas supporting cast beat the 1 seed bucks with Giannis last year.  Trae had 41 year old vince Carter playing 15 minutes per game. His centers were Damian Jones, Alex Len and dewayne dedmon.   But Luka was heralded and Trae was called an empty stats player.  (Not saying luka is an empty stats player just saying the goalposts seem to shift an awful lot.)  Trae‚Äôs shooting splits don‚Äôt tell the whole story because he still got his team involved with his passing and kept an all nba defender attached to him at all times."
last year his third scoring option was Jabari Parker..until the trade lol and Atlanta had a 43 year old Vince Carter on the floor with Trae Young sometimes. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish were rookies and weren't they running DeWayne Dedmon/Alex Len for center? it's almost like..you put a true superstar floor general with a real roster and suddenly things like this start happening. Last years Hawks didn't even play a minute of Clint Capela after the trade
"It should be Dewayne Dedmon, maybe Herro among non Heat fans"
It‚Äôs a completely different situation since we‚Äôre bringing him in to play 12-15 minutes a night off the bench against backup 5s. I‚Äôll gladly revisit this and eat crow if he‚Äôs getting roasted by Dewayne Dedmon next year.  I think it‚Äôs important to remember that whenever 90% of nba reddit agrees on something they‚Äôre almost always wrong.

"Their scouting and player development is solid; they find hidden gems not only in the draft but in the pool of undrafted players. Their G-League program keeps churning out rotation players (Rodney McGruder, Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, Duncan Robinson). They seem to get the best out of guys, even revitalizing discarded veterans (Wayne Ellington, Dewayne Dedmon, Birdman, Anthony Mason had his only All-Star year with the Heat). They employ a lot of their former players: Anthony Carter, Keith Askins, Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Chris Quinn, Shane Battier, Malik Allen, Caron Butler, Kasib Powell."
"&gt;The Heat improved their immediate title odds the most  Did they?  Lowry is a championship caliber PG, but they're losing Dragic so that's not a huge step forward.  Re-signing Robinson was a relief, but they already had him so it doesn't make the team better.  PJ Tucker is a nice piece, but he averaged 3.7ppg this year and is a total zero offensively on everything but corner 3's. Dewayne Dedmon played well in a very small sample size this year, but he's a 32 year old journeyman who's spent most of the last decade as a roster filler on 25 win squads.  Seems like this team is perfectly set up to enter the 2022 playoffs as the 6 seed while being *wildly* overconfident that their veteran experience will carry them.  That strategy has been attempted many times and virtually never works."
Two years Dwayne Wade became Dewayne Dedmon
To be fair the only player who looked solid for the Heat in the playoffs this year was Dewayne Dedmon.
"Don't forget our resident true big, Dewayne Dedmon. We need that size"
I want my Heats to resign Dewayne Dedmon and bring back Wayne Ellington if we gotta trade Duncan Robinson away.
"this is how I feel. vets come to our team and just stop trying. what's up Trevor Ariza, the worst King of all time (next to Dewayne Dedmon)"
"Isaiah Thomas is the big one. And cousins was looking great in NOLA pre-injury.  But also we had Whiteside become an actual NBA player once he left (after some time in China or whatever), Bogdan who‚Äôs looked much better on the Hawks, Seth Curry before he became Steph v2, Gary Trent Jr...  There‚Äôs also guys that just seemed to sandbag a bit for us.. Rudy Gay, who wasn‚Äôt bad but not what we had expected, we had the worst version of Rondo, bad seasons from DeWayne Dedmon, Arron Afflalo, Ariza, and pretty much every 37 year old vet we‚Äôve brought on (although it was pretty cool to have Vince Carter for a season)  It‚Äôs hard to say how much of it is the organization and how much is the players/bad luck. But after 15 years, it seems pretty clear to me that we are in fact Basketball Hell as Rudy Gay so accurately put it.  Luckily we seem to have turned a new leaf with Monte McNair, it‚Äôs only been a season and some change but it‚Äôs looked a looooot better.  So yeah in terms of who‚Äôve we drafted, nobody‚Äôs gone on to have an all-star type season besides IT. But I wouldn‚Äôt at all be surprised to see Bagley make a huge (double) jump once he leaves Sac. Or Buddy for that matter"
"&gt;I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schr√∂der and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.  So, the ""SnT Schoeder for Lonzo and fill out with good vets"" method, ala the 2020 run.  Do you think Pelicans accept that offer?"
"I don‚Äôt want Russ bc that means no depth. He isn‚Äôt bad, he‚Äôs just a bad fit for the Lakers since Lakers need 3PT shooting.   I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schr√∂der and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.   Best possible scenario I can think of.  Lonzo KCP LeBron AD Dieng during regular season.   Lonzo KCP THT LeBron AD during playoffs if THT makes a huge leap."
"We lost a lot. People talk about us gaining Lowry and that‚Äôs great, but he is much older than he was even when he won a championship.   Beyond that, from our 2020 Finals run, we lost, Dragic, Crowder, Olynyk, Iguodala, Derrick Jones Jr., Nunn and Meyers Leonard.   We‚Äôve added old Lowry, old PJ Tucker, Markief Morris and Dewayne Dedmon.   Really and truly, I don‚Äôt expect too much production out of Morris and Dedmon and even with them we lost 7 rotation guys and added 4. The ones we added are older and our bench is shorter. We went from being 11 deep to about 7 deep unless Okpala and Gabe Vincent to actually earn more minutes which they really haven‚Äôt as of yet.   It‚Äôs hard to win a championship without solid bench production and nobody on our bench really pops, scares a team, or does really anything so well as to be incredibly positive for us."
"Andre ""Dewayne Dedmon"" Igoudala"
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Bam Adebayo  Key Bench Players: Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, Max Strus, Markieff Morris, Dewayne Dedmon"
At a certain following number they pretty much all the have the setting switched on where they don‚Äôt even see notifications from people they aren‚Äôt following. As well as fans telling them how great they are/asking for something there‚Äôs also thousands of daily spam messages too. Someone like Haslem from Miami has a reputation for interacting with the people but I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs still a miniscule percentage of DM‚Äôs‚Ä¶but you‚Äôll more likely get a response from someone on Miami roster like Dewayne Dedmon. Just because he has such comparatively few followers. Maybe the equivalent to a Dedmon on your team who MIGHT see the message would be a start.
"&gt; The Bagels traded Bruce Brown, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, a 2023 1st round pick, and a 2025 1st round pick to the Cyclones for Bam Adebayo, Dewayne Dedmon, and Kyle Lowry.  Lol, thanks Brooklyn."
is that Alonzo mourning or Dewayne dedmon?
Here's the list from last season.  DeMarcus Cousins  Andre Drummond  Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond  DeMarcus Cousins  Gorgui Dieng  Cristiano Fel√≠cio    Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins  Dewayne Dedmon   Nikola Jokiƒá  Kelly Olynyk  Bam Adebayo   Steven Adams  Khem Birch    Kelly Olynyk                                   Jeff Green            Bruno Fernando  Jahlil Okafor
"TIL Dewayne Dedmon is still not only in the league, but getting minutes."
"No, and a gross misrepresentation. He won 60 games with the Hawks, got 4 players selected to the All-Star game and got a ton of players that really shouldn't have gotten paid, majorly paid.(Demarre Carroll and Dewayne Dedmon thank him)"
" PLAYER | CAP FIGURE  ---|---|---- Blake Griffin | $29,764,126| DeAndre Jordan | $7,875,533 |  Dewayne Dedmon |$2,866,667|  Cory Joseph | $2,400,000 |  Deividas Sirvydis |$1,517,981 |  Zhaire Smith| $1,068,200 |"
"According to bballrefrence their dead money is at $44.4M. Is there someone missing?   Blake Griffin - $29,784,216  DeAndre Jordan - $7,875,533  Dewayne Dedmon - $2,866,667  Cory Joseph - $2,400,000 (from his prior contract)   Deividas Sirvydis - $1,517,981  This totals $44,424,397 in dead money for Detroit, which is higher than the Thunders payroll as of right now. As OKC guarantees contracts, it's likely to bring their payroll above this though.  Side note: OKC is still paying Kyle Singler 1M/year this season and next."
"Man I still go back to check on the Kings to see how they are run hopeful that they turn the corner and what meets me? Failure. Cousins looks like an all star? Fire the coach he likes and precede to piss of Cousins. They jump all the way to the second pick with Luka, my number 1 prospect in that draft guess they better take Bagley. Oh they look somewhat decent with Joerger and Fox? Turns out Joerger is an a-hole and gets fired and replaced with Walton. The Kings win 39 games and look to grow? They sign Barnes to a market value contract and overpay Cory Joseph, Dewayne Dedmon, and Trevor Ariza to make a playoff push. I want the Kings to be good in fact I want them to be great but all I see is a trail of memes and the KANGZ all steps of the way. Now Simmons is available and they won‚Äôt consider trading like the 15th best point guard in Fox and a decent if unspectacular prospect like Haliburton. Haliburton is unlikely to be even top 10 pint guard in his prime with the amount of PG talent that flows through the draft."

"Lmao when we were running rotations of Bruno Fernando, Alex Len and Dewayne Dedmon Trae averaged 30-10. Trae can get lobs up to anyone even porzingis"
I thought this said Dewayne Dedmon
Bulls game plan on who to attack after game:   **ATTACK**  Jokic  **BOX AND 1**   Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Dewayne Dedmon  Bam Adebayo
"And the guy intended to be our main center that year got replaced after a few games, whined to the Sacramento Bee about wanting to be traded and got fined $50K for it, then ended up back on the Hawks like nothing happened.  The whole Dewayne Dedmon saga was weird"
I see Dewayne Dedmon and I immediately think of Joel Anthony
