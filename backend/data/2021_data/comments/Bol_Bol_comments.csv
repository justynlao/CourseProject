Balsetbol Bol.  Shou'd Quickley
"Jamal Murray, Garry Harris, Michael Porter Jr, Bol Bol, Nikola Jokic."
Imagine if manute Bol was -1 foot
This is some Bol Bol level reaching
Manure &amp; Bol easy
BOL BOL is the last one
The disrespect on Bol Bol smh
Manute Bol
"KD still shoots over Bol Bol. Tacko is just too slow, he can't contest fast enough."
"Does it really count, I mean Bol Bol didn’t even play"
why does he look like bol bol when he shot that 3
Brooks? Not even close. Oregon is Bol Bol territory
"Gheorghe Muresan 7'7″, Manute Bol 7'7″, Yao Ming 7'6″"
Well he kinda proved that they don't matter when he shot over Bol Bol like it was nothing during the matchup against the nuggets
"Yeah , I agree . I think Bol will end up like his dad , he won't be able to match Durant at all"
Durant is tall. Tall people simply are not supposed to move and play as he does. Durant is a freak on nature that we will not see again for a long time.( ok maybe if bol improves alot)
"Bol Bol, Tacko Fall and Tingus Pingus?"
"1. No thanks. If we're rebuilding we wouldn't want a player a year younger than Beal (Siakam) as the center piece.  2. No ... Bucks don't have picks .. and Jrue isn't valuable to the Wizards.  3. Not nearly enough ...  Herro, Achiuwa, Robinson, picks is the best they can offer .. and even that isn't great. Heat picks will be pretty high if they have Beal/Bam/Butler  4. This is my favorite package. Wiseman/Minny pick are valuable.  5. Picks are nice, but idk why OKC would want Beal now ...   6. wtf? who is Hart, Ball, Reddick is supposed to be valuable?  7. Why would we take on Harris ...  8. Potentially works, if we're sending Simmons to a third team like Minny  9. Nets don't have picks to trade  10. Celtics don't do this  11. Would need to include Bol Bol / Hampton"
"thats awful. pick are good but i dont think memphis would do that.  &amp;#x200B;  i want him to join the true dream genius artist jokic and klay thompson in kd body MPJ. murray, hampton bol and 2 frps should do it."
A Manut Bol that can run.
I'd like to see him on the nuggets with Jokic and MPJ  Reckon nuggets can get him with just Murray and 2 picks and maybe RJ Hampton or bol.  Beal would probably stay as well
"Bol Bol with 2 boards, 1 assist, 1 block in 2:30, truly the shining star of this game."
"Classic highlight reel, bol was based lol"
So mantue bol? Lmao check out when he dropped like 5 3s in a game
"Copying my reply to the dude you were responding to...  Is it that are more naturally athletic, or that there are cultural influences that make it appears they are more athletic?   Liberty City, Florida (subsection of Miami) is the breeding ground for the developing football players. Is it something in the water? Or is it that from a very young age it’s taught that the only way to escape abject poverty you need become an elite athlete. The community dedicated a disproportionate amount of their resources in order to protect and develop the talent within its community. As a result iron sharpens iron, kids get to play against better competition and develop more than peers from other geographical areas.    Investment in basketball has dramatically improved since the 1980s and 1990s when African players like Hakeem, Mutombo, and Manute Bol developed courts and infrastructure to train people. That type of investment trickles down.(pretty sure Siakam and Embiid decveloped at a Luc Mbah a Moute camp., players learning the game on courts donated by Hakeem and Mutombo) The NBA has really only started to make that type of investment in other international markets.   That type of investment is also why some international geographical areas have pockets of NBA players like it Eastern Europe. It only takes one Dazen Pertrovic or Arvydas Sabonis to inspire a Toni Kukoc, to inspire a Jokic or Luka to pick up the ball earlier and develop. That’s why a player like Yao breaking through the NBA is valuable, his existence in the NBA makes it easier for next generation of people that look like him.   In a similar vein, do you believe that Asians are inherently more intelligent than other races (you could draw a similar conclusion based off of standardize test score)? or is it that demographic community has placed an emphasis on a skill and dedicated a disproportionate amount of resources and effort to stand out.  Another example, Muslim Caucus countries dominate wrestling, while Western Europe has a very limited wrestling tradition, is it because Europeans are inherently weaker and wimpy, or the countries that do excel dedicated decades of infrastructure and teaching best practice through generations? Same with Ju-Jitsu, dominated by a particular group at the international level (Brazilians), it’s not because people from Brazil are naturally more flexible or inherently have better fight IQ or are more athletic, they have dedicated a lot more time and energy developing best practices."
BRING IN BOL BOL
Ya like how Manute Bol used to play games literally drunk
"Aight, don't take it *too far*. Shaq was a big boy but he was also absurdly talented for someone his size. He definitely was more than just the biggest guy on the court. You got guys like Bol Bol, Boban and Tacko who are all big as hell but end up being liabilities in a competitive game in some way or another. Shaq was able to contribute all over the court (except for shooting in any fashion literally ever) in some of the toughest games ever. His post playing career is some clown shit but we don't have to go after his time playing."
"I won't claim PEDs are safe, but the science around PEDs has grown a lot since the 80s when it was just D-Bol and ""grow big muscles no matter your sport"". They're more targeted and they've learned to mitigate a lot of side effects. Consider guys like Arnold and Vince McMahon- massive PEDs users for decades, but now in their early/mid 70s they're healthier and stronger than almost all their peers. Maybe their hearts will explode in a few years, but if you can be as strong as a 25 year old until you're 80 and then drop dead I'm not sure there's too much of a down side."
"I dunno, who we really wanted was Manute Bol who beat up lions and shit. I don't think his kid is being raised in quite the same manner though, nor KD."
"Austin Rivers has NBA parents.  He isn’t Steph.  Seth Curry has Steph’s same parents.  He isn’t like Steph. Bol Bol’s dad played in the NBA, he isn’t like Steph.  Saying that Steph is who he is because his dad played in the NBA is attempting to diminish the work that Steph has done himself. He earned what he has.  The greatest ever, Michael Jordan, had 2 sons who played basketball and weren’t NBA players.  Steph had to put in the work himself."
"This isn’t about all athletes in the world, just NBA players.  So why would I compare to ppl like you who are slow and out of shape when this conversation is specifically about NBA players?  Having NBA parents didn’t make Steph what he is because Austin rivers, Seth Curry, Bol Bol, etc all have parents who played in the NBA but they aren’t what Steph is."
Bol Bol
Manute Bol
"Bol bol, Danny green, Paul George: Am I a joke to you?"
Bol Bol and Poku
BOL BOL
"Jokic, Bol, Plumlee, Grant, and Millsap - Godlike. I want to see them bust that lineup out at least one more time."
Bol bol and tacko fall
"Jury is out on if Paschall is a top 5 guy from that class. Remember that he was already 23, so his impact was going to be more immediate than a lot of the 19 year olds in that class like a Horton-Tucker or a Bol Bol or whoever.  But ultimately whether he's top 5 or not, it's impossible to complain about getting someone as good as him with the 41st pick."
Bol Bol is bald?
Bol Bol and Jokic  I see no difference except weight
"meatball hoagie with american, herrs sour cream 99 cent bag and wawa peach tea, thanks young bol"
We need a Tacko vs Bol Bol matchup
Manute Bol blocked 10.2% of all 2-point shots attempted while he was on the floor.
Our FO people were talking about all the film study Bol Bol was doing leading up to the season  With a little time on the googles you can be the change
Bol Bol really is gonna be the steal of his draft... as long as those health issues that made him drop that low  don't flare up
"Bol Bol is Dhalsim, confirmed"
Bol
"With how much of a size mismatch it was, I wish Jokic took over more and the game would have been done even earlier and we could have seen more BOl"
"He's so tall, it's like Bol Bol is wearing short shorts..."
"Bol Bol's great Grandfather was 7'10"". That's pretty fucking crazy."
"If Bol Bol doesn't win ROTY, Most Improved and MVP this season I will be genuinely shocked."
I’m a simple man. I see Bol Bol highlights I upvote
"Bol ""Bol Bol"" Bol"
"It's because Morris and Facu play in the 2nd unit and so our team's worst play-- Markus Howard is the PG for the 3rd unit. And that dude is the text book definition of a chucker-- at 5' 10"".  I still like Bol, RJ and Zeke and pieces long term (even if I'm annoyed we wound up with Zeke instead of Precious, Bey or Maxey)."
"I like how you changed the color there now I just need an animated gif alternating between the two.  EDIT: Possibly with the first one saying ""Bol"" and the second adding the other ""Bol"""
Galaxy Opal Bol Bol right there.
Bol “Zion” Bol
"In order to block a Bol Bol dunk, one must first stop him from entering the arena."
He must've eaten all his vegetables as a baby bol bol
Bol Bol vs Poku is a matchup I'm here for
Shai Gay  Bol Ball  Dennis Kanter  Buddy Bonga
"Boban, Tacko, Bol Bol"
MVP not in HOF: Dirk Nowitzki (PF)  FMVP that never won MVP: Rick Barry (SF)  Player that never averaged 18 ppg: John Stockton (PG)  1 6th Man: Manu Ginobili 2012 (SG)  1 player who never averaged double digits: Manute Bol (C)
Granted his whole situation was reason he fell to you at 24th pick. That is kinda like saying Nuggets were cursed if Bol Bol/MPJ end up being plagued by injuries - they took a punt on them with low pick and it is more than possible that injuries will forever be problems for those 2.
"Don Nelson was happy to have a 7-foot tall outside shooter, it's one of the reasons they drafted Dirk. Nelson liked unconventional strategies (he gave Manute Bol the green light to shoot threes back in the 80s). But when Avery Johnson took over coaching the Mavs, he was determined to make Dirk play inside more, like a big man. Dirk's 3PA declined noticeably from a high of 4.9 per game in 2003 to fewer than 3 during Avery's tenure. But this is when Dirk learned to post up and developed his signature fadeaway.  His 3PA went back up a bit later on in his career but he never reached his 2003 high of 4.9 per game again. I think coaches today would love him to take like 6+. He's a career 38% shooter from 3, remarkably consistent from year to year."
Manure Bol has entered the chat...
Jake Paul would KO Bol Bol nephew
Bol Bol is missing 50% of the tall and strong smh
"Giannis isn’t skilled, he’s just tall and strong. that’s why Bol Bol is the league MVP"
"If I was a GM I’d sell my whole team and build it around Tacko .. screw trae and Luka ... we going big big   Tacko , Bol Bol , Boban , prozingis, Luke Kornet  Who’s going to stop that team from scoring ? Who!!!"
I think acid might give me tremendous clarity to make draft decisions  I would've gone all in on Bol bol
Can he come to the Nuggets so you can have the Porter Jr^2  + Bol^2 aesthetic? Fuck it let's get the Bulls in this and add Otto to this vibe.
"Yeah, the Harden-Embiid fit would have been insane. I always felt like a three-team trade between us, Philly and Denver made the most sense. Ben Simmons would be a really nice fit on Denver, much better than us or even Philly tbh, and both teams could send us young assets (MPJ, Hampton, Bol, Maxey, Thybulle) and a few picks between them.  For all the two team trades we heard about though, I'm happier to just click the restart button and get as many assets as we can."
"Oladipo and Gordon for Barton, Harris Bol Bol and pick?"
You dont thin Bol Bol is even worth trying to develop?
You don’t think Bol Bol should be on an NBA roster?
"i would assume there would be more like RJ Hampton, Bol Bol, and a couple 1sts.  but the main thing is how odd that the response to “Murray is off the table for Harden” was just collective acceptance"
" No Bol Bol. No MPJ. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back."
"All the tall skinny KDs.  Bol, Caboclo, Maker, etc.   We need more of those guys."
How is Bol Bol doing?
exactly why i'm optimistic. i think he has more athletic potential than Boban but way more strength than Bol Bol
A team with Tacko and Bol Bol for sure
Bol bol   Gobert   Durant   Lebron   AD  Embiid
"If we're trading Beal then its to rebuild ... so we would want young players on rookie deals and picks   Depends on how desperate teams are but ...  Warriors have Wiseman/Minny Pick, Nuggets have MPJ/Bol/Hampton, Kings have Haliburton/Bagley, Hawks have Okongwu/Reddish/etc  Probably need ~4 young players/picks to make the deal happen."
Bol Bol over this guy
Bol Bol is definitely not a better shooter than Buddy Hield (career 41% shooter on high volume) yet Buddy Hield couldn't even beat Kosta Koufos in 1v1.   https://youtu.be/TIBpqR-UF3M
Batman has a large shadow so it must be the following players who resemble that:  1. Boban 2. Tacko Fall  3. Bol Bol
"Likewise, if you haven't seen the Manute Bol swimming picture: https://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1lwv2w/manute_bol_in_a_swimming_pool/"
Just like celtics legend Brandon bass. Tacko got to recreated the manute bol swimming pic
"How? 5 years earlier (the 88-89 szn) Bol was top 50 in the league in 3PA despite playing 22mpg. It's still low attempts compared to today, but the guy wasn't Shaq. I struggle to see how someone who was encouraged to shoot is ""one of the all-time single game outliers in sports history"" for a game were he hit 3s.  Unless I'm just completely missing the point you're trying to make, that is"
Wait what? No he didnt lol the guy shot 20/91 in a season like 5 years earlier. Bol was top 50 in the NBA in 3PA in 88-89 even though he only played 22mpg
"For this scenario Boban makes shots and fucks thots. Done deal. Bol goes to give Boban a high five and Boban’s grizzly mitt engulfs Bol’s hand to the point he starts weeping uncontrollably. He says “Bobi, teach me those hands so I can become a basketball god like you”, Boban then reaches out and slaps Bol Bol’s face, breaking Bol’s nose clean off. Boban looks at him and says “heh, nothin personnel kid”."
Bol baby!
Um and what happens when Bol Bol is defending? Boban has around 70 lbs on him.
"Bol is just gonna rain 3s until someone comes out of the paint, then he’s gonna blow by them for a between the legs dunk. I get that Boban’s a treasure and all but the answers here are comical. Bol would run these dude’s ragged."
I got Bol Bol. Boban is washed
It's really weird just to see Bol Bol move so I'm going to go with him
Give me Bol Bol
"This isn’t a matter of opinion lol, the tallest player ever is Manute Bol and Gheorghe Muresan, the heaviest player is Oliver Miller, the highest mass/volume ratio amongst players is something that would require a bit of research, a starting guess I would have is Yao Ming  But mentioning Boris Diaw is odd to me because he wasn’t especially tall or heavy (at least considering listed metrics)"
"Bol Bol, Monte and a 1st to the bucks who says no"
"This was my fever dream until he signed that contract. I would want the nuggets to move the world on a sign and trade for him. Murray/MPJ/Bol/Zeke/RJ/ all of the firsts, I didn’t care. Giannis and Jokic would have been incredible to watch. Maybe the two freakiest current NBA players in completely different ways with perfectly meshing skill sets."
Bol Bol robbed
Bol Bol
In my 2K My Player 4 years in... Jaylen Brown is borderline unguardable.      And Bol Bol is somehow the greatest player in NBA history.
yea but the same list has his son Bol Bol listed as being from Sudan  weird how they'd do that when Manute spent way more of his life in Sudan than Bol
"I was curious about this statement (steals vs. blocks) so I looked it up.   You are absolutely correct, there have been 24 games all time with 10+ steals (25 now).  Meanwhile, there have been 160 games of 10+ blocks in a game, but interestingly only from 44 players! Mark Eaton did it 19 times and Manute Bol did it 18."
DEN is so fun. You get Jokic with Jamal and then when Jokic sits Jamal is out there just making buckets. It's just never not entertaining.   And in garbage time you get Bol Bol. Love DEN.
Bol Bol and Chet Holmgren gonna be dominating the league
It’s Manute Bol kinda embarrassing we need to keep having this debate.
"Considering the players the Nuggets have are (mostly) high upside guys that haven't shown much, they probably won't get the value they could get in a year.  As a Nuggets fan, I wrote off this year as a development year the moment Jerami Grant left. I think the Nuggets will be better in 2021-2022 than they would have if he stayed.  The Nuggets just need one or two of MPJ, Nanji, Bol, and RJ to hit.  And it is starting to look very positive with everyone but Bol."
shouldn't manute bol be listed as sudanese?
Probably Bol Bol
Bol Bol is actually very offensively gifted...
"He'll get his time. Moach has a Gregg Pop approach where he doesn't give his rookies much run, he did coach under him after all.   Bol will develop nice watching Jokic play."
"This is what I think with Bol Bol. I wasn't much of a stan of him before we drafted him, but I see now why he was projected lottery before his foot injury.  His skillset is insane for his height standing at 7'2"" (and maybe still growing). He has good handles for a point-forward, I've seen him drop a few people like Giles and Hassan at one point.   I do bolieve though his weight was at 235 until he went down maybe 20 lbs after injury. He gains the weight back and he'll be back to his former college numbers."
You did shoot bad but we were shooting 8-30 for three until the literal last minute of the garbage time when Dozier and Bol hit 3 in a row.
So did we to be honest. Dozier and Bol Bol hit 3 in a row at the very end.
"As a Bol Bol stan, he's individually gifted but not built for the modern NBA offense at the moment.  From an offensive perspective, he has a lot of the tools that would make him an excellent player -- decent handles, good offensive footwork, decent shot. He doesn't really have a post game -- or as strong of a post game as you would like but does have a decent hook.   His defense is horrendous though and a lot of it comes with his genetic build. It really is a shame because he has decent footwork, decent defensive IQ -- all of which could use improvement -- but his body just doesn't help him out and causes it to look a lot worse than it is in reality. Its awesome that he gets garbage time minutes because he can showcase why you would want him for the future, its all about getting him to that point."
"I love Bol Bol I really hope he develops. I get that our 2 2020 Rookies have earned minutes before him, but damn I love unicorns. Just let him slowly add weight safely (very slow with trainers) and get his rebounding and blocking skills refined and he can be such a weapon."
"Shoot like Curry, big like Bol"
James “6’5” Bol Bol” Harden
This right after he passed up a wide open 3. Bol just needs more minutes. Wish Malone would play him instead of Cancar or Hartenstein.
League fucked bol bol coming for yall
need more of that stepback high-arching bol bol 3pter
Man we look good when everything is clicking... almost as good looking as that Bol Bol 3
What a dominate game by Jokic. He's absolutely a top 3 player right now.   Also did anyone catch that casual stepback Bol 3? He needs to be playing those Cancar minutes.
Wtf Bol Bol
BOL BOLLLLL
Casual Bol stepback 3
bol got his first non garbage time minutes of the year starting against durant
Fuck it put Bol Bol on Giannis. Trial by fire
"You can have all the technique in the world, and a shaq level strength with no skill is going to beat a minute bol type body with perfect technique"
"Nuggets, never will I ever root against a team composed almost entirely of homegrown talent. Plus Jokic is so god damn good and I am very high on MPJ. And they also got the one true GOAT: Bol Bol"
"I don't think he'd be 3rd man but is there any chance they can get thad? Is there any other 4 that can protect the rim and play high IQ basketball and can guard out on the perimeter? I can't think of a team as good as denver with so many disposable players, they got the assets to make something happen. Millsap and barton aint it, MPJ, bol bol, hampton, nnaji, literally all there youngins can go if it means pushing the team to a chip."
" They already have one, Bol Bol"
"RJ, Deni, Maledon, Rui, Sekou, and Bol Bol are the only ones I can think of?"
"Bc Jokic carries the offense, can't they trade for more defensive minded/Athletic dudes?  Jokic n Murray were a fucking pleasure to watch in the bubble. If they had A Siakim type stretch 4 and if Bol Bol could play, godddddam that would be deadly."
1 or 2 words...Bol.
“Lonzo Bol”
"Overrated: Bol Bol by a country mile. Everybody's begging for him to get playing time but when he does he's just awful.  Underrated: PJ Dozier. Great defensive player, good spot up 3 pt shooter, but gets zero love from the sub."
"He’s ahead in a metric - team record - that we both just explicitly agreed is the most fluid of any of the factors relevant to the MVP race.  So why are we bringing up team record with 40+ games left to play?  Or at the very least, why frame in the condescending, static manner that you did?   Which is more likely? * nuggets get to the 4-5 seed * nuggets stay at the 7 seed * nuggets fall to the 9 seed   Because when you say shit like “lmao they ain’t givin mvp to the 7 seed fam” or “lol he’s only a game and half out of the play-in game” you’re saying that you think scenarios 2 and 3 are more likely than scenario 1.  You’re entitled to that opinion, but I would disagree. I do think this current version of the nuggets has some flaws that the teams the previous two years (when Denver was the 2 and 3 seed, respectively) didn’t have. But this team also has a much higher ceiling along with that lower floor.  It’s just a much higher variance team, trying to integrate MPJ who is still learning, trying to integrate 3 rookies other than MPJ (facu, rj hampton, zeke nnaji - and that’s not even including bol bol who probably doesn’t factor in this year), trying to deal with a plethora of injuries to their wings (Harris, Barton, dozier) and their bigs (Millsap, green, and Whittington) and stitching together lineups that work.  I’m inclined to believe they will figure it out and land somewhere around the 4-5 seed than 7-9. And if that’s the case with the crazy impact numbers Jokic has had, I’m not sure how you hold that against him."
I guess Manute Bol is your GOAT
"Warriors records are funny to me. They were bad for so long, but then they had the person that excelled at a different category and looking at their leaders on bbref is hilarious.      Rebounds - No one can touch Wilt.    3pt% 3pt FT% - Curry throws everyone away   PPG, point related scores - Young Wilt got you covered   Blocks - Manute Bol is right there   Had John Stockon played for the Warriors and all their leaders would be untouchable."

"That's right, but I don't really see a spot for Boogie on the team.  They have Hartenstein signed on the cheap for backup 5, and a couple of young guys who can play the 5 in Nnaji and Bol."
Take Bol please
Manute Bol had 2086 blocks and 1457 fouls in his career for 1.432
"Manute bol: 2086 career blocks, 1457 career fouls (1.43 ratio)"
Probably Mark Eaton or Manute Bol.
Bol literally forgot to wear his jersey the other day. He’s definitely not mentally ready to play consistently this year. I think Malone was trying to throw him a bone earlier this year and he squandered it. He has talent no doubt but mentally he’s not ready
Manute Bol-like
"KD effortlessly shoots over guys like Giannis and AD even when tightly guarded by them, even coming off a torn Achilles, this year vs the nuggets they put bol bol on him who has a 7'8 wingspan and he still effortlessly got his shot off over him lol KD is just different."
Bol Bol
Whoa Whoa.. Bol Bol would like a conversion with you about this whole skinniest man in the NBA thing...
"Bol Bol for Aron Baynes, who says no?"

Bol Bol needs to get Swole Swole
Have hartenstein and bol shared the floor at all this season? Having no millsap and green really messing up our rotation man
wow they're playing bol  the disrespect

"The Nuggs are full of the high ceiling/low floor dudes. MPJ, Bol Bol, Hampton. Murray is far and away the most important of the bunch."

"I guess my top ten would look something like  Hakeem, Nash, Embiid, Mutumbo, Siakam, Oladipo, Ibaka, Deng, Manute, Bol Bol"
"Oladipo's parents are both Nigerian, but he lived in the US most of his life. Steve Nash was born in South Africa if that counts. Maunte Bol, Luol Deng are some others that I can think of."
"I don’t really know enough off the top of my head to name 10 but my top 5 would be. Hakeem, Dakembe, Embiid, Ibaka, and Manute Bol"
"? Bobans has better shooting and touch around the rim. Hes way too slow and is too big to have nba conditioning to see big minutes.   Someone who is just massive is like manute bol who pretty much didn't see a basketball till he was like 20. Boban is a serb he's been playing his whole life. Seriously go watch his stroke and tell me has no skill, boban is one of those extremely rare players who are too big for his skillset and athleticism."
"At the same time your responses are serious, so I can't really be wrong here. If you mean to be sarcastic in your post, it isn't obvious. If you mean to be sarcastic in your comments, it's even less obvious. There's nothing that oozes irony in any part of this post, you're just playing dumb and trying to deflect. Bro, seriously. Do you think Manute Bol should've been nicknamed Blockboy?      Why don't we nickname everyone similarly?   Lebron James - Chasedown Blockman   Shaq - Bigman   Trae Young - StephCurryman   Steph Curry - Bigshootman   Karl Malone - BoyTouchingman   Kawhi Leonard - Boardman"
"Damn, I didn't know that your opinion mattered when assigning NBA nicknames. Do you have a specialized phone connected to Adam Silver's office?     Why was Manute Bol never nicknamed BlockBoy? Was it because he was the complete antithesis of a boy? Was it because his nickname was created before he was such a good shot blocker? Maybe because it's too cookie cutter and Manute is the antithesis of that, no answer has sufficed."
bol
"In his era? His first few years when he was most dominate half the centers in the league were 6'9"" or shorter while wilt was 7'1"" or 7'2""  There were no Bol, Smits, Ming, Bradley, Mureșan, Eaton, Sabonis or even Mutumbo for him to go against. Wilt was the biggest guy on the court"
Yes you are correct also Bol Bol and picks but I believe it would be worth it. Hampton has a very high ceiling and might be a project so I doubt it should be involved in any trade
"LaMelo, Burks, Hood, Bol, Wood  It works in 2k so it has to work in real life."
"I feel you'd need to throw in a couple firsts tbh. Or maybe a first and hampton or bol bol. Even then idk you'd prob need amazing defenders filling up the rest of the rotation if you got murray beal and jokic, not that I'm super low on any of them defensively but in the playoffs you need a good amount of plus defenders in a rotation and none of them are."
"Murray is inconsistent maybe due to injuries,   Grant is gone,   Millsap is older and injured,   Plumlee gone and his replacement is a G league caliber(hartenstein),   Garry Harris injured,   pj dozier injured,   Jamychal Green playing very badly for two weeks and occasionally injured,   Bol Bol is useless,   Monte Morris injured,   Barton unavailable due to personal reasons,   MPJ Shooting 20% so mostly benched also due to very bad plays not just bad shooting  basically 3 people can play right now except rookies. Campazzo, Joker and Murray available only"
"Yeah ill be honest with you about Bertans..the dude got paid way too much for a glorified 3 pt shooter. He is slow, plays no d, cant assist or rebound. Literally just shoots 3 and he isnt even good that good at that. Bol Bol would have handled him easily due to Bol's athleticism that Bertans lacks."
"Are y'all gunna just trade the future (mpj, Bol bol, Hampton) and contend now are what? Trading murray is tough I feel he's inconsistent and the return for him would be nice but he is Jokic's partner in crime"
"I'm still waiting on the bench and role players to deliver. With Green, Morris, Barton/MPJ, and the rooks, there's a ton of potential there. Gotta get used to the system or playing with each other? More experience for Nnaji and Hampton? Bol Bol? IDK. Its a mess so far but if they can turn that around, watch out.   This is all just my opinion, but this could still turn out to be a REALLY good team."
"I love how Michael Malone gave Bol Bol his first real minutes of the year against Kevin Durant. Then he played him against Oubre the next game so he doesn't look like a complete dunce.  But nah giving a little run out to see if he is capable of shading this tall fucker that can't dribble or drive, only shoot 3s, that's asking for way too much.   Well I don't love it, it was some of the dumbest shit I've seen all year."
"&gt;  when they had the #1 pick he was really excited and though they were going to be contenders then they traded it away for garbage which is when he decided he wanted to go elsewhere.  This doesn't even remotely line up with anything that happened.   Barkley asked to be traded after the 1991-92 season, when they had the #9 pick, which they kept (it was Clarence Weatherspoon), but Barkley had already been traded by then.   The previous two years they had traded their first round picks (which were #16 and #20) for Manute Bol and Rick Mahorn, and apparently the Sixers failing to re-sign Mahorn in 1992 was a big reason Barkley wanted to leave.   They traded their 3rd pick (Charles Smith) on draft night for the 6th pick (Hersey Hawkins) and a future first, but Hawkins was about the same quality as Smith in their first 4-5 seasons, so even if this had been a bone of contention, it clearly wasn't by 1992 when Barkley demanded a trade.  Before that they were in the playoffs every year, so I don't know when this supposed trade of the #1 pick happened."
So why didn't Chuck just get better instead of complaining about Bol being his center
"Totally agree with what you say. What do you think happens with Bol bol? I know he's not a great player yet, but he could step onto the court for a few minutes to gain some experience.  I hope the next game Green is more successful, at the beginning of the season it seemed that he could not miss from the line of three."
"I keep calling out this sub for the Bol Bol infatuation when he gets garbage time highlights posted for just grabbing a rebound and starting the break or hitting a 3 and it's completely fine. Even to the point where this sub was pushing this narrative that Bol Bol and Gary Harris is enough for Jrue Holiday.  But then when the THT stuff was happening in preseason, this sub was getting so butthurt over his posted highlights."

Don’t let this game distract you from the fact Bol Bol should be in the dunk contest
Can’t wait in 2025 when Johnson becomes an all star along with “next kd” Bol Bol and they run a Murray Johnson Bol MPJ Jokic lineup royally fucking the league
"Yeah it seems like certain GMs value high school ranking pretty highly, I've thought Olshey to be one of these guys, maybe Ainge is another; Connelly in Denver seems to value it, nabbing a lot of late-round guys like MPJ, Bol who were injured in college, picking up Dozier (rank 24 RSCI) for nothing, getting Hampton pretty late in the draft, getting Will Barton, too. Maybe there is a useful metric in there regarding draft position relative to RSCI ranking."
Bol Bol: Am I joke to you?
You forgot Tacko and Bol Bol
"They also got Bol Bol at 44, he hasn’t played much but he has talent.   I’m surprised other front offices haven’t just gone with “take the most upside” and let the nuggets scoop up all these guys that fall in the draft"
"Idk man that Nuggets bench is pretty good, they got:  Monte Morris  Facundo Campazzo  PJ Dozier  JaMychal Green  Paul Millsap  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if it's better defensively but efficiency wise they are (even tho they don't shoot at the volume the Knicks bench does), not to mention 11-15 they are by far the best in the NBA imo. I mean RJ Hampton, Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, are all getting minutes on most teams imo."
Nuggies without Jokic would be hilariously bad. Their backup centers are Bol Bol and McGee lol + they lose their primary facilitator.
If Bol Bol was doing this shit he’d be just as popular
Bol Bol is going to dominate the league in a few years
A non meme Bol Bol. Taller KD basically
"what if the nuggets had drafted poku. then made him and joker the guards and bol bol the center, MPJ and Barton the forwards."
Bol Bol?
Yes the Nuggets are a great team. I feel like Bol should be getting more minutes as it would create extreme mismatches/more length.
Manute Bol
"""Play Bol"" or ""Free Bol."" Have they watched Bol? Obviously not."
"Bol Bol.      Nothing against him, but his stans are so damn annoying."
I Hate Bol Bol for no reason.
Bol Bol isnt that gigantic but he has the arms of a 8 foot tall man
"Too late, they still have Bol Bol in it"
How tall is Bol Bol?
"Yeah KD for Bol Bol and Will Barton sounds cool. Nice stretch 4 off the bench, reminds me of lamar odom"
they should trade him tbh I’d take him for bol bol
25/9/10. Bench him. Put in Bol Bol.
"Did your team get killed by the Denver Nuggets? &lt;==&gt; Did Bol Bol play against your team tonight? Bonus points if Gary Clark continues to build his legend as the one, true Gary.  In seriousness, it was encouraging to see the Nuggets defense perform tonight. Obviously could have been better at times, but they kept the Spurs shooting percentage bad and outrebounded them. Combined with their offense, that is a death knell for most teams if performances like this are even partially replicable."
Jesus Christ Bol didn’t even jump to block that
"I hope OKC get Mobley this year, and then Chet next year, pick up Bol Bol, and then play the lanky lads lineup of:   Shai, Poku, Chet, Bol, Mobley"
"Don't worry everyone, April is Bol Bols month."
Bol Bol looks way skinnier at this point.
Bol Bol.
Bol Bol give him minutes
"&gt;I really hate that **very rare specimens** like Bol Bol, Tacko or Bruno Caboclo become jokes in modern NBA   This should have already answered your question by itself TBH. ""Rarity"" can't really be ""grouped"" by definition. So that's already a problem.  Not to mention market, quality of the product and all that good shit"
Bro it was 100% a blowout lol. We were completely outmatched. Nuggets fans were cheering to play Bol Bol at the start of the fourth.
"This is why I also like when young guys go play overseas. RJ Hampton for instance looked much more ready to come in and play a role than Bol ever has. Or than a ton of college stars do. LaMelo as well, I think really benefited more from playing overseas than in AAU."
I can offer one Bol Bol for Stephen
Bol Bol?
Bol Bol has entered the chat
Malone was pissed at the defense in the post game. So no way he was gonna put Bol in.
Straight up DNP for Bol Bol
No Bol Bol minutes so this is a spiritual loss for my Nuggets
The people want Bol Bol
Why would we want bol?
Lebron better get Schroder on that super hearty meal plan. You can't be weighing the same as a 5'9 Bol Bol.
Bro they would just do what they're good at. Shaq bol and Bradley would stand under the basket and the other 2 would handle the ball.
"Yeah, at this point Bol Bol’s ceiling is Aleksej Pokusevski’s floor."
"Say what you want about the team constructions. I’m purely just talking about the Yao vs KP matchup.   You are severely underrating Yao and overrating KP. KP is a poor defender and a poor rebounder. The only thing he has going for him is length where he is still outmatched by Yao. It’s also not like Yao was some clunky bug like Shawn Bradley, he had legitimately great footwork and touch for a 7’6’’ guy. He would feast in the post. This is like saying Bol Bol could guard Embiid because he has good length. We both know that’s not happening..."
"Tall, slim shooters that play nothing like centers. That's about it. Poku looks like he is a 7 foot SG sometimes and Bol is more of a PF/SF."
Bol because Poku moves funny
"The main issue with Gary has been health and his declining shot.  I’ve heard some people say that they viewed the trade as basically hampton for gordon, because they felt Gary’s contract was at the point of being a negative asset and you’d need to move a first to get off of it (ofc we needed either him or Barton in the deal to match salary).  I don’t think it was an overpay, though. We would have loved to keep hampton for sure, though I’m not sure he would have been worth a top 15 pick to anyone, given the scant playing time he was able to get in our rotation. Either way, keeping and developing him would have been nice.  We basically gave up 2 guys that weren’t a part of our rotation and a 1rp to add a missing piece that fits like a glove on both ends of the floor. Seems pretty reasonable to me. Magic did well to demand hampton over bol since he’s got some true potential"
Bol Bol about to do all of these in one season.
Poku has already amassed more than 3x the minutes Bol has played in the NBA and is more than 2 years younger.   I actually don't get the Bol comparison at all lol Poku plays nothing like him.
"Honest question, would you rather have Poku or Bol?"
"That's a lot to give but to be fair OKC with all of their picks in best possible position to make this type of gambles. I'm impressed by how fast he has progressed, faster than Denver's Bol Bol who had benefit of being with organization a year before making debut."
"Prizingis, boban, tacko, that makur dude and is bol in the top 5 tallest? Then thomas, uhh jj barea can come out of retirement... i don’t even know who the shortest players even are god damn"
Bro when the Denver bubble practice videos got released I thought bol bol and jokic was gonna be the shit...
"This but Poku and Bol definetly has handles so they can be the ""guards"""
"Might also go all in and trade for Bol and Pokuševski.     Poku, Bol, Fall, Porzingis, Boban lineup would be a nightmare."
Bol Bol is from Sudan
Where is Bol Bol?
Bol Bol of course
"Manute Bol and Ralph Sampson both played on the 88-89 Warriors and they were 7'7"" and 7'4"".  That's gotta be the record and they did make the Western Conference Semis."
"If Bol EVER put his hands up on defense, he'd probably be getting 10-15 minutes a game here and there to give Millsap/Green some rest.      The dude is just not ready to play NBA basketball on that end of the court and it's infuriating as a fan to watch him ""play"" ""defense"""
"Thank you for this take, I wish we could have shipped him instead of RJ but I understand why the magic wanted him. Bol has potential but hes on a deep roster that probably won't net him many opportunities until he shows clear improvement"
Bol has the highest ceiling of them all
&gt;bol bol  fucking lakers fans
Ironically thinking Bol Bol is a big trade piece is overrating him lol.
Bol Bol. I seen people overhype him based on few good flashes of potential but he still hasn't shown he is NBA caliber player yet.
"Bol Bol. People clamor for him to get minutes because he puts up a step back 3 in garbage time. There’s a reason he only plays garbage time and it’s because he hasn’t improved his defensive IQ and he’s still as thin as a pencil. Even in those minutes he shows very little defensively, which is his best shot at cracking the rotation in any way."
Bol Bol lmao
what does bol bol got to do with any of that lol
Give the people what they want! Tacko v Bol
Honestly love me some Bol but RJ was the right choice for the Magic
"It’s a win win for you guys. I think they made the right choice with RJ from an immediate impact perspective. He has al the attributes of a great guard and, as we all saw yesterday, is ready to play in this league. Bol has crazy intangibles, but is raw af."
Bol Bol
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
"I believe we attempted to give them bol instead of hampton (along with Gary and the first). That’s what was being widely speculated, anyway. I imagine the magic probably didn’t need bol with their other long bois and wanted hampton who has flashed serious upside already.  We really wanted to hang on to hampton because that kid is going to be great. One of those moves where you look at it 5 years down the road and you say “you know, maybe both teams did alright in this deal.”"
No trade him for up and coming superstar bol bol
"Is he really slender, though? I mean he's scary tall, but it's not like he's built like Bol Bol."
"Gary Harris and a 1st were offered and the second player would be a young guy. Either Nnaji, Bol or Hampton and I believe Orlando chose RJ."
It would have been Bol Bol or Hampton no? Don’t think Nuggets would want to give both away
Bol Bol 8’13
"Bol Bol has a bright future but he’s not going to be a contributor on this team this year. I actually wanted him to be traded so he could get minutes somewhere on a less deep team, like Hampton is now on the Magic."
"No chance clippers are beating nuggets in a 7 game series,im rooting for nuggets come play-offs. This is a wild nuggets team and they still have Javale and bol bol"
"This is the team who ran a lineup of Jokic, Plumlee, Porter Jr, Bol Bol and Milsap for a few minutes in the pre-bubble scrimmages haha"
Sure but I’d much rather have given up Bol lmao
in some alternate reality Bol Bol can be KD offense with Manute Bol defense
I genuinely wanted Bol. I think he was offered and we didn't want him.
Explain Bol Bol memes
Manute Bol
"I love Tako and Bol, but soooo many carries.  2 at least on this one possession."
It's the Tacko Bol all over again
Clippers never planned on tanking during that period so they weren’t really interested in taking a dude to sit him for a couple years.   Clippers didn’t make a mistake by not taking MPJ; they made a mistake by not taking anyone else besides Robinson. Walker and DiVicenzo were still in the table.  There’s a reason the Nuggets could take MPJ and why they took a risk in Bol Bol - it’s cause to say had their young core already in place
"Even better than players, are Croatian &amp; Serbian coaches in the Euro league.  [Daj move d bol u picku materinu](https://youtu.be/y4po7uVtyNs)"
He is almost as good as bol goat bol
Boban or Bol Bol
Thunder gonna have Poku &amp; Chet backcourt for a decade. Maybe they'll grab Bol Bol on the cheap and develop him too as a wing.
Don’t forget Thon Maker and Bol Bol
Bol bol In 5
This is why bol doesn’t play. Because he isn’t STRONG enough to guard centers and isn’t QUICK enough to guard perimeter players.
Mason Plumlee wasn't our best player dude. It was Bol.
"Shaq, Mark Eaton, Manute Bol."
Zion and IT. give me the modern Mugsy-Bol pic.
which bol is which?
Find fact: Bol's full name is Bol Manute Bol
"Me being south Sudanese waiting for the offensive comment   &gt; Chris   Oh yeah that is pretty weird   Fun fact, names like Bol Bol are pretty common since some tribes do your child’s middle name as your name, and your child’s last name as your patriarchal grandfathers last name. So when someone says their full name, it’s going back in history   It’s a really good way to find out who’s related to you or not   Bonus point: some names have meanings. My name means that a child died before myself and Abuk means very beautiful or goddess"
Bol Bol will always be funny to me because it means pubic hair here in the Philippines.
smerka bol?
You mean that Bol boi?
"Play only Jokic and Bol Bol, profit."
"Since Jokic refuses to not play, I think the Nuggets should play only him and Bol Bol against the blazers and rest everyone else."
"Bol Bol about to get the start over Jokic against the Blazers, I wouldn't be counting on a Nuggets win in that one."
up there with michael malone giving bol bol his first non garbage time minutes of the year in a start to guard durant
Against 48 mins of Bol Bol
You forgot Bol Bol
Shaq/Howard/Bol/Green/Cancar lineup gonna be unwatchable
"Really the 1st game all season I don't give af if we win or lose lol, just wanna see Bol Bol for 20 minutes and I'll be happy"
Okogie - later bol   Culver - hope your second chance elsewhere is productive
not hyping the lakers up but it is true. blazer had dame or cj literally all year. lakers had kuz and tht for like 40% of the season and they still ended up with a better record.  this happened because terry stots a shit coach who does the classic secrit plays. gib bol to daem. while vogel has talent.
Think of all the Bol Bol we could get from a rest game!
Imagine the man's house fucked by a Bol Bol step back 3.
We're playing Bol Bol 40 minutes to save that guys house
Need the Suns to win so we can watch Bol Bol drop 40 and ruin a mans life
Especially considering they need to supermax Bol Bol soon too
"If ""incredible offensive talent"" means chucking everything, from everywhere, bad shot after bad shot, than he really is the MVP.  Bol Bol has proven to be a ball stopper. He wants to shoot everytime he gets minutes in garbage time, bad shot after bad shot. Yes, his shot is beautiful, but he stil isn't a basketball player, and he is not trying to play like one, when given the opportunity."
"Yeah I feel (based on limited info) like it is more attitude/effort with Bol.  He doesn't seem engaged enough on defense, and isn't trying to play the right way on offense (very trigger happy, not looking to actually keep the offense moving, set screens, etc.) I hope he figures it out as his potential is crazy and he is fun to watch."
r/nba: Bro where is Brian Scalabrine Alex Caruso Tacko Fall Joe Ingles and Bol Bol?
"To say talent is as genetic as height... yeah and no. Talent can be inherent, but it's not like there aren't players who were completely average, worked really hard and got very good. To say talent is as genetic as the size you're born into is wack. Sure, there **are** players who are born talented, but there's also the players who are just workhorses who pushed themselves to be incredible. Michael Porter Jr is a great example of the combination.  &gt;and stats this year show he can guard anyone in iso better than **anyone else his size**  Alright, well, again: who's his size? Bol Bol, Tingis Pingis, Ibaka, JaVale, Embiid. I mentioned Boban and Tacko, but they're even **larger**.  It's a no-brainer he's guarding iso better than anyone his size. He's built like a 747 and the best player to be a DPOY candidate (Embiid) has missed too many games to win an end-of-season award. I mean shit, even in wingspan, his only competition is Drummond (by sheer ape indice), Mo Bamba and Whiteside.   I'm not trying to discredit Rudy. I don't know why Jazz fans insist on ""well actually""-ing everything. **I know Rudy Gobert is a highly intelligent and efficient defender.** I'm aware that he does more than camp the paint. I just think that when you shift the competition down to that 6'11 to 6'9 forward size, the players that Bam and Ben (the #2 and #3 in the DPOY race) are outperforming are of much higher quality than the players that Rudy (who is 7'1 with a 7'9 wingspan) are outplaying."
"I think [this](https://streamable.com/d80m3w) cut to the basket through 3 defenders is really impressive, especially to cut angles so quick at that height. His over-the-back-block on [RoLo](https://streamable.com/lr892e) to stop a fast break while the rest of the Celtics were kinda sleeping is a pretty impressive show of speed and mid-air body control - would have been incredibly easy to foul Lopez on that play, and a lot of bigger guys woulda barreled through him. Mane is not an elite NBA player, but it's really impressive to me to watch Tacko's footwork as he shuts down [this](https://streamable.com/tvd4iv) drive by a much faster, 6'3"" 190 PG who tries to get around him - watch how he pivots off his toes to finish cutting right. Again, his size helps, but a lot of big guys end up on their ass if they try that.  [This](https://streamable.com/idlt9) clip of his agility training isn't anything superhuman at first glance, but when you keep in mind that this is a guy who is 6"" taller than Giannis - the same gap between Giannis and Harden - it's insane that he's able to move that well.  Then he can also just do stuff like [this](https://streamable.com/du8ib) which is mostly a show of his height but actually takes some incredible control as well to avoid a goaltend, the timing on this is really specific.  Is he the most athletic player in the league? Absolutely not. Is he the most athletic person I've ever seen over 7'3""? Probably not, but he's definitely up there - Sabonis and Sampson are the only NBA players that size who I can think of with such flexible mobility and body control, and even then they used a lot more power and strength than Fall relies on. Guys like Yao, Bol, and Eaton were certainly better players, but they weren't necessarily so mobile"
Bol Bol really seems to be failing more for skill reasons than injury at this point. He doesn't have a position and can't really guard anyone
And I have hope in my heart that Bol Bol will be the second biggest example of that. I teared up watching him and his mom at the draft table waiting for his name to be called
"Manute Bol, Muggsy, pokusevski, Charles Barkley"
"I can see Lakers fans tuning into the final Portland game hoping they lose so LA can avoid the play-in and wondering why the Nuggets are starting Bol, Nnaji, Howard, Cancar and Harrison."
bol bol probably.  maybe KJ Mcdaniels a decade ago
"The last Nets game we had Markus Howard, Bol, Vlatko, and Javale out there for an entire quarter"
I don't have the numbers but it feels like Vlatko gets more meaningful minutes than Bol Bol. They're both pretty bad atm but I trust Vlatko slightly more.
"This should be huge, last game the Nuggets had to play Bol Bol, Vlatko Cancar, and Markus Howard meaningful minutes"
Bol Bol
Bol Bol has to be one of the greatest victory cigars of all time
😂😂 Throw this metric in the trash. Bonjour Bol Bol is not top 50
Still can't believe we drafted him over Bol Bol... IT WAS OUR DESTINY DAMMIT
"I was thinking about posting this but Bol Bol could honestly be either. He gets played if we're going to win but he aslo gets played if we're going to lose too.  He's more of just an ""this shit is definitely over cigar"" than a straight up victory cigar"
"Similar for us, Bol Bol."
Bol Bol is number one in the human victory cigar power rankings. He gets bigger cheers than any nugget and it's not close.
Idk why we can’t simply spam the Giannis as roll man thing. Like who except people with Bol Bol wingspan can stop that man from catching a lob
Bol Bol
That Nuggets one gotta be the tallest **realistic** one  Jokic at 1  AG at 2  MPJ at 3  Bol at 4  McGee at 5
I can offer one Bol Bol
"I have genuinely never seen another player with as low of a motor as Bol. Dude can touch the rim without jumping and on the regular will stand right next to an opposing guard as they take a layup and do nothing, or watch as an easily grabbable board flies into an opponents hands.  &amp;#x200B;  His more recent minutes have given a little more hope, but on the season he's been awful. He's definitely an incredible talent."
"There is a reason teams didn't pick him in the Draft. Additionally, Bol doesn't seem like he gets along with the team that much. Surprising given how tight knit the Nuggets locker room is."
"He was definitely available but, Magic wanted Hampton, not Bol."
Maybe this off-season you can package him for someone but Bol was offered in trade packages? I think the nuggets were not trying to trade him.
It's Bol time
"Yeah, the worst thing is that he is backing up the best big man in the league and watching Bol makes me realise just how good Jokic is."
Bol Bol just plays garbage time. What happened to him? Is his defense that bad?
You say Kevin Knox and I raise you a Bol Bol. All Jokes aside both are young and might make it eventually.
"Disregarding all of those things..... I meannn we look real good ngl.... AG 25, MPJ 21, Murray 24, Jokic 26, and possible BOL BOL, Maybe?! probs not. But those 4 ;)))"
"For guys who are comfortably over 7 Feet, these are two of the strongest dudes. Lots of guys that tall kinda look like toothpicks like KP or Bol.    They’re giants"
"35 yr old bron bron. Rest of the nuggies were arguably better than the lakers supporting cast. Jerami grant, mpj, Gary Harris, millsap, BOL BOL"
If Bol^2 health issues are worked out and he gets a bit stronger he could be highly impactful in the NBA imo and he has the advantage of not coming into the league at 40.  [Ex-coach says he made up Manute Bol's birthday: He could've been '40 or 50' in NBA](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/ex-coach-says-he-made-up-manute-bols-birthday-he-couldve-been-40-or-50-in-nba/)
Nobody’s reputation as a shooter is more inflated than Manute Bol. My guy had 1 good game shooting and it made everyone think he was Dirk Nowitzki  14% of the 3’s Bol hit in his career came in one half
Huh? Does Bol Bol even play? Being a role player is better then being a garbage time player.
"I don't know if Manute would get many minutes in today's league either. Bol is a better fit for it. But I dunno, they just don't think he's ready. He will surpass his father's point and rebound averages immediately when he gets decent minutes, but nobody in the league can block like his dad."
Manute Bol once averaged more blocks per game in an entire season than the amount of minutes Bol Bol is averaging this season
Manute Bol is better all time but skill wise it’s Bol Bol by a land slide. Manute Bol was lacking a lot of skill and just depended on his height. Unlike his son Bol Bol. RIP Manute Bol though.
"Manute Bol actually had playing time when compared to Bol Bol, so no."
Imagine a team with three Balls and a Bol Bol.
"Russel, Wilt and Kareem unarguably have more blocked shots.  KAJ was having these 300+ blocked shot seasons when they started counting the stat; that didn't come out of nowhere (and in fact, he tapered off a bit with age). Extrapolating for the years it wasn't counted puts KAJ well ahead.  With Bill and Wilt, there's rate stats for the games that was actually observed.  Extrapolating that over their careers wasily puts them ahead.  Hakeem is so darn great that he's #4; there are guys like Mark Eaton and Manute Bol, who had better individual seasons, but did not have the longevity to get there."
"That half accounted for almost 15% of Bol’s career three pointers. In his 10 year career, he only had three seasons - counting that one - with more made threes.   One of my favorite stats: Bol had more three point attempts that game than three point makes that *season*."
With Denver it might come down to how many of guards they can get back healthy by the 1st round. Having to play Bol Bol outside of garbage minutes like they did against the Nets is not ideal.   How bad are Barton and Monte's injuries?
I heard he 69’ed Bol Bol though
"**Jokic:** Imagine a 7'3"" athletic Serbian just absolutely vibing out and shooting like 48% from deep. Nick Wright still would still disrespect him, unfortunately.  **Facu:** This would be an absolutely terrifying player to encounter. Elite defense with a slightly more imposing 6'1"" frame with like 43% from deep would be amazing.  **Bol Bol:** Just imagine a 7'5"" athletic dude who could shoot lights out. this team would be absolutely bananas to watch!"
Bol Bol would win
Can we get Bol Bol in this clip somehow?
Bol Bol &gt; Ball &gt; Ball
While yesterday's loss to the nets sucked it's still pretty impressive considering we were giving Bol Bol and Marcus Howard decent minutes and only collapsed in the 4th
I especially love the position assignments. Bol Bol - Forward
"That dude wasn't even right. Nuggets were down 5 players for injury, 3 of them starters (murray, Gordon, barton), the 6th man (morris), the next guard on the depth chart (dozier), and Millsap was resting because it was the 2nd night of a back to back. Nuggets used 3 players who are end of bench garbage time players (Howard, bol, vlatko) during meaningful minutes and the nets without Harden still barely won (and really only did so because of those 3). Congrats."
Manure Bol Bol
Bol Bol  Vlatko Cancar  Markus Howard
Bol* arena but yes
Bonjour Bol Bol=Gobert
"- That 1st quarter is crazy to rewatch with how scorching Porter Jr. was and how cold Kyrie started  - Hopefully Nash has finally learned that win probability and DJ's minutes have an inverse relationship  - I'm not sure if it's a positive for Denver that so many guys got good looks throughout the game or a negative that no one could capitalize on those looks except Campazzo  - Bol-Mcgee lineups, why Malone? Why?  - This was a very physical game, glad the refs didnt decide to get whistle happy at a random juncture of the game  - Durant with his typical quiet 30, Irving stole the show in the 3rd quarter, but Blake was the cog that kept the Nets afloat to stay within striking distance, hitting crucial shots and using the ""Curry Defense"" on Jokic(refs cant call em all)  - With no DJ, the Nets doubles and digs looked so much sharper versus the Milwaukee games"
"To be fair, the Nugs were playing Vlatko Cancar, Bol Bol, Shaq Harrison, and Markus Howard all double digit minutes. That’s not a recipe for success."
"he can slow him down for sure he is great defender LeBron on east had issues with him there was stat that showed LeBron scored least points when guarded by Gordon on average.  Check this stats [https://twitter.com/thelando\_\_/status/1217720474567958528?lang=en](https://twitter.com/thelando__/status/1217720474567958528?lang=en)  , LeBron only averaged 17 pts vs him and he played him plenty on East  Gordon also did great on guys like Kawhi just recently and Nuggets won both game vs them since trade . He is def gonna be way way better solution then Bol Bol/ Cancar loool."
"You do know those games are meaningless for Nuggets? Pretty much fine with 4 seed and didn't need to push for 3rd or something ,missing 7 injured players and resting some -vs Nets we played G leaguers Bol Bol- Howard-Cancar along our injured Barton -Murray-Dozier-Monte-Zeke we didn't play Millsap and Gordon as well .  And still Jokic played good made both games close with good stats on his own vs Jazz shooting 9-11 ,81 % shooting  putting 24-13-9 one short for TD and 29-7-6 vs Nets on b2b and as i said with only one starter MPJ. So yeah he still MVP dont worry  \^\^"
"Now that i remember that game Nuggets didn't have wing lol no MPJ no AG trade ,played 4 guard lineups . Now missing 7 players after b2b playing G leaguers Bol Bol/Howard/Cancar etc etc..  Those second lineups lost us that huge lead we built but oh well. Just shame we couldn't face each other fully healthy would be fun game Murray vs Harden etc"
today was like the first game I’ve seen where Bol Bol played non garbage time minutes. I get why they’re still developing him. 0 points and 1 rebound is pretty rough.
"Eh lol ? Jokic played with g leaguers ... Even first match Nuggets were missing players . With who you play matters and they are on different positions. If we had full team and AG to guard KD things would have been way different.  Sure Nets are missing Harden but we missing 6 players ,3 starters we played with Bol Bol ,Howard ,Cancar etc ofc KD will have easy time scoring on em. We tanked b2b game and still made it close"
"Nuggets tanked it we played G leaguers Bol Bol ,Howard etc 😁"
A game we tanked rested AG and Millsap along our injuries got to unleash Bol Bol and Howard against KD and Kyrie and still make it close. Happy with it
"First one we choked super hard  This one is just a lot of shit we're dealing with, injuries, tiredness, etc. Just happy we could compete while giving guys like Vlatko Cancar, Bol Bol and Markus Howard significant minutes."
"Bro the nuggets were giving minutes to vlatko cancar, bol bol, and Markus Howard in the first quarter tonight.  Jokic was 29/7/6 on good efficiency. This was also a b2b. You know, those spots where all the other superstars in the league sit out and rest instead of playing."
"Yeah we're playing on a back to back and our 5th game in 7 nights with 6 out of the top 10 rotation players out, can't be mad at this loss, just completely out of gas. Shit we were playing Bol Bol Vlatko Cancar and Markus Howard against Kyrie KD lineups."
"They definitely are. Though while Nets are missing Harden, Nuggets are missing 5 of their top 8 players.  I mean Cancar, Bol Bol and Markus Howard played 50 mintues tonight. Even while 21 up never thought we were running away with anything."
"I mean our bench this game hasn’t played together once. Howard, Bol Bol, and Cancar have only played garbage time except for maybe a game or two. Javale has only really played like 5 full games with the nuggets and Shaq Harrison has only played 10 games with the nuggets. Also in our starting lineup Rivers has only played 10 games, Green has only started in like 5, and Facu is an undrafted rookie who wasn’t in the rotation in the beginning of the year. It’s not just Murray who was out is what he means. It was 6 key rotational players"
"Not even mad denver lost this game. Bol bol came in in the 3rd quarter, that tells you how many inactive players they had."
Nah mike Malone deserves hell for having javale mcgee and bol bol run extended minutes together
"Running that McGee, Bol Bol lineup to start the first 4 minutes of the quarter is really coming to bite Denver in the ass"
Bol Bol just kinda out there
"My good grace, am I really looking at a front court of Javale, Bol Bol, and Cancar?"
Bol is literally all arms and legs
Bol bol is a physical manifestation of a daddy long leg
Bol bol got a rebound who cares
Bol Bol would like to speak to you
faxand bol bol a generational star fym lol
Markus Howard and Bol Bol were so terrifying they had to play KD and kyrie together to keep it from getting out of hand
Malone really put Bol Bol out there as a flex
"Man this is such a dumb game, we’re out kawhi playign well and bogie decides to turn into manute bol in the first quarter?"
"Bro lay off the 2k lol. Bol Bol has proved absolutely nothing at all, he barely got minutes and he wasn't great. Yeah he showed potential, but he's not great enough of a prospect to risk the trade. Wendell carter is just not very good either"
"Bol could be a star if given a chance IMO, I’m not gone say Bridges a full on superstar but he did show some promise this season"
"Facts. I see great potential in Marquese Chriss if they can sign him in free agency but if trading, get someone like Bol Bol, maybe Wendell Carter Jr but a two way player would help a long way most definitely"
"neither of those dudes are remotely close to a star, bol doesn’t even get minutes bruh"
I hear ya on that; I could see someone like a Bol Bol or Miles Bridges maybe.
Wenyen Gabriel and Bol Bol are overlapping in Chartum.
This man KD was shooting over Bol Bol when they had him guarding him in the regular season. I don’t see Giannis making it difficult for him one bit
Bol bol
Black hole is the opposite of Ben Simmons. That refers to someone who doesn’t pass when that’s all Simmons does. Manute Bol has hit more 3 pointers in one half than Simmons has in his entire career.
Didn't ask + bol bol to the suns
1. Bol 2. Bol 3. Bol 4. Bol 5. Bol 6. Bol 7. Bol 8. Bol 9. Bol 10. Bol
Bol Bol x 5
No I mean to the city of Atlanta.    Undersized guy with the heart of Maute Bol is the perfect embodiment of Atlanta.
Nate Robinson Yao Ming. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvjmc19RfQ.  I was looking for muggsey Bouges blocking manute bol.  Here he is blocking ewing https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvn95CTeYXs.
"Yeah it was dickish but I was hoping someone would look it up and discover this info just as you did lol. I always thought Manute Bol was the HVC, I swear this book, *Smooth Moves* I read as a kid said so. But turns out it was Chuck, and it shows lol. Thanks for digging"
Porter and Bol for filler and 2 firsts with a separate Rodgers for 2 firsts and a 2nd on the other end would be wild.
Let me guess.. you also think Bol Bol has an “African accent?”
Bol Bol
We'll trade you MPJ and Bol Bol for the Rodgers
so was manute bol not a big
Point Bol
They need to develop Bol Bol.
Free BOL BOL
"Weirdly enough, I'm from the Bay Area so I have a soft spot for the Warriors because I enjoyed how low Oracle arena attendance was when I grew up but at the time they were boring and Carmelo Anthony appealed to me most with the Nuggets. The Suns are a great team to watch but this friend of mine has too much hubris for him to realize.  &gt; Wish Murray didn’t hurt himself cause this would’ve been a hell of a series.  True, he would've bolstered that starting lineup better. I'm also ticked off how Bol Bol barely got used this playoffs but I think his lack of experience (and pure strength) makes Mike Malone hesitant to use him more"
GET BOL BOL SOME HELP
Bol Bol is in the shirt
It's time to unleash bol bol
Da fork is a BOL BOL shirt?
Play bol bol you cowards

"*OT sorta about ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES (1992), the very first game with official NBA and NBPA licenses*:  I recently found out that I have a copy of ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES *and* a working NES (*don't ask how I just figured this out*), so I gotta talk about this game. I don't want to discuss its gameplay because you already know it sucks. Rather I'd like to talk about the details it includes for the players (*nope, not graphically, because those are pretty generic*), chiefly their abilities. Each player's profile page ([MJ's profile as an example](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/images/22)) includes their FG%, FT%, 3FG%, and then 6 abilities: Running Speed, Jumping, Stealing, Blocking, Shooting Range, and Stamina. Those shooting percentages are from the 1990-91 season, and the rosters reflect the 1991-92 season. OK, you got the basics; time to look at this game's choices with player abilities.  * First, here is [a detailed scan of the game's front and back cover](https://www.covercentury.com/covers/nes/t/nes_tecmonbabasketball.jpg). Again, this is the first game ever with licenses from both the NBA and NBPA, so it can use all the real teams and players. It can put anyone it wants on the cover -- It was early-1992, so probably Michael Jordan, or Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or David Robinson. Look closely at the main player making the play on the cover -- that's Clipper **Loy Vaugt**. The Clippers weren't good in '91, weren't supposed to be good in '92, Vaught was a rookie of no note in '91 (*5.5 ppg, #13 pick in '90 draft*) .... I can't figure out the choice that was made here.  * Speaking of the timing of this game's release - it came out with rosters set for the 1991-92 season, including mega-star **Magic Johnson** on the Lakers. Except Magic retired in November of 1991 and never played for the '92 team. Oh well.   * **RUNNING SPEED:** The game shows you a bar graph for each player's ability, but over the years people have gone into the code and pulled out the specific number that Tecmo assigned to players' ratings ([all player ratings in the game are at this link](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/faqs/50445) - *scroll way down*). Ratings are out of 100, but few speeds topped 80; somehow Jeff Ruland and Magic Johnson both had an 80 speed. Ruland is a particularly egregious selection for this fast speed since he was just coming out of 4-year retirement at that point due to massive foot troubles. The fastest players in the game, with Speeds above 80, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90), Charles Barkley (90), **3)** Tim Hardaway (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), and **5)** Orlando Woolridge (81). Barkley, huh? For that matter, MJ also has no business with the best speed in the game.  * **JUMPING:** The best jumpers/leapers in the game, with Jumping above 70, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (80), Manute Bol (80), **3)** Dennis Rodman (78), Orlando Woolridge (78), **5)** Clyde Drexler (75), David Robinson (75), Hakeem Olajuwon (75), Scottie Pippen (75), Patrick Ewing (75), **10)** Elden Campbell (74), and **11)** Otis Thorpe (72). As you can see, this category sort of stands in for ""reach"" for tall centers who get lots of blocks.  * **Best Overall Athletes** in the game based on Running Speed &amp; Jumping (RS/J) are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90/80), **2)** Orlando Woolridge (81/78), **3)** Dennis Rodman (80/78), **4)** Scottie Pippen (80/75), **5)** Shawn Kemp (80/70), David Benoit (80/70), and **7)** Larry Johnson (75/70).   * **STEALING:** The best at stealing in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** Kevin Johnson (65), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (65), Michael Jordan (65), Scottie Pippen (65), Maurice Cheeks (65), Terry Porter (65), John Stockton (65), Mark Price (65), Greg Anthony (65), Michael Adams (65), **11)** Isiah Thomas (63). I'll point out that **Gary Payton** only had a rating of 45, which is oddly low, even based on the circumstances. He had just completed his rookie season in 1990-91, and his 2.0 spg were 12th best in the league despite only playing 27 mpg (*his Steal% was 5th-best in the NBA*). He had been the Pac-10 Defensive POTY and had a ridiculous amount of steals in college (*#2 in NCAA career all-time at that point*). There was both his college reputation &amp; proof as an NBA rookie that the guy was a big-time ball theft, so I'm unsure why they kept his Stealing rating as low as they did going into his 2nd season. Weirder yet, Greg Anthony graduated in '91 right before the game was developed with nearly the same amount of college steals as Payton (329 vs 321), but had no NBA success yet since he hadn't played yet, but he got the great rating (65) and Payton didn't (45).   * **BLOCKING:** The best at blocking in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** David Robinson (90), **2)** Hakeem Olajuwon (80), **3)** Manute Bol (75), **4)** Elden Campbell (72), **5)** Rik Smits (70), John Salley (70), Chris Dudley (70), **8)** Larry Nance (65), Mark Eaton (65), **10)** Alton Lister (62)  * **Best Overall Defensive Abilities** in the game based on having 40+ in Stealing &amp; Blocking (S/B) are: **1)** John Salley (40/70), **2)** Scottie Pippen (65/40), Shawn Kemp (45/60), **4)** Larry Johnson (50/50), Chris Gatling (45/55), **6)** A.C. Green (53/43), **7)** Reggie Lewis (50/40), Billy Owens (45/45), **9)** Tim Perry (40/45), Jerome Kersey (45/40), **11)** Tyrone Hill (40/40), David Benoit (40/40)  * **SHOOTING DISTANCE:** This isn't 3-point ability, as that's measured by 3FG%, but I think this affects how consistent a player is at hitting that 3FG% ... something like that. There are a bunch of guys with a 100 in this category, mostly 3-point specialists who it makes sense to give that top score to: Dell Curry, Reggie Miller, Craig Hodges, Dale Ellis, Glen Rice, and even Larry Bird (*plus others*). But for some reason they simply decided to give a 100 shooting distance ability to Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, as well. I guess they just wanted to game their own game however they needed to to make sure the 2 biggest superstars ended up putting up superstar stats no matter what.   * **STAMINA:** If a guard played almost every game, they probably got an 80+ stamina. Players with a stamina above 80 are: **1)** Michael Adams (90), Kevin Johnson (90), Tim Hardaway (90), John Stockton (90), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (90), **6)** Spud Webb (85), Terry Porter (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), **9)** Sarunas Marciulionis (83), **10)** Gary Grant (81). This last one is an obvious error since Grant had played in only 65 and 44 games over the prior 2 seasons.  * **David Benoit:** You might have noticed that David Benoit is among the best athletes &amp; best overall defensive abilities. I'm as confused as you are -- sure he was a good athlete (*was in the '93 dunk contest*), but he was also an unheralded rookie in the 1991-92 season, meaning he never even played in the NBA before this game came out. He went undrafted in 1990, played in Spain for a year, then joined the Jazz. He was a decent-not-great player at Alabama at the same time as Robert Horry, but nothing he did there (*including his defensive stats*) leads anyone to believe the abilities given to him make any sense."
The disrespect to Bol Bol :(
Bol Bol has surprisingly good handles for someone with his frame.
What’s the chances of bol bol getting or tomorrow?
Bol Bol plays for the Nuggets
Time to sub in Bol Bol
"If you're old enough to remember Celebrity Deathmatch, you should be old enough to remember Todd Bridges vs. Vanilla Ice, and Refrigerator Perry vs. Manute Bol. Spectacle celebrity boxing isn't new...what's new is that instead of being a shitty show on primetime Fox, these goofy ass promoters are trying to sell PPV watches lol."
"Both Boban and Tacko Fall have ridiculous handles for their size. Honestly they are better with the ball than Steph and Dame. For some reason their coaches refuse to put them in positions to highlight their strengths though.   I’ve never understood why their coaches don’t run them at the point. They both have the lateral quickness and athleticism to defend the Dame and Kyrie types out there. They are both deadly 3 point snipers. Unbelievable court vision and always make the right pass to find the open guy. They can score at will. Defend. Block shots. Rebound. Start and finish a fast break by themselves.   If I’m the Seattle expansion team I’m getting Boban, Tacko and a bunch of shooters like Bol Bol. League fucked."
"| |Points | Rebounds | Assists| |-|-|-|-| |Jokic | 32 | 20 | 10| |Other 4 Nuggets Starters | 30 | 18 | 1 |  Also if you throw out 1 Bol Bol assist from garbage time, Jokic had as many assists as the rest of the team put together"
Bol bol nows the time
Where the fuck is the Mcgee Bol Bol lineup
Its Bol Bol time
I see you Mike Malone. Saving Bol Bol for game 4.
We should just Bol Bol start or forfeit the 4th game
Jokic mcgee and bol
Tbh even with Jamal I dont think Denver takes this series.  Jamal aint gonna stop all these guys from getting into the painted area at will.  Now if Bol Bol got some minutes...
Be healthy and either let Bol Bol play the 5 sometimes or find a backup defensive big
Pull Gordon and unleash the Bol Bol
Why is MPJ still in with such an injury. If you want to end the young mans career just get Bol Bol to step on his back
I don't care who Bol Bol goes up against. I'd PPV that shit.
"Jokic: ""Bol Bol, you da real MVP"""
"Okay, this is actually pretty funny. If someone is Tacko Fall or Bol Bol height then they are around 6” taller than someone that’s 6’10”, which is 6” taller than 6’4”. The difference from tall to very tall is bigger than very tall to super tall. Just found that a bit humorous."
&gt;Kawhi for Bol Bol ~~Schroeder~~  FTFY
"Nuggets protect: Joker, Murray, MPJ, Dozier, AG, Morris, Barton, Nnaji.    Facu, JaMychal, Bol, Austin, and JaVale are up for grabs. Millsap retires. I doubt any of the other guys have interest or value."
"Nobody is pulling out a ruler, tall is tall unless you're built like Tacko Fall or Bol Bol, and also that percentilage is global, not nation-wide, state-wide, or city-wide. If I saw someone 6'8"" at the gas station I would think ""oh that guy's tall"" but I've seen people that tall before."
"Great answer, Denver has absolutely slain their drafts after the Mudiay fiasco (did they get a new FO after 2015?). MPJ is a beast and I’m excited to see what Bol Bol can do"
nah Bol Bol MVP 2025
Anybody would be lucky to have Bol Bol
Perfect for me because I can catch some Bol Bol G league games for cheap now.
Is that or giving minutes to Bol Bol.
How dare you besmirch the name of Bol Bol?
Why aren't they putting Bol Bol on him
Manute Bol is the tallest licensed horse jockey at 7’7”.Lil fun fact for ya.
At this point only one thing can save the nuggets. Unleash bol bol
We wanted Bol Bol :(
We wanted Bol Bol :(
Running the team through Bol Bol would change the tide for the nuggets in this series.
The fuck is Bol Bol doing in practice if he can't get minutes here?
Denver’s only answer is to start giving major minutes to Bol Bol
"See Bol, that's what you get for acting too good to be out there last game."
Ok where is Bol Bol the people demand it
Yeesh Bol isn’t even with the 3rd stringers lmao
I think it’s Bol Bol time
Unleash bol pls
Weather he’s shaken up or not dude is checked out lol it’s bol bol time
"Throw Bol Bol at them, I want our starters resting please"
At least we might see some Bol Bol action.
"Can the whole fourth quarter please just be Harrison, Howard, Cancar, Bol and JaVale/Zeki vs Carter, Galloway, Moore, Smith and Kaminsky?"
GIVE US FRANK KAMINSKY VS BOL BOL YOU COWARDS
BRING IN BOL BOL
When we gonna see Bol Bol?
We want Bol Bol now
put in bol bol
Team A has more youth to go to 50 pts. Team B is basically asking PG to do everything. I would rather put him on Odom than Lebron. Young Bron would eat up Kobe or Bol  Old Kobe would let Giannis brick everything.
"I’d expect Facu to be the least likable lol. Do people not like Rivers, Aaron Gordon, MPJ, or Bol Bol?"
There is no such thing as a shooting guard when 7’16 Bol Bol is considered one
"I reckon it'd be either be Bol Bol or Poku.  Not so much in terms of getting hated on in this sub, but just generally being slept on, because they play a skill based style that seems like it can't possibly work in the NBA"
Bol Bol future DPOY
"Tacko, Boban, Porzingis, and Bol Bol must’ve been snubbed for DPOY then I guess"
So Bol Bol is starting next season?
*Bol Bol

"Bol Bol was invited as a second round pick a couple years ago, this isn’t true."
Bol Bol 1  Markus Howard 2   Don't care about the rest.
"Did you look at my source? There are documented instances of “my bad” prior to any documented instances of Bol using it. Earlier users, like Rex Chapman, cited the phrase as being playground slang. Bol is cited as having referred to the phrase as one of a number of slang terms he’d picked up in the U.S. So, there is a bunch of evidence suggesting that Bol didn’t coin the phrase.    By contrast, the lion story is a family anecdote that, while it may be a tall tale, is not contradicted by any documentary evidence (as the “my bad” story is)."
just trade them bol bol too. Ball to bol to ball
"That is the case for many very tall players, especially ones not in basketball-heavy countries. I think Manute Bol didn't play basketball until his 20s maybe? I could be wrong.  A bit surprising for Giannis though, as Greece seems to be pretty into basketball, right? But again, must not have been interested in it until his growth spurt made him get ""recruited"" by basketball coaches I'm sure."
[Probably not](https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/the-manute-bol-theory-of-my-bad/). He definitely helped popularize it though.
Manute Bol killed a lion (not a mountain lion...a big ass Mufasa lion) when he was a youth. He used a spear though.
"The Nuggets don't have the picks. They're backed up against the Stepien Rule. They traded a lottery protected first 23-25 for Hamptoo, and consolidated more assets for Gordon. Unless Bol Bol or somebody else takes a major leap, they're locked into their roster."
Jamal Murray or MPJ + Bol Bol &amp; alot of picks
Mark Eaton  Shawn Bradley  Manute Bol
"You need Bol Bol also, and sign Liangelo. The starting lineup is Paul Ball Ball Ball Bol.   Paul passes the ball to Ball. Ball sets a screen for Ball who throws the ball out to Ball who sets up Bol."
I draft   Bol Bol as my 1  Kristaps as my 2  Kornet as my 3  Boban as my 4  Tacko as my 5
"It’s a family name. Manute’s grandfather (Bol’s great-grandfather) was named Bol Chol Bol. There’s some conflicting info about whether this relative was an uncle or a great-great-grandfather, or potentially whether there are a bunch of Bol Bol’s in the family. Grandpa Bol Chol Bol was a tribal leader and reportedly had like 50 wives and 80 children, so there are a lot of possibilities."
"I always wondered why Manute named his son Bol, when it's also his last name. It's like if Paul George was named George George or something"
Bol Bol reminds me of Manute Bol
"Dikembe Mutumbo, Manute Bol"
"Damien Lillard for Jamal murray and bol bol trade scenarios, you mean"
bol bol was lottery bound tho
Bol Bol was never suppose to be a top 5 pick though. MPJ was already seen as legit but with major health risk.
i mean it is what it is.  nuggets at that time didnt mind taking the risk wereas other teams did. cause they did the same risk w/ bol bol
Shit imagine if Bol Bol reaches his potential on the Lakers
Jamal Morris Bol Bol 2 firsts and a 2nd for Dame.  Jokic-Gordon-Dame-MPJ with the Nuggets development wins you a championship
Kuz for  bol bol?
Bol Bol laughing maniacally
"Not saying this kid won't be good, but people are making him and Chet out to be much more ""sure things"" then they are right now.  There's a reason Bol Bol who has a similar frame and displayed a similar (but toned down) skill set in HS/College is on the bench. Guys with this build have two huge obstacle to becoming great, 1) they are usually more injury prone as the game speeds up, and 2) the difference in skill required to put the ball on the floor against a high schooler vs an NBA perimeter player is immense.   This doesn't mean that both of these guys can't do it, but I think a lot of people who watch these clips and go ""omg this guy's is a sure thing successful #1 draft pick,"" don't realize how few players make that second and third jump in skill level required to do this against NBA defenses."
"Poku has played so many more minutes than Bol lol, i doubt Bol has played starter level minutes once while Poku has plenty."
"Out of the 32 games Bol Bol appeared in last year, he played more than 10 minutes three times last year. Out of 45 games played last year, Poku played LESS than 10 minutes 3 times. The game Poku scored 29, he played 40:55. That’s more than a quarter of the playing time Bol Bol got over the course of the entire season. I’m not saying Bol Bol is better than Poku, but it’s not like he’s really been given a chance to show what he’s capable of."
"Bol is a much better shooter and has insane highs aswell. I just don't rate Poku as a prospect. Hopefully, he proves me wrong."
"Bol Bol shows crazy flashes also, but he also shows a lot of bad.   Just like Poku"
"I think you're right in the regard that Poku has had a chance on a bad team to play a ton of minutes, and fail a lot. Bol just hasn't played. Nuggets can't afford for him to be bad and learn on the fly on a contending team.  But in those limited minutes, Bol's career high is 11. Poku's after one season is 29. He's scored 20+ on 5 separate occasions, and he's still younger right now than Bol was when he entered the league. Poku's lows were LOW, but he showed flashes in some extended minutes that have Thunder fans pretty excited about his potential"
"Do you think Bol will be out of the league soon, or do you still believe he could end up as a bench player in the future? I haven’t watched enough of him to judge it"
"He's like Bol Bol (if he was on a bad team). Despite the hype, I don't see any crazy potential.   Maybe, I'm blind."
"I doubt it’s possible without MPJ but Murray, Bol and as many picks as possible would be better for the Nugs"
"Would Portland be interested in trading Dame to Denver for MPJ, Bol Bol, Will Barton, Monte Morris and a couple 1st rounders? Dame and Jokic?!?!? Watch out. Then Jamal Murray comes back from injury and the Nuggets are looking scary."
As much as I love Jamal I think we need to be involved in this.  Jamal will always be one of my favorite players but this makes us maybe favorites in the west.  Every pick we have in the next 5 years + Jamal + AG + Bol + thrill  We'll then have cap space to sign another defender to replace AG.  Dame and jokic with and improved mpj is literally title favorites defence be damned
This dude is Manute Bol shaped. Hope he pans out.
"Bruh I though Bol was hooping though  (/s,after posting this does Sean like it could be a legit opinion)"
You have not seen Bol Bol play in the NBA dude is just bad. If the Nuggets could trade him for a pick in the 30-45 range they should pull the trigger. Only time he was played is blowout minutes I rather have Thanasis on the team.
Bol Bol
Bol was only drafted due to hype. This kid has actual skill.
"He's actually a good basketball player, the two situations aren't comparable. Bol is barely worth a 2nd round pick."
Hope he goes high and it’s not a Bol Bol situation
Tacko Fall? Bol Bol? White Mamba? James Hardens Fatsuit? Smh if you wanted to say you’re a casual you could’ve just told us.
I hope they pick the right people for the green room this year. I felt so bad for Bol Bol during his draft. He had this really cool suit on top of being enormous so you could always pick him out of the crowd and then he had to sit to just sit there till the second round.
Bol Bol aint in this series
"“So coach, what adjustments do we make?”  “Put bol in hoop”  *Furiously take notes*"
keep your eyes on bol bol and tacko fall 🔥
I wish Bol Bol could go to the Thunder or somewhere he could get actual minutes to develop. He's such a ridiculously good shooting talent.
"Bol Bol, Jeremiah Robinson Earl, Dean Wade"
I want to see that Manute Bol trebuchet form.
If you had a league average bench Gelo Lavar and Bol wouldn’t be starting
"*Cries in Manute Bol, Mark Eaton, and Hakeem all missing out*"
What’s Denver’s package? MPJ Bol Bol and Nnaji?
He's like Manute Bol
"I compare him to Bol Bol or Thon Maker, but get instantly hammered with downvotes when I do. Everyone else sees him as an awesome KD-esque playmaker who can do everything on offense. Easy choice for #1 overall."
I have low expectations on what Bol will become but I wouldn't send him for just a 2nd.   The potential (even if it's not likely to hit) is too enticing.
"How do you mention people like Bol Bol or even JaMychal Green and just leave out Dozier?  Forget that this post as a whole is stupid, that’s definitely the worst part"
You lost me when you mentioned BOL BOL and nothing about Zeke Nnaji. Zeke will be the most important factor outside of the big 4 next year. And BOL BOL is gone.
"Facu is 30? 31? And a rookie and look how well he performed in the playoffs.  Tacko still has time. But like I said, neither of them look ready to be a legit role player and I do think Tacko is falling behind at this point, so I’ll agree to that extent. Both of them have been underwhelming. I’m pretty sure it was Tacko or maybe it was Bol who said the amount of fan appreciation is almost hurtful because they haven’t done shit yet."
Bol is young but Tacko is 25 which aint old but in the nba I dont consider that to be super young
So is the case with bol bol. They can't guard consistently with the league changing into small ball and they will be exposed.
Will Barton + bol bol + 26 might get us something decent. Most likely not gonna happen tho
Bol bol
Bol Bol or Manute Bol both very nice with it.
"I think he is way quicker and more coordinated than those guys.  Thon had straight up bad hands, Bol is very slow."
"Nuggets trade for Bol Bol, Zeke Naaji and a 1st?"
"Yeah I'm with you. Chet reminds me of Bol Bol or Thon Maker. That type of player and you have to draft him high just because of his height. Maybe a nice role player somewhere, but not an all-star. No strength or explosiveness.  Michael Porter, Jr. looked a lot more like KD or Paul George type of walking bucket. [Infinite upside.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDaxzg0o9OU)"
Manute Bol ?
NBA should adopt rule of Live ball upon hitting rim.  This would add a new meta to the game. Imagine someone like Bol Bol just stands under the basket to tip out everything that hit rim.
Boban  Fall  Bradley  Yao  Bol  &amp;#x200B;  this team would go 82-0 and 12-0 postseason....   in winning jumpballs.
Manute Bol did it
Take Bol out and it's a better trade lmao
That is true which is why I think if Dame gets traded it’s for Murray and Bol Bol + picks still doubt he gets traded.
We can sign and trade with Barton and bol bol
Bol bol
"Durant to shoot, Manute Bol to guard"
Bol bol minute bol
"That kind of didn’t work out. And considering Nuggs haven’t played Jokic and Bol together like at all, that should be even more of a warning sign. Granted, Cousins got injured, but that was never going to be a successful pairing."
"It's for Hayes' development. If Jaxson Hayes can play PF, the amount of roster flexibility and potential lineups the Pelicans have access to goes way up. Name one combination of players besides *maybe* Bol-Jokic that could guard Hayes-Adams if it works out.          It's steeped in the same principle as Davis-Cousins."
It will be the Bol Bol era soon
Rudy (maybe a franchise player) and Bol Bol are both 7’2
"I hope I'm wrong but I think Chet is going to be a bust if he's taken in the early lottery. Just my own personal opinion on him as a prospect but I think he's going to be another Bol Bol. Insane skill set for his size but at NBA speed just isn't as effective.   To be fair, I wouldn't call Bol Bol a bust though since he somehow fell to 44 so any production from him is a W. But a 5 star recruit, ranked 4th in the country, falling to 44th a year later is insane. It's also early and maybe in 3 years we see him become an NBA starter and show flashes of greatness but I just personally doubt that happens."
"If Kevin Durant was 5'10, his jump shot would get blocked every time. If Shaq was skinny like Manut Bol, he wouldn't have been as dominant."
They’re trying to squeeze that sweet sweet Bol Bol out of you.
The anti Bol Bol.  Every time he plays he doesn't give a shit
Why didn’t he qualify as a rookie like bol bol
Manute Bol
"Whoa, whoa, Manute Bol was fun to watch, but he was not hitting threes at a good percentage lol. The form of his three point shot was something else!"
Bol had a couple seasons where he took a lot for his era. But he shot 21% for his career and made 43 in 13 years. Almost half of his career attempts came in one season. He famously made 6 in one half one time though and makes some people think he was a 3 point shooter.
"Didn’t realize Manute Bol shot threes, but Laimbeer was in the league before Bol, and Bird was definitely not a stretch big. Sure, he wasn’t small, but no way would you consider him a big in his era. He was a 3 through and through."
"Manute bol, bird tbh."
"Bol Bol, Taco Fall,  Thon Maker"
"He does compared to Bradley, Marjanovic or Bol but IIRC his wingspan is very close to his height which is basically the norm for most humans. The fact that basketball players tend to have a longer wingspan kinda skews the perception."
Bol
Bol Bol most versatile. 🐂🐂. 🍜🍜. 🎳🎳.
Bol Bol is a Bol
"I’ve seen enough, trade Bol Bol"
bol bol looks ready to be a piston
Manute Bol and Bol Bol are third cousins.
Mugsy and Manute  https://www.google.com/search?q=manute+bol+muggsy&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enTW842TW842&amp;hl=en-US&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk008_aXijbioTPsaL2cbImq6hAbxGg:1629608597653&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiG1NeM7cPyAhUSK5QKHSUJB6EQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=720&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=KPW1V9xlzlSOkM
Manute Bol 6.4 blocks per 36 minutes. Second place is Hakeem at 3.1.
Muggsy Bol.
Bruh no wonder we don’t play on Christmas Bol is our most popular player 💀
Bol Bol to be the greatest of all time.  Two of the same name.
"Carlos Boozer, Dionte Christmas, “Fat” Lever, God Shammgod (my personal favorite), Longar Longar, Bol Bol, Uwe Blab, just to name a few."
"Seriously, a basketBALL player called Bol bol. You might as well pretend theres Ball brothers who play basketball lol."
Bol Bol
Bol Bol
Bol bol is more popular than nba champion jrue holiday
"Yeah. We have 7 Power Forwards (depending on how you view MPJ and Bol). Unfortunately Millsap was just a casualty of roster construction. He’s lost a step, but he’s still a plus contributor and a great locker room guy.   *We miss you dad!*"
Lebron had more mpg in every season (lowest 33.4 last season) than Bol Bol has had in his entire playoff career (28 minutes 1 second)
I hate to spoil the party but the only place Bol Bol is incoming is the bench.
yeah who knows how far they could've gone with Jamal.. at least Bol Bol is incoming next season
Can we get 3500 dollars for Bol in a trade?
"Lmao 🤣, I can def tell the difference. Bol Bol's face looks like he's 50."
It isn't always about the numbers. Embid put up worst numbers and had a more serious injury yet went way higher. Bol has coordination and mobility issues that don't show up in the stats.
"Tacko Fall, Boban Marjanovic, Bol Bol, Luke Kornet, and Kristaps Porzingis. Not a single player below 7’2."
Bol bol had those crowns for a while now
Bol Bol would like to know your location
Honestly our same team except we have Donovan now  PG: Jamal Murray  SG: Donovan Mitchell  SF: MPJ  PF: Zeke Nnaji  C: Bol Bol
"Baze did have a career high 3pt% at 40.8%, though that was on low volume and basically only wide open corner 3s. And he's still a pesky defender, but the boneheaded plays/fouls negated his impact.  I think aside from his athleticism and motor, his biggest asset is switchability on defense, which can keep you in the league along time. And I think that's probably a big drawback for Bol Bol."
I would love for the Raptors to take a flier on Bol. I wonder if the Nuggets would be interested in a Boucher for Bol longboi swap
Al Jefferson - post moves   Matisse Thybulle - blocking jump shots from behind   DeAndre Jordan - catching lobs   Manute Bol - blocking shots without jumping   Tristan Thompson - offensive rebounding
"When Bol Bol plays, its like your dad playing against you when you were 6 years old. He’s lowered the rim so he can block all of your shots and poster you on every play."
"Shai Poku Bol and Giddey is such a dope lineup, and they're all 12 years old. I'm really hoping you guys get him"
Id slam that but we only have room for a player for player trade.  realistically we just need to get bol on a team for a 2nd rd p.
"Right, that's why we throw in Okafor. Then Garzilla can be the PF that never plays and Bol Bol can be emergency C behind Beef Stew and Kelly O.   I agree though, you're not coming out enough ahead. How about throwing in Josh Jackson (he was actually pretty decent last year) in place of Lyles?"
Trey Lyles and Okafor for Bol Bol?
"Manute Bol his rookie season Avg 5.0 BLK per game. He had 15 Blocks in a single game vs ATL on Jan 06, 1986."
"Manute Bol: Blocks. Or specifically blocks per 36, where he averaged over his career an absolutely ludicrous **6.6**. If this guy had managed a full career with regular minutes, he'd be so far ahead of the all time blocks leader it would be almost comical. Hakeem, the record holder, only averaged 3.1 per 36."
"Kings:  Pg: De’Aaron Fox (2017) Sg: Tyrese Haliburton (2020) Sf: Michael Porter jr (2018) Pf: Pascal Siakim (2016) C: Bol Bol (2019)  Passed on Luka AGAIN lol.. only cuz I wanted mpj during that draft, even with the 2nd overall, so this is my only chance now"
"Kings  2016- 8th Domantas Sabonis(11th), 59th Fred VanVleet (UFA)  2017- 5th Donovan Mitchell (13th), 10th Bam Adebayo(14th), 34th Dillon Brooks (45th)  Was kind of tore between Fox and Mitchell but I picked Mitchell. If Sac doesn’t trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I’m okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"
salaries for Bol and Dort match up... how does that sound
PG: Grayson Allen SG: Jarret Culver SF: Kyle Kuzma PF: Udonis Haslem C: Bol Bol
"Yeah. I agree.  Houston, Detroit, Philly, Minnesota give us a call! Bol can be a good commander!"
This showcased Bol really well.  Now which team here has time to give him meaningful minutes? :)
Bol Bol still has so much potential
Rock and Bol
Needs some Bol Bol as well.  Dude hates to try.
"Is horse racing the most unfair sport in the world?  I was watching a lot of oversized jockeys with amazing skills that never made it: Shaq, Manute Bol, Oliver Miller etc... Let's be honest about it they would all be jockeys if smaller…"
"yeah good that he got one before this Nuggets super team of Jokic, Murray, MPJ, and Bol Bol hits its peak."
How did Bol make the list? I think he had a few games where he shot poorly.
"Bol is amazing, can we have a pick for him?"
Bol 1.03 PPP: I sleep...  Bones 1.05 PPP: Real shit?
Manute Bol
And bol bol
"I mean you're gonna have to do that with two of the three anyways, and Zeke and Bol are prob gonna hurt the least"
"Jokic  Murray  MPJ  Barton  Gordon  Monte  PJ Dozier  Here’s where it gets tough: do we protect facu, Zeke, or bol? IMO we should go with facu cuz we have a ton of bigs but bol bol’s ceiling is really high"
"Altman has consistently been able to get his talent to develop, was happy to see Pritchert and Bol Bol filling in the stats sheets to. But Honestly what the hell happened to Jordan Bell!"
how many games would a lineup of Manute Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol win?
Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol Bol
BOL BOL
Bol bol if he was given the right training and minutes
Basketball Paul-Paul-Ball-Ball-Ball ball with Wall and Bol Bol.
I think he could be a very handy D Rose-style 6th man tbh.  Paul-Ball-Ball-Ball-Bol Bol-Wall ball
Replace Bol Bol with John Wall and you’ve got both.   Wall-Paul-Ball-Ball-Ball basketball.
Get LiAngelo in there. Chris Paul too. Bol Bol while you’re at it.  Fuck small ball.  Give me Ball-Ball-Ball-Paul-Bol Bol ball
Bol if he gets substantial minutes.
It’s a Will Barton plus a Bol Bol. Seems legit
Nuggets have both Bol Bol and Matur Maker???  Fucking demidgods 2k cheesers
Wouldn’t trade bol for lebron and AD
Manute Bol
Nah don’t want to replace the goat bol bol
"Bol Bol, because he loves himself and I would just love hearing “ Bol Bol gets the rebound, passes to Bol Bol who throws it up to Bol Bol for the alley oop"
Bol Bol
Not Bol Bol
I want to see Bol Bol playing with Poku in OKC.
"&gt;Campazzo, Morris, Green, Green, and Mcgee  McGee gone and Morris will start half the season.   I think bench lineup is Facu, Rivers, Dozier Green, Green  Nnaji, Bol, Howard and Bones still need to do a lot to get into the rotation but Nnaji probably closest to get in due to Defence"
McGee’s on the Suns so Bol has a chance to get in there if he can become a better and more reliable rim protector and post presence
"Hello, Bol Bol ^^^ImSorry"
Bol Bol
BOL BOL
Bol Bol. I really wanna see him get minutes from Denver but sadly not sure its going to happen unless he goes somewhere else.
"Idk, I wouldn’t compare him to porzingas. Porzingas, as far as he’s fallen, was a former number one pick right? Bol bol doesn’t have anywhere near that level of skill.   Also I feel like being unplayable defensively but being extremely tall is the definition of being a meme in sports"
Bol Bol
Bol Bol
UD  Boban   KP  Tacko   Bol bol
"I agree. Haven’t been too up to date on all the new thunderers, but watched a few poku highlights and he actually looks mobile, unlike bol bol. I think bol bol really is just basically a meme. The latest in a long line of freakishly long international players who are thrust towards the nba because “oh look tall!”"
"Bol Bol, he just needs to get out of Denver"
I’ll break Bol Bol’s ankles.
1. Manute Bol proportions  2. Isaiah Thomas height  3. John Wall speed  4. Shaq play style  5. DeMarcus Cousins attitude  6. PatBev defense  7. Ron Artest mental stability  8. James Johnson fighting ability
"He tries really hard in games that don’t matter. Then, when given time in the regular season, he makes sure to do absolutely nothing. Not expecting anything from Bol Bol as a big Nuggets fan. Please have one good regular season, come off the bench in garbage time game, Bol Bol. Just one to earn some extra minutes."
"Bol Bol. The way the dude moves and plays is insane for his size. I'm sure there is some kind of flaw or hole in his game I'm not seeing that has limited his playing time to now, but the flashes of brilliance he has are jaw-dropping."
"Bol Bol, hes got all the tools he just needs to work on his body some more"
"Bol Bol, Mo Bamba. I think they could both break out if they would get actual minutes somewhere. Their current teams (DEN/ORL) aren't playing them at all.   Luka Garza could join the conversation of guys like Draymond, Manu, and Jokic in terms of most successful 2nd round pick, IMO. He can score like very few others I've seen and if his defense can become even just a slight negative instead of just a black hole, that's better."
I believe if he can stay healthy Bol Bol can be a legendary player
"He was supposed to be a lottery pick though, I remember seeing him mocked as high as 3. Not a guy you would have said it about after actually getting into the league but there are tons of guys listed who never had promising NBA seasons and only ever looked like future stars in high school and college. Bol is a weird case but his pre-draft hype was high and his drop was a draft night shocker."
Bol Bol
"Then they get late picks of Jokic, Porter and Project Bol. Wish they could've kept Grant and Murray had stayed healthy for last year."
I believe in bol bol so much. he just need to get LeBron trainer and bulk up if he does he's going to destroy the league
Bol Bol
I think Poku has more potential than Bol Bol
"Barring injury, Bol Bol. He's more than a meme."
"Well because Claxton is 2 years older, Cam Thomas most likely won’t be in their actual rotation, but if he is, he’s one of he most interesting players in the league, Bol Bol is bad and they aren’t a real contender, and Maxey is just worse than THT on both ends of the floor and only really playing out of necessity because they don’t have a point guard.   THT isn’t some conspiracy theory, he’s playing because he’s really good at a very young age…"
That doesn’t make him one of the most interesting players in the league this season though still. Why isn’t the most interesting player this year Cam Thomas if that’s the case? Or Nic Claxton? Or Tyrese Maxey? Or Bol Bol? Young role players are not the “most interesting” in a league of over 400 people.
Bol Bol
I was curious so I looked it up. Only players drafted after him that have done anything are 38 Daniel gafford  41 Eric paschall 44 bol bol (hasn’t really done anything just a big name) 46 THT 48 Terrance Mann.
"If Lebron was unskilled and unathletic but also 7’7 and his name was manute bol, how good would he be"
"Dude, you should look at the average, not at the extremes.     I can provide you a lot more: Manute Bol 7'7  8'6 wingspan, Bamba 7'0 7'10 wingspan, biyombo 6'8 7'6 wingspan, THT 6'4 with 7'1, Mourning 6'10 with 7'6.5, and we could go on and on.      We could look at the other side: Svi, 6'6.5 with a 6-4.75 wingspan, Kaminsky 6-11.75 with a 6-11 wingspan, olynyk 6-10.75 with a 6-10 wingspan, jj redick 6-4 with 6-.3.25, etc. Compared to those, blake has really long arms.     That's why you should look at averages and not at extremes, and you'll notice that blake's wingspan compared to height is in the normal range, just a bit below average for the nba, but not notably so."
"Wtf  Bol Bol cold as fuck , the nuggets better play him after this summer league"
Average Rebounds Per 36 Min  Lebron (6'9) - 7.0  KD (6'11) - 6.9  Manute Bol (7'7) - 8.1  Shawn Bradley (7'6) - 9.7  Gheorge Muresan (7'7) - 10.5  Boban Marjanovic (7'4) - 15.2
You should see Bol Bol out and about haha.
Personally I’d favor Manute Bol
Manute Bol is the only player to retire with more blocks than points
BOL BOL
Can I interest you in a Bol perhaps?
Bol is hot garbage.
"I saw Bol Bol outside my apartment in downtown Denver about three days before he was leaving for the Orlando bubble.   He was cool, bent over like 20 feet to pet my little dog, then I told him good luck in the bubble but it's LeBron's year so don't try anything.   He appreciated that I 'kept it real,' haven't seen him since and he was really easy to spot."
"Your examples are bad, almost all those are legit nba players or super tall like bol bol."
I’m glad to see Jeff green finally got paid.   I’m unhappy that Bol isn’t getting more run
Bol has done nothing in the NBA and has been bad even in garbage time. Nnaji was able to fill in last year when needed and he was pretty solid. Nnaji is way better than Bol.
"Bol is too small to play center, he is a stretch 4 at best and right now his effort is lacking. Dude needs to improve his lateral quickness and his handles"
I’ll rather have Bol Bol
&gt;Unless the plan is to Bol Bol  We also have Zeke Nnaji
Unless the plan is to Bol Bol i would’ve tried to keep McGee … i love the move never was high on Gordon but can’t let him go right after trading for him …. Nuggets would’ve been in the finals had Murray never got hurt … nobody will agree with this but in today’s nba in order for Denver to win MJP has to be they best player
BOL
Why Bol Bol doesn’t start and get 32-35 minutes a game
"Nah, past present future, Bol, Bol Bol, Bol Bol Bol…."
Manute Bol
Bol Bol
Gotta be Tacko Fall currently. But all time it's gotta be either Manute Bol or Gheorghe Muresan
You have to question whether /u/anti-bol actually watched the Thunder play that season at all
"Who you getting to defend Shaq?  One 7'7"" Bol  One 7'2"" Mutumbo  One 6'9"" Afro Ninja?"
"Surprised Manute Bol was able to somewhat contain him. If you asked me if I thought Shaq's average against Manute Bol or Ben Wallace was higher, I would have laughed at you and not even answered the question. Crazy."
Bol Bol
"Pts/Reb/Ast/Stl/Blk   Bruce Bowen: 5/2/2/0/0, 5 fouls, 1 MCL tear   Manute Bol: &lt;5/&lt;5/0/0/&gt;8   Shaq: 28/15   Bob Sura: 26/9/11   Chris Dudley: x/3x/x-5/x-4/x-3, where x = field goal attempts (Dudley formula)   Enes Kanter: 20/10 and the L   Brent Barry: 1 Crip Walk"
"[no, this is about Bol Bol](https://tenor.com/view/talks-get-out-skeleton-man-gabe-the-office-gif-11873355)"
This is clearly about Bol Bol
Manute Bol was such an insane blocker.   My favorite fact about him is that Manute Bol has made 3-pointers in a game than Ben Simmons has made in his career
Manute and Bol   Sounds funny saying it like that   Also the AntetekounmBROS.
Denver because the concept of the Bol is the better part of a Tacko Bol
Bol bol is trash
"They have both Jeff and Jamychal. That’s a fine big rotation, and maybe Bol Bol will get some minutes finally too"
"Don’t forgot about bol bol. A starting line up of  Murray - 6’4”  MPJ - 6’10”  Gordon - 6’9”  Bol Bol - 7’2”  Jokic - 6’11”  The skyscraper lineup, or ‘Metropolis’."
Such a terrible contract.  Poor Bol Bol :(
"Definitely.. especially when they already have Jokic, Murray and Porter, Barton and Bol... Bol."
"Jokic is the reigning MVP, MPJ dropped 25 a game down the stretch, Murray was a 21-6-5 guy before his injury, and Aaron Gordon is a 4th option who can ballhandle, and ideally he can hit open threes, maybe he will take a step past 12 a game. Thats a championship level core, not a super team but can absolutely win a ring. Throw in good role players like Facu, Bones, Barton, Nnaji, and maybe Bol Bol if he ever becomes something, and I don't really see the issue."

Bol Bol for Wall? We got a deal Houston?
"Bol bol, though hes a better shooter"
The Bullets should trade him for Manute Bol.
"Bol Bol.  Ryan Gosling, eat your heart out."
I didn't even know that Bol Bol was bad enough for at least one person to have this opinion
ALL time - Manute Bol  Recently - Tacko or LiAngelo
Manute Bol : Anger noises
Tacko &gt; Bol
Bol Bol AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
Lol yeah keep being that delusional. Look at Bol Bol from the nuggets a decently attractive girl was sleeping with him just for the clout and fame. You are delusional if you think a woman would choose her average husband over a million dollar famous basketball play lol
"Its so funny when people say stuff like this, considering last season was the only season of his entire career AD played less than half of the season. But sure, if AD does what he has literally done every season of his career, then u/anti-bol will consider it possible.  You'd rather have Gasol *around* *the* *rim* on defense than Dwight? Yikes"
"Nellie was also a pioneer of the ""stretch big.""  Manute Bol, first 3 seasons combined in WAS: 3 3ptA.  Manute Bol, first season playing for Nellie in GS: 91 3ptA.  Later stretch bigs for Nellie would include Raef LaFrentz and some guy named Dirk who was pretty good.  Nellie also basically invented the ""point forward"" in Milwaukee with Paul Pressey and Marques Johnson, as well as being one of the first coaches to emphasize ""switchability"" on defense with Sidney Moncrief.  Nellie was also one of the first coaches to recognize international talent. Sarunas Marciulionis had the biggest early impact of the post-Soviet Euros, playing for Nellie in GS. Wang Zhizhi was the first Chinese player in the NBA, playing for Nellie in DAL. And of course, Nellie made sure he came out of the 98 draft with the greatest European NBA player ever.  And Nellie also drafted Steph Curry, the most influential player in the NBA meta today. [Even though Steph's parents didn't want him playing in Oakland.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2836520-video-steph-currys-dad-dell-told-don-nelson-warriors-not-to-draft-his-son.amp.html)  Smallball, stretch bigs, point forwards, switching defenses, international talent, and an emphasis on perimeter play - the modern NBA *is* Nellieball."
"Uwe Blab! One of the Warriors' ""killer B's"" along with Manute Bol. (Well, my section called them that for one game, anyway.)"
"Don Nelson should be included too. He's had more influence on the modern NBA than any other coach, though it wasn't as strongly affiliated with any single franchise.   Nellie is largely credited as having invented the point forward position with Paul Pressey and Marques Johnson in Milwaukee. While Rick Barry had previously played a similar role for the 70s Warriors, that was more attributed to Barry's individual ability, as opposed to a systemic choice (for instance, the Warriors' backup SF didn't run the offense when Barry rested).   Nellie was one of the early promoters of the stretch big. Even before he had Dirk and Raef LaFrentz shooting 3s in Dallas, he had Manute Bol shooting 3s for Golden State. Bol had attempted 3 3-pointers in his first 3 seasons in Washington, then he got to GS and Nellie had him shoot 91 in his first season as a Warrior.   Nellie was one of the first coaches to advocate smallball. He wanted Webber to play C, at a time when most Cs were much bigger than Webber. He wanted Billy Owens to play C, when Owens had been a SG/SF in college and for the Kings.   Nellie was one of the first coaches to promote ""switchable/positionless"" defense. He had Sidney Moncrief (6-4, 180) guarding 4 positions, leading to Moncrief becoming the only guard to win multiple DPOYs.   &gt; “People forget with Nellie – and Sidney was the key to it – we were the best defensive team in the league,” said Garry St. Jean, a Bucks assistant in the ‘80s. “We were one of the first teams to switch. Remember the double-teams we used? Nellie was ahead of his time defensively. He always studied the rules, and then he’d find a way to break ‘em. Moncrief was the cornerstone to all that.”  https://www.nba.com/news/sidney-moncrief-hall-fame-profile  Go back and watch the We Believe Warriors, and you'll see Dirk being guarded by a seemingly endless parade of similarly-shaped Warrior defenders - Jason Richardson, Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Matt Barnes, Mickael Pietrus - leaving Dirk no way to hunt for a mismatch.   Nellie was also one of the first coaches to recognize international talent. Of the Euros who came over in 1990 after the fall of communism, Sarunas Marciulionis had the biggest immediate impact playing for Nellie in GS - followed by Vlade (LAL), Drazen (POR) and Volkov (ATL), in that order. That Lithuanian connection continued well into the future, with his son Donnie helping build their national program and drafting Luka.   And of course, Nellie made sure he left the 1998 draft with the greatest European NBA player of all time.  Point forwards, stretch bigs, positionless basketball, switchable defensive lineups, and a global talent base - all defining characteristics of the modern NBA, and Nellie helped pioneer all of them. Oh, and he also drafted a revolutionary PG by the name of Steph."
Can I interest you in a Bol?
"Which bench would u rather have?   Mills,Brown,Millsap,Claxton?   Or Morris,Rivers,Dozier,Green,Green,Bol"
get him right in his bol bols
"The Nuggets aren’t realistically expecting anything from Bol Bol, and MPJ still isn’t that secondary playmaker that the Nuggets get from Murray. If MPJ continues to improve, I see him more as that solid 3rd piece"
A headkick or knee from Bol Bol would be deadly though
"I’m 5’5. I’m at the perfect height to punch Bol Bol in his balls. Aside from that, there’s nothing else i could do."
"Someone here has to be able to take Bol Bol, right? 7'2"" and 220. He's gotta be pretty weak"
"And he would have learned to time his drives.  It's not like Bol never drove once in his career.  People act like the 80s was a boxing match under the hoop, and everyone was injured all the time, but having watched MJ games it wasn't.  It was barely more physical."
"Manute Bol and Shawn Bradley managed to play in that era, I think skinny KD could manage just fine."
Are we forgetting Shawn Bradley and Manute Bol played in that era and were skinny as hell?
Giannis with average shooting = GOAT  Bol Bol with average strength = all NBA  Tacko Fall with average speed = all star  Steph Curry with average height = GOAT  Chris Paul with average height = GOAT Contender
"Exactly.  PEDs are pretty much mandatory at the elite level of sports. If you want to be the best version of yourself, it’s the next logical step. This isn’t like the Wild West days of bodybuilding where guys are just mainlining d-bol. These are Doctors giving these guys safe amounts of the cutting edge science in PEDs.  I’m all for it."
Is Bol Bol on the block? Cuz i think Cleveland wants him
"You’re spot on with your assessment  That said, throwback to when Manute Bol was a Sixer"

Counter point. Manute Bol

"i remember watching a documentary or something many years ago that said the Bullets drafted Muggsy Bogues only because they had Manute Bol on the roster, and they thought having the shortest and tallest NBA players on the same team would bring in a lot of fans."
Basically as tall as is physically possible without being physically debilitating. There’s a reason someone as unskilled and as poor of an athlete as manute bol made the league.
"Mugsy, Nate, Nash, Iverson, manute bol"
"Manute Bol, George Muresan, Shawn Bradley, Tacko Fall, mugsy"

"Monte Morris, Bol Bol, Zeke Njaji, &amp; a 1st"
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
"but playmaking is not a traditional big man role. it’s fun and great that he has that skill, but comparing him to other bigs with that as a metric makes as much sense as comparing all players in the history of the game whose last name starts with a J. it’s like overrating yao or shawn bradley or manute bol because of their height, which arguably is an incredibly defining characteristic of being a center. maybe more so than any other."
Funniest part is them putting Bol Bol in the Knicks uniform instead of MPJ 💀
"Not really  Those 2 frp are likely 25-30 range, Morris would be a good backup not sure he’s a starter caliber PG and AG who’s a good defender and decent playmaker but outside of playmaking offensively he’s nothing special and Bol Bol gets little pt"
"Gordon, Morris, Bol, and 2 FRP"
The Sixers haven't done a Bol Bol for Simmons trade yet. Not yet cause they need to come around.
Bol bol for the nuggets  Half the roster for the mavs (lol)
I like juancho I. Denver he was jokics best friend on the team.  Problem is his d is suspect and he's streaky.  I've seen make 5-8 threes in games and miss the same ones.  He can run on the break too.  I would rather have him than bol bol as our end of the bench or zeke at this point.
I went to a Bucks game back in early 90's when they played the Sixers. Barkley was phenomenal but I've never seen a player as bad as Manute Bol in the NBA. Manute would only play half court ball when rest the players were playing full  court. So when Philly was on offense they only had 4 Players while Manute would stay on defensive side of court. Bol was great at blocking shots I won't deny that but I've never seen a player literally not play offense. It was to far to run for him. If I was Barkley I'd want out of that team as well.
Bol bol
"&gt;He does not have “90% of the physical abilities of Giannis.”   Yeah, he does. Simmons came into the league more than well equipped. Simmons was also naturally more coordinated, faster, and balanced, enough to have a better handle and not go tumbling around.  Giannis came into the league as a literal new born deer. He worked his ass off, his ass off, and now has the body of a Greek statue. Giannis could easily have the fucking physical stature of Bol Bol or anybody else instead.  Simmons on the other hand entered the league, and has not shown a speck of improvement in almost any manner, physically or in skill."
Bol Bol
"MPJ Bol &amp; picks, say yes rn"
How would Philly feel about a lightly used Bol Bol?
"The problem was we didn’t have anyone else to play backup 5 since Plumlee left. I mean, that’s still kinda a problem for us, hopefully Bol^2 can take a leap this year"
Bol Bol?

Denver gotta start bol bol at sf and mpj at sg .... get on the long Boi train
"Grant, Millsap, Porter, Juancho, Vanderbilt, Cancer, KBD, Bol were all on the roster for at least some of the year.    Okay, but your argument keeps waffling from. Point to point trying to find something that sticks."
Let Bol ball
"That's just not true, also him playing doesn't mean he's starting, I said he would be good if the bench   If OKC got Bol Bol Dort would still play"
Somebody mentioned Bol Bol to the Thunder. I was like dude the fuckin tank might stop if that happened. I’m here for it.
Bol Bol is awful. He’s had 3 years to earn playing time and he’s shown nothing. Please anyone can have him
Zion probably shits the weight of Bol Bol on an off day.
Bol Bol off the bench
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe only five players in NBA history were on the All-Defensive Team in their rookie season.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (22 years old)  Hakeem Olajuwon (22 years old)  Manute Bol (23 years old)  David Robinson (24 years old)  Tim Duncan (21 years old)  None of them were first team, all of them were second.  Evan Mobley could seriously flirt with it at just 20 (!!?) years old. No Kawhi this year opens up a spot. First team is (probably?) out of the question, but I really think second team is in play. He's completely transformed the Cavs defense. Defends the paint, blocks shots, guards the perimeter, sticks with guys in space, doesn't foul. The footwork, and the way he uses his body is so advanced for his age. He looks like a multi-year vet.  Like, holy shit. I'm in love with this guy."
"March 14 1992 on a Saturday I was 15 years old I went to see Charles Barkley in Milwaukee at Bradley Center. Barkley Scored 33 points with 14 Rebounds in a losing effort against my Bucks! What stood out (literally) to me was 7'7"" Manute Bol who had 2 points and 3 fouls! Most the game he never ran down court to play offense just stayed on Bucks side of court. So Barkley scored 33 points playing 4 vs 5 on offense! Bol did get 3 blocks but only 2 rebounds! How you gonna get more blocks than Rebounds when your 7'7""??"
Bol + Poku + 3 plumbers can beat anybody in 2027
Free the Bol
Why play Bol Bol when you can play the same guys that haven’t gotten it done for last 3 years I mean right?
"People will give Kevin Durant shit for being 240 at 6'10"" or 6'11"" but Bol Bol at 7'2"" 220 needs his minutes."
"The Pelicans gave us Boogie and AD, so we need to get that Tacko Fall and Bol Bol duo."
Not biased but I swear bol would make so much sense for the youth movement in OKC.
"They're robbing us of mad entertainment, bol bol is fun to watch"
"Man, with all of the love Bol is getting in this thread, I really hope some of you are getting GM positions with your respective teams soon so the offers can flow in! Just remember, he's MVP caliber talent. lol"
"&gt;He demonstrated that he was listening to coaching during the preseason. The way he positioned himself off ball changed/improved a lot.   I remember seeing a rumor that the coach gave up on Bol learning the playbook, hopefully thats not true or Bol has started to pick up plays"
 Still a chance it could've been Bol Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean-Jacques Wamutombo
"Yeah muscle building rate is definitely genetic, but I have a hard time believing that Bol could not possibly get any more muscular given how thin he is bow. It’s not like he gained a bunch of weight but it was just hindering fat, he just hasn’t gotten any bigger at all as far as I can tell.   I dare say that even if his muscle gains weren’t especially efficient, simply having more mass would make him a more useful player by virtue of not being able to be pushed around as easily. Fat is still gonna make you harder to push around even if muscle does it better. I sincerely doubt his issue is that he is worried he will get too fat"
"Bol bol, Giddy, and sga would be so fun to watch in okc"
"No he plays SG because he only shoots 3s, and mostly immediately on catch, doesn't playmake, doesn't drive or attack the rim, can't set a screen, doesn't have a role in a PnR, doesn't offer rim protection, has never stepped in the paint on either end. There are actual stretch 4s who exist. Anyone who has watched Bol BOL play (and I'm not talking highlights) will see he is just a tall SG, and plays like it. He's an offensive blackhole, and couldn't guard anyone from 1-5 if he tried, which he doesn't."
"You guys have done stupidly well with lower draft picks, so I'm inclined to agree that it's on Bol Bol.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Malik Beasley at 19.  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
Omg Poku and Bol lineups are one thing that I never knew I needed
Bol Bol isn’t a SG lmao
"tbf, Bol Bol could easily use 20-25 lbs of fat too lol"
Honestly Bol Bol would be perfect next to Zion.
"Either they are staying loyal to him and hoping they can pull him out of his funk/immaturity/whatever else, they want him as a deep bench option and are aware that's all he would be on any team and Bol Bol is the person who isn't accepting that, or they are waiting to see if there is a trade scenario out there where he is part of a package of things to send to a team to get a playable piece."
I don’t think there is a worse NBA player that gets more undeserved praise then Bol Bol  He’s just straight up bad but people think he’s good
&gt;Imagine OKC running lineups with Bol Bol and Poku handling the ball  Why would Bol play over Dort or Mann?
Their starting five could be: PG-Simmons SG-Pokusevski SF-Bol Bol PF-Krystaps Porzingis C-Tacko Fall
"But his name wouldn't be as fun to say if he wasn't Manute Bol's son. Bol Smith is kinda fun, but not nearly as fun as Bol Bol."
"In addition to the other reply to you, I do not think there is meaningful interest around the league for Bol Bol. I do not think front offices around the league believe that he will ever be able to play acceptable defense at an NBA level, and that his offense is nowhere near as refined as it would need to be in order to make up for that. We're talking extreme bottom end of all the players in the league level of defense all things considered.   Add his attitude issues and lethargy to the mix, the likelihood that he can probably not improve his body all that much (don't think he can even get to early OKC KD weight/strength), and his tendency to play sloppy and inattentive, I do not think Bol Bol will ever be a rotational piece on an NBA team.  We are essentially talking about an elongated Dion Waiters, but with even less of a chance to score well against NBA defenders."
Not the 2K Storyline Bol Bol lol.
Bol Bol’s body frame suggests that it isn’t his level of skill that’s the concern.
raps need a center. don't know if thye would want bol bol but I'd still take him
"Dam this is the first time I've ever seen a Nuggets related post up so high on this sub, and it's about Bol lol.    Would be fun to see him and Poku play together though haha."
Trade Bol to the bulls would be nice
bo bol and tacko would be legendary
"He also doesn't account for frame. If you looked at the skeleton of Bol compared to, say, Embiid (similar height and length), it would be very obvious which of the two would be capable of putting on more healthy weight."
Bol Bol and Poku need to join up
Para Bol Bol la Bamba  Se necesita una poca de gracia
Watching Bol Bol on the Pistons or Thunder in the second half of the season going 5-17 but all 5 buckets being highlights would be pretty entertaining
"Then they just have to draft Chet and they can unleash the longboi lineup:  Giddey, SGA, Poku, Chet, Bol"
put bol bol in you can’t get much worse
"&gt; Bol Bol is a black hole shot chucker.  100% this, plus his attitude has been dogshit. I think he needs a new opportunity on a tanking team where he can try to develop, cause he's clearly not doing that on the Nuggets bench."
"Yea its kinda impossible to know how bad someone like Shawn Bradley or Bol feels when they eat enough to gain weight at any decent rate. When you get up into those extreme heights all kinds of body parts don't seem to scale in a perfectly linear fashion. Could be his stomach and/or intestines won't expand enough to accommodate processing 5000+ calories a day. Not a doctor, but i can imagine an overtaxed stomach just giving up and say enough and pooping out perfectly good protien."
"Bol Bol isn't his father though lol. Their games are pretty different, not to mention era"
"The obsession that some people have with Bol Bol is something else. And Bol Bol definitely agrees with them.   Bol was never going to be a good NBA player. All his ""potential"" was completely theoretical and ignoring massive amound of red flags. Yeah he can shoot and dribble pretty well for being that tall but when you have no speed to strength to be able to utilize that and you play like you're Kevin Durant but have the BBIQ of Javale McGee you are not going to be a good player."
You would be very disappointed. Bol is worse than Lyles. There is a reason he can't get on the court at all.
Bol bol to the bulls confirmed
We would have traded Bol if we had an offer already. Sadly there are none.
"Its Michael, and I’d start him and his wet jump shot over Bol any day."
i love you delano but you plus Svi for bol?
"I understand that completely. I’m just saying the odds are it’s still within his means to gain weight.    If I believed that the NBA does everything they possibly can to get rookies their proper nutrition, then fine I would admit that by now it’s probably a lost cause. But this is the same league where players like Embiid and Jokic were drinking Coke and Shirley Temples by the gallon— I think I’m right to be skeptical that Bol has really tried to step outside his comfort zone.   I’m a hair over 6’ and have always eaten like a bird. If I wasn’t forcing myself to hit 3000 kcals in a day I would naturally only be eating like 1700-1900 and would have stayed a twig my whole life. Like many skinny ass kids I just assumed I had trouble putting weight on— once I started force feeding to a normal level, viola! I started looking like a normal person.    Obviously comparing myself to a 7’2 giant is massively different— he probably needs 5000+ per day to start putting on decent size— but I also have a normal 9-5 job whereas Bol can essentially make eating his job. If I had the choice of getting paid to bulk, I would do it in a heartbeat."
"If you want to put it nicely, Bol is probably the only true rim protecting 3 in the league, he is a beast in space with a slick handle and a solid long pass, he can catch a lot of rebounds for a perimeter player and he can shot from anywhere both off the dribble and in catch and shoot with good percentages.  If you are being realistic about it he can't handle perimeter players outside or interior players inside, so the only way to use him reliably on defense is in some short of zone where he can just act as a rim protector (he covers well the P&amp;R, but he doesn't force the other team to use the P&amp;R against him 1 on 1, and he loses against fast perimeter players most of the time and dies against strength inside all the time, so 1 on 1 he can only really handle longboi 4s and slow 3s), he is a beast off-ball or on-ball if he has enough space to start dribbling but dies when he has a defender on him, witch every player that covered him last year knew and exploited for the easy turnover, he can shoot over said defender but not that well, he is much better in open shots, and he can't really pass well unless he is in transition, but at least this year he learned how to restart the offense by passing the ball back to the frontcourt instead of just shooting every time he has the ball.   So he is very easy to exploit both on offense and defense, but in (and more importantly against) the right lineup he can make some mayor damage.  The biggest problem with him that moves him from a situational bench player to a problem is that he has a lot of questions outside the on-court stuff. Last year he showed very little interest in the game and regressed when compared with his play during the bubble, both in the games leading to the playoffs and on the playoffs themselves. He also had questions regarding his effort before the draft. He has shown some other bad signs regarding accepting a limited role on a team, like the one that has started this post. And that's not even taking into acount the injury risk with his frame"
"Whoever gets him is gonna be disappointed. He has a lot of natural talent and he's shown flashes but he'll never piece it together since he doesn't have the work ethic. Lots of people said Ant Edwards didn't like basketball and would bust because of it, but Bol is the real answer. He only plays because he's 7'2 and because of who his dad is"
Bol Bol has the height but doesn’t have the weight/strength to be a starter. He needs some serious muscle/weight gains to be out there regularly without risking injury.
"I don't have any opinion at all, I was just remarking on the others who all seem to disagree on how well or poorly he did in various leagues.  I've watched NBA since the early 80's and have seen his old man play many times but haven't yet seen Bol Bol."
"Nic Claxton is who this reddit hopes Bol Bol will be.  He's a long, quick-footed defender with good instincts and a raw offensive game. He's got potential to eventually play 30 mins a game, but he needs to even out his offensive game and gain some muscle. He has the potnetial to hit 3's too, but he's not consistent yet."
Deni is significantly better than Bol but your point stands.
Bol for Shai who says no
"Nuggets fans, in general, are probably one of the most homeristic fandoms in the league. It’s a battle I fight daily. They love guys like Facu and Plumlee despite stats and eye-tests that clearly indicate liabilities, because the homer announcers are morons and hype them. But guys like Bol and Vando, who Hastings talks shit on, they hate despite stats and eye-tests that indicate they have significant value."
"I am telling you, watch him be unable to catch a pass that hits both of his hands before he kicks it out of bounds and you’ll have had enough. I loved his dad and actually lived near Bridgeport when he started his career. I wish bol bol was good but he most certainly is not."
"&gt; Can these dudes break the law of thermodynamics? If he can’t gain weight he just needs to eat more low density high calorie foods, no?  It's not the laws of thermodynamics. It's to do with the way you process food and build muscle, and a lot of factors go into that. When people talk about thermodynamics (or in this case energy conservation), it's more applicable to losing weight since it's impossible to support fat and muscle when at a caloric deficit.  The reverse isn't true that caloric excess will cause muscle and fat growth. It's necessary, but not sufficient. Obviously he can get bulkier, but 20-25 lbs of muscle is probably out of the question. The body will literally not synthesize muscle if it doesn't want to, although this doesn't apply to 99%. I'd imagine Bol Bol is an outlier in that regard."
"&gt; Do you support Malone’s lineups and decision, specifically regarding Bol?  Definitely.  You need to prove yourself in practice. And when you enter games, you have to play the right way. It still is basketball. Bol Bol? Black hole on offense, black hole on defense. He doesn't try on D, and just shoots everything on offense, every time. If we had a stat about 3rd stringers vs 3rd stringers, we get murdered almost every time. Why? Bol Bol.  As I stated, I don't agree he has played anything close to ""well"" in his opportunities.  &gt; Do you agree that when placed in the starting lineup against KD, he played very well and with energy and focus?   I agree he tried. That is the thing. You don't get to choose when you try. You have to play hard and the right way every single time.   &gt; Would you also acknowledge the fact that a 21 year old son-of-an-NBA-legend would probably have a strong emotional response to G.I. Malone’s military style seniority system while he’s watching guys like Dos Verdes and Austin Rivers make significant negative impacts in positions he can play?  Who cares who's son he is? He has to show _he_ belongs, and that he has the right mindset to be an NBA player. He hasn't shown that. Now, Bol Bol can't even start to thing to play Rivers position. Bol Bol isn't an SG. And Rivers _proved himself in the playoffs_. Remember? We beat Lillard/McCollum. With Rivers.  &gt; You REALLY gonna sit here and suggest that Bol Bol should be eating pine for JaMychal Green or Austin Rivers? Especially when Malone is running a 3-guard lineup with the Geriatric Duo in the front court???  YES! You have to play basketball, a team game. you have to show effort, every single time. YOU ARE NOT A STAR! You don't have _anything_ given to you, never. Bol Bol acts like he is Kevin Durant, and as he doesn't need to do the dirty work. He can rot on the bench with that mindset, he is no good at all to any TEAM with that smug attitude."
Yeah? Fred VanVleet is 5'11 and can block shots better than Bol Bol.
"I’ll honestly never understand it. Let Bol run some minutes for 5-10 games, see what happens. Malone has basically given him no chance, yet as you said Nuggets fans consistently defend Malone and put down a, in my mind, rightfully upset Bol Bol lol."
Bol Bol isn’t a Center let alone is he guarding those guys.
"I got Covid from reading this thread.  People really have absolutely no clue about what they are talking about, be it regarding Bol Bol, Nuggets or Malone. I'm truly in disbelief! lol"
Bol Bol plays as a SF. He is not a defensive presence and does not look to block shots. Bol needs to develop that side of his game
They'd turn him into just Bol
"I love the Nuggets and I’ll never understand why Nuggets fans defend the fact that Bol Bol has been underused or at the least underplayed. Jokic played 80 games his rookie year and averaged just over 20 min a game, Bol Bol has barely got run in the NBA compared to Jokic’s first two years. When he gets played he gets highlights and he gets buckets, whether that’s what Denver needs or not is debatable but it’s clear Bol Bol isn’t getting the minutes he wants or that other teams would be giving him. Play him or trade him, kind of a ridiculous situation."
"Skip over the points I made to try and use the “do you even watch” argument. Typical Nuggets fan.   Do you support Malone’s lineups and decision, specifically regarding Bol? Do you agree Bol has played well in his limited opportunities where he wasn’t given an extremely short leash (preseason, summer league)? Do you agree that when placed in the starting lineup against KD, he played very well and with energy and focus? Would you also acknowledge the fact that a 21 year old son-of-an-NBA-legend would probably have a strong emotional response to G.I. Malone’s military style seniority system while he’s watching guys like Dos Verdes and Austin Rivers make significant negative impacts in positions he can play?   You REALLY gonna sit here and suggest that Bol Bol should be eating pine for JaMychal Green or Austin Rivers? Especially when Malone is running a 3-guard lineup with the Geriatric Duo in the front court???"
"Do you even watch games?  If Bol Bol showed that he was _trying_, or commited into playing _basketball_, we could have this conversation. Bol Bol isn't a basketball player. He is a Bol player.   He will be out of the league really soon."
"&gt; Nurkic was injured Jokic's rookie season and only played 32 games, most of which were complete dog shit, and then got traded the following season after a terrible start. &gt;  &gt;   Bol Bol isn't an NBA player, period. Watch every game/minute he has played.   I'd take 4 years away from 4 year away Bruno Caboclo over Bol Bol."
All this people doubting Bol Bol talent gonna be very surprised in the future lmao. It aint his fault Mike Malone doesnt like playing him. We will se what he does when team actually gives him minutes to develop lol
someone tell me what happens when you play bol bol more than 15 minutes a night. mans legs are gonna look like kyle when he got testicles in his knees.

"The Miami Heat will take him. Bol Bol, you know you want some of them spicy girls down in south beach?! I mean to hoop too, yeah."
"It simply doesn’t vary as much as you’re saying it does, the biggest obstacle is Bol surely doesn’t *feel* like eating. He needs to force it down, and with NBA nutritionists it shouldn’t be that impossible. He needs to treat his job like a job right now."
Tall ball Bol Bol
"&gt; Calories in, calories out. It’s basically a law of physics with how true it is.   You've failed to account for metabolism, which can vary significantly from person to person (especially when genetics are taken into account), plus the factors of stomach size, feelings of fullness (or lack thereof), gut flora, digestive speed, enzymatic availability, and a whole host of other factors. Calories are calories, but the amount of fat or muscle gained for an extra 1000 calories will vary wildly from person to person, and the simple fact of the matter is that someone like Zion can eat what he feels is a comfortable diet and continue to put on weight, and someone like Bol can stuff himself well past the point of discomfort and still barely maintain his weight."
"“Stagnated” suggests he’s had a peak to begin with. Imagine being 21 in your third year and your coach still gives minutes to guys like Austin “can’t play offense to save his life” Rivers, JaMychal “lead footed goof troop” Green and “Uncle” Jeff “gets burned by even the simplest inside offense” Green, while you rot away on the bench after continually showing out in opportunities. When Bol gains momentum, Malone nips it in the bud and sits him for ages. When he shows out in practice and gets praise from said coach, he receives literally no minutes at all. The Bol hate in the Nuggets community, especially when compared to the praise this derpy fucking coach gets is egregious."
I honestly think there are 6’2 players in the nba who can back Bol Bol down.
"He absolutely can, it’s just difficult as hell. I’m only 6’4” and putting on 20 lbs is hard as hell because you have to eat yourself full and then do it again in 2 hours. And I’m not a professional athlete so the calories in for me are considerably lower than what Bol would need. It’s doable but god damn is it not fun"
"Nonono. I want to see Bol, yurts and Bam on the court together.   #FREEBOLBOL"
"I've been pulling for bol for a longtime. And I understand people wanting to see him out there. But I'm out on him. Hes just an insanely unlikable dude.   He'd probably get his trade wish if he would do a single thing to increase his value. Instead he mopes around, does immature shit all over social media, thinks he deserves more than he does and plays like shit everytime he gets a chance.  Dude went off in a couple crowdless warm up games for the bubble and that's it. Hes a novelty that won't fit in on a team until he majorly shifts his attitude.   Why should they trade him for a useless second round pick just to do him a favor? The only argument I could see is to get his toxic attitude off the team."
"To be fair, his dad was fucking Skeletor.  (With all due respect. Manute Bol was an amazing human and a personal role model.)"
"I feel bad for Bol. He gets treated like a novelty, kinda like Tacko Fall. I think it makes him feel he is a lot better than he really is.  It might be a hard reality for him to accept.  He is somewhere between being a 9th-12th man on the NBA bench or playing overseas and being a star."
"Nurkic was injured Jokic's rookie season and only played 32 games, most of which were complete dog shit, and then got traded the following season after a terrible start.  Bol Bol played 3 summer league games.  Also, he had the best Drtg of anyone on DEN that played 20+ mpg."
"Bro lmao he can't do what Jokic does. Sure, they're both slow, but Bol is weak as fuck. He's had his shot, multiple times. He just appears disinterested and plays terribly. Look at Markus Howard, he spent basically the entire season playing garbage time, except he proved he can be effective and earned his minutes, becoming a part of the rotation for the playoffs. Bol Bol is unplayable. He doesn't have a true position, he's too slow to play forward and too weak to play center. Other than shoot and maybe dribble, he can not do anything at an NBA level."
"Bol Bol slapped me outside of a Waffle House in Gallagher’s Corners, Kansas."
Will trade Goran dragic for BOL BOL
"I agree with everything you said, but hopefully he can figure it out. Bol Bol kind of reminds me of Julius Randle when he was with the Lakers (Randle obviously being much better). Randle has a me-first, superstar type game but wasn't yet good enough to earn that role and didn't have the type of game that translated into being a role player...while Larry Nance Jr was a stud role player who fit perfectly and so earned minutes over Randle despite being objectively a worse player. Randle eventually figured it out but Bol Bol has a much steeper hill to climb."
Wanna swap Facu and Bol Bol for him? Seems like a good trade to me
"As a fan of the Dubs since I was kid - long before We Believe, back when Manute Bol was on the team (Tim Hardaway and Jordan were my fav players as a kid) - I woulda been happy with just the 1 title, regardless if people think it was fraudulent or not. Getting 2 more was great. Missing out on the 3-peat due to injuries was a bit of a bummer (because Warriors woulda gone down as the GOAT team in many peoples eyes), but I will say, besides Klay and Steph outbursts, nothing on the mega-ultra team excited me as much as they did before and after KD joined.      Last season was awesome and this season is starting out incredible. I just want to see more Steph, Dray, Klay. Plus, they have something to prove. Whether or not it works out, who knows, but it's going to be damn fun to watch!"
I'll nominate Manute Bol since we have the numbers. Career 10.2 BLK%. Meaning he blocked over 10% of the opponent's 2 point attempts while he was on the floor. Career 6.4 blocks per 36 minutes.
Manute Bol averaged 6.4 per 36
Is there no way to get Bol Bol? I’d be throwing everything at Denver to try to pry him away.
Bol Bol as point guard
Boucher and Bol (both of them) all know which is the superior siege machine.
Bol Bol is done. This year is his last in the league.
So u may say Zeke Nnaji = Bol Bol Bol Bol?
and Bol is love.
Can someone please explain to me why Bol was launching so many 3s that game? He took like 10 3s which seems unheard of for a center that can’t shoot in that era
Bol is life?
Now I'm hoping in addition to Bol Bol we get his previously unknown brother Lol Bol.
Zelle Nnaji is twice the player Bol Bol is
&gt; Bol was not Lol  Yea dude because Bol was Bol
"For sure, but he's still a good 3pt shooter  Bol was not Lol"
"I think that one was crazier because Bol averaged more blocks than points in his career so he wasn't a scorer/shooter at all, and it was in the 90s before everyone was shooting 3's. And he had a trebuchet release."
This like that one manute bol game
"I'm absolutely stunned.      This has got to be one of the absolute most unexpected things in NBA history. Like Corey Brewer scoring 51 points, Aron Baynes producing a 37/16 game with 9 triples or Manure Bol hitting 6 triples in a half."
Bol Bol is an experience.
Bol Bol isn't a center.
Get bol bol off that team now that mfer never gon play over this demigod
I don't disagree this is the case but it frustrates the hell out of me. Like your working now for your next contract. If you want a change of scenery you have to actually play the game. I don't care if you don't like the coach or the org. He wouldn't have signed the min with us if anyone else wanted him. He needs to evaluate his options and take a long look at his work ethic and financial future. He has the opportunity to make generational money and he's just pissing it away by moping night in night out. The Nuggets are hard on their rooks and young guys but the legit ones play. Bol could be such a unique player and with MPJ out his skill set would fit there but there is no fucking way Malone ever gives him that role at this point. He plays the mins he deserves from my observations this season.
Maybe *now* they'll give Bol Bol real minutes ?
Would Bol Bol get consistent minutes on any nba team?
Does anyone remember that poster who said that Bol had taken a phone call during a college lecture causing the instructor to have to wait for him to finish his phone call?  Obviously might have been fabricated but iirc it sounded fairly credible.
"&gt;he has a terrible attitude.   Which, along with his injury history, is the biggest reason Bol dropped so far in the draft. There were huge motor, effort, and attitude problems while he was at Oregon.   People were just blasted as jealous or ignorant if they mentioned that on here or r/nba_draft. People just thought teams were morons for passing on him."
"I was all for the Boogie experiment. Don't think he brought toughness (or that we need it, obviously) but he is still good and the Malone connection is important.   I don't think we can realistically get either of the guys. No one wants Bol and Rivers. JMyk has pretty much played himself into an untouchable. Monte is the only guy value.   I think we'll be hard pressed to get rid of MPJ now, too.   I'd love those two guys but it is just unrealistic. Which I think gets to the heart of why we signed Barton, AG and MPJ to their contracts. They were the best bang for our buck and the ROI on any other contract wouldn't be nearly as good.   I could maybe get behind something with Zeke, Bones, and Monte for one of those two but I don't know enough about their teams to say if they need those guys."
Sad for MPJ and the nuggets but I hope this means more Bol Bol time
"It’s just feels like we need someone like Boogie. Or maybe make a trade somehow and try to get Derrick White and Ben Simmons, we got enough scorer anyway.. get rid of MPJ, Bol, Rivers, Facu, Jamaycal Green, and maybe even Monte."
Bol Bol time!
"He should seriously consider putting in effort on the floor and trying to develop his game (footwork, defensive awareness, etc.)  I really wanted Bol Bol to become a great player, but it seems (from the way the team talks about him, his own social media posts/likes, etc., his apparent unwillingness to play in the G league) that he has a terrible attitude."
Nah it's Bol Bol time ( not sure if that means significant minutes or trade Bol Bol and a pick)
Definitely a sign from the universe that the Denver Bol Bol Trade Value Rehabilitation Roadshow needs to play him with Jokic more
Its time for Bol Bol to turn into KD
They would need to 6 man Aaron Gordon and have bol bol play defensive lineups potentially at the 5 on defense and 4 on offense with jokic
I'm sure the contracts don't work out but I low-key would take him for bol bol. Feels like its a win win tbh
As a lion lover Manute Bol can suck a D
A newt bol.
"nuggets fan here, Naji is a liability. Need to trade him, Austin rivers and bol for someone decent on D"
Same here. And definitely not because when I had redemptions replaced by panini that I asked for bol bol stuff because of the memes.
Bamba/Bol was my go-to franchise in 2k20
I want Bol to succeed but oh my god a chihuahua could play better defense than him
I hope this ages like horse manure Pulling for ole Bol.
Manure Bol Heat jersey at a McDonald's sometime in the late 90s. TBH I have always wanted one for myself.
KP at his worst &gt;&gt;&gt; Bol Bol at his best. and KP at his worst is fucking useless so that should tell you how good bol is
"There's a group of Nuggets fans that despise Will Barton. He got booed in the playoffs a couple years back vs the Blazers after coming back from his injury and not looking great. I'll admit he's inconsistent and doesn't always take the best shots, but he's a do it all type of guy that is an OG Nugget and a huge part of our culture. Real Nuggets fans love Thrill, he's been with us thru it all.   The Bol thing is weird because it feels like most of us are just frustrated with him. I think most nuggs fans feel he could be special, and he will show flashes where he looks like the cheat code that he is in 2k.   But his BBIQ is so low. And when he gets garbage time minutes, he takes bad shots, doesn't try, throws behind the back passes/tries to break ankles...The thing is Malone is an old school coach and he's probably just boiling watching Bol try to put on a show instead of playing in the system and playing team basketball. We all want him to be great but he just looks lost on the court too often."
"I would say that the Barton hate is injustified and goes away quickly when he performs well, meanwhile Bol Bol definitely has something going on.   He even low key caught some strays from Monte Morris last game in the post conference for being extremely passive and out of focus on the court last game.   You would think that not having much chances he would go out there trying to destroy everyone to show what he´s worth in the few times he can get minutes but as soon as he touches the court you know why he is often out of the rotation.  Maybe other fanbases like him because they see him as a meme or something, but I am not so sure that other teams scouts think the same."
Tf? I thought Nuggets fans loved him and wanted Bol Bol to get more minutes.
"Both thunder trades make no sense, we have a stockpile of pick already and second rounders barley make a difference. Kenny is worth more than those picks. Also why would the thunder send Denver a good player AND picks for fucking Bol Bol of all players. Denver can find anyone to take his contract in the first place anyway."
Bol
Gary Harris for Bol Bol who says no
"You must have gone into the thread after a loss or after a bad play by Bol. He's actually a fan favorite.  If I had to pick polarizing players, I would say it's Michael Porter Jr. and Will Barton. Lately, Facu has become polarizing as well."
I was really hoping we could get Bol Bol from you guys as throw for the Gordon trade just for 2k Bamba Bol Bol lineup purposes lol
"As Thunder, I would not trade him for cheap (like 2nds in 40-50 estimated range and a... Bol). We are going to have a lot of youth and little continuity soon (lol, we will keep having it) so gotta keep the organizational values alive with a good, maintenance-free and kinda productive dude or two."
"IDK, he gets in, travels on a pump and go, never passes, gets bullied by big men, blown by by guards  Don't have to watch more than a couple episodes of the Bol Bol Show to lose interest"
"Muscala for Bol + a 2nd, do Thunder say yes?"
I agree both are long shots but Poku has been below a 10 PER both years in the league. Maybe it’s just because I watch all their games and way less Nuggets (so most Bol Bol I see is just highlights) but I have no faith in the guy
"&gt; I’m trying to see Bol get an opportunity. Denver got him buried  This is a pretty big part of why Nuggets fans don't like him, he's not very good and has a bad attitude but they still have to deal with a lot of outside fans hyping him up and complaining about how he needs minutes."
Nuggets fans have animosity towards bol because they know he’s not good but every other fan thinks he’s cool cuz he’s tall and looks like a stick
"Nuggets fan here to explain! It's mostly an attitude problem. He thinks he is better than what he is (he is very bad) and expects to be given meaningful minutes when he has proven time and time again that he is unplayable. He is too slow to play forward and too weak to play center, and really the only thing he can do at an NBA level is shoot, and he does! He shoots. Every single time he touches the ball. He is a black hole on offense, and while he is a good shooter, he is not nearly consistent enough to get away with it. Also, he is absolutely abysmal on defense, where he honestly doesn't even try. He's gotten opportunities to get minutes, but he hasn't shown any reason to get them.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Bol Bol, but he is not a very good player at all."
Then trade Poku for Bol. Muscala can hit the three and provides much-needed vet presence to OKC.
Worse than Poku?! At least we have seen flashes out of Bol Bol. Poku is seeing his minutes cut in half for a team starting 3 rookies right now
Lol if you think Bol Bol is an NBA caliber-player. He is worse than Poku
Because bol bol is what r/NBA thought KP was before he started playing well
"Has the thought occurred that no one wants Bol, and that’s why he’s riding the bench?"
FREE BOL BOL!
Bol Bol hated by Nuggets fans??? How can a man who barely sees the floor be hated???? I’m confused!! I’m trying to see Bol get an opportunity. Denver got him buried
"Bol Bol as mentioned, but thats because he doesn't even try.    Barton has a lot of haters but they only resurface when he has bad nights."
Poku  Bol  Scottie barnes
"Im going to go for a really counterintuitive choice and say Manute Bol. Yes he was the longest longboye of all time, but the idea of someone that was 7'7 and only 200 pounds playing in the NBA is wild to me. Looked completely made out of glass but played center against folks like shaq."
"This is a great post and question, Honestly I always wondered How Minut Bol made it, he was so tall, but his legs were soooo skinny I used wonder like how the hell did he keep his legs strong they just always looked like they'd snap lol, His son Bol Bol to me Physically also very Skinny but he's way way more skilled and yes his legs are skinny as hell but he moves so smooth, I cant wait to see him get more minutes and mature in the NBA. Another player that comes to mind is Paul Pierce, he just Physically always seemed to not work on his body, Not saying he was fat, but he wasn't a specimen at the position he played either, but he was still Box Office AF."
Bamba hustles; Bol shuffles.
"I mean, he plays in practice. If he were good, they'd play him. You think the Nugs are trying to suppress a player who can help them win? Have you watched Bol ""Bol Bol"" Bol play? He has a nice shot, but he's a sloppy player who doesn't hustle and ball watches on D."
Bol Bol?
"So yeah, I'm not saying I don't expect him to put on weight. But I also would've said the same thing about Bol when he was drafted. For reasons I don't fully understand, some guys just really struggle to add muscle, and until he proves otherwise there's always the risk that maybe Chet is one of those guys. That's all I'm saying."
"Tacko Fall vs Bol Bol on an inbounds pass, who ya got"
Bol Bol?
"I just don’t think they’re a good comparison because even though their archetype may be similar, Bol isn’t even close to Chet in terms of skills. Bol was a 2nd round draft pick, Holmgren is going #1, he’s gonna make it work for sure."
"That's the concern though- Bol has a lot of intriguing skills, but his body makes him such an utter defensive liability that it doesn't really matter. What happens if Chet also never cracks 200 lbs? There's a chance that the rest of his skillset would basically be wasted in the same way."
Chet is wayyyyy better than Bol
Surely we could bring him in and play him?  Makes sense to have Bol playing in DC like his dad?  Not that we’d give him many minutes either but it’s a cool thing to do!
I'm so afraid that Chet will fill his body out like Bol Bol.
I'm getting real sick of people who clearly haven't watched Bol Bol say stuff like this. He gives no effort in the minutes he does get.
"yea i mean hes not mo bamba but look at the season bamba is having, bol can produce too!"
"There might be a reason why he doesn't play. Its probably because he's not playing team basketball (hustle, passing, rebounding,etc.) in practice and on the court.   Coach Malone has give young players to get a chance and they have developed great. At the end of the day it might be Bol Bol's fault"
I swear these people have never watched bol play
You know he could also not be showing effort in practices.   Strange how all of the garbage time player put in effort except bol. Seems like he is the problem.
"That's the stupidest shit I ever heard. Don't act like someone who should be getting at least a handful of regular minutes on court can go and put effort in when subbed on, in garbage time after getting 7 DNP's in a row, SMH.  Management ""Bol, you don't put the effort in, if you put more effort in, you'd get more minutes""  Bol ""Ahh, I haven't actually played""  Management ""Exactly, you haven't put the effort in""  Bol ""ahhhhh"".   Bol leaves in free agency.  Good job Nuggets wasting 3 years of someones career and a 2nd round draft pick."
Anthony Bennett Payton Prichard Liangelo Ball Tacko Fall Brian Scalabrine Ben Simmons Andrew Wiggins Ish Smith Isaiah Thomas Jeremy Lin Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  Bol Bol
Except for bol
"monstars?  patrick beverley, dillon brooks, pj tucker, the morris brothers, bol bol  players who play hard and generally resemble monsters, and then a goofy ass tall dude"
"Bol Bol issues are physical and mental. Hasn't really improved his body since he's come in the league despite having one of the better strength coaches in the league.   I suppose that could be mental, if his work ethic and attitude is messing that up too, but who knows. It's all not good."
"I'm just using KD as a reference to someone that was very skinny entering the league, and how a player like that will naturally put on weight as they age.  I think more of Bol Bol's problems are mental at this point."
"I'd be surprised if he can ever get as big as KD, and KD doesn't really play center outside of weird Nets smallball units even at this point.   Realistically you'd have to be worried that Chet has a Bol Bol type of situation where that bulk will never come. The good thing is that he is quick enough to be a 3 in the NBA most likely."
"Nuggets will be fine, this will free Bol Bol - instagram bros"
"Boo bol has averaged 5mpg over the last 8 games. It doesn’t matter if they’re getting blown out by 50+ when you’re trying to earn playing time. He played 3 minutes in a blowout loss with no Jokic which tells you the coaching staff already have zero confidence in him, so yeah, it was a boneheaded play for a guy in his position."
"It is not like that bro  Jokic- Gordon- Barton- Murray- Monte  + 2 very talented kids Zeke and Bones + Jeff Green is not bad at all + thay will bring some new body before the end  That is dangerouse for anybody if Murray can be on even 80%  I didn' t count JMG, Facu, Cancar, Bol Bol, Rivers"
"Manute Bol was healthy his first 8 years in the league, which is pretty impressive since he was actually like 45."
Manute Bol would have blocked it.

It’s Bol Bol time
Yea this was gonna be my answer. Facundo and Jokic are so fun to watch together. Crazy passers and they couldn't be built more differently.      Also: Bol Bol
Bol Bol
Bol Bol
Bol Bol and yes I come from 2035
Manute Bol
Apparently they weren't seeing correctly and it was only Bol Bol in there
"He was hands down the best player in the PAC-12. Even with Isaiah Stewart, Oscar Da Silva, Okongwu, and Remy, it wasn’t really up for debate. Also that sweet 16 Oregon team with him, Bol Bol and Louis King was fucking sick. Got to catch one of their tourney games in person and he controlled everything. Knew he’d have a career in the NBA, he’s an absolute dog."
"59 blocks, Manute Bol got 397 in the season following Eaton's record."
what would you rather watch the Ball Bowl or Bol Bol
"Ah. I see. And I guess your the guy to ask, what about Bol Bol? I've been kinda following him since he was drafted a year or two back to Miami. I always believed in him and saw him in the upper to lower mid 1st round grades."
"&gt; It'd help if Malone could refrain from running him into the ground this year.  In the offseason, we lost our backup center, TC (who Malone used all the time and for everything), Grant (who we could use now). Meanwhile, we got that Hart kid that doesn't play for some reason, Bol Bol( that doesn't play), RJ that doesn't play, Zeke (never plays). Vlatko( also doesn't play)...!?:O"

Bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol bol.
Biggest surprise: Julius Randle and KD  Biggest disappointment: Oubre and Siakim  biggest disappointment is really the nuggets organization for not doing anything with Bol Bol tho
"Dtown Nuggets trading Donovan Mitchell to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. I guess you can add Rudy Gobert as well, since we drafted, then traded him for Erick Green and cash.smh The Nuggets really drafted and handed Utah both their franchise players.smh I often think about what that starting line up would’ve looked like with Murray, Mitchell, MPJ, Joker and Gobert.lol Bol bol off the bench. Wild."
"You're not getting two firsts, bol bol and Millsap their starter for Lowry  They have no one else at the other forward spot and have no depth there then"
"Lowry to the nuggets for Gary Harris, Millsap, Bol Bol, 2021 1st, future protected 1st."
"I say that and then when I actually have to say who they are it gets more difficult.   Favorite Warriors of all time definitely gets the top 3 nod. Players of all time, probably not.  Favorite Warriors 1. Steph 2. Klay 3. Draymond (how could you not have those three as the top?) 4. Rick Barry. (But I never saw him play, I just love the underhand free throw) 5. Baron Davis 6. Chris Mullin 7. Tim Hardaway 8. Mitch Richmond. (I did get to see them in person when I was a kid) 9. Manute Bol. (Spelling?) 10. Kent Bazemore (I got to meet him after a Santa Cruz Warriors game and he was super nice and actually talked, so glad he’s on the team again)"
i don't mean to sound like a dick but you literally admitted you were wrong in your bol bol hate here -- and it's unsurprising someone with a team overloaded by disappointing players projects that onto other teams' prospects  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kqctbt/rudy_gobert_responding_to_the_shaq_beef_on/gi4h53h/
"Thought about it, but I know and tend to agree with the general consensus on MPJ (I.e. as long as he stays healthy, he’s gonna be special). So I’d ask about a different player. And bol bol has long term injury concerns heading into the future so it’d be tough"
"Just curious why Nuggets excluded?  Even if you take out Murray/Jokic, where is MPJ/Bol/Hampton?"
"He is a scrub.  But that doesn't mean he can't get better.   Gobert was a scrub in the G League at 22 years old. Bol has time to improve for sure.  Scrub =/= bust in my vernacular, idk."
Calling Manute Bol a scrub is also not  accurate on top of being a dick move
"More than even Yao Ming, Shawn Bradley, or Manute Bol?"
not to mention bol has only had one season and was drafted after 9 games of college. the kid needs to develop more before you say he is a scrub. in three years if he hasn't moved/improved then you can make the claim.
Why are we calling Bol a bench scrub? He's still just in his second year after being injured for the majority of his rookie season.  Maybe wait until the end of like year 3 before we start designating players as scrubs?
"He's only 150lbs, they can't be talking about him. Bol Bol is all skill."
"Well, he isn't just some bench scrub like Bol, or a regular player like Boban. The guy is a two time DPOY, who just got a max contract. 7-foot or not, I'd say he beat the odds."
"Yeah , I understand what are you trying to say, but I will say that in today's NBA it's extremely hard to be contenders long term unless you are LeBron because other teams are also getting better and there is lot of talent  . You are also missing that our timeline revolves around Jokic who will turn 26 next month. Who knows if he wants to stay or not ? Also you need veteran to win championship who can adapt rather focusing on rookies. Sorry but we are not a rebuilding team . We are putting hopes on Bol for no reason. Even if MPJ scores a lot it doesn't matter in playoffs as you desperately need defense and I don't see MPJ becoming one soon."
BOL BOL FINALLY EXPOSED???????
Secrit play 1 thru 99 gev step cyrru the bol
Play bol bol cowards
Are we really running a 4 guard lineup right now? Do we not care about developing Bol^2 ?
"He scores 25ppg right now with ease, in the flow of the offense. If he continues right now, in an offense with him as a centerpiece, something like 28ppg with above average defense, but he's a unique superstar in that he isn't ball dominant, you still want playmakers alongside him. He's perfect alongside other stars for that reason.   Imagine if Denver hypothetical traded the farm for JB. Something like Jaylen Brown for Barton, MPJ, Hampton, Nnaji.   Murray-Harris-Brown-Millsap-Jokic  Morris-Dozier-Green-Bol-Hartenstein  That team would be so much better than any other team in the NBA. Jaylen is the perfect player alongside a Jokic, a Doncic, a Lebron, a Curry, a CP3, etc. Can literally do anything off ball. His defense is going to become underrated soon."
"Height matters too much in 2k, bol bol and boban turn into all stars"
Bol Bol isn’t getting his minutes
"People are seriously overrating how much would need to be traded for Beal especially if he asks out  Porter, Bol, and like 2 picks would prolly be enough"
lol why would Houston agree to Harden for MPJ and Bol Bol. Y’all would have to trade Murray for any chance at Harden.
Denver is looking for a trade and Siakam plays better as a 2-3rd star...imagine him playing with Jokic/Murray...MPJ could replace him in Toronto...thats if it's a three team deal though with another team..Denver has alot of good prospects like RJ hampton and Bol Bol to trade to a team that needs to rebuild
Yeah definitely. And I was thinking bol bol would be good and he looks like he doesn’t belong on a basketball court. It’s weird
"Murray and Jokic arent the reasons to be worried. This team has zero depth. The only bench player we have that's worth a damn is Monte. We drafted Nnaji and Hampton so we really don't know what we have in them, but Bol Bol looks lost. Barton is showing he can't handle the work. Dozier is a liability on offense and Campazzo is being completely misused."
"Bol ""Bol Bol"" Bol"
Is “BB” Bol Bol or Brad Beal?
"Like I said the sixers get Harden and maybe house or something. We get Simmons. Rockets get mpj, Harris, Barton and bol bol and maybe Hampton and picks from both teams. Essentially the sixers get harden for giving up Simmons and picks. Nuggets get Simmons for giving up mpj, bol bol Harris and picks. I would trade mpj for Simmons any day of the week. Simmons is an all star now who could play any position and immediately win the nuggets a ring."
"😂😂😂. Dwight was compared to him, and for the tslent that Dwight had, he has seriously underaccomplished. Btw Kobe didn't do any pushing for a lot of the better part of the decade until 08 when Phil cameback. No one at the time from 04-08 wanted to play with Kobe and even after that the reason Dwight left was because they didnt like playing with Kobe?   Shaq does teach basketball quite a lot, you just don't hear abt it. Prime example is Bol bols kid and Aayton."
"Nah. Harden would hate Denver (strip club jokes aside) if he didn’t like cp3 having the ball so much, he would hate jokic. I personally like a trade where the sixers get harden, nuggets get Ben Simmons, and rockets get mpj bol bol and thybulle + picks."
"Lol I thought Denver was the only place that didn’t want Harden. I been telling HOU fans, we’d only send Bol Bol and a later 1st at most for him 😂"
"Harden to sixers, Simmons to nuggets, mpj bol bol and thybulle + picks to rockets. Sixers and nuggets get better, while rockets immediately get a good rebuild going"
"Thats a good comparison. I could see someone like Denver panicking and offering something like RJ Hampton or Bol Bol + a first, the only issue would be matching salaries."
7 new players. 5 of which are NBA rookies. 6 if you count Bol. That’s the key. Not JG.
"They would have to send all the Picks and send Pascal to 3rd team for more picks. And still might not be enough    Possible 3 team trade:  DEN RECEIVES: Pascal, House  HOU RECEIVES: MPJ, Gary Harris, Bol Bol, 1st rd  picks(s) from DEN, ALL OF Raps picks they can trade  TOR RECEIVES: James Harden"
"Harris, Campazzo, and bol bol who says no"
"Yall need to trade murray for harden. Murray, harris, bol bol and picks. A lineup of morris, harden, barton, MPJ and jokic is top 5 easily."
"Murray, barton, bol bol and picks."
"They lost a lot of depth, especially on defense, and thought Campuzzo and Bol Bol could fill in"
Then there’s manut Bol and George Mirason (7’7) big
I think Ben Simmons and MPJ could compliment each other quite well. Ben would be a good mentor for MPJ since they have similar careers as hyped prospects/injuries and would be a good fit for the Nuggets culture.   Throw in Jokic and Boban while we're at it. Nuggets tall ball lineup...  Ben Simmons/MPJ/Bol/Boban/Jokic.
"Picturing current Bol Bol but with a round, supple Brazilian ass....  My man lookin like the letter b"
Tacko Fall and Bol Bol should be league mandated to play 36 minutes a game. Just to see what happens.
I want BOL
I still struggle to comprehend the fact that that Manute Bol game happened. One of the all-time single game outliers in sports history.
"I remember when Manute Bol hit 7 threes in a game. The next morning the sports Center guys were criticizing the team for allowing him to shoot them like it was hurting the image of basketball. Stand on Manute's shoulders, Tacko."
MANUTE BOL SHIT
Malone gives playing time based on trust established on the defensive end.  Bol is learning on that end every game.
I honestly just want bol bol to do well because I abused him in 2k my career so much and a little bit because he's manute's son
"I couldn't care less what team THJ is on. And for the record, I think Bol Bol is trash"
So much salt about a 20 year old but this sub fawns over Bol Bol highlights in garbage time in a 20 point loss
"I love that Bol Bol tried to contest at least, even if he was a little late and mistimed his contest. None of this falling over and flopping for a fake charge call. Well in that posterised ashen corpse of a man."
"The answer is that the flashes of extremely high potential are there, but he is so raw that he is often a a negative on the floor at the moment. Interestingly, he looked better with the starters the past to games bc they can cover for the fact that he is still adjusting to the speed of the game and it puts him in a clear role on O.   Malone also (right or wrong) has a very clear cut way of handling rookies. If you fuck up on the thing Malone has you working on than he yanks you. So for example, last night Bol was passed the ball and had an open 3 (which he is very good at hitting) but hesitated and then put the ball of the floor which led to a bad shot or turnover (can't remember which). He was promptly yanked.  Nuggets are in an odd spot with Bol-- he needs minutes to get better but may not get them here. And yet, that means that to trade him, they would probably have to sell low, and I don't think they are willing to do that."
"Im with you. It seems they are in the window as Boston. They have soooo many valuable assets that im legit jealous of the guys they have coming off the bench, and this is after losing grant and trading beasley. Wouldn't the smart thing be to flip a couple firsts, porter Jr., and maybe like bol bol in exchange for a 3rd player? The nuggets are one of like, 3 teams that I could think of that has enough assets where they could trade big and still have a deep championship contender.    For the last few years they've been putting on a front office master class though so im just gonna see what happens before critiquing them about it lol"
the GOAT bismack biyombo??? bol bol cant hold a light to the Toronto raptors playoff hero
Bol Bol is going to go on the show and Shaq will start doing tongue clicks FFS.
It looked like Malone started Bol last night. Hopefully he'll be getting more minutes going forward. He's gonna have to earn it though.

High altitude duel between Wiseman and Bol.
"Bol Bol is so damn slow, dude is still thinking about what to do while he's getting dunk on."
"Bol Bol as well. I'm tired of the dumb jokes about these guys. Haha yeah I get it they're tall and skinny, move the fuck on. I just feel like it dehumanizes them into some kind of freakshow."
Bol Bol
Bol Bol
Bol Bol
"Let’s be real, Bol Bol didn’t make any attempt to stop that and knew he couldn’t stop it. The title is completely misleading"
They been begging for Bol Bol to play
"Imagine Ernie telling the same “jokes” about Loul Deng being from Cameroon... or Joel Embiid being from Ethiopia... or Serge Ibaka being Cuban... or Bol Bol coming from Kenya. But really if Shaq were a comedian this kind of humor probably wouldn’t be questioned, heck, it’s barely even questioned as it is."
Bol is still getting the hang of the NBA game. Wiseman has played more minutes this season than Bol Bol in his entire career.    Wiseman forced him to make a quick decision and Bol Bol wasn't ready for it.  Really simple as to why the contest was so slow.
Oh oh! Do the one where Bol Bol swats that shit next!
"I don't think he expected him to jump from that far out lol, Bol Bol was ready to contest but jumped late. Wiseman is pretty athletic for a huge dude."
"At about 3.4 seconds you can see Wiseman purse his lips and gently blow, pushing Bol Bol back a good two feet."
James dunked on Bol so hard Manute rose from the grave to give Bol and hug.  rip manute
On a poster? Bol really didn’t jump and he probably would’ve blocked it if Wiseman was right handed.
And Bol Bol Bol... :)
Bol hit the jump button way too late

 Can’t hate on Bol there. I don’t think anyone expected him to take off and yam it from that far out
Bol Bol had that turnover where he dropped the ball and it looked like he couldn't reach down to pick it up. Like I was worried he would fall over if he tried to pick it up
"Not quite Giannis but honestly this man is better than everyone thought . He’s going to develop that handle and playing in golden state means he has to develop a 3 . I guess he is going to get the last laugh about the next Giannis .   Poor Bol one of my favorite players but you see why he started at the 3 . Hope gets more than 9 minutes next game . Him , MPJ and Jokic are going to be a video game team for the next 5-8 seasons . Hell Jokic might outlast both of them ."
I swear Bol Bol jumped twice
I’m sure bol bol could hang it for him
That is for posterizing Bol Bol! 🤣
why did bol bol react so slowly to contest that lol his arm wasn't even in the air until wiseman was already at the peak of his jump
Wiseman got him back for when Bol Bol had that clean block earlier in the game

Why start Bol Bol for less than 10 minutes of playtime
I like Bol Bol and think he has lots of upside but thay is the difference between 50 extra pounds and a full draft round right there.
And Bol nil grew up in Connecticut lol
Why you gotta do my Bol like that?
"Watching Bol Bol gives me anxiety. His legs look like they are gonna snap in half at any point.  Somebody please get this kid a fucking sandwich. Let him hang out with Harden for an off-season on a steady diet of titties, chicken wings, and frozen margaritas."
Imagine having Bol Bol up there and you just start talking swahili or some shit to him lmao
Why did nobody post the dope block bol had on wiseman in the first few minutes. As far as I'm concerned they're 1-1 in the poster department.

Bol Bol would never.

Not this. Bol grew up in Kansas so if anything he has a classic Midwestern accent. Regardless it’s definitely not what I expected.
you ever hear bol bol talk?  that's a refined cali accent right there.

Bol Bol has a refined california accent. It does not match his rugged sudanese look at all

Nuggets should trade Barton + Bol + a first for Collins. And then flip Millsap + Hartenstein for something
Bam Adebayo.  Taco Fall.  Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje (I'm pulling him out of retirement for this one).  Bol Bol.  Jonas Valanciunas.    Luguentz Dort.  I am open to more names of mainly active players if I'm missing other great names.
Manute Bol’s size + Manute Bol’s legendary 3 pt shooting + Kevin Durant’s scoring + Lebron’s handle and passing + Russel Westbrook athleticism + Scalabrine’s minutes = Bol Bol

"Nuggets don't have a G-League team. As for Bol, he is insanely bad on defense, if he was playing he might legitimately be the worst defensive player in the league.   He moves with the speed of someone like Marjanovic, but he tried to play defense like he's Covington. It makes for some very ugly defensive possessions."
"He's a project. Jokic is too good to give Bol any minutes that would help develop him. Nuggets should trade him, I know they're the team that drafted him and they have the right to not play him at all but it's really unfair to waste these pivotal years with no NBA experience at all. I want to see a tanking team trade for him so he can get 20 - 25 minutes a night."
They avoided bol and ran into hartenstein
*Cries in smol bol lineup*
I like the tall players like Bol Bol
Thank you for selling us the pick ... we were praying for Bol Bol but got someone better ...
the whole idea is to pair him with Murray and Jokic though. Denver never plays ball if they have to give up murray. MPJ and a hefty pick package is what they really have. Maybe if Washington likes guys like Dozier or Bol you throw them in too.

"Okc didn’t get a prospect for cp3 however no offense to ty Jerome.  It was a 1st, decent expiring(oubre) and slightly negative contract(Rubio) which they turned along with 2 late 1sts into a bad expiring and a mid 1st.  Add on even though cp3s on a bad contract and older, he was a little better than Lowry is now and has 2 years left.  I read on realgm that a team that trades for Lowry can’t resign him now and that’s a huge deal.  Think raptors fans on here are asking for a bit too much looking for a first and a good prospect unless the other salary is bad.    I’m talking like Gary Harris as the bad contract Barton as expiring and a 1st and Denver still is only attaching like bol bol.  Realgm trade board(suggest people check it out) also threw out stuff like just Lowry for Drummond and a prospect/1st and rarely include maxey in any Danny green deal."
"KD, Bol Bol, Simmons, Demar, LeBron so on basically any elite athlete on a fastbreak can do this."
"[KD is not an elite athlete? that is a weird ass take I’ll tell you that. ](https://youtu.be/a-2L7SR-1Ng)    Agree with Bol Bol, he’s just too long."
KD and Bol Bol aren’t elite athletes really they’re just dummy long. DeMar is way more athletic than them but he would struggle with this more just from lack of length compared to them.
"Those guys can, and they don’t do it nearly as often as Giannis. LeBron, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him do it. Bol Bol has 5 career dunks. Simmons doesn’t do it often. DeMar def doesn’t do it often. KD probably does it the most, and its less than Giannis."
Joker’s just warming up for Bol Bol

Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"Chris Bol. He plays for the Suns, I think."
"Absolutely better than last year. I’ll start with Grant. In the pre covid part of the season Grant was a 6th man for us. He was streaky on offense and inconsistent on defense. He continued to develop and earned his minutes as the season went on eventually leading to his outstanding defense in the WCF against Lebron. That’s what non-Nuggets fans saw and thought that’s the player he always is. AG is a better player than Grant for our team, no question about it. MPJ is being ignored by a lot of people, in the last two weeks this man is putting up elite numbers, crashing the boards, and playing strong defense. AG opened up the floor for MPJ and since his arrival MPJ looks like a superstar. Eons ahead of where he was in the bubble. Gary Harris is a Nuggs legend, but he has been off the court so much with injuries these last two seasons and his offense had taken a nose dive. The team was clearly better defensively with him on the floor but our offense was still stagnate. Our guard defense was never bad though without him. Our wing defense was horrendous though which is where the addition of AG elevates the entire team. There’s less need for guys to come off their man or out of their zone to help the wing defender which is what was freeing up so much offense for our opponents. The last thing is the depth of this team now. With a healthy Monte Morris we have two starting caliber guards to pick from as a 6th man. Our second unit will be Monte/Barton, Dozier/Facu, Milsap, Green, McGee with some fluidity in the positions they play. Behind them you have effective guys like Nnaji, Gary Clark, and potentially Bol and Cancar. Idk if it will be enough to take on Brooklyn, but two weeks ago I would have thought we stood no chance against them. I personally felt we over performed on the bubble and that was enough to get us to where we got. This team is much better than last years and if Mal can put up 75% of what he did in the bubble and the team stays healthy, we can win it all."

"I know Madut and Bol have different mothers, so it doesn't seem like this is true. It seems that Chris is just named after Chris Mullen and the rest have traditional African names."
"In exchange, chris mullin should have named his kid Bol."
Foot Bol
I am still so happy Bol Bol doesn’t play in Philly just to avoid the awkward conversation.  What’s that young Bol’s name?    Bol.   Yeah that 7’5 Bol.   Bol
"Ayak means ""Foot"" in Turkish and Bol means ""Plenty"". Plenty Foot."
Abuk Bol reminds me of my ramen noodles in college
He must think Bol Bol literally just lays in the sun when he’s not playing basketball
"The Nuggets are smart in realizing small market teams have to build through the draft and get under the radar trade pickups to be good. Jokic, MPJ, and Murray were all drafted as high upside medium/high risk guys. Millsap and AG were highly underrated trades that have already paid dividends. Despite Denver being a growing city and market, high profile FAs will never want to come here over LA or NY, but they are still willing to take risks and try to compete. MPJ has already been well worth the risk even if, god forbid, he gets injured tomorrow. Bol Bol is sitting in the rafters waiting for his chance.  I’ve sat through years of sucking and mediocrity to finally have a juggernaut of a young core with the league at their feet thanks to great player development and a FO who are willing to take risks to compete with the big markets."
Don’t worry bol bol will sign with you guys and get you the championship
Bol Bol
Can we enhance bol and make him a cybolg? Just give him over to Krieger.
"This is hilarious. Like yeah let's compare him to a bunch of historically dominant physical talents and ask why he isn't just as physically dominant as they were. C'mon bol, just decide to be faster."
Bol Curry is top 5
"Come to the nuggets bro, comeback kids, Underdogs, getting better every year, generational talent in jokic and MPJ, showtime glue guy in Aaron gordon and the Guin as emotional leader.  Bol!!!"
So you're asking why bol bol doesn't move like Kareem?
Not a fair comparison at all. While he may never be a good player bol definitely has a chance to be one. At the end of the day one of those players has the skillset to put the ball in the basket and the other can’t.
Bol Bol and Evan Fournier
Seth+Bol = KD?
Bol Bol and Lonzo
Isaiah Thomas and Bol Bol
Seth Curry &amp; Bol Bol
I heard he's a cross between Mugsy Bogues and Bol Bol.
Moses is such a fun story. He was the number 2 center prospect coming outta high school only behind Bol Bol. After his one year at UCLA he looked bust bound but has turned himself into a diamond in the rough.
"The first two, sure. Bol? Are you joking."
Ah yes bol bol.   Now I know you're a troll and I shouldn't waste my time. Thanks.
MPJ? Murray? His coach even has Bol Bol sitting on the bench
Ngl I think Bol Bol is scarier.
BOL BOL
Definitely bol bol
Fred is a 6 foot Manute Bol
I'm 8 inches taller but only 10 or so pounds heavier and I'm not exactly skinny like Brandon Ingram or Bol Bol. If that's accurate that's pretty impressive.
"We also have two players under 6' though lol. Last year during the bubble we were one of the tallest average teams of all time cause we had Jokic, Plumlee, Bol Bol, Grant, etc."
"Nuggets are up there - Jokic, Bol Bol, Javale, MPJ"
Bol bol finals mvp?
"Yeah you’re right it’d be Bol Bol, Greg Whittington then Jokic"
I was so excited after the first quarter because I thought we might get a whole quarter of Bol. The bench had other plans unfortunately.
The Nuggets took a chance at MPJ when he was projected Top 3 before injury and now look at his improvement. I really hope Bol has the same story.
Bol bol
I love seeing Bol ball out
But then you don't get to see Bol.
Lol I was preparing myself for some Bol Bol time.
I see bol I know the games over and I can go to bed
This. Bol minutes are the most crucial thing in a Nuggets game.
No it's not. You're rather push it another 10 points and have Bol and the scrubs on for the last quarter instead of having to keep the starters on
"Nuggets are the best watch in basketball between Jokic, Murray, Gordon and also MPJ. On some occasions Bol Bol. These jerseys kinda ugly tho."
"As talented as Bol is, he doesn’t have that smoothness that Poku does. I’m calling it now - I think Poku will be a Giannis type prospect"
NONONONO I dont wanna see another lottery pick with tons of potential be stuck in the 3rd string for 4 years. Give Mamba and Bol minutes
This should have been Bol Bol
Bol would likely also see a lot of time on the thunder
"Jokic, Murray, Bol Bol, MPJ, Gordon"
"I am just saying that you qualifier of a '7 footer that can dribble shot fake from outside the perimeter into an effortless layup' doesnt mean anything meaningful. He is intriguing for sure. I just think Bol Bol is a version that occurs with him, where at this point, Bol is unplayable against actual rotation players. And while he does need time to get better, his high center of balance means he gets knocked around really easily. Playing time isnt going to make that any better. Young players with unique playstyles and bodies have a wide range of outcomes."
I don’t think the juries out on Bol Bol yet. He’s on a good team so he may never get the minutes he needs to meaningfully develop. Meanwhile Poku is playing like 22mpg for the Thunder.
"I like that we're pushing for the play-in. And this is the more popular decision for the players on the team.  Maybe Lauri Markkanen/Colby White or Kevin Knox, Bol Bol will become stars and joke will be on us though. lol"
Bol Bol could...and he still cant play
"simple, we change the rules to allow a Bol Bol Poku fusion by Potara earrings."
"That’s okay Aaron. You can reproduce that Taco dunk in this year final’s garbage time. Instead of Taco, we’ll give you Bol Bol.   Cool? Now win the chip."
You should trade for Bol Bol.  Unstoppable in garbage time.
Yeah he’ll be right behind bol bol at like 7
"Didn’t the nuggets have a Jokic, Plumlee, Bol, Millsap and Grant lineup last year?"
Denver -  PG - Joker SG - Bol Bol SF - Gordon  PF - MPJ C - McGee
bol bol if he ate more chicken nuggets
"Oh, don't get me wrong. The fact the guy can actually run around is incredible. Watching my 6'8"" uncle walk around reminds me of an old Smallville villain of the week. It's remarkable that Bol can really do anything athletic. But being ""great for a guy that's 7'3"" doesn't mean much when people are dribbling around him. He just has so much length to move and I'm not convinced he can even reach average NBA defensive quality. But if he can dial in the handles, continue shooting well, rebound, and block a couple shots, I think he could be an actual commodity."
Bol Bol is only 21? Holy shit
Jimmer Klay Scal Hedo Bol Bol
Watching Bol Bol play is pretty terrifying.
I wonder what happens behind the scenes that prevents Bol Bol from getting more minutes. He’s definitely still raw in some areas though.
"i get the joke here, but Bol Bol is kinda a diva. He clearly does not want to be on the nuggets for some reason, he unfollowed them on social media"
Free Bol Bol
"He can't process what to do well defensively, and will get cooked on PnR. Sure Malone can play Bol Bol more mins to get more experience. The team will increase their chance of losing game and put Malone on the hot seat."
Mike Malone is not going to be playing Bol Bol 36 minutes until the Nuggets clinch their seed in the playoffs and decide to rest their players to give Bol so development. Which is why I used realistic minutes that Mike could play Bol.
"Bol isn’t an NBA rotation player yet, at least not on the Nuggets. Also he is a wing, he might die if you play him at the 5."
Mfs traded for Aaron Gordon when they had Bol Bol the entire time lmao wtf
And when I get jammed I always find a loophole   I got a crime record longer than Bol Bol
Bol Bol for the slam.
"Completely agree. RJ has a higher floor though. Bol could be an absolute bust, whereas RJ can already can meaningfully contribute"
Yea I agree as soon as they give the taller KD aka Bol bol more minutes they’ll win a chip
"TRADE HIM , WE NEED TO SEE BOL BOL"

Bol Bol always shines in prime garbage time.
What's even the point of discussing this when Bol Bol is obviously better than both?
everybody talking about Luka and Trae and Zion and Ja.  The future faces of the league are Bol Bol and Poku.
Free Bol
Nah. Manute Bol was a literal spider. 4 twigs attached to a slightly thicker twig
"Y’all should have really went all in and traded sap, bol bol and firsts for Lowry   Lowry  Murray  Porter  Gordon  Jokic   With Willy B off the bench oh boy  What do you think?"
He's a Manute Bol body with a young Mugsy Bougues athleticism.
Bol Bol Bol
"If Bol Bol isn't ROTY, Most Improved, DPOY, MVP and 6MOTY this season, I'm not watching the NBA anymore."
"The problem is Bol is physically limited right now, he just gets tipped over and there’s no way he could hold up against NBA level 4s. People compare him to his dad but Manute had 10” more wingspan and was 6” taller; Bol has way better touch but he’s just as weak and can’t make up for it with length as much as Manute could."
"Bol Bol vs Tacko, a battle for the ages"
6’10 LeBron blocks Durant’s dagger 3 in 2017 so Im going with that  I would say 7’ Steph but we already have Bol Bol
"Dude Lamelo Ball also had horrendous shooting splits in NZ.  Clearly it isn't as simple as a 1:1 translation, this is just a silly argument.  He was an 18 year old playing in a foreign country.    High schoolers playing in either Euro or NZ almost alwayssss have horrible effiency.  It doesn't automatically mean they will be trash here.  Hampton actually looked really good in the minutes he got this year.  That's why almost literally every Nuggets fan who watches every game was hoping it would be Bol instead of Hampton to be traded.  Hampton has a ton of promise.  It's asinine to hang his reputation on his shooting splits on New Zealand when he was a teenager."
Give it to BOL BOL you cowards
all i want from this game is for kj martin to block bol bol
"Malones trash, he has the worst lineup's and rotations ever. It's gunna be sad watching bol leave."
"I've been watching the NBA for over 40 years.  Lots of entertaining players of all sorts.  My short list is Steph first, Charles Barkley second, Dr. J third.    And Manute Fucking Bol was absolutely entertaining as hell."
Vince Carter = Meat  Hon mention Manute Bol
It's even funnier with the commentary from RJ. They were just talking about how good Bol Bol was handling the ball then suddenly... turnover.
I love the effort he put into getting it back just for it to roll away. Poor Bol Bol.
Bol Bol is Kyrie with a 40 foot vert
In context to the game this is such an unnecessary highlight lol  Cool handles by Bol ² tho
Smailigic vs Bol Bol future titans going head to head
Bol Bol in garbage time &gt;
Bol Bol kinda looks disinterested out there imo
Gary Payton II defending Bol Bol...
Good point. He did have a bit on Bol height wise. He was Bol Bol + Manute weight wise.
Taller is better. Bol over all.
I like to think Mike Malone isn't playing Bol Bol so that he doesn't give Steve Kerr any ideas.
"&gt; but ig if you trained bench only for a year and ate a lot you could probs hit it even starting out with a bol bol figure  Yes, that's the implication. 185 for reps with consistent training and a sufficient diet is a very realistic 1 year goal, assuming you don't have a freakishly small frame or something crazy."
Bol is a SG
Manute Bol is all that comes to mind
Youtube comments believe we are wasting bol bol and that he would be a 20 point scorer in any other team
"If defense makes up for an 18 game difference and 1 game difference in the standings, then the gap on that end better be Bill Russell to Bol Bol"
Check out bol bol
My favorite part of that air ball is bol bol picking up a seat cushion for cover.😂😂
Bol Bol or GTFO
“Giannis is too small to defend Bol Bol and Tacko Fall! Especially when they pull up from half court.”
Bol Bol gonna be just an average looking guy in a few years
Yeah I mean I've injured my knee before and I cringe when Bol Bol moves.
Counter it with 5 Bol Bols
Bol Bol
That fact that Bol Bol is not on this list.. makes me irrationally angry.
Why don’t you guys play bol bol for a few minutes a game if you have time for shaq Harrison? Cant be that bad
No seriously look at a picture of manute bol. Not trying to be racist but he’s literally purple.
Bol Bol is a better shooter than KAT.
Best I can do is Bol^2
Bol Bol actually never misses a shot in garbage time. If he had any Bball IQ he'd be the best prospect in the league.
Why not give Bol Bol a crack at it? 🤷
Need to give bol bol some minutes. Let him play C and have jokic start at PG
Y'all sleeping on Bol Bol 😤
Chet is better than Bol was as a senior in high school. Better athlete and much better handle.
U love Bol Bol?
"Mugsy Bogues, Ai, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Manute Bol  Bench Shawn Bradley, Yao, Dennis Johnson, Spud Webb, Detlef Schrempf, Brent Barry"

Fuck it let's play bol bol at point guard
"Ah yes, the 1991 76ers, a stunningly good defensive team including the talents of fully declined Rick Mahorn, not a good defender Charles Barkley, skinny bean pole Manute Bol, undersized Hersey Hawkins, and Mike Gminski, another poor defender."
How about Bol Bol and Will barton for Smart?
I see your offer and raise you Will barton and Bol Bol.
Manute Bol
He reminds me of Bol Bol and obviously the NBA doesn’t like him
Manute Bol: 4pts 4rb 15 bocks also a ridiculous 10 pts 19 rb and 15 block game...  Allen Houston: 37/0/0/0/0   Draymond: 4/12/10/10/5  Some weird lines for you haha
manute bol
Bol Bol will bloom!
Manute Bol*
Dude looks like Manute Bol that one game he drained a bunch of threes. What a trebuchet of a jumper.
manute bol is everyone's og
I would say the Nuggets would be intimidating. Jokic and Porter Jr are some big dudes. Aaron Gordon has some serious hops and it would certainly be a relief when you see Bol Bol isn’t a starter.
Bol ²
Bol Bol with Kyle Lowrys butt is GOAT candidate
Manute bol is tall
it’s absolutely not Bol Bol
Anyone who says Poku hasn’t actually watched Poku. I would say Bol Bol right now
"Do you know who Manute Bol is? Do you know who Guy Rodgers is? One was way more talented, and it wasn’t Manute Bol."
Did you mean Nuggets Superstar PG Bol Bol?
Manure Bol was significantly more famous than he was skilled.
Bol^2
Saving Bol Bol for the finals
Where is Bol Bol??????????????
"Bol ""Gary Harris"" Bol"
NBA Finals replaced with Poku and Bol Bol attempting the Skills Challenge to Benny Hill music
"Did you mean Bol ""Bol Bol"" Bol?"
The fuckin disrespect to Bol^^Bol is sickening
Bol Bol?????????
"Manute Bol invented the phrase ""My Bad"""
No joke. Must be hard to pack on weight when you’re that tall or something. Bol doesn’t look like his legs could support much more weight that 220 though.
Manute Bol killed a lion with a spear
Bol Bol: *exists*
I'm interested in how Bol Bol has been doing
Does bol bol qualify?
The build of Manute Bol and the handles and speed of Kyrie.
muggsy bogues and manure bol
Bol bol
"The easiest way to put it is that Bol Bol and Tacko Fall would both be starting in the 90s. Not on competing teams or anything, but still starting."
If Poku and Bol Bol play each other it just ends up looking like tangled mess of headphones in your pocket
"if sports medicine/science manages to eliminate all the injury problems tall/skinny people have like porzingings bol etc, then this unicorn tall lanky guard build is the future of nba. Unblockable shot and being physical is less and less relevant with the soft fouls"
"Bol definitely won’t be anywhere near as good as MPJ, no way he could shoot 50% and 40% from 3 on high volume, and he’s a defensive liability despite his length"
Can I get a comparison to Bol Bol?
"yeah ik, but im just saying we dont know if bol bol could produce the same way as mpj"
"I do love me some Bol Bol. Shame he got hurt in college, he would've gone much higher in the draft."
Bol Bol is awful lol
"I was here for the first time this was posted  Bol Bol is fine but I feel like he's a pretty low IQ player, every time he gets the ball he's trying to do his best Kevin Durant impression"
"Siakam, Ibaka, Mutombo, Olajuwon  Then ofc theres the super tall but super raw guys like Tacko, Bol Bol, Thon. There’s a lot of undiscovered talent in Africa, and due to physicals alone a good team could develop them into monsters."
Bol Bol has the mentality of a killer. He’s here for buckets and he’ll be damned if your third string tries to stop him.
"He has so much offensive potential but just can’t defend for the life of him. I wonder if they should use him like the Nuggets use Bol Bol, play him at the 4 or 3?"
"Bol Bol is blessed with the body of a unicorn... but cursed with the personality of AI and the work ethic of Ray Felton.   If you're worried your team lost their chance at him, don't fret. They could probably trade for him this offseason for a future second or the rights to some random foreign player who's never coming over. Or be patient and just wait for him to get cut eventually."
[play bol bol michael](https://i.imgur.com/fAx6wkB.jpg)
This is why Bol Bol is the GOAT
"Markus Howard and Bol Bol could probably be better than those guys in a game against NCAA competition, yes"
"That’s not necessarily true. Guys that are drafted high need to have the build to develop into NBA players, they aren’t necessarily the best players in that moment against college competition. Like, Markus Howard and Bol Bol aren’t NBA bodies right now and their draft position reflects that, but they’d be more dominant against a team of NCAA players than Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman were before they came to the NBA, IMO. It’s just that wiseman and Edwards have higher ceilings than a guy like Markus Howard or skinny Bol"
Bol Bol &gt; Herro case closed
The world needs more Bol Bol minutes
Bol bol is not out there to pass and I am there for every minute of his “I will shoot this” mentality
"""bol bol...off the rim rim"""
"Denver playing Cancar and Bol Bol, and still leading the Nets by 13 in the 1st Q after scoring 37? Good grief."
Bol bol v Durant omg thank youuuuuu
Bol Bol in the 1st is surprising me
"I love how random malone is, fuck it let’s play bol for this game"
bol Bol in the 1st whats happening here..
Bol Bol time already? I wonder if he's the tallest PF ever.
Bol Bol in already? RIP Nets
We love early bol bol minutes
Bol Bol
Gordon is out lol just put in Bol Bol fuck it
"Malone makes it tough to get playing time...because if you can overcome what it takes to get on the floor you can overcome what happens on the floor.  In my min Bol has 2 struggles.  1. He doesnt have a position on defense. He is too weak and more importantly his center of gravity is way too high to play center on defense. He can be bullied by much smaller guys. He sometimes gets boxed out way out of bounds. 2. Mentality. I think some of this is just his lowe key personality. Maybe he is just really self  conscious, I dont really know. But when things are good he is smiles and when things arent as good he is a stormfront of pouting. At least that is how he comes across.   I dont think Malone actually likes him much right now, or has lost some hope in him making a difference in Denver. I see a scenario where he gets really good on offense and he may be able to be effective in zone schemes on defense with his extreme length, but his defensive weaknesses are really really bad. Even with the physical limitations he looks lost in the few times he is on the floor."
Like that time Manute Bol went off for like 6 threes in a half
"I can’t be the only one that feels like Malone is the perfect coach for Bol Bol.   I understand the he doesn’t play enough argument, but he has to earn those minutes.  And Malone is pretty chill with having young players on big roles (see MPJ).  It’ll help his development but he needs to be a little quicker."
* Cam Reddish will never be a good NBA player. Those who saw him in college know this. Reddish had a small fragment last season where he wasn't hot-garbage and Hawks fans thought he had turned a corner.  * Anfernee Simmons could carve out a very decent role on a solid team. His 3pt shot % increase may be unsustainable though.  * Mo Bamba needs to switch teams.  * Bol Bol I have absolutely 0 clue what you do with him if you give him big minutes.  Kevin Knox is a garbage NBA player. Wendell Carter I think can still become a good center one day.
Cam can probably make an all star team or two if he can stay healthy   Simons seems like a 6th man scorer type  Bamba is tall   Bol is ass right now but he’s still young so he could be something
Bol
Manute Bol
Explain my undying love for bol bol then?
If Bol Bol had scored 40k points in the past 13 games he'd be first all time in points
PG: Facu SG: Caruso SF: Bol Bol PF: Kostas C: Tacko
"Still better guard situation then ours, starting pg, backup pg, starting sg, backup sg all gone. To make it even better, we traded 2 guards away right before the injury spree happened. At this point Bol Bol is about to play sg."
"That’s not how Malone rolls, though. If you want to mope and pout about not getting playing time, then you’re gonna continue to ride the bench. You have to at least show some effort and willingness (especially on the defensive end) to play the right way.  Giving poor defensive effort and chucking everytime the ball touches your hands on offense is not a great way to get coach to trust you. That’s the “for some reason.”  Add to that the fact that we are a contending team so he only gets garbage time minutes rather than real meaningful ones.  Again, look at how Malone handled Mpj. There were plenty of people calling for him to play more because his talent was just oozing when he was on the court. Bol doesn’t have anywhere near MPJs talent - he has an interesting appeal between the skills he does have and his body type, but it’s no where near the same. So if MPJ didn’t get special treatment, why the hell would bol, who shows significantly fewer flashes and potential?"
It’s because Bol isn’t ready and Denver knows it but wants to compete so they don’t have minutes to give him.
"MPJ was not a diamond in the rough. His injury background was responsible for his draft position.  Bol Bol is a different kind of proposition. Son of a famous basketball star from Sudan, catchy name, extremely tall and already famous despite not playing much. Drafting him in second round is a sort of win even if he never makes it to a starter level player.  We have Boban, Boston has Tacko, OKC has Poku - very tall guys who don't play much. Boban is quite old compared to others but even he managed to score 31 against Nuggets in the last game before lockdown. Poku has had a few amazing performances after his return from G League while Tacko had 4 blocks in 5 minutes this week itself."
Just watch any time Bol is on the court lol he puts in basically zero effort
Boucher is also 6 years older than bol bol lol Edit: 7
Boucher is much more mobile / quicker but not as long as Bol Bol.
His peak is probably what Chris Boucher is rn. Boucher probably what people thought Bol Bol could be. Just never turned out for him
I’ll never forget when Bol Bol gave him hell in the bubble lmao
Sure put bol in as a stretch four or five.  I would rather see a bigger garden for defense like Rivers.
"When do we get our Joker / MPJ / Zeke / Bol / JaVale lineup?  Average height of that lineup is 7'0"""
The very fact you compare Porzingis to Bol Bol on defence shows how awful he is on that end.
A Chiptole bowl made by bol bol
Against guards he will be targeted like most larger players who can’t keep up with speedy guards. He still does well when switched most  wings compared to someone like Bol Bol.
Or just 1 set of Bol Bol shoulders.
we need more tacko and bol bol in the NBA :)
George Muresan and Manute Bol started for years in the league. I think this guy can find himself an actual rotation spot soon
The dude looks like a light breeze would turn him into a fucking kite. He makes Bol Bol look like David Robinson
"Trade for Derrick Jones Jr, Cassius Stanley and Dennis Smith Jr. The team will still tank, but there's going to be lots of highlight dunks to keep the fans interested. Add Poku, Bol Bol and Tacko as well, and watch ticket sales sky rocket."
"I gave up a 1st for bol bol in 2k, he's a beast in 2k..."
"They aren’t fast enough to be effective on fast breaks, get targeted in PnR, rarely have shooting and their defensive ability in general does not fill what is typically an offensive hole. It’s why guys like KD, KAT, Tingus Pingus, etc are so rare. They are fast, mobile(agile), can defend by switching, space the floor well and are an overall positive. A 3andD player who plays the 4 or 5 is almost always a max contract player while a traditional center usually gets half. There is a big gap in the valuation and the drop off from unicorns to players like bol bol is massive especially when viewed with a more offensive minded league and small ball emerging"
"Agreed. I'm wondering if the dude is just bringing part of 90s basketball back where you embrace the lack of offensive production and just let him do his thing on defense. Mark Eaton, Manute Bol, Dikembe kind of player. He needs to rebound much, much better and as you said, if he can even learn to just better position himself down low and develop even a standing hook shot type of thing, he'll have a career. Seeing him out there is like when you create your own player and turn the height setting to maximum. It looks comedic at times how massive he is."
"He really is godawful, and an absolute turnstile while guarding. At least Bol Bol is awful in a fun kind of way"
"They're a total meme squad. I just switch off at the point they come in, unless i feel like watching Bol Bol do Bol Bol shit for the laugh."
Dude out here looking like Kyle Anderson x Bol Bol.
And then their offense is 90% Markus Howard and Bol Bol chucks
Bol Bol was at the free throw line when he shot the ball lmao enough clickbait titles
"""Over Bol""  My man was basically in the paint lol"
Bol Bol got a wingspan of 15 miles it looks like.
"Haha, Cancar coming in, crowd seems to like him :-)   Bol Bol walks behind Cancar.  Knicks announcer has no clue who is the MVP in Nugget's fans hearts."
Vlatko *and* Bol Bol! Thank you NYK!
Alen Smailigic and Bol Bol
Reminds me of the Jokic/Millsap/Bol Bol/Plumlee/Grant starting 5 from the bubble last season
probably too late in the season to meme with Bol at PG considering we need as much time as possible for our rotation players to mesh
Huh? Idk about this lineup. Why not Rivers? Why not Shaq? I wouldn’t even be mad at Bol istg
Looking forward to the last minute substitution of Bol for Facu.
Bol Bol
Ben Simmons at the 1  Bol Bol at the 2  Zion at the 3  Fuck height
"fuck it. yeah why not, a guy with experience could be good. bol is absolutely not ready, he’s a long way away from being a serviceable NBA player, a very high ceiling but he’s been given so many opportunities to prove himself and hasn’t once risen to the occasion"
Nah we have established the best play is to have bol bol on tacko’s shoulders and stand at the ring
I have faith he’s gonna Bol out.
Jokic Bol MPJ Green McGee lineup awaits us
Bol Bol is actually going to get playing time lol
"I wanna see Facu, MPJ, Bol Bol, AG, Jokic 😂"
Damnit. Lin signing? Or they finally gonna try and give Bol some mins?
The injury gods just really want to see Bol at SG huh
"We can agree to disagree. Drummond got cooked in the post at least 3 or 4 times. I think the Lakers were -17 or something in his minutes. Jokic was something like 8-20 with Drummond in. I dunno what to say he missed a few 3s, and couple mid rangers and at least one wide open layup. I don’t know how this becomes some sort of Drummond really played great D thing.   Dwight is significantly better on defence. He can defend a pick and roll, is still a pretty great shot blocker. Drummond’s night would have been worse if the Nuggets had any guards left on their roster that are capable of running a pick and roll. The Nuggets are one injury away from playing Bol Bol at guard at this point."
Why do you think lifting weights makes a player better?  &gt;Someone who doesn’t lift weights couldn’t get one minute in the league today.   You're telling me Pokusevski is in the league because of his muscles?  Or Bol Bol?
Who is up for our guard rotation now that pj is down? Bol bol
We are really going to have to play point god bol bol in the playoffs for considerably minutes
Explain Bol Bol
The streets need Point Bol Bol
"Time to start Austin rivers or maybe even Shaq. Maybe Marcus Howard gets his first non-garbage time minutes. Are we gonna sign another guard? BOL BOL possibly. Who knows?! I don’t care anymore, Fuck this season"
"At this point play bol bol, rivers is just failing to make teams want him."
"We are running out of guards. At this rate we are going to play Jokic, Bol, MPJ, AG, Mcgee in the playoffs."
Jokic isn’t even the best center on his own team lmao (bol bol)
honestly he couldn’t defend that bol bol shot with the crutch and healthy
"Idk how it works for the playoffs, but I think Bol Bol was considered a rookie this season even though he played minutes in the 8 seeding games in the Bubble."
"&gt; You can't have played a single minute in a meaningful game and be eligible the next year  Bol Bol played in the playoffs and had ""his NBA debut"" the next season. I bet he would be eligible."
"Yeah, but did Hakeem ever block a Manute Bol three pointer?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CxSZmnAT5I&amp;ab\_channel=ESPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CxSZmnAT5I&amp;ab_channel=ESPN)"
Yeah Bol Bol is something else
Bol Bol.
"I'll die on my hill that we should have turned Barton+Bol+picks into Lonzo. Would have had a starting 5 of Lonzo/Murray/MPJ/Gordon/Jokic. A bum bench, to be sure, but with that starting 5 we win 2 titles in the next 3-4 years. And they have an average age of like 23/24.  edit: If we had to give up Monte or Dozier i'm fine with that too, a true point guard shooting 40+% with good defense is worth it."
Luka is a solid player.   I’m just happy r/nba is over the if I teamed up Larry Bird with Manute Bol and his six brothers and his son Bol Bol would they win a championship faze.
Not betting on a player with multiple back surgeries doesn’t make a manager dumb. Not every franchise can wait 2 years for a player to even get healthy. Just because Denver had a better base than other teams doesn’t male the decision dumb. Especially considering that Bol Bol didn’t work out at all yet.
Doing all of this without Bol Bol playing significant minutes either.
"He makes close to $50M with endorsements and has tax accountants maxing his charitable tax deductions.  The amount of good he does versus the amount he makes is marginal and the same goes for most athletes.  When given abundance, the average person is hardly charitable relative to their income.  Go look at Manute Bol if you really want to see what a role mode is.  Kyrie is a schizotypal overly empowered genetically gifted 107 IQ thinking he is 150 IQ basketball savant with questionable interpersonal skills.  He is not a role model.  He does not do good relative to his income."
Bol Bol
"also bol bol, denver seems to love those high risk high reward guys"
"Just resting Jokic is not enough.We will also need to not play Bol Bol because if we do,we will win every game till the end of the season :/"
Bol fucking Bol. There's no limit to the guys other fans (and even some of ours) think he should be getting minutes over.
Poku is manute bol without shot blocking
Campazzo and Bol
Bol bol?
I feel like taking away his height would take away from the point of Bol Bol as a player. But that was who i had in my mind.
What about bol Bol? Isn’t his thing that he’s too skinny? Maybe if he’s shorter it’ll be easier for him to put on weight? Plus he does have more of a skill set of a guard I think
Bol Bol at SG will be amazing=)
No Bol Bol? Unbelievabol
So is bol bol like a meme or something I don’t watch many Denver games lol
I could probably beat up Bol Bol just by head butting his dick since I’m only 5’9
"Marcus Morris, Jokic, Will Barton, Bol Bol, Paul Millsap  0 bias"

"I just fw Bol Bol, I’m not from Colorado, never even been  There’s racists everywhere, whether it’s known or not"
Bol Bol or Pat Bev
Bol would definitely just chuck up a bunch of 3s uncontested.
I would like to see a chicken fight where bol bol holds Curry vs Tako and CP3
Bol bol
"bol joined the league 1 year after hakeem (1985), according to wikipedia"
"I just wanna live in a world where Boban, Bol Bol, and Tacko play significant minutes and dominate basketball."
They tried that with Manute Bol - 7’6” but was only 200 lbs.  got a lot of publicity but wasn’t able to make a strong contribution to the team.
"He seriously hit everything, it was wild. I swear he could have the whole Bol family guarding him at the rim and he’d still hit it."
Bol Bol
"Except maybe Bol Bol, because that would require him putting in some effort."
Bol Bol doesn’t like basketball that much.
I think the way our fans treat Bol is shitty. No one wants to hear their name chanted because they’re viewed as a novelty.
You know it's over when we got Bol Bol out there strolling around.
0/10 Bol Bol didn’t shoot
WE CAME FOR BOL BOL!!!
Bol Bol threw that one pass he got away faster than he's ever done anything in his life. Dude looked like a who're in church out there
i think they were saying we want bol bol
We got a Bol Bol sighting 👀
They even let Bol Bol get mins. Yikes
I want Bol Bol to bring the ball up and shoot a transition 3 so fucking bad.
Let Bol Bol put up a shot dammit
Bol Bol was not siked to play garbage time minutes.
0/10 Bol Bol didn’t shoot
Bol Bol!
bol bol walks so funny 😂
bol bol does not wanna play lol
That ref backing away from Bol Bol's pass at the end lmao
"Lesgo Baby, we got Bol Bol minutes"
Why didn’t Bol Bol shoot?!
"lol they put bol bol in a playoff game, human victory cigar"
Sticking Bol Bol in the corner is such a disgrace. James Naismith must be furoius.
I want Bol Bol to bring the ball up and shoot a transition 3 so fucking bad.
Let Bol Bol put up a shot dammit
Bol Bol looks like it's his first day at a new school and he doesn't know where the gym is
They even let Bol Bol get mins. Yikes

Release the Bol!
Crap put Bol Bol in on him - try something
I would pay good money to see a Bol Bol-Tacko Fall one-on-one game.
"if it means I get to see bol bol, I'm in"
"This game should have a halftime dunk contest between DJJ, Gordon, Simons, and Bol Bol."
Masochist Michael Malone adds Bol Bol to the mix to torture Nuggets fans on pick and roll defense.
Bol Bol this is your time to shine
"R.I.P., Manute Bol"
This was the dream of Manute Bol.
Manute Bol
If you think Barrett reddish Naz little and bol bol were all better prepared for the nba at 16 you need to get your eyes checked
Nuggets woulda won if Bol Bol was out there.
They have a good drafting strategy. Bol Bol probably won’t pan out but he’s another example of their solid risk/reward approach
"Video is awesome but can I just say that first clip is kind of surreal? Walking behind MPJ and Bol Bol at a level that makes them look like regular people yet they are both 7 footers, lol"
Grizzlies over Jazz BOL
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"

"Tacko fall, bol bol, lamelo ball, Lonzo ball, Grayson allen"
You can have bol bol
Only one I can think off of the top of my head that sticks out is Latrell. Chris Webber was a stud that year and one RoY  That 76ers roster was hilarious to me. They had Manute Bol AND Shawn Bradley and the corpse of Moses Malone.
Dell Curry -&gt; Karl Malone -&gt; Devean George -&gt; Steph Curry   Pace Mannion -&gt; Karl Malone -&gt; Kobe Bryant -&gt; Kent Bazemore -&gt; Nico Mannion  Manute Bol -&gt; Muggsy Bogues -&gt; Antawn Jamison -&gt; Javale McGee -&gt; Bol Bol
Manute Bol to Muggsy Bogues to Antwan Jaimison to Javale McGee to Bol Bol.
You forgot Bol Bol who will get his number retired by every team when it's all said and done
Bol Bol in shambles
"I dont know about will barton, but the nuggets extended bol bol‘s contract sometime this season until 2022.. It was kind of under the radar, but too me it was a clear sign that they see potential in him for the future."
Probably Bol Bol and maybe Will Barton (hopefully not)
He added Bol Bol after I made the comment
Noted white people Bol Bol and Tacko Fall
Clearly you don’t know that point god Bol Bol is on the nuggets
Bol bol better
I highly guarantee this is just fashion it's a Vetements jacket which is a popular brand.  Bol Bol wore a Vetements sweater that had Soviet Union/communist flag on it like last year.
"Charlotte should sign Lonzo and somehow acquire Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, and Bol Bol.   Then their lineup could be:   Ball/Ball  Bey/Bey  Bol Bol"
gotta say I'm surprised you're not protecting Bol Bol
*My Bad*    Manute Bol
Magic are my second favorite team because of Cole and RJ. Also thanks for AG but wish you guys took bol instead of RJ lol.
"Has yet to be proven, BOL"
BOL BOL and his historical 3-1 comeback

Bol Bol is fast but he's not quick. Can he play center?
BOL BOL TIME
WHERE IS BOL BOL
Who wants Bol Bol? We want Bol Bol!
where is bol bol
Bol Bol! We want Bol Bol!
Ok NOW we can put in Bol Bol
Came for Bol Bol  I see no Bol Bol
So we can vote? Looks like Bol Bol is getting an MVP vote next season.
Da bol'  is a PROBLEM.  My man is  subtle assassin. Casual af with the kills.
"Trade Bol Bol and a second for Curry, who says no?"
He went from 2k portraying him as a polar bear in 20 to 2k portraying him as a white manute bol in 21
"Bol Bol didn’t play enough, there’s your problem right there"
Tacko at least plays with effort. Combining Bol Bol's skill and mobility + Tacko's effort would be a lock for All-NBA
That's hyperbaric. Hyperbolic is what it's like at the Bol family reunion
Bol Bol is like Michael Jordan but 7’3
Start Bol Bol at point guard
Need Bol bol in game 2
Tha bol bol dime tho
"Man, Bol Bol walking around like he doesn't even want to be on the court"
Hear me out  Start Bol Bol at PG. Whats the worst that could happen?
We want him gone too. His attitude is inexcusable. Fucking hell markus Howard had a couple good games n made his way into the play off rotation. Bol doesn't give a fuck
Bol has a serious handle
"The way Bol Bol moves/looks(his body) is so weird, that’s coming from someone who watched Poku for a year. Poku moves a lot smoother and his body proportions just seems a lot more natural???"
"Never forget, Bol Bol is one of the most broken cards in 2K21"
Need Bol bol in game 2
Bol Bol is a unit
I'm glad to know Bol Bol retains his dad's trebuchet shooting form.
Wicked assist bol
What a flashy pass from bol bol. He's been playing 2k for sure
Bol with the spicy dime
"The person who said Bol Bol just coasts and shows no effort wasn't lying, no wonder Malone hates him"
Sweet pass Bol!
Would Bol Bol be the ultimate white flag?
"Man, Bol Bol walking around like he doesn't even want to be on the court"
Bol Bol has the funniest body shape I've ever seen.
Fuck you Bol Bol.  Aimlessly shifting around the court. Do something!  Acting entitled here. Play like you want to be there.
Bol just wants to leave.
STIX VS BOL BOL the matchup i was fucking waiting for!!
Bol Bol time let's go
Bol Bol deserves better
Standing ovation for Bol Bol. In Phoenix no less.

BOL BOL TIME BITCHES
BOL BOL SIGHTING
Time for Bol Bol
Put in Bol Bol you cowards
Bol Bol
"increases or stays the same. Players that are tall are learning to handle the ball at point guard levels now. Ben Simmons is an anomaly now but players are going to learn to dribble better and faster at earlier ages. Aleksej Pokusevski, Bol Bol, and Kristaps Porzingis are all 7 foot shooting guards. Cade Cunningham is a 6’8 point guard. Not saying that they are that good but there is a trend."
So Bol Bol&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Trae&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Murray?
"Basically he's not done a single thing to justify getting minutes in any game that's not a blowout. Even when he does play, he puts in barely any effort and you can tell it visibly pisses off Malone.  Malone actually takes a lot of stock in those kind of minutes and has really rewarded players like Howard for putting in the effort when given the chance to impress, but Bol just strolls around not giving a fuck. Out of the league within two years I feel, barring a drastic turnaround in attitude and effort."
what’s up with Bol? He got a few minutes in the bubble but I haven’t heard anything about him this year
"And literally the worst 7' foot &lt; shooting guard in the league   (Durant, Poku, Possibly Bol)"
"Cancar has occasionally contributed, he's on the Marcus Howard end of the bench for us that there may be a bit of a player there. The *actual* end of the bench for us is Bol Bol."
"if bol bol had his minutes on the same team i'm completely, 100% sure that he'd try harder &amp; perform better"
"Go back to the three guard lineup with Zinger, Bol, and Poku. 21'5"" of hanging out at the arc"
"That rebounding piece is honestly the most important part of it. IDK why players like KP or Bol Bol are allergic to wanting to rebound the ball. Kahwi said it: ""Board man gets paid""."
Bol bol
"Yeah, I’ve noticed Bol Bol is shorter than Pingis and Boban is taller"
KP is just a better version of Bol Bol
Bol Bol?
Have you heard the stories about Manute Bol?
Bol Bol
"Man, a Denver team with Simmons, Jokic, and MPJ would just be so tall. Throw some Bol Bol out there and you’ve got a real long boi line up"
"That’s fair.  The issue is that Porter is less likely to get 30-40 point games with Murray on the floor.  That said, when Murray is hot, the Nuggets also don’t need him to.  On defense though, Campazzo is a better defender than Murray.  That allows for Porter to not have to chase guards, which is good because his defensive IQ is low.   The Nuggets are better with Murray than without, but they’re fine without him.  But they also haven’t had the roster together long enough to really build that chemistry.  It would be amazing to see Jokic, Murray, Porter, Gordon, and either Barton or Morris with Campazzo coming off the bench.  And god help anyone if they find a way to get Bol Bol on the court regularly."
"I’m pretty sure he even suffered from dropfoot in his rookie year (which he was already taking off due to injuries).   Denver was in the lucky spot where they hade the 14th pick, but also had a really solid team already, and therefore could afford to pick a player who couldn’t contribute immediately. They basically tried the same thing with Bol Bol too."
"i think you're expectations may have been skewed to begin with. boban hardly ever looked ready for real reliable NBA minutes, and he looked pretty damn good much of the time for what his body is capable of. he's not just a big man, he has a growth hormone disorder. his touch around the rim is better than what many expected i think, and he seems like he's learning the game better and better. KP is the real disappointment. who would be surprised if boban was more in the tacko fall and bol bol category? he's earned his real minutes"
He been watching way too many manute bol film
"Back injuries on a taller guy like that are probably the biggest red flag there is. We saw what happened to Bol Bol, a worse player with a less significant injury, made him drop from late lotto-late first round to the second round. Drafting MPJ in the lottery could have ended very very badly if he continued down the injuries. They still aren’t really in the clear."
"Jamal Murray, Zeke Naiji, Bol Bol, and 3-4 future picks would do it lol"
Give me KP vs. Bol Bol
Haha I want bol bol to get playing time so bad. Start him at the 4 next season he is ready.
Manute Bol
Two 15 BLK games. Nobody blocks shots like that anymore plus the game is way more perimeter oriented now than it was when manute Bol played
Manute Bol and Muggsy Bogues
I actually agree with Demar because of that fuckin footwork but I'll go with another Denver player for sexiest playstyle honorable mentions. Shout out Bol Bol.
"I'm just really happy seeing comments like this.  My first Warriors memories are: my dad explaining to me that it's not normal for a player to choke out his coach, and being insanely stoked on finding a Manute Bol card of him on the Warriors.  They've come a long ways since when I was a kiddo."
"Can you really say you watched enough games of both players to judge that though? I only watched a couple of grizzlies games and don't think I watched a single Kings game so I am  not going to try and analyze their abilities. But based on stats Fox seems to be much more consistent at this time. Yeah Morant is younger and less experienced, but neither of those guarantees that Morant develops more than Fox over their careers. Potential is a fun concept but it is not easy to judge. Bol Bol probably has the most potential of any player in the NBA, but I don't think he will ever be a starter."
Yeah for sure. Honestly wouldn't mind taking a chance on Bol Bol developing in Portland haha.   But yeah they've picked up some really solid players tbh. They've had the odd horror moment [Mitchell and Gobert trades] but overall its a good squad. I think they will challenge Phoenix especially inside.
Wait until they actually give Bol Bol a chance youll see a big man move
Tacko Fall vs Bol Bol
3 team trade to include Bol Bol.
Bol Bol  Nah fr Miles Bridges
Trade everyone for Bol Bol
It's Bol Bol
The disrespect to Bol Bol.
"The nuggets starting line up in a preseason game was 413"". Bol bol, Jokic, plumlee, Grant, Millsap. Shortest player was 6'8"" milsap lol  https://www.golfdigest.com/story/denver-nuggets-tallest-lineup-nba-history  Also showing a team before 2018 in any of these (the 1999 mavs) is a bit misleading since each of their heights would be 1-2 inches less from ~2018."
Bol Bol for series MVP!
See you in 5 years when Bol Bol is the MVP
And they have Bol Bol
"But fr their GM is a legend. Jamal Murray was a solid pick but not a wild one, the MPJ (and Bol Bol) picks were both home run swings and one is already paying off! And to get both Jokic (the MVP) and Monte Morris in the 2nd round is insane - like what are all the other GMs doing?"
"don't forget Facu and Morris. The FO made a lot of good moves, and they showed it tonight, despite missing Murray and Barton. Master Bol Bol didn't even need to suit up lol."
Just wait for Bol Bol
We all want game 7! Pull it out guys 🥺🥺  Edit: I’m an idiot and thought I posted this on the blazers sub 🤪. To clarify I want the nugs to win the series but a game 7 as a neutral haha. BOL!
Time to bring Bol Bol in man.
MPJ wouldn't be where he is now without Denver's development program. They really know how to turn a talent into a superstar. My man Bol Bol next
Could’ve sworn that was Bol Bol getting buckets
Bol Bol.
Bol Bol sadly
Oubre for Ariza  Oubre turned himself into one of the prime pieces for CP3 trade and boosted team culture in his time there which remains today  Bol Bol is one that looks good  his pick for a 2022 second round from Philly which is not very good
"PJ Dozier, Aaron Gordon, Bol Bol, Barton, 2 FRP, 1 pick swap for Simmons and Shake Milton.   Nuggets go with Monte/Murray/MPJ/Simmons/Jokic. Bench of Facu/Shake/Nanji/Green. Not bad"
"Definitely a better shooter than Shaq.  I would say though that Shaq was more than just a “little” more athletic.  Shaq was probably the most athletic 7+ft big man in NBA history which is why he was so dominant.  It’s true he didn’t have the skills of modern big men but there’s (probably) still no one today that can guard a prime Shaq.    Boban probably has the skill and size to be a factor in any era.  I would just say that he doesn’t have that “alpha dog” mentality that many champions have.  Very much a gentle giant like Yao.  My opinion is that prime Shaq’s athleticism in the modern NBA would’ve been on par with prime LBJ, Giannis, and Zion and he would’ve been a perennial all star at the very least.  Like an angry Rudy Gobert on steroids.  Boban has a lot of merits that Shaq didn’t have, but so did a lot of centers that weren’t as “great” as Shaq.  Easy to forget Shaq was the consensus best player in the world for a few years in between Jordan and Kobe.  Today, Boban might be the sixth best player on his team.  Before we can compare Boban to Shaq, he needs to surpass guys like Shawn Bradley, Yao and Manute Bol."
Bol Bol.
Nazreon Reid  Moses Moody  Bol Bol  Udonis Haslem
How many people saw Bol Bol being a SECOND round pick? Shit happens.
He’s got the body of Bol Bol but not the talent.
Bol Bol.
"Damn, imagine. What if Bol Bol leaves the Nuggets and becomes like MVP type of player. Im jk. Maybe he could.   In all honesty. We've probably missed out some players that could have become legends if they got a chance to play. Jokic is a good example of getting to shine. Imagine that. Legends, just sitting there that never got the chance to prove what they can become."
"oh, so not a typo?  why would a 7'3"" player be remarkable in 2000, though?  Gheorghe Mureșan 7'7"" played from 1993-2000, Manute Bol 7'7"" played from 1985-1994, there are others as well  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_players_in_National_Basketball_Association_history"
There were guys taller than that like Manute Bol before  2000 so not that shocking
I think players like Bol Bol are the most likely to have benefited from this in the past. With his injury and lack of development at oregon he dropped hard and didn't get a great draft position. Even being able to make 100-300k for a year with NIL so you aren't living on scraps and then develop for another year could have got him to stick around.
this is how I feel when I read Instagram comments wondering why Bol Bol is getting “wasted” on the Nuggets bench. Like stop it bro he looks lost on the floor
KD or Bol Bol?
That's Bol Bols brother right?
Bol Bol &gt; Paul Paul
"Dennis Rodman, Manute Bol, Ben Wallace, Bob Cousy, Mugsy Bogues, Earl Boykins, Calvin Murphy, Nate Robinson, and Spud Webb."
"bol, wes unseld, fat lever, garnett were all unique contextually. bol might be the most unique both in height and skill set. we will probably never see another player in history that averages more blocks than points"
Muggsy Bogues  Manute Bol
Bol Bol should've started when we were down 0-3
"Other than Mourning, Smits and Sabonis, none of those guys had much offensive game.    There are still novelty super-tall players left.  Tacko, Boban, Bol Bol, etc."
Bol bol
Manute Bol literally went 43/205 on 3 pt shots over his entire career. He was not good at 3s. And this guy was talking about him like he was some amazing outside shooter because of one half of one game.
&gt; Jxmmyhighroller   This dude's opinions are worthless. Ever since he made that video about Manute Bol being a 3 pt sniper I ignore everything that comes from him.
"Bol Bol, that's the only answer"
Could win 1K if this goes to OT. BOL
Bamba or Bol Bol. Just because I think they’ll develop better in a Raptors system
Mo bomba is a Freak athlete   Bol bol   On a different note  I would like to see Carsen edwards get a shot somewhere else I think if he is able to get some game time he could be an energy guy off the bench and be a serious scoring threat
Bol Bol.  Dude has had zero chance to prove himself
"MPJ, Barton, Morris, Green get you the salary matching. Then add in Bol Bol, and a couple firsts?"

Tacko Fall vs Bol Bol
Bol Bol is the best name even outside of basketball
bol bol is pretty great
JA for Bol!
Barton + Gordon + Bol + FRP
They just don’t play bol bol I wouldn’t call him a bust yet he needs to get out of Denver for anything to change though
"Kevin Durant. He's one of the reasons teams keep picking these 7-footers who end being busts because they think if they can develop a jumpshot and handle, they can be the next KD. Bol Bol, Thon Maker, I'm looking at you.  Steph Curry. He's the reason basketball is the way it is played right now. Also, he has indirectly affected who teams look for when building their squad like KD.  Jordan and Kobe. I don't think there is anything to explain here.  Magic and LeBron.  Shaq."
Bol bol
"He did, but there was a good shot at the time of getting MPJ and Bol Bol from Denver instead. Even if they didn’t work for our team we could at least get some trade value from that package. Instead we got Bledsoe."
"You could just stick bol bol in front of the rim, and have him block every single shot before it goes in. A lot of players can get above the rim too, like John Collins could easily block every shot if there was no goaltending."
What's the bol bol story?
"The Nuggets could definitely offer something better the Sixers. MPJ, Bol Bol, and picks or Jamal Murray and picks are way better than what the Sixers could give."
I hate the warriors so I got a good one. Steph curry and 5 first round picks for bol bol
"Bol Bol grew up in Kansas, you think he would have lower expectations"
Never forget Bol Bol was surprised that Denver wasn't a bum city.  Phoenix not even that bad either.
"Watch him play an nba game. There’s no way that he’s putting in hours of good practice and getting Worse. He had terrible form and Mechanics and has refused  help... isn’t changing his form. This Sixers blog from 2019 tears it apart:  “Manute Bol used to walk into Sixers’ practice every day and put up hundreds of shots and he never improved a lick. Practice doesn’t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. You need the right method.  Buzz is right. Truth is, Ben could fling up millions of straight legged, elbow-flaring, wrist-twisters this summer and still be lucky to crack 63 percent from the line next year. It’s like practicing frisbee, but hurling it like a baseball. You can only get so far.”  https://www.libertyballers.com/2019/5/20/18627828/is-ben-simmons-taking-the-jump-shot-thing-seriously-enough-when-do-we-worry   He misses layups in practice  https://www.yardbarker.com/general_sports/articles/nba_fan_secretly_recorded_ben_simmons_missing_a_lot_of_floaters_during_practice/s1_16751_35193356"
"yeah this is the main reason why I think someone will hire her now. I mean the Wizards got Manute Bol and Muggsy Bogues for the same reason.  I'm all for equality and all that but no damn way grown men will listen or respect a female coach, especially a white one, at this point in time. This ain't Eddie or Sunset Park."
"Yeah there aren't _that_ many full MLE slots, since a lot of teams like to save 2 million or so to sign their second-rounders for four years (otherwise they can only sign them for 2 years, like Lakers with Horton-Tucker), and a lot of the contenders (who don't care as much about their second-round guys) only have the tax-payer mid-level.  Like this past year we split the MLE between JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2.x)."
"I seem to recall Manute Bol just catapulting in 3s one game, but I don't recall if his shooting form was with both hands in thay (infamous) video"
jokic would be the worst point guard out of all of these people. he is very good with getting assists. but not in the same way someone like magic or stockton was. the best pg would be bam bol bol or kat
Bol Bol
Free Bol Bol
Bol Bol
2020-2021  PG: Jokic  SG: Poku   SF: Bol Bol  PF: Boban  C: Tacko
"Well it’s kind of weird to think about but all of Jokic, Murray, Porter Jr, Monte Morris, and Aaron Gordon are 25 or younger. Plus, they have some other intriguing pieces include Zeke Nnaji, Bol Bol, PJ Dozier, and Markus Howard. They could run a respectable NBA rotation with just their young guys, which makes them all the more dangerous with some veteran signings."
"&gt; Excuse himself, admit he’s soft, blame other problems and accept no responsibility?  I mean, that is Embiid, right?  Running away from interview as a cry baby when he had a shit game, not owning up to his responsibility, not talking about his _eight_ turnovers and also completely disappearting _when it mattered_, _again_. Those 2 missed free throws in the other game and now being useless in the last 2 minutes.  But well.... If you don't like him and Simmons is _this_ bad, we may include him in a trade for Millsap, Bol Bol and Markus Howard."
"&gt;The only NBA player with an affluent background I remember of is Jose Calderon.  ? Are you not aware of the many NBA players whose fathers played in the league?  Steph, Klay, Tim Hardaway, Jalen Brunson, KJ Martin, Cole Anthony, Jae Crowder, Bol Bol, etc. List goes on and on."
Bol Bol
How denver gonna get Simmons without those guys lol. Is Bol Bol that valuable?
"We shouldn't include MPJ. Barton, Gordon, a first and Bol is a really good and fair offer. They get out of the contract, an OK prospect and a pick"
I'd do that for sure assuming we can move Tobi for a PG. Bol in the mix is also super interesting to me.
I'd be game for Barton + AG + our first. The value is in moving off his contract after just one year because Barton and Gordon are expiring. We can also include Bol or Nnaji. MPJ obviously stays
You guys will get Bol Bol and you will like it
Bol Bol for Simmons
"Bol bol went from an expected lottery pick to like 45th, let's not act like it's a guarantee players he wanted would've been there, mock drafts aren't always great"
"Both nutrition and genetics play a major role, though genetics role more pronounced. Nutrition can give a couple centimeters at best, while genetics is the difference between you being being Manute Bol or Mugsy Bogues."
Giannis went from Bol Bol to David Robinson almost overnight
I'd love to see more mins for Bol!
Bol Bol makes this list next year. Play him more you cowards!
Short manute bol
Bol bol
"Imagine harden, jamal Murray, MPJ and bol bol on the same team..."
he’s definitely a mix of Muggsy Bogues and Manute Bol
Manute Bol
"Brioche Baynes, Louvre Amundson, Soufflé Dalembert, Baguette Biyombo, Bonjour Bol Bol, GOVID-19  Whatever you choose to call him, just remember he is **OVERRATED**"
"""But mah advanced analytics say he is a top 5 playe"" SHUT UP ALREADY JAZZ FANS  Bonjour Bol Bol is OVERRATED AF"
MICKEY MOUSE DPOY! Bonjour Bol Bol you're overrated #FraudWatch stop getting dunked on U bum.
Bol bol definitely has the chance to take over this spot.
Draymonds a good choice. If Bol bol pans out maybe him too.
"Bol has a ton of potential but he plays like he's 6'3"""
Bol needs more mass. Tacko is too slow.
"Tacko is awful lol  I love him, but he is completely a meme at this point.  Bol Bol isn’t as bad, but he isn’t a rotation quality player yet."
"Bol isn't very good and has poor body language. I think we've given up on him tbh, even Markus Howard gets playtime"
"Bol might get traded soon. He’s really struggled to get on the court.  Though it’s possible we want to give him another year to develop, especially with covid upending a lot of stuff. He was obviously raw coming out, but I’d also heard some reports saying that he might not be ready for the nba life from like an emotional/mental level. Which sounds kind of condescending but it was basically saying that he was an 18-19 year old kid who might need some extra guidance/hand holding - more than the other youngsters who come out.  Of course he lands with the one NBA team who doesn’t have a local g-league affiliate so we had to send him to Chicago’s g-league team. Then the pandemic happened. Shortened to no practices.  Tough set of circumstances for a young guy to try to learn the ropes and learn consistency about being a pro and all that comes with it."
Add in Denver for the deadly Ball Ball Bol Bol connection
Nuggets officially make a Tacko Bol
Tacko to Nuggs to team with Bol please
"Ball handling the ball, jabs!, drives! Behind the back to Ball back to Ball again for the lay up, blocked by Bol Bol!"
Nuggets vs Hornets would be interesting. Bol Bol vs Ball Ball.
Bol is insanely skilled. By far the biggest reason he's not successful is his motor.
"Nah, this just isn’t it. The reason we lost those series was because our offense was awful, largely thanks to Eaton but don’t take away from his stellar defense. During Eaton’s prime 85-89 we had a bottom 5 offense until 88 when Stockton became a starter and Malone became an all star (though IMO wasn’t quite in his prime), and even then in 88 and 89 we only manage to be the 16th and 17th offense in a league of 23 and then 25 teams. The only series in which Eaton wasn’t good defensively in that stretch was 89 against the warriors, but even then that was partly due to him starting to decline in the 89 season and the warriors in particular playing a nuts super high paced system.   The late 80s Jazz didn’t fail in the playoffs because Eaton suddenly wasn’t good defensively in the playoffs. They lost because outside of Stockton and Malone the rest of the team couldn’t do jack shit offensively. Eaton would struggle today but he was an absolute monster in his day, having a 5 year stretch of being the #1 defense 4 times and #3 the other year while averaging 4.4 blocks per game over that span shouldn’t be looked over. He was way better than Bol who was only part of a top 5 defense once, his rookie year. Our defensive rating from when Eaton got here to when he left correlates almost perfectly to the amount of minutes Mark played.   Eatons got a legit case for worst offensive player of all time (negative 3 career offensive win shares for a center is almost impressively bad) but he had arguably the highest defensive peak ever. But the 80s Jazz offense was so bad even the addition of Stockton and Malone couldn’t get it to average. Blaming the playoff exits on Eatons defense is just dumb."
"&gt; The Jazz had the best defense in the league by a pretty big margin.  Here's a case where the eye test and the statistical test tell you different things. In the late 80s, Detroit had the best defense, period, no matter what the stats say. Eaton was basically the Gobert of his era, only worse, and the only reason he didn't get played off the floor is the illegal defense rule still existed and most centers couldn't stretch the floor. He and the Jazz made a splash in 88 taking the Lakers to seven, but this was Kareem's next-to-last season and his mobility was circling the drain, so he couldn't pull Eaton away from the bucket.   The Jazz's defense ""prowess"" in the era translated into a second-round out in 85 (lost to Denver, which famously didn't play defense), a first-round out in 86 against Dallas (again, not exactly a defensive stalwart), a first-round out in 87 against Golden State (Sleepy Floyd sends his regards), the second-round out against the Lakers in 88, and *another* first-round out against Golden State in 89. In 89 Cleveland and Detroit were nearly as good on D statistically while fielding far more well-rounded squads with far more well-rounded players.  Eaton was the rare 7-4 guy who had the physical wherewithal to play 80 games in the regular season (there were other 7-4 guys, Sampson and Chuck Nevitt namely, but they were fragile and in Nevitt's case also significantly more unskilled). There was also Manute Bol, who in 89 was playing for GSW and was actually *better* than Eaton by the rough defensive measures we have. But there's a reason why Olajuwon has two rings while Eaton, Bol and (to date) Gobert don't, which is that there's more to playing defense at the center position than rim protection."

"I want a team like the Cavs to just collect all the meme players, it’d help get fans to the games. Imagine Caruso, Poku, and Bol Bol all on the same team"
"Mugsy Bogues 5'3""  Spud Webb 5'6""  Isiah Thomas 5'9""  AI 6'0""  Monute Bol 7'7"""
"That's not necessarily a good thing. Bol Bol is a ""unicorn"" in terms of his skillset. How's that working out for him?"
Bol Bol
Would Manute Bol count?
Bol was initially drafted by the Clippers in 1983 but the NBA voided the pick as he hadn't declared his eligibility beforehand.
Didn't Hakeem predate Bol by a year in the NBA? I think Hakeem was drafted in 84 and Bol in 85.
Manute bol
The guy has never seen Mobley play. “Skinny lanky tall big = Bol” is as far as his analysis goes.  People really need to stop making player comps based on appearance.
Mobley is so much more skilled than Bol Bol. There’s a reason that take is unpopular
I had this VHS too but forgot all about it except the manute bol video. Thanks for sharing!
Bol Bol in shambles
Dude TIL that nothing is as it seems with Mr. Bol.  Like what the fuck. He may have been 50 when he got drafted.  They just don’t know for sure.
Manute Bol was 45 when he was drafted
Manute Bol was 45 when he was drafted
No Bol Bol wins it.
Sharife getting the Bol Bol treatment
I'm just glad Coop wasn't invited to be there. Watching Bol Bol sit by himself was heart breaking lmao
Sharife is this year’s version of bol bol
We don't do second rounders and never have unless it's someone like Bol Bol. People are free to post them if they want.
Sharife Cooper the Bol Bol of this years draft
Damn Ayo! First Bol and now him...tough couple of drafts for players with 3 letter first names
Probably pretty bad.  We saw this with Bol Bol.
"Wait, did someone draft Bol Bol yet?"
Bol Bol came hella close
Bol Bol came close.
Manute Bol was 7’7 and was listed at 200 pounds
In the first round ye. Bol Bol fell to second round 44
The closest was bol bol dropping to the middle of the 2nd I think
They always invite some highly likely picks. But some years they go late like Bol Bol
"Man remember when Bol Bol walked out and almost didn't get picked, that shit hurt me"
"They just invite the most hyped prospects. Sometimes it doesn't work out, like with Bol Bol."
"I look like a mix of Luis scola and manute Bol, with a splash of curry, and a sprinkle of lebron"
Who wants to help us trade up? We can offer ONE BOL BOL.
Bol Bol
"boban, tacko, bol bol"
"We need to marry someone like Bol Bol to a Italian girl or something. We need a C so badly! Also, CJ McCollum, come play for us, your wife is Italo-American and you love wine and Tuscany!"
"Almost assuredly we're going to make a move before/on draft night.  Just won't be for #1.  MAYBE #3 but most likely it involves moving 16/18 (either packaged together up, or maybe down to get someone like Bol Bol)"
"Mitchell doesn't have good shooting mechanics there is a reason why he's dropping in mock drafts. The best thing we can do is stay at 26 and get the best guard available (Primo, Mcbride, Springer, Ayo, Hyland). Maybe, trade Bol for a 2nd rounder and pick someone else up."
"We never move up so I doubt it, probably trade Bol for a 2nd and call it a day"
"Poku, Bol Bol, and Josh giddey on the perimeter please"
Bol bol realistically probably wont ever be good lol i feel like people just hype him because he has a funny name and he's manutes son.
Bol Bol needs to go to OKC and pair up with Poku. Imagine that front court.
Kevin Porter Jr  Hoping Bol Bol finally gets some run
I was thinking Shai for MPJ straight up. We'll add Bol Bol as a sweetener along with a 1st rounder.
"Bol might be too skinny to guard the 5 though?  I don't know too much about his defense tbh.    But I would definitely be interested in taking a shot at him with 18, if we can't package 16/18 to move up and maybe get someone like Sengun."
18 for 26 + Bol + future 2nd?
"We might give you guys #18 for him. We have a hole at the center position and if we don’t identify anyone at that position in this draft, Bol Bol would get some minutes with us at that spot."
Bol Bol?
Yeah I don't think Bol Bol and our FRP gets us low enough for OKC but would be sooo down.
Vlatko Cancar can probably be used to move up 1/2 a spot. Include Bol Bol and you might be looking at being able to move up to the 25th pick.
"Bol, and Howard probably.  Nnaji is probably going to stay.  Howard has some upside as a from the bench microwave kinda guy"
LET'S GOOOOOO.  Bol bol and Howard probably
Who can help us give Bol Bol actual meaningful minutes?
Young bench players? Howard and Dozier unless we want to trade Zeke which I doubt. Bol if he even counts as a bench player at this point
"Ours is more recent though Dillon Brooks is looking nice in Memphis. We got Payton Pritchard, Bol Bol, Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell...so pretty meh generally. Aaron Brooks I guess had a few years he looked nice in Houston but that's getting into old head territory/outside the 10 year window...."
Manut Bol was the Crouch equivalent. I find Durant a good Di Maria equivalent.
Bol Bol.
"The Denver Nuggets are one healthy season away from winning a championship. They're not exactly up and coming so people forget that they're still very young: Jokic is 26, Jamal is 24, MPJ is 23, Aaron Gordon is 25, and Monte Morris is 26. If everything falls into place, they have the potential to be a dynasty.  In the brightest timeline, MPJ becomes Tracy McGrady, Jamal proves that he's the real Maple Jordan, Aaron Gordon turns into Warriors Iggy,  Jokic is Jokic, and they go on to win three championships in four years.  The brightestest timeline also involves RJ Hampton coming back home when he's an all-star, future league MVP Aleksej Pokusevski choosing the hardest road and joining the Nuggets dynasty because he can't win with those cats, Tim Connelly drafting another generational superstar in the 2nd round (i.e. Kai Sotto), Jokic playing well into his 40s without any decline in his play, and Bol Bol finally taking the leap to become a serviceable NBA player.  Or everything goes to shit because nothing good ever happens. Either way you'll still have fun because every single Nuggets player is hard not to root for."
"It just seems like he doesn’t give basketball his everything, I think he’d rather hangout w Lil Uzi than put in the work to actually be able to play more than 5 minutes a game. Also he plays for a coach who’s kind of a hard ass on a team that’s trying to become a serious contender so they can’t bite the bullet and let bol develop. His off the dribble shooting is pretty insane for a guy his size tho, who knows if he’ll ever put it Together?"
Bol bol but that is fading fast
"Nuggets with Joker would be great.  Yeah yeah they have Bol Bol but I'm in this for the memes, start em both. All longboi."
We'll trade you Bol Bol for Juancho.
here’s my predictions for 5 years from now 1. Thon Maker 2. Matur Maker 3. Makur Maker 4. Bol Bol 5. Payton Pritchard
Mugosey bouges and manut bol. Tallest (well almost) and shortest player ever
Heard this about Manute Bol as well. There’s a conspiracy that he was actually close to 50 when he was playing
Bol bol
"Send it to the Nuggets for ""future MVP"" Bol Bol &amp; the ""next Curry"" Markus Howard."
Send it to the Nuggets for Bol Bol. /s
Who y'all want from us Philly?  One bol bol?  One will the thrill in a s&amp;t?  One Vlatko Cancar?
"For those wondering, the second group lost out to Wilt Chamberlain (38.4 points and 27 rebounds), John Stockton (13.2 assists and 3.6 steals), and Manute Bol (5.0 blocks)."
Damn Eaton at 4.6 was 2nd. Manute Bol had 5!
manute bol would never miss with his 8'6 wingspan. he'd just drop the ball in your cups
Best 3 letter last name: Bol Bol
Bol Bol
I saw Bol Bol has Joel Embiid Ceiling after the draft
I remember people going crazy over the Nuggets getting Bol Bol after some Bubble exhibition games.
1 Giannis or 2 Lukas Luka   1 Giannis or 5 Bobby Portis Giannis   1 Giannis or 3 Javale Mcgee Giannis   1 Giannis or 2 Damian Lillard Dame   1 Giannis or 2 Anthony Davis Ad   1 Giannis or 6 Larry Nance Jr Giannis   1 Giannis or 3 Chris Pauls Giannis   1 Giannis or 5 Hardens Harden   1 Giannis or 2 Kyries and 3 Bol Bols Giannis   1 Giannis or 13 Dwight Howard's Giannis   1 Giannis or 3 Sexlands Giannis
Wait…people had unrealistically high hopes for Bol Bol? Like who?
People said Bol Bol could be a HOFer? Did they ever watch him play?
So does Bol Bol…
"Um, not only do we not have Barton on the roster anymore, nobody wants bol bol lol."
"2 Lukas. Trade one for a better complimentary star. If that's cheating, I still think 2 Lukas is just too crazy good.   Giannis &gt; 5 Bobby Portis. You can get Bobby Portises in free agency. You can't just get a MVP.   1 Giannis &gt; 3 Javale Mcgees. My dude.   1 Giannis &gt; 2 Damian Lillard. This is close. 2 Dames don't compliment each other that well, and Giannis is so much surplus value over a max contract whereas Dame is worth his max, maybe a little more.   2 Anthony Davis. One will be healthy, right?  1 Giannis &gt; 6 Larry Nances Jr. See Portis  1 Giannis &gt; 3 Chris Pauls. Assuming current CP3. Prime CP3 a different matter.   5 Hardens. I will exchange one Harden for one Gobert and collect my championships until the team blows up.   1 Giannis &gt; 2 Kyries and 3 Bol Bols. I'd rather have 2 Dames.   1 Giannis &gt; 13 Dwight Howards. 13 Dwights would bring so many baby mommas to the game we wouldn't have seats for paying fans.   1 Giannis &gt; 3 Sexlands I'm too tired for a good meme answer here."
&gt;2 Kyries and 3 Bol Bols  Now thats some proper chaos I wanna see
That was just a run on sentence with some random emojis. Like trying to read a cam newton post. Give me a source not your cherry picked career numbers on a project player that came in at 17 and is reaching his peak.  Idk why you're talking Ky. You said harden was more skilled finisher. I'm also including touch and whatever else you use to..finish lol. I guess I'm not including hooking the defenders arm so I guess if you include that maybe. nah jk giannis still a better finisher. And for some reason people don't think defense is a skill if you're tall? Cuz von maker and bol bol both came into the league taller and more skilled than giannis. So he must have just worked really hard on non skills to win a title and a mvp. Gratz on stealing a line from Twitter. [Insert harden pulling hamstring at strip club joke here]   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gcg79t/who_are_statistically_the_best_finishers_at_the/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body
Tony Snell -&gt; Thon Maker -&gt; Manute Bol
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
KAT has the same chance as Bol Bol of winning the MVP. A good dark horse is Paul George.
Wdym we unfortunately lose bol bol cuz he’s obviously our best player
Tim Hardaway and Manute Bol come to mind
"Bol Bol  Still think he can, one day"
Boucher ain't getting fat bro. He's a long boi with narrow shoulders. Dude is more manute bol than Giannis
"I believe the purpose of the summer league is to showcase the newly acquired draft picks; critique any problematic pieces of said draft picks while introducing them to the coaching style; and, seeing if any of the other than current draftees have improved during their player development. Off the top, I think of Bol Bol and Obi Toppin."
because bol bol
why no bol
"Nope, Manute Bol unstoppably trebucheting six threes in a half."
BOL BOL will be a phenomenon.
"Bol Bol isn't going to make it in the league. Yes he can move well and dribble and pass...but he can't do any of these things at a level to be the main guy on a team in the modern NBA...which means he going to be a role player, but he lacks the game to fit in as a role player. Similar to Isaiah Thomas...good enough to score 80 in a pro-am game but not good enough to be the main guy on a modern team and lacks the game to fit in as a role player."
"Thanasis went 4 for 5 on threes that game.  For the rest of his career, he's 3 for 35.  It was like that one Manute Bol game when he hit 6 threes in a half."
It's Manute ..RIP Manute Bol.. Bol Bol has potential
"i was like ""did bol bol get traded to the pistons?"""
Bol Bol and IT
is like bol but shit
"mature bol, to be exact"

KD is a combination of Bol Bol and MJ
Bol bol being similar to manure bol
"Nuggets should build around Jokic, Porter Jr and Bol Bol, and not Jamal Murray"
"Knox shot badly but Knicks fans were so hyped for some reason  You have better examples, Bol Bol was averaging like 25 and shooting elite from 3 as well"
"Salary wise it would have to be Barton. I think if we’re being honest Barton and white are in the same tier as players, just white is a bit better and better fit here too.   So the trade would look something like Barton + something. Maybe that is bol, else maybe zeke or a first but that’s more so on the higher end imo, especially cause i think the only first we can give is in 27’, which is a little nutty to do that far out for a role player.   Add second rounders or a pick swap if needed. Understand if it’s not the most appealing"
Nuggets should start Jokic AND bol bol maybe popular because people love bol bol but I think purely because of talent he needs to play more
"1. Kyrie Irving is the most offensively talented player in league history. His offense is so good people sleep on his defense. He is actually a great defender. 2. James Harden is supremely overrated his jumper is inconsistent af but i think he plays way better defense than he gets credit for 3. Draymond has been the best overall defender in the league for years but has regressed so much on offense he may as well be matisse thybulle  4. The Lakers roster is awesome i loved every move...shame they couldn't get Rudy gay tho 5. The bucks don't get passed the second round next year and the sun's getting bounced in the first 6. The Cavs are going to compete for a play in spot next year 7. Bol bol is being under used and under developed under Mike malone 8. Phil jackson is the most overrated coach of all time in any sport 9.  Hakeem is the ""best"" center of all time regardless of rings 10. Larry bird would be joe ingles in today's game"
&gt; Bol-Bol Hurts   I'm so ded
"the way fans have treated him, boban, and manute bol before him as this freakshow circus meme pisses me off and it'll never go away man. sad"
"Kevin ‘dick’ Huerter, Anus Can-hurt, Bol-Bol Hurts"
Instead of Bol Bol it would probably be MPJ and Murray.
"Murray, Bol Bol, and 3 firsts? Please?"
He’s so smooth. This kid was a steal. He’s gonna bring Bol along with him too. Win win.
I thought Bol had pretty nice handles
... Vs Shawn Bradley and Manute Bol twin towers.
"SGA might not be traditionally skinny, but he has the one of the lowest body fat percentages ever. Probably kick out Bol, move KD and Ingram to 4 and 3 respectively, and slot in SGA."
"Yeah but Bol didn't do himself any favors either, he played zero team basketball when he got in the game and pretty much tried to shoot every time he touched the ball.  His effort wasn't always great, either."
Bol Bol on repeat.
If you throw in a first the nuggets might trade bol bol for him.
"Bol Bol stans, PACK A BOWL!"
"How many calories would it take for Bol Bol to get a body like Giannis?  &amp;#x200B;  And if he achieved it, would he be as unstoppable as Giannis currently is?"
i am high off Summer League games right now. Aaron Nesmith is Ray Allen with hair. Scottie Barnes is Giannis with thigh high socks. Bol Bol is Jesus in a basketball jersey.
"I need a Tacko Bol, still pretty hungry"
"I think it is worth noting the Nuggets were getting plowed. Empty stats in Summer League are a thing even if he does look really good at times. Hopefully he can find more PT, but he has to show something (anything) when he does.  Bol Bol, just like his father, has got to have the most unique body type in the NBA. Boban also has an odd body type (giant rectangle chest)."
"Whoever has the ball will probably lob it to the other one. So if Jokic has the ball, he would lob it to Bol and dipsy-doo-flip-a-roo."
Bol Bol would like a word
"Help yourself to another Bol, you’re all skin and bones"
"Bol Bol really hit the grind during the summer and practiced playing as himself in 2K, really starting to pay dividends in summer league"
no one is trading a good back up for Bol Bol the guy has shown very little in actual nba games.
Bol Bol is who Thon Maker thinks he is.
BOL BOL WILL BE A GOAT
Excited to see more of Bol Bol and Bones man
No Murray for the nuggets so I say fuck it. Run the Bol/Jokic PnR all game

"100%. Nuggets with MPJ and Bol Bol are prime examples and 1/2 have paid off big so far. I wasn’t as high on cooper as most but I had him mid 30s, not 48. Jalen Johnson on the other hand I thought would’ve went 9th/10th in the draft when I mocked it and honestly thought he would’ve been a perfect addition for the kings at 9. Draft season is a roller coaster and I love it"

Down 20. Thats Bol Bol time babyyy

Manute bol. He was playing nba by day and commanding troops in Sudan by night. He was using his nba money to fund his army to fight off military factions that were attacking his homeland. Easily the baddest assed dude to wear an nba uniform

When I think generational talent I think of one name: Bol Bol
"obviously bol is raw and young but 21/5 in 29 isn't really impressive when you had 6 TOs, shot like dogshit and didn't score any of your 3s"
Minut Bol relation?
Bol is unplayable in today's NBA. But Ntilikina is a bust. It's a lose lose trade for both teams. Total waste of time and money.
"Bol unfortunately is that “coaches kid” who didn’t really want to play but had to due to family expectations. Word before the draft was he really didn’t like basketball, he just did it since he was raised for it and had NBA size. That’s one of the reasons his draft stock fell"
I seriously doubt bol bol will ever be an nba caliber player.  Ntilikina isn't great but he can be serviceable off the bench in the NBA.
"Ntilikina is a horrible bust, but they should give Bol Bol to another team since he never plays."
Denver would be dumb to give up Bol for that little
No Bol has potential. Frank is bust.
Frank is much better than Bol Bol can ever be!
we r not re-signing frank so u wud be giving us bol bol for free lol
"it's hard to know how good bol bol really is, sometimes i wonder what would happen if a team gave him consistent minutes despite his flaws... having said that, bol isn't really fit to be a backup big yet, maybe a SF/PF"
"no, if bol bol was that good on offense hed play regardless, like MPJ"
Highlight culture would have you believe bol bol is a 7'0 point guard that can shoot step back threes and is wasted on the nuggets
Dude can Bol!
I mean true and jokic not being a great defensive player mean bol prob won't get the playing time he need
I'm weirdly invested in Bol Bol's career and I just wanna see him shine
Bol was 7’7 and Sampson was 7’4 why are we talking about anomalies lol
BOL BOL
Weird Mike Malone isn't playing him ? Is he scared bol bol gonna join the iso gang club and make jokic pissed off at him ?
You can only do so much with legs.  Heard of Bol or Ralph Sampson?
Bol Bol is a beast  He should go to rebuilding team like Thunder and get way more burn
Manute Bol   Bol Bol   Bol Bol   Bol Bol   Bol Bol
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtdPplzbmd0  This is grainy as fuck.  It's also 5'7"" Spud Webb dunking over 7'7"" Manute Bol."
"Green is clean. Not going to lie, Mobley lookin like Bol Bol now."
"These are literally the only 3 players in NBA history that I feel are like him. That says a lot. He’s a rare, special player.  Also he’s kinda like a **much** better Bol Bol"
"Nah   Steph/Poole/Mannion is as good of depth as they have  with a significantly better starter  Klay(fully healthy)/Moody: Klay would be easily better than Barton and I’m willing to wager the drop off between a rookie and a player out of the league isn’t massive  Wiggins/Iguodala/Kuminga/OPJ: assuming health, this is just better than their sf Rotation. Wiggins is significantly worse than MPJ for offense, significantly better for defense. OPJ, if healthy is probably better than Jamychal (though if you want to slot him as PF then this rotation gets weaker given Kuminga and Iguodala’s age)  Draymond/Bjelica personally I think it’s better starter with a bit worse bench piece    Wiseman/Looney just worse, but there is an argument for Looney &gt; Bol"
He really put Bol Bol

"Markus Howard alpha dogged him right back out the door.   *I’m the long range chucker around here…well me, Bones, and Bol Bol.*"

Bol Bol for Sexton straight up who says no
They need to trade Love for Bol Bol and have him play PG then they’ll be 82 - 0
without bol bol they’re a regular season fraud
Implying Bol Bol was actually 11 then
SexLand for Bol straight up
The warriors office would be absolutely moronic to do this. However we can give them Aaron Gordon and bol bol and iw would be happy
Bol Bol would be a great 6th man
"Listen, I've watched Bol Bol play since he was 11. The kid did not give one single solitary fuck about basketball in his entire life. Dude was like 6'2"" in the seventh grade getting scared off the post by some 5'7"" white kid from Missouri, and he remains the only person I have ever seen play an entire half of basketball without running once. Its possible that Bol has had some massive breakthrough mentally since high school but he is everything people thought Ant would be. He plays basketball because he's big and his dad did."
The hell is your problem? Bol &amp; Naz too‽ are you daft man? Have you no ❤️?
"I actually think it was the Nuggets in the bubble. They had Bol Bol, MPJ, Niko and someone else all in the starting lineup.  Edit: [Kinda](https://imgur.com/a/DdnEoC8)"
"Welp fuck it, Let's go big and Trade for Bol Bol."
"Of course it’s speculation lol How would i know how Bol Bol feels?   all I’m saying is confidence effects how a player plays, especially young ones, and having a team that doesn’t believe in you could easily make someone lose confidence and 5 mins of meaningless basketball in 30 games isn’t really doing much to change that"
They just need Bol
Cavs should really pull the trigger to trade for Bol Bol.
"If you can’t prove yourself in garbage time you don’t deserve the chance to play a larger role yet. Coaches usually know what they’re doing, specifically good coaches like mike malone who ar proven in the league. I think Bol Bol will develop fine in Denver given his role models there."
"I know nobody watches games but bol bol is legit awful and has zero drive. He gets stepback threes but after turning over the ball around 3 times and being god awful at defense. Id he gets cooked and neutered by third stringers he would absolutely get destroyed by starters. He also has zero effort. I can't forget a game when he walked back to defense and allowed the other team to score on us, absolutely shameful for someone that wants to have a bigger role"
Bol Bol is lowkey one of the best rim protectors in the game. I've been blocked by him countless times.
How is Bol Bol tongue-tied lol?
"Please tell 2k it didn't happen. So sick of that games with tako fall, thon maker, and bol fuckibg bol as the best players. Oh yea with Ben Simmons with the greenest shot ever bringing up the point. Absolutely nobody's fantasy."

Bol Bol wins MVP hands down
"In 2K, the Giannis team would for sure sweep. Precious Achiuwa, Giannis and Bol Bol would kill the simulation. That's a freaking dynasty.  IRL, I'll give the Giannis team an edge in 6. I think Collins and PG13 could steal a couple, but I can't see them winning any more than that."
Mount Rushmore of African players should replace Manute Bol with Steve Nash
Manute Bol would be on there if we knew his true age.
"Denver should offer: Monte, Barton, Green, Bol Bol, Campazzo + first round pick and second round   Simmons- Murray- MPJ- Gordon- Jokic would be insane"

Jokic? Pretty sure he was talking about Bol Bol.
2k god bol bol
"Bol Bol, MPJ"
This has never been the reason. Bol doesn't play because he doesn't try when he does.
"I barely know anything about Sekou, so I'd say Bol, but Bol hasn't really shown much either yet"
bol has shown more flashes by all accounts
Who do you think is better between Bol &amp; him? Genuinely asking.
Bol Bol
"Giannis was built like manute bol when he was 16, that didnt stop him from growing into what he is rn. Hes 16, give it some time."
i recommend putting bol bol in 1990 and he would simply dominate. Mj would be bbq chicken for the might of bol bol
Tacko Bol
"Ahh yes, Tacko Bol"
"Both Tacko Fall's and Bol Bol's spines will fuse together, back to back, forming a basketball version of the Flexile Sentry from Dark Souls 2"
"Man I want to agree with you but I doubt it's all legit even among the players. The whole league is all about this stuff so I can't believe they simply all leave it off the court during games. Like, does your dad stop thinking about your mom banging Manute Bol just because he's in his office?"
Bol Bol  Kristaps  Dirk
Bol Bol
Westbrook + Bol Bol = Giannis
Brandon Ingram and Bol Bol equals KD.
"PJ had a 29yo (I’m only mentioning her age because of how old he is) IG model trap him with a child. She pretended to like him and then dropped him as soon as she got pregnant. Bol Bol isn’t really as bad, but he dumped his girlfriend after she started posting public things about being a gold digger. He’s back with her again. If she plays him, I wouldn’t even be mad at her"
PJ Washington and Bol Bol didn’t learn anything
"That statistic is a little bit skewed by using a fairly accurate statistical estimation of the total number of people who are 7'+ but taking player's listed height at face value.     For example, while Nikola Vucevic is listed at 7'0"", he actually measure a touch over 6'10"". If you go by reasonably accurate draft combine measurements, the number of actual 7'+ NBA players plummets (Gobert, Porzingis, Poetl, Bol, Fall, and Moses Brown seem to be it) to 1.4% of American 7'+ males between the ages of 20-40 being NBA players (Moses Brown being the only American born player on the list)."
Have you seen bol bol play? He can block shots because of his length and height but he can’t actually defend at all.
PG Giannis SG Thon Maker SF Joe Ingles PF Bol Bol C Tacko Fall  6th man Isaiah Thomas  does this team break the warriors regular season record?
Bol still has potential to be really solid
"Bol Bol is pretty tall, he could probably reach most ceilings."
KD is an awful comparison. His speed and ball handling isn’t half of what Durant’s is. He’s more of a souped up Bol Bol or skinnier Kristaps.
I am also rooting for Bol Bol.
"Tbh it’s was just Thon and Bol who were supposed to be KD 2.0s. Shit I was super high on both guys and thought Thon was gonna be KD with muscle.   All anyone ever expected from Tacko was to be basically Boban, a bench big who’s only useful in certain lineups because of his size."
"What do Thon Maker, Bol Bol, and Tacko Fall have in common?"
*Manute Bol has entered the chat*
"This dude is 7’1” and 190 pounds…. Wtf (for context Bol Bol is 220lbs). This doesn’t sound healthy, I wonder if there’s some medical reason he’s so slight"

"I would floored if Dirk is high on this at all, even with his longevity. His shot from the post was almost anatomically unlockable unless Manute Bol is on the court."
And that's how Bol Bol came to be
"The question was 1-5, so Bol Bol can play the -4"
Manute Bol for his career has a 2.15 BLK/missed FG ratio (2086/970) while shooting 41% from the field.
Bol Bol
Manute Bol was once six three.
I feel like Manute Bol probably had at least one but I’m not gonna look it up
Manute Bol once hit six threes in a half.
"aside from that one famous game where he chucked up a bunch, Bol was not a shooter  He made 43-205 for his entire career, with 6 of those makes coming in one game."
Manute Bol hit more 3s in one game than Ben hit in his career thus far!
Whenever I think of manute bol shootinf 3s I always think of when he had like 6 in one half
Bol Bol is a bowl.
"Manute Bol was like 55 years old when he played in the NBA. Story goes is that he didn’t have a birth certificate and the guy who discovered him created fake papers for him to be able to go to the States. Teammate asked him why he has scars on his head, Bol said he didn’t know his birthday so he scarred himself every 10 years and he had 5 scars.  Maybe a few details off because I’m not remembering right."
I feel like Mo Bamba’s the Bol Bol of the East. Will this finally be the year he breaks out?
"your posts are so garbage dude.  1) it's not like Barnes is on a hot fluky shooting streak in pre-season. he's showing defensive versatility, play-making and IQ, and he's only 20 years old. he's leading the team in assists as a 6'8 positionless player. Suggs, the supposed PG isn't even coming close lmfao and hasn't shown anything that would've warranted the raptors taking him over barnes. and outshine what potential?  his shooting still sucks and he's demonstrating that's he's not that good of a playermaker. yeah i bet you're impressed by Suggs half court fluke shot and his fancy, risky bounce passes. he honestly doesn't do anything better than Barnes and Barnes has a lot more going for him for success in the NBA. not to mention Suggs' arrogance, claiming he has no weaknesses in his game LOL.  2) it wouldn't be shocking if he averages less than 10ppg as a rookie. it's clear his offensive game is raw. did Kawhi, Pascal, OG, Giannis or similar molds average more than 10 ppg as a rookie? no.   3)why the fuck should we care about college accomplishments? This is the NBA dude LOL. Should we put Adam Morrison in the hall of fame because of his college game? Fuck outta here.   4)Barnes has better tools than all the players you listed. Bol Bol, Isaac, Bender don't have his combination of versatility, wing span, vision, and IQ, not to mention his personality and leadership   5)are you stupid, a troll or just ignorant? The championship run wasn't all Kawhi and this has been discussed to death. Let's see the players who have improved with the Raptors : OG 23rd overall, Pascal 27th overall, Norm Powell 2nd rounder, Fred Van Vleet undrafted, Chris Boucher undrafted, Lowry, Serge Ibaka. players recognize the Raptors reputation for player development because it's played out before our eyes over the past decade. you're head is so far up your ass it isn't even funny"
"My goal was to point out people are gassing Barnes up way too much because he is likable. Suggs has proven more than Barnes has in the limited action we’ve seen and his production/accomplishments in college dwarfed Barnes’s.  Barnes is a raw, project player...upside is crazy sure, but so was Bamba’s, and Bol Bol’s, and Jonathan Issac’s and Dragan Bender’s..you get the point. Stud guard prospects are a lot easier to project than raw forwards with physical tools."

"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
The opposite of Manute Bol = Spud Webb
Sometimes I feel like this is how some big guys end up approaching shooting. Had this thought when I was watching highlights from that game where Manute Bol randomly knocks down like 7 3s or something.
calling bol a miss already is truly insane
Bol Bol had that slick ass one bounce pass in the Bubble iirc  I thought the hype train was percolatin’ then
"Bol Bol isn't a miss. He was a mid-second rounder, worth the risk.  The misses: Mudiay and Tyler Lydon."
"We got Bol Bol with the 44th pick of the draft.  That isn't a ""miss,"" haha.  You don't expect 44th picks to be anything more than what Bol is, which is a project player who gets minutes at the end of the bench and shows flashes every once in a while."
You remember that time when the Nuggets were running lineups with Jokic and Bol together and he actually had decent statlines? People still remember that and hold too much value in potential than what they see. Bol Bol to me might be a better version of Thon Maker but that’s it
"You might get downvoted for saying Bol Bol but fr every draft they get an impact player. PJ Dozier, RJ Hampton and now Bones all look like they can stick in a rotation in 2-3 years time"
"Other than Bol Bol, have they really ""missed""?"
Timberwolves analyst Jim Peterson said that Manute Bol could stand under the rim and grab both bottom corners of the backboard.
"Watching Bol Bol move makes me uncomfortable.  He looks way too long and skinny, like a thin piece of wood I'm worried will break."
Bol Bol and a bag of basketballs.
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"Bol Bol by a mile, can’t believe nobody has said him yet. Seeing videos of him running the court then draining a three along with the crazy other stuff he can do makes him look insane on film. Even if your just watching his summer league highlights or college. But in reality there’s a reason he isn’t getting many minutes on the nuggets. He can’t guard a 4 or 5 cause he’s so skinny, but is very slow for a 3 aswell. He seems like a cool guy, but the idea of a 7’2 220 player seems great but in reality a little different"
What's funny is the more weight he loses the better he is.  He's going to get the second unanimous MVP if he can get Bol Bol skinny.
well you've sold me Manute Bol &gt; Shaq with that argument
Bulls get Bol Bol or Marvin Bagly as a Backup.  Or sign Demarcus Cousins. Also play Matt Thomas More he a real shooter. If we get a decent back up  big man we should be great. I never seen Tony Bradley play since College tho.
"Modern day Manute Bol.  Bol was a 21% outside shooter (Bobi is better), but every time his gangly 7'7"" ass connected it was a legitimate momentum swing."
This was a fun bench shoot out. Markus and Bol looked lost as hell. smh.
"I really want a Bol Bol breakout year, he's so surreal to watch out there how thin he is."
"No MPJ tonight, gonna hope for 30 minutes of Bol and Bones"

Kennard's d is so bad he made Bol look like prime AI.
Bol Bol is so bad on defense
Bol Bol
Bol Bol comes from lion fighting stock. No man will back him down.
"He's never going to be able to back anyone down except bol bol because his center of gravity is so high. Probably needs to take a dribble, draw the double and kick out here."
I’ve never seen a player so big play so small. Even Manute Bol tried to bang around in the paint to some extent even though a light breeze would send him fluttering away.
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
"That’s what they said about Bol Bol coming out of high school.  I’m not trying to be a hater, but the post says his comp is KD.  I’m not saying he can’t be a solid player but there’s no way he’s a KD."
"They are obviously on completely different levels as prospects but Maker legitimately does have solid handles for a 7 footer. Bol Bol is an even better case, he's actually pulled them off on an NBA court"
This is also similar to Bol Bol or Poku
Jokic/MPJ/Gordon/Green/Bol  Who needs to jump lineup
Shawn Bradley or Manute Bol.
I got a bad feeling this kid is gonna be a mix between Poku and Bol Bol.
"This.  Even without the injuries, he’ll be too slow and weak to be anything other than a 7 foot spot up shooter.  He’ll be just like KP with the potential to end up like Bol Bol…which KP isn’t terrible but it’s also not in the same world as KD.  Who will he guard?  They’ll pick n roll him off the court.  Sure, he’ll get stronger and a little bit quicker but go back and watch Bol Bol and Thon Maker.  They had the same hype and skill sets."
"&gt;NBA players have turned into spoiled brats, what with their incessant opinions on race, politics and vaccines, and their shitty attitudes for their own jobs. If there is a class war these idiots should be the first to go.  anti-bol, you really have to say their opinion in race makes them spoiled? Lmao fuck out of here u racist. Lol thats one of the dumbest takes I've seen in this sub today.  Edit: nvm troll account."
Unfortunately we will be trading bol for him
Outside chance for Bol Bol if everyone else gets hurt and he leads the Nuggets to a 1 seed.
"The deadliest I would have to say Mike Muscala in terms of shooting. Overall game KAT OR VU. Two player to watch... Roby and Bol Bol.   Obviously Bol Bol cant play many minutes due to his height for safety reasons, but Roby has a chance to really create a whole new style for Centers"
Manute Bol
"* Tatum, both are very good but I expect Brown to be who he was last year while Tatum becomes more consistent and improves on the playmaking flashes he's shown.  * Don't see any of them really improving, more playing in the same role they had. I'll go Nunn, because I think he's a more consistent and less ball-dominant player than Monk, and I think that off-ball scoring will be very valuable to the Lakers.  * Maxey, I think Thybulle is who he is- great defender but offensive nonfactor. Maxey is much more of a young, developmental prospect, and he'll likely see more minutes as a PG/playmaker with Ben out.  * Brooks, I think Clarke is buried in the rotation and Brooks really stepped it up (particularly defensively) last season.  * Huerter, played a big role in a playoff series and he'll likely split minutes with Bogi and LouWill- the only two players on the Hawks who are really SGs, and I expect Lou/Cooper to avoid sharing the floor with Trae for defensive purposes. Reddish has shown a lot less and is competing with Hunter/Gallo/Collins/Bogi for a spot as a SF/PF.  * Miles took a huge leap last with Hayward out, and his efficiency was through the roof last year, but I'm going with PJ. He experienced the classic sophomore slump on offensive, but his defense was still very good. I think he'll follow the trend of players who re-find their footing in their third year, after they're accustomed to the league a bit.  * Bones, he'll be a legit rotation guy and showed out in college and Summer League. Bol still doesn't have a defined role or NBA skillset and he's buried in the rotation.  * Hayes. I loved Hayes coming out of the draft but he's been an appalling NBA player who is good at basically nothing. That means he basically has nowhere to go but up, even if Bey is still the better player. He'll probably get better with a whole season and no injuries, but I think he's gonna be a four to five year project kind of guy if he even sticks in the league. I think Bey's minutes are gonna be eaten into with Cade/Grant occupying a similar role, and I think Hayes almost has to get better, while Bey will slowly refine the things he's already good at- I think he'll develop like his Villanova peer Mikal Bridges, pretty good as a rookie and slowly refining that 3&amp;D skillset until he becomes really good within that niche.  * KPJ, I think Wood is who is and won't take much of a leap. This was KPJ's first year as a PG and he looked promising, I expect him to be a better at playmaking with some experience. Wood is probably still the better play, but with less change in his game.  * Herro, another guy who I think had a sophomore slump but is still a valuable player, even last year he was a solid off-ball guy and actually averaged a higher PPG than Duncan, albeit on much worse efficiency. Herro is also a better playmaker than Duncan, and much younger. Duncan could still be the better player, but I doubt he changes much in his age-27 season, while Herro has a bit more room to grow.  * Both made a big jump last year, and I think this year will be becoming slightly better versions of themselves, instead of another big jump. RJ's shot has really dramatically improved, and I think he'll get slightly better in that area even if he experiences a dip in raw numbers (for example, going from 40% three-point shooting to 38%, but doing so on more attempts per game). I'll go RJ because of the leap from rookie to sophomore, and I think he has a higher defensive ceiling than Randle. I also expect some of Randle's heavy usage to be eaten into by Kemba/Rose, hurting his raw numbers even if he's just as valuable.  * Mann, Winslow has basically taken a Klay Thompson-length break from basketball.  * Walker, I'm very low on Hayes and his fit beside Zion is questionable, plus he has JV ahead of him. The Pelicans backcourt is seemingly an open race, and NAW seems the most likely guy to take that SG spot.  * Pat, I think Lonzo is who he is (which is a very valuable player) but I don't see him developing into a star. Pat looked like a man amongst boys in Summer League and I think he increases his three-point volume; he shot efficiently last year, but on very few attempts. And, on a roster with Lavine/Demar/Vooch, PatWill is gonna be expected to be a go-to defensive stopper, another area he's shown promise in- clearly the Bulls trust him to reach that promise.  * I'll stand with Ant here. I'm not sure what role D'Lo has on the Wolves; he's a poor defender, has below-average efficiency, and is fairly ball-dominant. He's not an astoundingly great playmaker either. I think he's actually better suited to a sixth man role, and he did play in that role some last season. I don't think Edwards back-half a season was a fluke, guy was legitimately great with Finch coaching and KAT alongside him, plus he should take the rookie to sophomore defensive jump; he's a hard worker and has all the physical attributes of a great defender."
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
The recruitment pool is also a hell of a lot wider now. You had the odd fluke find like Manute Bol back in the day but the Giannis and Embiids and Siakams of the world almost certainly wouldn’t have been NBA players 25+ years ago. The foreign NBA pipeline just wasn’t there.

gawd damn bol with all that ice just to play in garbage time for the third straight year
Bruh I swear if I was walkin my dog in the woods or somethin and saw Bol Bol jogging I'd swear I saw some sort of Slenderman or some shit wtf
"Now give Bol Bol more play time, hes the next unicorn"
He also said Manute Bol would've been great at getting things off high shelves.
"Not even just the core locked up but we've also locked up our primary bench pieces (Monte Morris and PJ Dozier), we've got control of the majority of our future draft picks, and we still have intriguing young talent like Bol Bol and, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji.  Tim Connolly still has all the firepower to swing for a huge trade without even having to touch one of Murray, Jokic, or MPJ."
You're good. Save your bol jersey for when we trade him for Giannis
dang I'm getting targeted in this comment. Lemme know if my take is bullshit tho because I got a Bol jersey sitting in my closet that I will try and get rid of while I can still make some money off it.
Invincible Bol Bol.
I'm not sure if this is really a homer take because I think its usually from fans of other teams but some people think bol bol will be a superstar if he got more playing time.
&gt; Another fun fact about Bol; he blocked 10.8% of his opponent's shots while he was on the floor in his career; nobody else tops 8%.  I believe he is also the only player (over some minimum to discount somebody who played in like 4 games in their whole career for 15 total minutes and had 2 points and 3 blocks) to retire with more blocked shots than points.
"&gt; OK Manute Bol is a great story and I have tons of respect for him… but did fitness programs not exist back then? Couldn’t he have easily just worked out and put on 20 pounds? I never watched him play, but that probably would have improved his career, wouldn’t it?  Adding weight is hard for athletes. He played drunk what more to you want from him. Do you want him to endanger himself with the goal to add weight for his career?"
Um BOL BOL. Mic dropped lol
"(Sga)MCW, (dort)marcus smart, (giddey)joe ingles, (bazley)lamar odom, (poku)bol bol....  Hmmm????? Lol"
"There's just no way that's Bol was 200.  [This is what 6'9, 215 looks like](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTGGRj6cbOyd9U628GrM1ZnwAxn_Hq2hnGMa_MiCioNLHEETC_-jrEFWdyZkLkmTdLhVm0&amp;usqp=CAU).  You're telling me that Bol was 10 inches taller and 15 pounds lighter?  Let me say that again:  #10 inches taller."
"OK Manute Bol is a great story and I have tons of respect for him… but did fitness programs not exist back then? Couldn’t he have easily just worked out and put on 20 pounds? I never watched him play, but that probably would have improved his career, wouldn’t it?"
Manute Bol was ridiculously thin.
"I’m optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
"Seriously. Unless his skeleton was made of balsa wood, Bol weighed at least **220**."
Member that time Manute Bol killed a lion?
"Bro bol bol has more potential than tht, he's pretty irrelevant to the Lakers season and likely will stay that way."
"Bol Bol with Ben Simmon’s perceived work ethic, would probably not last in the NBA. IT managed to stay in the league for a decent amount of time, he even averaged almost 30 ppg one season. IT with Kobe’s work ethic is undoubtedly a better player than Ben in Bol’s body."
Bol Bol
Bol bol is literal highligh culture at its peak he can't be played at the 5 or 4 or 3 unless it's garbage time and when it's garbage time he is barely good. He always looks disinterested and Hurst the team more than anything. His numbers in the summer league look good on paper but honestly his play was bad and his defense even worse. Once we played him in the preseason it's the same shit. If anyone want bol bol he wouldn't be on a one year contract with us. You think the coach that made mpj earn his starting spot wouldn't play bol bol if he deserved it. There's no interest on him while we keep expecting him to develop into anything
"This Dinka thing is bullshit and definitely comes down to diet. Very very few people are *actually* incapable of putting on weight, and since Bol seems to be a healthy (but tall) human he should be no exception.   Calories in, calories out. It’s basically a law of physics with how true it is. Obviously if you’re 7’2 it’s gonna be a LOT of calories but cmon this guy is a paid professional athlete. Gaining is literally his job."
You’re right. 1. Bol 2. Markkanen 3. Mobley 4. Allen 5. Fall. That’s your starting five.
Marvin Bagley for Bol Bol
DETROIT BASKET-BOL
"Unpopular opinion, but I don't think Bol Bol is going to make it in the league as a regular rotational player. He has nice highlights but he's not good enough at what he does for an NBA franchise to put the ball in his hands consistently over other starter-quality NBA players. College players who lead the nation in assists or scoring regularly fail to make it in the league, people under estimate how elite you have to be to even be a guy like Jalen Brunson who is a quality back up guard. Just on the Nuggets, are you going to take the ball out of Jokic, MPJ, and Murray's hands to have Bol Bol try to break down his man on the perimeter?"
KZ Okpala for Bol Bol? Nuggets need some defense and Okpala can do that
"I'm not saying Bol Bol is Hakeem. But he's in his 3rd season now and has 250 total minutes played.   I just don't see a way that he's completely unplayable, it's not really about his stats."
"Feels like he's falling for the curse of wanting to be an offensive centerpiece instead of figuring out how to be an effective role player and expanding from there. Thon Maker's not even in the NBA now and Bol Bol's had even less success - wouldn't be surprised if he follows the same path.   The one thing I'd say in his defense is that MPJ is living proof of that blueprint working, and it's more glamorous."
"The point is Beasley was completely out of their rotation. It is very obvious that at the very least, he is good enough to be high in a playoff teamz rotation if not the starter.    So saying Bol being out of their rotation means he is a bad player isn't a good argument"
"Problem is his offensive game is just too one dimensional. His inside game leaves so much to be desired and could get shut down easily by decent centers or 4s even. His shot is clean but not good enough for that to be his entire game and get good minutes. Another problem with that is when we do give him minutes, the dude is an instant chucker. He plays catch-and-shoot or just straight ISO. Slows down our offense and shows he’s not bought into the offensive philosophy. Something I’d imagine would endear him to get more minutes. Both those other centers you named are great offensively but also contribute where they can in other ways on offense.  To your other point, I would GUARANTEE you if Bol Bol went to like the Rockets or Pistons or something he’d have better stats. Just like all the guys you named, because those are bad teams just throwing shit out to see what works. Jerami Grant balling out did fuck all for the Pistons and on a team where he’s the 3rd option, his numbers won’t be that. It’s what happened with Arron Afflalo back in the day. Decent with us as a 3rd option, near all-star on a bottom barrel team. Hell RJ Hampton did the same last year after going to the Magic. Doesn’t mean his issues aren’t still there and he won’t last long in the league if he doesn’t improve them."
Wow looking him and Bol Bols story up now
"Manute Bol was 7""7"
"no, Boban is legit NBA player and he was the best center in Europe before coming to NBA. And he is really trying. Bol Bol doesn't care."
"People act like Bol Bol is some sort of godlike basketball player that gets stuck on the bench for no reason. The reality is, he's a meme and he's not an NBA level player. He's 7'2, sure. But he's skinny as a rake and slow as fuck, he can't play 5 against real bigs and as a 4 he's even worse."
I watched Bol Bol play 1 game in college and from that alone thought he was talented enough to be the #1 pick. Was stunned he fell to the second round. Is he really that unviable of a player? How could his floor not just be a 3 + rebounding guy? I honestly don't get it.
"For sure but DEN was trash when y'all got Jokic, and wasn't a playoff team the first two years of Beasley's career.  Y'all are a legit contender now and can't afford to sacrifice Ws to develop Bol Bol.  I'm not criticizing DEN at all.  +/- doesn't mean a whole lot in such a small sample size.  DEN lost every game and as far as I can tell pretty much every player on DEN had a negative +/-.  I mean damn he averaged 2.3 bpg in 27 mpg.  That's not everything defensively but it's something."
Bol Bol sucks tho
"All 4 of those players are strong and can push people around with their weight, and can defend in the post. None of things Bol can do. Mans is a twig.  Also the Grant take is terrible. He wanted to be a number 1 and left. Its not like they didn't offer him a contract."
"I think they meant with all his hype the fact he went 44th said a lot about what coaches thought his future was  Yeah draft postion alone isn't definitive at all, but it definitely can be used as a big red flag when a guy with as high of a theoretical ceiling as Bol Bol did coming into the draft drops that low. Definitely says a lot about how much his potential issues could hold him back in the future and it looks like FOs were right so far"
"I just don't agree. And I've watched him a ton.   I don't see how he's any worse than guys like Boban or Kanter who are basically 1 dimensional players. Even Okafor played last year. Hell, Marcus Morris is playing Center on a contender.   I dont see how Bol is any more unplayable than these guys. Maybe he isn't locking down the paint ir whatever but his floor spacing and size are both valuable. I think he can get minutes.   Also, I disagree with your comments about the Nuggets. They are a good team but that doesn't mean they get the best out of all of their players. Malik Beasley was out of their rotation than then average 20 as soon as he was traded. Jerami Grant also was obviously much better than they thought he was."
"We’re the same team that developed Jokic from a later pick than Bol, same with Malik Beasley, and got low rotation players like Will Barton to play starter caliber basketball. We give players chances to prove themselves if they actually show it, whether that’s in practice, summer league, 5 minutes of play, etc. When Bol plays there’s nothing to indicate he’s improving or that he’s changed the habits that are preventing him from playing which is why we don’t give him more opportunities.  Dude had an alright summer league from a scoring perspective but was bottom of the team in +\- and was mediocre on defense the whole time."
"The Reddit nephews are out strong in this thread.   Bol Bol is a meme. That’s it. He’s slenderman who can shoot, and has almost no other positive qualities to his play. He’s too slow to play anything but the 5, and too weak to even play that effectively. He’s a complete defensive liability based on his effort alone.   Trading him isn’t a terrible idea because who knows if he’d find some kind of motivation with some new scenery? Better than stashing him on the bench because he will genuinely never do anything worthwhile for the Nuggets."
"no, because boban is at least an unbelievably efficient offensive player.   Bol Bol is a black hole shot chucker.   he hasn't looked remotely like an NBA player in his limited time on the court"
Oh sweet Bol... They're desperate to move you but no takers my man.
"He demonstrated that he was listening to coaching during the preseason. The way he positioned himself off ball changed/improved a lot. However, it has been hard to develop him. He hasn’t been easy to slide into the post lineup, because the team works backwards from Jokić, and in the second unit NJ is in love with JaMychal Green.  I’m a Nuggets fan who has held out hope for Bol. I’d be fine with the team making a mid season trade if that seems like a good option and teams are willing to take a flyer on him. But first we need to see Murray back from injury to identify what the team would need back in a trade. Being on ice for another half a season must really frustrate the young man, but managing his emotions is part of his job."
He is a unique talent and he definitely deserves to go to a team where he can get minutes. Go to a team that needs a big like the Nets or the Mavs. Imagine KP at the 4 and Bol Bol at the 5 😅
Nah have Bol run point and have Tacko in the lineup too
"The thing with a player like Bol is that he's boom or bust. He's either gonna be borderline game-breaking or just unplayable. I'm not sure there's too much of a middle ground for him, so oddly enough I think good backup is one of the least likely scenarios for him"
There’s many guys on rebuilding teams that would have the same role Bol has in Denver right now if they played for Denver
After Joker got MURDERED that game in the first 3 seconds  MOACH  shoulda sent in Gordon MPJ and BOL BOL and tell them to just dunk all game.
I don't know why but Bamba and Bol would be fun
People see a giant dribble and hit some 3's against bench guys and think it means he should be part of an NBA rotation.  Bol Bol is the type of player that could score 70 in the Chinese league but he just doesn't have the right body to be a contributing NBA player.
"Problem there is you’re not matching size, you’re matching height and yeah there’s a difference. Gobert is a down low center so his offensive game is built to bully guys who give up size like Bol. Team that with Bol being a lot easier to catch out of position (the dude’s basketball IQ is low) and he’ll get scrubbed against the Jazz. Then offensively it would have been worse.  Nuggets fans want Bol to be good but the dude has not shown improvement and seems to just be negative attitude wise because we don’t recognize his greatness"
"Bol Bol has the body of a center, plays like a guard"
I wonder if Bol is simply just never going to leave the raw talent stage.  His size and skill carried him partly through college but then his injury fucked him up.  He declared for the draft and people were super hesitant for a reason.  My guess is that he's a very 'me-first' player with super star ambitions but lacks the basketball acumen to get himself there.  He's also probably not listening to good advice.
ITT: People who don’t actually watch Bol and don’t know how bad he is on defense and how much slows down the offense.
"I know he’s not the best but just to match the size I’d put him in instead of a 6’8 forward  they were doubling a lot, if they’re doubling I’d rather have like Jeff Green and Bol Bol than both Greens  Bol my guy so definite bias. This is why I’m not a coach lol"
Kai Jones is raw and will only see g league action for like a year or two. He has severe tunnel vision and doesn’t understand defensive positioning yet. The current backup bigs are pj and nick Richards. Bol bol can easily take Richards minutes.
"People are really underestimating how bad Bol is on defense because he’s gotten a few good blocks against deep bench guys. Against another center or anyone with even decent post ability, he gets smoked."
Every single time he's gotten actual rotation minutes he's been awful. If he truly was so valuable he would have balled out in the preseason/summer league when we played him 30+ minutes for a handful of games. He had one really good game and a bunch of eggs. Bol Bol is not a rotation player. He's a meme
bol bol for dragic who says no :)
"Yes, he is that bad. He's had a fandom behind him purely for memes since he got drafted, but as it stands right now he's an offensive black hole and a defensive turnstile. Green/green are absolutely unironically better options than him at center and anyone arguing otherwise hasn't watched Bol"
"Charlotte already has better bigs... Kai Jones is a better C than Bol Bol, If you are being absurd and wanted to play him there"
"Unironically the 2 greens were our best options. Bol is absolute trash defensively. He's got length sure but he's built like a fencepost he gets bullied by everyone  Just saw that you're also a nuggets fan, you should know this lol"
Pj tucker would get more contested shot than bol bol
"Just get Simmons, Poku, Bol Bol, and draft Holmgren for team tall-ball, run FVV at the 2 to throw everyone off"
"Bol Bol would be a low risk, potentially high reward signing, he just needs some playing time and I believe he wouldn't cost a lot"
"ITT: People who don't understand that Bol Bol is 7'2"" but can't play the 5."
Bol Bol is a forward... he isn't a Center.
"I mean either BOL BOL sucks and we lose, which we want, or he’s good and he have another tall person who can pass. Imagine him n poku running a pick n roll, nba meme dreams"
Bol Bol and Poku on the same team? Hell yeah
"thinking more defensively  Rudy a DPOY, Bol would get smoked   But a 7’2 guy with long arms is better than a 6’8 guy"
if we could get bol bol and bridges omg i’d be so happy
What's Bol Bol going to do against Rudy...
Bol Bol cant do anything to centers.
"Their tallest player last night was 6’8 against Rudy Gobert  and to my knowledge they had Bol on the bench   absolutely ridiculous, they need to trade him bc he’s just sitting there he plays like 20 minutes a season"
Yupp it would be fun playstyle to watch even though everyone knows they will suck this year. No pressure for bol bol to immediately be a impact player.
"Exactly and if it doesn't work out it won't set those teams back, low risk with a really high potential reward   Imagine OKC running lineups with Bol Bol and Poku handling the ball"
"I truly believe Bones will be that spark. Also having Monte start is tough, as he'd be getting most of Facus mins. Maybe a Bol &amp; Zeke trade for someone later on in the year?"
The Nuggets could lose everyone except their backcourt and Bol Bol but Malone would still find a reason not to play him. 😒
Kelly Oubre would be nice on the Warriors  Bol Bol would actually play basketball
Put bol bol in
"Bol Bol, easily"
"“Bol Bol’s best case scenario is becoming Mobley”  Bol is weirdly fluid for his size, even more so than Mobley. He’s a weirdly impressive dribbler for his height, again, better than Mobley.   That being said, he’s too big. He’s slow, and kind of stupid. Mobley is more of a super modern big because he’s switchable and versatile. Bol has a super unique skill set that really isn’t practical. The best case scenario for Bol would’ve been like a bizzaro small forward, while Mobley is more AD like"
On Bol Bol or Mobley?
"Bol Bol couldn’t set a screen when he came to the NBA, like scouts wouldn’t be able to see that on film. That seems to be one of his issues"
I think Mobely has a bigger frame with potential to add weight. Bol Bol looks like hes dying of starvation
He’s Bol Bol with Basketball IQ.
Man imagine having bol bol with Kevin Durant's skill. It would be incredible to watch
Bol Bol
"Mobley reminds me of Bol Bol if he reaches his potential, Mobley’s basically a cracked out Bol Bol"
UNLEASH TACKO FALL AND BOL BOL
I feel like this will be Bol Bol in a couple of years
this looks like bol bol mixed with travis scott except they’re homeless and looking for some h
bol bol has great handles for someone that tall
BOL BOL!
7' with a jumper. How do you think Bol Bol is still employed?
"That 91 team won 44 games but they traded GMinski mid season for Armin Gilliam who was a better player at the time and they were really good in the 2nd half of the season. Heck they swept the Bucks in the 1st round and like i said before there were only 2 teams that won a game against the 91 Bulls in the playoffs and the 76ers were one of them (the other was the Lakers). Scrubs? I don't think so. That team was good and if it wasnt for the Bulls they could've beaten that 91 pistons team. Of course Portland would've beat them in the finals.  In 92 they went 35-47 after Barkley mentally checked out that whole season. He even tells the story of how he pushed all the 92 season for a trade and was traded to the Lakers for Worthy and he went out that night and celebrated and got drunk only to find out the trade didn't go through and he had to play that night. You telling me thats how professionals act during the season. That whole 92 season he was only playing half speed like Carter in his last year in Toronto or Howard in his last year with the Magic.   5 players on that scrub team averaged double digit scoring to go along with Barkley's 23 points per game. Hawkins put up 19 a game while Gilliam put up 17 and 9 numbers, Dawkins put up 13pts and 7assists. SHackleford was good of the bench and Bol was averaging 3 blocks off the bench as well.  I know hindsight is 20/20 but none of Sir Charles teams were putting up 15 wins, they were not awful like people seem to remember. He had good teams that consistently made it to the 2nd round, if it wasn't for Jordan he might've even made it to the finals with the 76ers."
"Calling Davion Mitchell ""sound"" defensively so far is like calling Manute Bol ""tall"" or Ben Simmons ""a bitch"""
"Because DEN is on the first game of a B2B, if they have a large lead in the 4th they will play Bones and Bol etc. and rest the A squad to prep for the Jazz tomorrow.  CLE to cover the spread is a good bet IMO."
"It’s Manute Bol, Bol Bol’s dad, RIP."
Bol Bol
"Because the Nuggets are not in need of prospects currently out of their G-League team.     They will have Howard/Bol Bol and maybe Zeke Nnaji all playing some time there and they need to surround them with capable players who can simulate an NBA environment since currently those guys all struggle to adapt to in-game situations and pressure.     We also don't need them taking every shot, they need to be able to be able to play alongside other quality NBA level players and so for us having veterans is a great thing.  We aren't looking for guys to break into the rotation this year, or long developmental projects necessarily just a good functional/nba-like environment for our (brand new) G-league squad so the guys we are trying to develop can get good reps."
"Bol Bol was much improved this preseason.  He knew the plays and the defense.  Bol Bols forte is the fast break and poppin 3's believe it or not.  I think he's awesome, but still young in the game."
Manute Bol with the body type of Zion
Yeah Bol is not good. I don’t blame Malone for that one.
Facu has more blocks than Bol this year
Malone would sooner play Jerry West than a rookie. Unbelievable how dedicated he is to earning playing time just by being around (unless you’re Bol Bol).
My money is on Bol Bol as the person *michael* is talking about here.
Jol the Bol Embiid
More like bol vlako and future 1st for Simmons haha
Giving one bol bol here. He can make ALL the difference
The issue with Bol Bol
So is this going to be another year of talking about how scary Bol Bol is going to be and not actually playing him?
Why dont they ever play bol bol? He always seems to show out during preseason games.
Malone doesn't seem to trust Rookies very much. Look at Bol Bol. I thik Bones could really help to.
"He in the process of being adopted by the Ball family, changing his name to Bol Ball"
I also don’t think you do if you watched the preseason Bol was undeniably an elite rim protector throughout the preseason
"I dont think you do, either, if you think that's what Bol was giving this preseason."
"Michael Malone will never get any credit, and I question his in game decisions sometimes, but he empowers any player to come off the bench and play well at any point it seems like (other than bol bol)"
"You can have Bol Bol, he'll fit in perfectly."
"what does Bol Bol even do. he doesn't play in the g-league, he doesn't play in the NBA.  like bro.."
Wdym my man Bol Bol Will totally kill it now that that scrub Jokic is out
I don’t know who that is.  Is it Bol Bol?
Kyrie and Bol Bol
Holy fuck I didn't realize how skinny Holmgren was. He makes KD and Manute Bol look like body builders
Part of me hopes Bol Bol gets some minutes just so people can see how bad he is and stop asking why he doesn’t get minutes lol
"Ahhh...the Shawn Bradley/Manute Bol factor. There were certainly shorter players who blocked more shots per game, but how many shots did those two prevent just by standing there with their arms up?"
Just have Bol Bol poke him in the eye from 30 ft away.
That is fair. I’ve only seen Bol pass once on a drive and that was it.
Then you gotta let Bol Bol in the conversation
"I mean, do you watch the nuggets? Vlatko hasn’t played this year and Zeke has played 11 minutes total, all garbage time. They aren’t the reason Bol isn’t playing. We obviously can’t see what happens during practice, but in the few minutes Bol has played this year, he has been bad. He plays like he thinks he’s a SG, but he has a wild out of control dribble, and he doesn’t play team ball in the garbage time minutes he gets, he just looks for his own shot. I actually think he has defensive upside, but it’s pretty clear watching him play that he doesn’t care about team ball, and just wants to get his shots up."
Bol bol
"I think zeke has better potential with the team because hes more of an anchor. Probably won’t be a star but I could definitely see him as a good bench player. Vlatko and bol I see as interchangeable. If I was Denver I would trade bol while he still has value. Denver needs a backup center for sure, because I can’t see Vlatko or bol holding it down while jok is off the court"
"you’re absolutely right, mobley/bol/markannen/allen/tacko"
"What’s your point? I watch the Nuggets all the time. Their bench is horrible. Nnaji and Cancar do nothing. Bol Bol will make mistakes for sure, but so will those guys and, at least, Bol Bol brings energy and brings the crowd into a frenzy. He actually does have talent even if he may not look like it. Certainly more than Caleb, KZ, Zeke or Vlatko. Not sure why you are spouting off about things you don’t know about."
J.R Smith was a good player. Bol isn't like him at all
mobley/bol/love/markannen/allen lineup just for fun
Sam Hauser  Bol Bol  Saben Lee  Usman Garuba  Yves Pons  Paul Reed  Jalen Smith  Joe Wieskamp (should not be on a two-way)  Malachi Flynn
"I really don’t see much potential from bol. He’s too skinny for his position. It also seems like she scared to play at the rim. Although he is a fun player to watch, he’s too much of a liability on defense. And at this point I’m pretty sure he want to be traded"
"This is the number one choice. Love the Nuggets, but not sure why this guy can’t get playing time even when half the time is injured. They bring in Zeke Nnaji over Bol Bol? Wth?"
Bol Bol
Probably gonna get some Bol Bowl time as well
Bol Bol minutes or riot
Bol Bol gets to feast. Lord knows the slender boy could use it.
I literally bought tickets for tomorrow like 5 minutes before the incident. Bol Bol coming out party here we come
Bol bol… you’re 6’11 and weigh 90 pounds. Gumby has a better body than you. BOOM roasted!
"Bol so long though, I wouldn’t want him to slap me over my face"
"He is a very good defensive coach and elite at culture building. Solid at adjustments... he is slow to make them but usually makes the right one   Very good at player development unless it's a more eccentric, less traditional cat... in which case he is less successful (see Bol, Zeke, Beasley and arguably MPJ).  Bottom 10 offensive coach which is annoying as fuck but doesn't matter as much when both Jokic and Murray are healthy.  So yea, just say you have an irrational hate boner."
We gonna get some bol bol un a blowout baby
Is that Bol Bols music?
Malone is about to release the Bol league fucked
Will Bol Bol get to finally play meaningful minutes?
Bol bol going for 70
Bol bol
lol it was funny seeing Bol entering the game to shoot free throws for Nikola lol he missed both of them
I'm ready to lose the next two games maybe we see bol bol considering it's likely four quarters of garbage time
Just tell Bol Bol reach his long ass arms up into morris' hotel room while he's sleeping and punch him in the face then
"I am glad you asked! [Vlatko](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/videos/_/id/4230557/vlatko-cancar) doesn’t get many minutes, but he is second behind Bol Bol in my heart."
"Zeke, Bol will get minutes"
Y’all need Bol Bol to go all gangly armed on anyone that tests Jokic
&gt;Don't forget Bol Bol
"if you flagrant foul a 3 point shooter, do they still only get 2 free throws + the ball? Jokic saw the foul coming and was well into his shooting stroke when Morris hit him. Bol only took 2 free throws after replacing Jokic.   Aside, that was a nasty foul by Morris. The check is obviously dirty, but since Jokic sees him coming and starts his shot, Morris ends up banging his knee into the side of Jokic's planted right knee. go frame by frame thru the first angle on the altitude broadcast clip linked by u/hyperadhd, his knee bends in a very painful looking manner. I have a feeling Joker felt a twinge and thats what made him see red.   ""Are they really about to foul me at half court? Fuck it I'll try and get 3 free throws out of this. **sharp pain in knee** FUCK this guy."" -&gt; violent reaction"
Is that Bol Bol?
Bol Arena
"Yea Butler loves his Europeans but now they're probably not gonna get along, sadly. Spo knew what he was doing choosing Bol for those FT lmao."
"nah bro he's got the best interests of the team bro he's tryna get malone to develop bol bol now that mpj, murray and him are missing games"
He had it comin 😎 just wish bol bol delivered the hammer instead
I see this as a win-win: More Bol Bol in coming games. We get to see what Jokic would look like as an NFL linebacker. Morris gets some of his own medicine.
"I came here to have a good time, not watch WWE. Shame cos butler n jokic seemed to be friendly with each other, but thats never gonna happen from now. Jimmy aint a guy to forget stuff like this. n bol bol just missed both tech FTs lmao."
Bol bol mvp
Bol Bol wants out of there
Wtf is that body language bol bol
Bol bol sucks
Bol Bol LMFAO   more like MISS MISS
BOL BOL
BOL BOL IS IN
"Bringing on Bol Bol to unite the people, good call."
BOL BOL
BOL BOL
Look heat fans can we just call this a game so no one gets injured and try to get /r/nba some bol bol highlights?
Bol bol
Was hoping we get a hot pool pic like manute bol
oh man bol bol is destined to play for this team
"Agree with the First two   Everyone's like ""Get Bol Bol out of Nuggets,Free him"".....well.... Take him then"
"Bol Bol, Taco, Rubio, Nance Jr."
I used to have a manute bol warriors growth chart poster whem i was a kid.  So im going for bol bol on this
Tim Hardaway Jr. and Bol Bol for the Warrior connections.
Shades of Bol Bol
"Man, we NEED Bol Bol"
Current he is 7th in the league behind:  Bol Bol  Tacko Fall  Carson Edwards  Dwight Howard  Thad Young  Ben Simmons
Manute bol bc he's the nicest nba player maybe he'd let me win
let bol bol smoke on the court
Probably has the case to be literally his biggest fan  Unless Bol Bol is closet Styler
I would say 2nd round pick is enough for Bol Bol
KAT for Bol^2 straight up.  Who says no?
And Bol Bol was caught liking a tweet to trade him out of Denver. Are these guys doing this on purpose lmao?
"Its literally impossible for them to do ""the exact same thing"".  Not sure what you dont understand about that, this isn't a video game.  And The ref cant know exactly how much force each player is exerting.   Under the rulebook im guessing both should be fouls, but if the refs called a foul every time someones elbow came out a little bit thered probably be fouls on almost every play.   So again, its a subjectively refereed game where the ref has to decide if enough excess force was used.  If Shaq and Manute Bol both put their arm in the same position, but Shaq is able to generate enough force with his full body to send his defender flying into the stands, and when manute does it he generates almost no force and maybe even he gets forced back by the defender.   If you really think those 2 are going to be called the same because its a ""player making the same move"" you're lying to yourself."
Trade for Bol Bol you wussies
Manute Bol
Christ i remember that one 2K where they released Bol Bol PG cards
"NBA2K and their obsession with Bol Bol, Galaxy Opals and all"
"manute bol and shaq ""making the same move"" is literally impossible.    the point is that 'rule' is impossible for humans to judge, and would only work in like a video game setting where you know the exact perimeters of the interactions.  If Lonzo and LeBron do whats apparently close to same thing with their arm but Lebrons defender goes non-flop flying and Lonzos defender doesn't even get effected at all, that clearly should and will be more often a called foul on LeBron than it should Lonzo, taking superstar calls out of the equation."
"Yes, specifically for one very talented and very tall and long fella who goes by the name of Bol Bol. I think he'd be an amazing player to rebuild the franchise around."
I don't think Bol Bol is European
"I thought your list was pretty good, personally I would put Tacko or Bol Bol on there too, but I respect your opinions"
How about Bol Bol for Ben Simmons?
Trade for Bol Bol to be the sixth man.
bol bol vs his pops manny bol
I like how you had “blank” starting over bol bol lmao
Injuries took a toll on him. He was once elite. With that said free Bol Bol. Play him.
dont get why Bol gets no runs smh
He looks like he's on the diet Bol Bol should be on
We've got Bol Bol available for anyone who can score off the bench.
"Would pick perfectly behind Jokic.  Trade Bol, sign Boogie"
Bol Bol just has horrible court vision and sucks on defense. Bol Bol with better IQ and positioning is a star.
"It'll be like that manute bol and muggsey bouges picture, but the opposite."
Bol Bol is already doing that himself so the mods don't need to
They won't have to do that for Bol Bol since nobody posts about him
Bol still won’t get minutes.
Bol Bol has been spiking the gatorade with cobra poison.
Don't be callin' Bol Bol a McNugget now.
"bol bol is bad, playing time or not."
I know someone close to the situation. Bol Bol shot a three so clean it opened a portal to another dimension and the nuggets are benching him for the safety of all humanity
Lmao comparing Bol Bol to fucking Chet Holmgren is such a wtf take
We're playing people who are borderline NBA players out of necessity. And Bol still hasn't earned real minutes despite that
"Go over to some college basketball subreddit if you want to jerk off about your coach K hate.  Those players are there for 1 year, it's nothing he's doing. They're responsible for what they do after getting drafted.  Let's go through your brilliant thesis anyway:  Parker: injuries - can't blame that on Duke  Zion: fat - can't blame that on Duke  Okafor: didn't fit the modern game - can't blame on Duke  Bagley: drafted by the Kings - can't blame that on Duke  Allen: was never that good of a prospect  Sheldon Williams: bro you're reaching further than Manute and Bol Bol combined here.  Tatum: he's developed fine, go fight some Celtics fans if you think otherwise"
Bol Bol is a Greg Brown III fan. He wanted him to have his moment.
"Being an eastbay doesn't automatically mean it's a top dunk.  Plenty of players are capable of throwing down eastbays, they just don't because they're in competitive games or don't do it in garbage time because you're either way ahead (sportsmanship) or way behind (embarassing).  Players do them all the time in the layup line.  Being in a 2 man club with Ricky Davis speaks to the mentality of anyone doing it. [Bol Bol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQC1MGXm5ZA) would also like to join.  This one in particular is not that nice - Brown's lower leg is straight with foot near the ground, and his arm when he dunks he's basically straight from hand to foot which means it's not a powerful flush (note how softly the ball falls out of the rim) and the dunk comes from arm length not bounce.  It's missing finesse, hangtime, aesthetic and other elements.  Most guys default to throwing down big tomahawks which is more simple but one of the more powerful dunks.  Then there are tons of incredible dunks finished vs over/around shotblockers or through contract, using double clutches, tweaking, pump fakes &amp; reverses on other side, etc.  There are tons of better difficult open court dunks during live play that actually look like dunk contest worthy dunks.  Dr J's rock the baby, MJ cradle dunks, VC's reverse statue of liberty 360.  Lots of stuff every year is better than this, current guys like Morant, Bridges, Jones Jr do better dunks commonly than sloppy eastbays"
We have a gently used Bol Bol available.
I think he is a skinnier Evan mobility or maybe a playable Bol Bol with a passing game
"Yeah dude. I’m surprised nobody is pointing it out in this thread. Bol Bol wonders why he doesn’t get minutes, Bol Bol provides the answer."
"Well, few more dudes going down and we are about to see Joker pull Nuggets to 4th seed with  Bol and bunch of g league dudes  Wait, are Nuggets about to bring Lance back haha"
He was mad Bol went behind the back for a pass in garbage time when the dude who shot it just missed and then just verbal diarrhea’d about how people are always watching through this amazing dunk haha
Bol bol like bro stfu I hate it here bitch I wanna play! 😂
Are they gonna cut their losses on Bol Bol being a capable Jokic backup?
"He didn't miss a beat, just zero acknowledgement of the dunk lol.  At first I thought OP had messed up the recording and overdubbed commentary from a different game, then SVG mentioned Bol Bol."
"Bol Bol is the epitome of “I’m only playing basketball because I am this tall”. He literally stopped running back on defense and gave up a between the legs dunk and could have easily stopped him from even considering it. If you only play garbage time you should be busting your ass, but he is pulling a Gilbert Arenas and doing the opposite"
Bol Bol with playing time
That is why Bol Bol is not getting his minutes. Slowing down on D when he can still challenge the dunk.
I love that Stan van Gundy was in the midst of a minute long rant about Bol Bol throwing a behind the back pass during a 20 minute blowout game and barely even reacted to this insane dunk.
Someone tell SVG there are 9 other guys on the floor besides Bol Bol.
Why bol bol so lazy
SVG at the end of the game being so critical of a decent behind the back pass from Bol Bol was so weird.  It was 50 seconds left in the end of a blowout…and then didn’t even get hype for the dunk after.
I really don't understand the refusal to play Bol Bol. Why not give your young high potential players minutes so that they can develop and increase your roster depth. What is the point of having him?!!!
A rich man's Bol Bol?
The only reason Bol Bol doesn’t play is he would break the game of basketball as we know it.  Shooting 70% from 3 with 12 blocks a game and shit
"Send Jokic to Serbia where he’s safe. Load manage AG and Barton. Play Bol 40 minutes a game. Tank for a pick. When Murray, MPJ, and Dozier are healthy run it back next season."
"The Bol Bol fans are gonna get their wish, we're gonna run out of players soon"
"You know what, I blame this on the free Bol Bol people. At this rate we're gonna have to actually play him lmao"
"I swear when I’m watching a game and look away, I’ll hear he had some kind of highlight, but when I’m actually paying attention, he’s looking like a new born door. If there as a bol-ish, slender man tweener on every team, he’d probably play more, but until then, I just do no see who or what he is supposed to consistently guard"
'no one wants Bol Bol' is a crazy take.
"You dont think they want to trade him? No organisations want Bol Bol, simple as that."
Bol Bol is universally loved.
"This is a peice of shit take but I hope Bol Bol goes somewhere and sucks. So tired of people sayin free Bol Bol, we've homegrown a lot of talent in the league, if you think the nuggets are not aware of what they have then you're just kinda stupid"
"I think it's a combination of Murray looks like he's sitting on something and that Bol Bol has the torso of a 6' guy, with the arms and legs of a 8' guy."
Yep Bol Bol has the same strengths (and is even a better shooter) and he is a total bust
Bol Bol looking like Squidward dealing with Spongebobs shit
Bol bol face gas my dying omg
"Bad post, and forcing race into every frame gets old.  Zero evidence of this, and it's sad that you've gotten a few of votes for this comment.  If you don't understand why Poku is fascinating (not to be confused with good), I don't know what to tell you.   Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence. You have offered none.  &gt;Bol Bol being memed doesn't negate the fact that r/NBA as a whole on average is infatuated with white players."
"Bol Bol:  https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/c\_fill,g\_center,w\_1200/fl\_lossy,pg\_1,q\_auto/ifwt\_Terio-vine-2\_rsgrqq.jpg"
"Come on Nugs, just fire Bol Bol, he's clearly in pain sitting there."
bol bol like wtf you talking about bruh look
Bol bol wanna die 😂
Bol bol looks so done with his shit
"Damn, free Bol Bol already."
"I hate Bol Bol. He’s a shit player. He’s an irresponsible, disrespectful, entitled shit. If you FORGET your jersey you shouldn’t get to play. If you spend 90% of your time on the bench, you shouldn’t be regarded so highly. I hate Bol Bol. As a nuggets fan I DO NOT understand the hype. In my mind he is the most over rated play of all time. I wish the nuggets would release him from his contract and let him fall through the cracks. He’s a wasted space. Trying to trade him and get the money back is not worth it and I just want him gone."
"if you really think lebron is that big, then you should have been around to see some players in the 90's like Shaq or Manute Bol, they TRULY towered everyone."
"Jodie: Boy that popcorn smells g-  JVG: You know Jodie, they should get rid of the five man restriction. There should be a height cap the same way there's a salary cap. But that cuts both ways. If you want to put Manute Bol and twelve dwarves on the court at the same time that should be allowed."
But bOl BoL is A uNicOrN
"Bol bol, and there is no other player even close."
Bol Bol
"Realistically though, I feel like that kid is destined to be the next Bol Bol"
Just start Bol Bol you cowards
"I mean Zach Lowe said the same thing on his podcast and he’s one of the most objective NBA analysts out there. Whether you agree or not, he’s still a really good player. And that, along with the other things I mentioned, is why he’s popular. Not because he’s white.  We can go down the list of players that have mass followings (Caruso, Jokic, Luka, Herro, SGA, Jordan Poole, Bol Bol, Tacko Fall, Ingles, Lonzo, Dort, Poku etc) and talk about why they’re so popular. It has nothing to do with being black or white. Each player has legitimate reasons that people love them that have nothing to do with race. Only the truly ignorant would ignore the context of each player and belittle the reasons they are fan favorites by boiling it down to the color of their skin"
"He also has Bol and Cornelie, who might have been helpful against a team fielding 2 dudes who are 7'1? Especially because this was always going to be a blowout."
look at any nuggets instagram post and every comment will either be in Spanish about Facu or about Bol
"Why is bol bol a strawman for the Poku example? They both had hype less because of skills, but because they both have extremely unique body types. They're both oddities in a league filled with 7+ footers. Caruso is an example I see in this thread being brought up, but he was more memed because of his looks. Donte Divincenzo is basically the same type of player as caruso with a fraction of the love or notoriety on here.  Is someone like Sabonis, who is an all star, really ever brought up on here? Vucevic as well. I feel most guys are brought up an adequate amount for their skill level. Do white stars like Luka, Jokic, Herro etc. get a little more love? I can see that. ""Infatuated"" is pretty hyperbolic IMO."
Bol Bol only weighs 220. Throw his little ass up to the moon.
"Suns just want to see some bol bol minutes, you can’t blame them"
You got it mane. They are white. the only reason they get hype.   Bol Bol got hype cause he was white too.
"Bol Bol got similar (actually more) attention, despite lower production in the nba. His highlights were getting 10,000+ votes"
"Here’s a Bol Bol highlight with 13,000+ upvotes.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw0nf4/highlight_bol_bol_gets_the_block_leads_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  There are multiple other Bol Bol posts above 10,000+ upvotes despite being a borderline G league player. He definitely had massive r/nba acclaim"
"Nothing that you said disputes any of the points I made. Poku is a unicorn prospect, and Bol and others who follow (like Chet most likely) will have similar types of hype.   That picture falls back into the Lakers being a ridiculous fanbase that blows others out of proportion. THT is hyped as much as literally anyone on this sub. Before him it was Svi, and before that Lonzo. It happens with literally EVERY fringe (sometimes not) Lakers guy."
Who's been calling Bol Bol an unicorn?
"Thats cuz Bol Bol is on a team that wants to compete and their fans actually care about winning now, meanwhile OKC fans know they are in the Process."
Best case scenario is him being taller Ginobili. Worst case scenario is Bender or Bol Bol.
Bol bol sucks tho
"That’s definitely true now, his first year in the league he definitely got more of the r/nba love than Poku ever has though  You also have to factor in that Poku scored 3x as many points in his rookie year as Bol has in his entire career so far, so Poku has had far more opportunity to be posted"
I feel like for every 1 comment I see praising Bol Bol for being a unicorn saying how he could dominate if he got more minutes I see 5 more explaining why he isn't a good enough defender or efficient enough to be on the court. But tbf they're both players that if they score anywhere near 10pts it has like 1500 upvotes on the front page lol
Bol Bol got nowhere near the amount of acclaim Poku received.
"Brian scalabrine is a meme because of his personality, like his quote after winning a ship.   Caruso/Reaves are hyped because of the Lakers. They have the biggest fanbase so every one of their prospects are gonna get hyped. Look at Talen Horton Tucker.  Poku has the same body type as Bol, that’s the point and why he’s not a good example of *oh everyone on rnba is racist and loves white people*"
"Like I said in another comment they aren't mutually exclusive. No one is saying ""only white players are getting spammed on /r/nba"" but white players disproportionately get talked about on r/nba largely in part to the reddit fan base being mostly white. It's why guys like Alex Caruso, Brian Scalibrine or TJ McConnell are talked about constantly.  For the example of Unicorns or unique build players like Yao, Boban, Bol Bol, Tack Fall are all going to get hyped more than shorter or less unique physically built players."
It’s the same with Bol Bol and Davion Mitchell… Poku fits the mold of “unicorn” and that attracts attention.   Mitchell gets a ton of posts like Giddey bc they’re rookies and new and shiny.   Garza gets attention because he won National Player of the Year in college. He was literally a superstar at Iowa so he has a huge fan base. You’re ignoring context.
"Bol Bol being memed doesn't negate the fact that r/NBA as a whole on average is infatuated with white players. It probably stems from the majority of /r/nba being white and people being drawn to people who look like them. But don't act like r/nba is completely blind when it comes to race.  Using bol bol is kind of a strawman argument, when r/nba is on average very infatuated with white players despite only making up about 25% of the league."
Come on.  Bol Bol was a similar “unicorn.”  You don’t have to make this about race.  There are plenty of white boys with funny names in the NBA.
Bol bol
I could honestly see Bol Bol having a breakout like these guys if he gets playing time and develops
There aren't even that many true 7footers in the league. I know Boban and Jokic ain't coming close. Doubt it for Bol Bol and Taako. Embiid is a maybe but dude gets tired pretty damn quick. What 7 footers are you actually confident could do this?
"I was a nuggets fan for about 7 years now. Started rooting for them bc Jokic.  I'm done with them.  It's the most confused and pointless franchise in NBA, as far as I know.  With them, it's all irrational, emotional, kind of embarrassing posturing.  During the past 3 years they couldn't complete a roster.  Many opportunities to make trades, get some real men to assist Jokic, were missed. Nuggets FO is just not up to the task. They can scout, and gamble on the cheap - but they can't craft the contender roster.  Worst thing is that they, after they make their cheap gambles - they retreat into their shell, throw money at the half-bets (good money after bad), and fake ""management"".  The disconnect between the Nuggets FO and coaching philosophy is just astounding.  Malone like to play on sure bets... He's a defensive coach, but more - a defensive personality. Hence, he plays Greens even though it's clear they're over the hill and have no connection to anything in the future. He did the same with Millsap. Just a CYA little man. He's doing the same with Rivers and Monte.  OTOH - the FO is a bunch of drunken fratboys, on the chicken side... hoping to go on a treasure hunt for peanuts. Loading the roster with ""damaged goods"", undersized, with serious injuries, some talent though, but not even close to be contributors on the contending team. How many chances they missed to make a REAL trade and get some REAL talent!? Look at portland, chi, etc etc etc...   Oh... Mudiay didn't work out? Marcus is 4"" tall? Monte is low ceiling guy? MPJ back is broken? Etc, etc etc...  They act surprised when dumb things they bet on don't work.  Meanwhile, Jokic's time is slipping away. He's the only reason anyone even knows about Nuggets and Nuggets are playing him into the ground just to keep the illusion going.  In reality - Jamal will never be the same (if he recovers, it'll take 2+ years to get where he was or close), MPJ is a bust (physically or mentally or both), Bol Bol is in Malone's jail, Barton is going into the retirement and fast...  Nope, Nuggets are pretenders.  With no strong 1 and 2, no shooting, no 2nd unit, no real PF, no backup-c... they are 1st round exit material, at best.  Jokic is f\*d. Luckily, his FA is coming soon and if he wants something more, he'll get out of there asap."
"Bol Bol's path to being the GOAT mostly comes down to convincing his coaches to give him minutes, and he'll prove it."
"Came to this sub to ask about Bol Bol to the raptors possibly eventually???     Wasn't the rhetoric about the riots at the time if you defuned the police communities will police themselves?     His Dad lived in Kenosha and owned a corner store, his friends who owned car dealership asked him to come help."
I got to see Manute Bol live way back in the day when the Warriors played the Suns.  It was unreal seeing how much taller he was than anyone else.
Play Bol Bol
"I watched the 76ers practice with Charles Barkely, Manute Bol, and others.  They got bored of the pre-game warmup, so they all egged on Manute Bol to trebuchet three pointers while laughing hysterically."
"I dont mean to say Bol Bol is a great player or anything but their bench is so bleak, it seems like anyone with any juice at all should be able to help"
That jumper Bol made in garbage time was pretty smooth... I see some potential with that shooting form he has.
cant believe doc rivers robbed us of the bball paul vs bol bol matchup
"I say when the non Jokić or Barton players are shooting 1/20 or whatever it's time to sit them down and put in the third stringers, why wait until garbage time  Bol Bol and Howard, they can't be worse idc"
im going to defer to nuggets fans but its kind of hard to imagine Bol Bol cant be useful to this team.
I love when Bol Bol jumps for a ball he can obviously grab standing still
"Agree with you 100% after seeing this tonight.  I obviously am not a huge fan of Bol, but this is the type of game to try him out in."
100% But in games like this what’s the harm in putting Bol in. That bench unit that came in was easily the worst I’ve seen in the last three years. The second I saw Green with four guards I let out an audible fuck. No idea what Malone was thinking there
This is ugly. Put Bol in!
I'm at the point I'd genuinely prefer Bol at SF than playing both Facu and Rivers
Hey you guys want to trade for Bol Bol. ...2nd round pick and he is yours.
Everybody on the team just grabs Bol Bol.
I hope Bol Bol's wish was for Jokic to play for the national team
"No surprise that they sing ""Happy Birthday dear Bol Bol,"" singing his full name like it's his first name."
haha no way you would but Bol looked great for his first start last night imo.
Bol Bol on the way!
Bol Ball
"Nuggets have shown that they're very content to develop guys from within the organization unless there's a perfect fit for the right price (like their trade for Jerami Grant).   They won't trade for the expiring Dipo unless it's a good deal for them, like Harris + Bol or something. And it all depends on how Dipo and the Nuggets players look over the next 2 months until the trade can actually happen."
"Gary Harris + a first rounder or 2 depending on how good he looks by the deadline, possibly add Bol Bol or Hampton too."
The nuggets could roll bol bol jokic heartstein who is decent and mpj who is like 610
We will give you two FRPs and Bol Bol. :)
Who guard trez during bench time on the nugget? Bol bol gon get eaten alive.
Bol Bol
Might have to be something like that. Would cost you Bol too. And a lot of other stuff.
"Bol ""Slimmer Reaper"" Bol"
Pelicans/Hornets finals with Bol Bol as special guest referee.
I think that means Bol joins his dad in the tallest lineup of all time.
Is Bol Bol the tallest starting SF of all time?
Bol bol makes KD look thick.
I love Bol Bol!
God Bol Bol looks so wild there.
"Reasonable, as Bol is the bigger player."
"Pretty sure they 3 main guys they had defending KD all game were Bol Bol, Dozier, and Barton... That's a tough time."
Bol bol
Bol Bol is just not nba ready.
Why bol bol only play 16 mins as a starter. Asking soemone who is actually watching the game
"Made a contested over bol bol's outstretched arms in his face, he really is the GOAT scorer"
Just need to bring back mason plumlee for a return of the jokic millsap bol bol 4 big lineup
"Watching Kevin ""Longboi"" Durant being guarded by Bol ""Longerboi"" Bol has been a treat."
"Bol ""Durant Stopper"" Bol"
Bol Bol is so skinny if he ever gets knocked over I'm worried he will just explode
Is Bol Bol already a hall of famer?
"Well, this is 1 good thing to come outta the covid protocols is More Bol Bol minutes."
"Likely one of those ""least disruptive to our rotations"" sort of moves.  Better to move Bol Bol from 3rd/4th string to 1st for limited starter minutes, then try to keep bench cohesion roughly the same.    Just hope that Jokic still carries the starters like he has been, regardless of who the other starters are."
"Bol, Jokic are actually a power combo in 2k."
Lmao his name is bol bol
"Gary Harris out for personal reasons, Bol is not getting the start over him"
Bol Bol Szn Szn
"Ahh yes, the day that will officially mark the coming of the one true GOAT, Bol Bol."
Huh do the Nuggets have alot of Covid players or did Bol^2 earn this start?
Broke: KD will feast on Bol Bol  Woke: Bol Bol will feast on KD
BOL
"Threw my rifle in the river, it look like Bol Bol diving in the river."
I’m only here for Bol
"Nice, I think this will be his first career start in an NBA regular season or playoff game. Let's go Bol!"
"Confirmed starting lineup (no positions listed) by the Nuggets Twitter account: [Murray, Barton, Jokic, Bol, Millsap](https://twitter.com/nuggets/status/1349145125830545411)"
"Bol Bol starting, sorry Brooklyn fans."
Bol Bol and KD on the court at the same time. I hope they get matched onto each other at times
Wait wait wait are they trying to put Bol Bol on KD? Who tf they gonna have guard KD
I’m thinking Jokic Millsap Bol Barton Murray
Bol Bol guarding KD????? Hell yeah
The nuggets basically said we have our own KD and started bol bol
BOL BOL!!
“Matchup to watch: Will Bol Bol lock down KD?”
Tol Bol*
Porter out it's murray barton bol millsap jokic probably
"Dominated by Bol Bol, let's see how 50-25 fell like Wil Chamberlein."
BOL BOL
"So the starting 5 is Murray, Barton, Millsap, Jokic and Bol?"
"Well that’s the problem, you’re good enough to compete but not completely suck. I would think about a trade with Denver, Powell and Siakim for Harris, MPJ, and maybe Bol or a first. Siakim isn’t a first option, he’s a 3rd option on a championship team"
"As a Nugs fan our 5 worst players lineup is really fun to watch PG Markus Howard SG R.J. Hampton SF Bol Bol PF Vlatko Cancer C Zeke Nnaji  Idk if we have the best 5 worst players, but watching them check into a game is fantastic as a victory cigar lineup"
"I've been saying since last year that the Nuggets need to shake it up to really contend, and we're all seeing their deep seated issues so far this season. I think Washington needs a shake up too, they have good players but they just don't fit together well. I came up with this trade, which works on the trade machine:  Denver gets:   * Davis Bertans  * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * Jamal Murray  * Paul Millsap  * Bol Bol  * RJ Hampton  * 3 1sts (2021, 2024, 2026)  * 2 pick swaps (2022, 2025)  Denver runs Beal/Harris/MPJ/Bertans/Jokic, great spacing for Jokic to work with, and Beal adds consistent star power, which Denver needs to pair with Jokic, he's not enough by himself. Second unit of Morris/Campazzo/Barton/Green/Hartenstein  The Wiz get a very promising young PG in Murray, two talented projects in Bol and Hampton, Millsap is expiring financial filler who provides a veteran presence for a year, and several picks/swaps to help the rebuild."
"He's my MVP so far. The Nuggets need another star player, that's consistent, next to him. If the Wizards keep sucking, I think a Beal for Murray &amp; Bol Bol makes sense for both teams. Beal is basically a better version on Murray anyway."
"That’s true, Bol can stretch the floor, but from what I’ve seen he’s a liability on both ends"
"I would disagree with you on this one, would rather have Jaxon Hayes than Bol"
Explain Why Bol is here
"Ja, Herro, Thybulle, Clarke, Zion.   Paschall, Bol, Wiseman, Barrett, Ball, Pat Williams, Avdija  Long bois, bully's, and versatile wings o my."
PG: Bol Bol  SG: Bol Bol  SF: Bol Bol  PF: Bol Bol  C: Bol Bol  Fun fact: They're also best for all-last-name team too
He’s just old school with young players. People want to see MPJ and Bol
"Hartenstein, Pritchard, Bol Bol"
Bol Bol
Its hilarious that this sub would get mad over the THT highlights when he can actually get minutes and play but will fawn over Bol Bol scoring a 3 in garbage time with 45 seconds left
"This Philly reference is over my head  I do get I shoulda spelt it jawn, my fault young bol"
Not our announcers saying Boucher and Bol Bol look alike 😐😐😐
Bol Bol to the Lakers for LeBron and two firsts
"In the bubble seeding games, they played zone with Bol Bol, because they didn't have any guards to start, it really helped negate his foot speed problems, as well as the game seems too fast for him atm."
"Yooo girl let this young bol being you down the shoar and get some wooder ices.  Then we can hit Wawa and get hoagies, bring em home and turn that jawn onto old ECW matches"
My bad young bol
"Gary Harris, Will Barton, Bol Bol, 3 firsts and a pick swap"
"It's because they let Plumlee leave without signing another 5. They barely play Bol Bol and don't have another big to fill in that spot. There bench has been great for the past few seasons and Plumlee was part of the reason why, this offseason though they let go Plumlee, and Torrey Craig, in addition to Jerami Grant, wifhout filling in those spots. I hope they can bounce back."
Can anybody give me a reason why Bol Bol hasn't gotten more minutes so far this season?
If one of the ball brothers was named ball we couldve had Bol Bol vs. Ball Ball
We could play  Hampton - 6'6  Dozier - 6'7  Mpj - 6'10  Bol - 7'3  Jokic - 7'0
"The point is that Smart has a good contract, so why would Boston want to switch that out? Especially when Smart is the heart and soul of their team? When you have a player that’s over-performing his contract value, you don’t get rid of that.  I’m not saying Barton is a bad player or that Bol isn’t an interesting trade chip, those players are definitely those things, just Ainge is not going to give up Smart because he provides value above his contract. When a player provides surplus value you don’t switch their contract out for someone like Wil Barton. And again, you said Boston would want to get an expiring over Smart, but with their cap situation they won’t have room anyways, so expiring contracts don’t move the needle for Boston, expirings hurt Boston."
"Nowhere near enough for Smart. Boston loves him and he’s on a good deal. Barton, Bol, and a Nugs pick barely moves the needle, they’d need at least two real assets for Smart and the trade you proposed has 0 real assets for Boston."
Bol Bol is a Nugget.
and Bol Bol
It’s Bol Bol period.
"I actually like that for both teams, but Bol Bol has such a higher upside"
I don't think the Spurs would give up picks for Bol Bol. Maybe Jakob for Bol straight up?
"Maybe this is a dumb question, but why haven’t we seen Bol play that much this season?"
That no look pass 👀 Bol Bol
We have played 7 dudes all game and Bol Bol only gets 2 minutes of run. I feel robbed
Crazy it took this long for Bol Bol to play. Exact game he should’ve gotten run
I want to see the Bol
Why aren’t Bol or Hampton in yet??
Can we get a Bol &amp; jokic line up?
I thought Thon Maker was gonna be Manute Bol 2.0 and him and giannyboi were gonna be an incredible frontcourt duo
"Wembanyana lol?  &amp;#x200B;  Seriously tho, will dudes built like him become reliable good NBA level players.   Porzingis got hurt early, and its too early to say for Bol Bol"
"I'd actually say he's relatively built for a guy his height. It comes to a certain height where you're most likely to be a stick figure (like manute bol), but Tacko seems to have some muscle on him"
Wow throwing Manute Bol under the bus
Bol Bol Goated so that’s understandable
Read that Bol Bol
"BOL   I was watching Suns/Pistons and there was a similar early lead which looks like it has since closed, so don’t count your money yet."
Mol Bol
Wait what Bol Bol is out of the g league?
What kind of shade has Bol been throwing?
You’re talking about bol not RJ
Bol don’t lie?
Go Bol!!
"Looking solid so far tonight vs. the Lakers, makes me sad we had to give him up instead of someone like Bol Bol (not hating on Bol, just think RJ's ceiling is higher and he was a better fit now as well as going forward)."
"I would argue bol bol has more potential even if its unlikely potential, and isnt better prospect mostly about who cpuld potentially be a better player years down the track"
"Yeah I think his ceiling is probably a plus roleplayer or mid-rotation guy, but I’m not convinced Bol is even going to be an NBA player lol. He’s just not strong enough now and it’s gotta be hard to put on weight with that build"
Block this you fucking midget   -Bol Bol all the time
Bol don't lie
"Because the insisted on RJ Hampton. Which was smart, he is going to be very fucking good in a couple years. Bol is a giant mystery box because he has no clear role on D."
FREE BOL BOL
"We tried Bol Bol quite a few times at the start of the season though, no? It seemed like Hartenstein was the backup plan if Bol doesn't work out, but maybe I'm alone in that."
I really wish we got Bol in the trade
Umm we immediately got Hartenstein as a backup C and Bol hasnt played a single second at center in Denver this season and he is obviously not a center? Bol actually started a few games this season if some of yall didnt know and he was a 4.
Siakam for Barton+Bol?
Bol Bol baby
They have Bol at home
Unleash the Bol
Bol Bol
Please never give-up on developing Bol Bol.
FREE BOL
"That was our offense at peak efficiency, Jokic distributing then gets easy shots because the defense was so spread out.   Jokic 7/12  Jamal 7/11  Gordon 6/9 nice  MPJ 6/12  Barton 5/13 meh  Green 7/12  Green found his game we need that from him. Millsap finally off the bench and I think his game will do really well there.  Facu does everything that doesn't get stats. Bol was stupid good in garbage time lmao. Defense being so good after the 1st was also nice."
It would be a hate crime by Malone if Bol Bol isn’t in the rotation next season
The real highlight of that game was obviously the Bol Bol stepback 3
Bol Bol™ Arena
100/100 splits for Bol Bol tonight. The numbers don't lie
Didn’t even have to give up bol
BOL^2
Jeez Bol Bol w/ the 2 stepback 3s 😲
Shocked the Magic didnt get Bol Bol
FREE BOL
hol' up did bol bol hit em wit a shamgod to a stepback 3??
God damn Bol Bol trebuchet 3 takes 5 seconds to launch
Bol bol is the AD stopper
"With no extension guaranteed- maxey , RJ Hampton, Bol Bol or precious and a pick."
We get humiliated in the playoffs this year. We realize malone isn't a good defensive coach a good offensive coach and has weird rotations. We get a guy that draws plays. Murray gets consistent will barton gets traded for a shooter mpj signs a long term contract and becomes an offensive star. Bol bol becomes a defensive center piece. Forget small ball we play tall ball
He's got to be one of the skinniest guys I've ever seen in the NBA (other than Manute Bol obv) but he def has skills.
Then next year there’s gonna be a new one called BOL BOL
Bol Bol
Bol bol
Yes to the Nuggets for Will Barton Bol Bol and a 2nd
"Not too excited about Bol or Hartenstein getting minutes but for sure they need Milsap healthy in the playoffs.  Meanwhile, Harris will be lucky if he plays fifteen more games this year."
"&gt; I’m from Kansas City and have been hearing about Bol and his lack of interest/effort since he was 14  Need hard sources on this, otherwise they're just rumors.   Someone who stands at 7'2"" with insane handles, passing and a shot does not get to where he is with ""lack of interest/effort"".   He has the skillset and potential. I mean even Wiseman and Wiggins don't seem to be the type to ""put in effort"" but their effort can be turned around the right direction by a good organization and good group (Warriors).  Just be patient."
" Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball and Bol"
"Right... this isn’t a new thing though. I’m from Kansas City and have been hearing about Bol and his lack of interest/effort since he was 14. If slipping to a second rounder doesn’t wake him up, I’m not optimistic that anything will.   That said, I hope I’m wrong."
Raptors will turn him into Manute Bol
"[Still feeling pretty good about my preseason takes](https://np.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/k96xlu/wind_when_news_broke_weeks_ago_that_denver_was/gf2oc5f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  &gt;***For point 3:*** *We might have a small-ball bench with both Green and Millsap as our 2nd unit 4 and 5. Both players are getting older and its more important they are healthy come playoff time than coming off a career statistical year. As long as they get diverse experience with different lineups I expect them to each have a more reduced role, particularly Paul in the regular season to both preserve them going forward and free up minutes for Bol, Hartenstein, Nnaji, etc. Granted, they each might look great and be very difficult to take off the court. A good problem to have.*"
"Didn’t Nuggets have a lineup of Jokic, Grant, Bol Bol, Millsap, Plumlee in the bubble?"
"Point Jokic, MPJ, Bol Bol, Nnaji/Green/Millsap, Hartenstein  Height wise this lineup is huge but like I doubt Denver would ever roll it out."
"Of course, hes a rookie playing his first (couple) years during a pandemic. You don't know what he's going through. Bol will turn it around eventually."
"I'm a huge nuggets fan and I want the best for Bol. That said, Bol doesn't even want to be on the court. He'd be happy to just chuck threes in garbage time and give 40% effort on defense. He's the biggest waste of potential I've ever seen in the NBA."
Wait until Bol gets his time. You'll see the true potential of this team.
"There isn't any reason for Orlando to pursue Bol Bol, especially with Khem and Bamba behind Vucevic. Anything that comes out of Bleacher Report is bad information and fans with a platform."
Bol Bol
"Bol Bol plus a first doesn’t sound like enough for AG, not surprised that didn’t happen."
"Probably a 3 team trade, according to Jake L Fischer of BleacherReport, it would be a package centered around Bol Bol (I guess the magic are interested in him? maybe since bamba is gone soon idk) where it would be Barton to philly for a late first, and then a first of ours to Orlando alongside other random cap filler. That's not bad for Orlando, 2 picks is what they were gonna get for him anyways"
"What is that supposed to even mean?  Muggsy Bogues was basically the same player as Manute Bol if you stretched him into a 7'7"" frame."
Dana Barros once had a 50 point game. Manute Bol once hit 6 3’s in a game. Shit happens.
Bol bol gets traded from nugs and finally gets PT
"Other players like Shawn Bradley, Gheorge Muresan &amp; Manute Bol comes to mind. too tall but too soft."

Larry Bird and Manute Bol
You’re right I’m thinking Bol bol
injuries are a separate issue entirely unless there was a recent injury or something else on a medical exam (like MPJr and Bol Bol).  normal development of a player should absolutely be judged in hindsight.
Manure Bol is also the only NBA player to have killed a lion.
"I've seen two NBA centers in the wild (Manute Bol and David Robinson) and in both cases, even if I hadn't been an NBA fan, I would have been acutely aware that I was in the presence of an NBA center.  And I'm guessing these guards have walked past 20 blown up murals of #33 just to get to their post in MSG."
"Wilt, Thurmond, and even Manute Bol are off the table. Hell, even Billy Owens would have sufficed. Oh wait, “real” Warriors fans have no idea who Billy Owens is."
"&gt; This is how I think it went &gt;  &gt;                                                  *somewhere in Africa* &gt; random African dude: “I have a daughter.

bol is better than literally nothing my friend
There has to be some young talent for them to consider it. And its not Bol
"Millsap, Bol Bol, and a 1st and a 2nd? Toronto probably wants another pick"
"Denver has the young talent and the salary to make it work, something along the lines of Gary Harris, Bol Bol, and a first? Maybe throw in RJ Hampton or Campazzo to sweeten it if needed."
"**TEAM DONGBOY**  Despite a hodgepodge of talent, Team Dongboy enters the year with a fighting chance after being granted the rights to prime Manute Bol and prime Nikola Pekovic, who was a good burly center in his prime (prior to injuries and gang warfare.)  Unfortunately, defense proves to be a roadblock for the team. They have plenty of size and shotblocking, but almost no one who is able to get a stop on the perimeter. Teams rain threes on them, upsetting Pekovic and his gang members who threaten the league to stop shooting threes. Or else!  Turns out, the threats don't work. The team stumbles to a 6-76 record on the year despite a solid season from Kevin Love (25-15-5)."
"  Manute Bol, 94-95."
"I asked this question a month ago, and the general consensus was it’d be awesome if they can also play with Bol Bol, and create a [Ball-Ball-Bol Bol lineup.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lj1lqm/how_good_or_bad_would_a_ballball_backcourt_be/)"
"Ewing had both bad luck, and was robbed, of some All-Defensive teams.  He had the bad luck of playing when Hakeem, McHale, Mutombo, Robinson, and Rodman were in the league. He was in their class but just got the bad bounce.  And early on, he got robbed by selections for Mark Eaton and Manute Bol, who were not nearly the all-around defensive menace that Pat was. But got voted based on solely on their block totals."
"He absolutely can. Embiid can jump. Bol basically couldn't leave the ground. He might need to take it one legged Dirk style, but he can definitely get a shot off over Bol."
"Can you guys please trade Lowry to the Nugs for Gary Harris, RJ Hampton and 1st round pick/BOL BOL?"
Not literally. He can't shoot over Manute Bol.
We got Bol Bol minutes. Honestly we deserve this.
Manute Bol played for the Warriors.
Point Bol Bol be absolutely ruthless off the pick n roll in 2k lol
bol bol supporters?
I read this as starting the game up by 50 since that’s the only playing time bol bol gets.
I would start Bol Bol at PG
Bol Bol
Bol bol but it’s not for sure yet
Exactly. The NBA is gonna have a lot less spud webbs in the future and a lot more Bol Bols. Too bad for the normal dudes who dream of the league tho
Bol
"There are still some guys who would be able to dunk with the rim that high. Bol Bol, Tacko, Lavine, Gordon, Derrick Jones Jr, Lebron etc"
Bol Bol minutes yet?
"From the crowd: ""Play Bol Bol!""   lol"
"He claims to have made up his age, and then he drops a line where he says he believes Bol was 40 with no evidence. That's pretty speculative."
Bol Bol would average 20 with this dudes minutes.   This guy is the worst player in the last five years to start ten straight games.
"The article also says that Bol Bol is a high school player, pretty sure he’s an NBA player though hence this article must be fake"
and if Bol develops no one can stop 3 trebuchets and a taller Kyrie
Bol Bol doesn't (and unfortunately probably never will) get minutes for us
"FWIW Thon Maker was a top 10 pick and super hyped. Called a Kevin Durant/Kevin Garnett hybrid.   Bol Bol had a super famous father who was quite literally the tallest player to ever play in the NBA. I get your point in that physically unique players get more recognition than not, but those two examples are a little different.   I think Poku has quite a bit of potential and is a fun player to watch, but he's sort of a /r/nba user's wet dream. Tall awkward white prospect who wasn't a lottery pick and is on a bad team. It makes folks feel cooler about liking him than a more polished product/prospect.   I hope he pans out! I just think /r/nba specifically is going to focus on a player that looks like the majority of the user base than not."
I feel like the people who say this are just trying to be apart of some sort of anti circlejerk on Poku. People hype up Bol Bol anytime that he sees the court. The only difference between the two is Poku has a more diverse skillset and actually gets minutes.
"Lmao, you act like Thon Maker and Bol Bol haven’t gotten the same meme treatment for being lanky 7 footers who try to shoot 3s"
"Jokic 41st pick, mpj at 14, and even Murray at 7 is a steal. Then some other ones would be Facu who is undrafted and Bol bol at 44."
"*Paul Paul, are you aware if you merged with Bol Bol, you'd be named-*"
Bol Bol in shambles
"Nobody is able to even shoot a skyhook today except maybe Marc Gasol let alone block it. On footage there were only 6 or so guys who blocked it I think and thats   Bill Willoughby (6´8), Wilt Chamberlain who blocked it 3+ times (about 7´2), Artis Gilmore (7´2), Manute Bol (7´7), Ralph Simpson (7´4, and Mark Eaton (7´4)  Not many guys blocking him in 2021"
Bol Bol gets to play at his natural position the pg
give us pokusevki for bol. give us mark digonald too
"I don't know how the school system in America works, the point is dude didn't look good at all, then he had a growth spurt and became fucking good. The same happened to Dennis Rodman at an even later age, and Scottie Pippen, and many other Basketball players.  Dude when discussing about these things it's obvious that health is taken into consideration without mentioning it.  Bol Bol, Tacko Fall and Hasheem Thabeet were unhealthy as fuck and lazy as fuck too. There are 7+ foot tall dudes in wheelchairs that doesn't mean that they are automatically better than the rest, the health factor is something I shouldn't even mention but since you came up with those dudes.   If you are a healthy 7+ foot tall dude you can became the greatest if you put a little bit of effort. Look at Shaquelle O'Neal, dude was the laziest human being on planet earth but still got to the very top just by being tall as fuck.   And just because being tall is the most important thing thay doesn't mean that hard work doesn't play a factor.   Shaquelle O'Neal was a lazy fat ass who could have become by far the greatest of all time if he put 5% of the effort someone like 5'7'' Isaiah Thomas put to get into the NBA."
"He got rejected by the varsity team as a Sophomore. Two years later he was the best high school player in the nation.  Edit: he didn’t get super tall. mj is 6’6”, and in 2019-2020 the median nba height was 6’7”.   If height was what mattered, the most Bol Bol, Tacko Fall, and Hasheem Thabeet would be some of the greatest players of all time."
Manute Bol
"Your overarching point dude. You're insinuating other teams are following the same blueprint as Denver, but denver just got lucky. I disagree with that. Denver has taken chances other teams have not taken. They drafted Nurkic and then Jokic while they were weak at the wing position. Jokic wasn't just the ""next guy up,"" I literally don't think basically any other team would draft two centers in Denver's position. Same with Bol Bol, lots of other teams passed him up and Denver gave it a shot. I personally think Denver's success is a result of zigging while other teams zagged, so to speak."
"I disagree. Denver took the chances other teams weren't willing to take. It worked with Jokic, not with Bol Bol. Worked with MPJ."
Boban   Manute Bol  Bol Bol  Shawn Bradley  Sim Bhullar
we're literally destroyed by injuries currently and he can't get into non garbage time minutes. Malone trusted Nnaji and RJ more than Bol
"Yeah I don't know what this dude on. Bol had chances to crack the rotation at the start of the year and didn't cut it. Next year, hopefully."
"I see no scenario where MPJ or Jamal Murray would not have ben involved in the Rockets demands. Giving up either of them would have been a bad decision considering Harden would have been a season rental. They certainly would have to give up numerous picks or multiple strong assets. In the Harden trade alone the Nets gave up Allen, Prince, LeVert, Kurucs, three first rounders, and four first round swaps.   If the Nuggets did not want to give up that many picks or both MPJ and Murray, then they would definitely have had to include their talented prospects such as RJ Hampton, Bol, or Dozier as well as someone like Gary Harris. If that scenario were to happen then we never would have gotten Gordon."
Bol Bol
Bol Bol gotta have the greatest ratio of highlights to minutes played
I really hope he or bol never have to deal with injury
Why doesn't Bol play more? I remember he did pretty well in the bubble last year.
Bol Bol with the dAgGer! /s
You gotta pay the Bol toll if you want to get the boys hole.
"NGL it took me longer than usual to find where Bol Bol is. He's definitely putting more muscle and weight. He's gonna be a great player, imo."
"The Grizzlies were keeping up pretty well but just looked like they got so tired in the second half. I don’t blame them — last night was the last game of a 7 game/11 day road trip for them. When these two teams played each other at the beginning of the Grizzlies road trip the game was much closer, going into double overtime with Denver winning by 2 points. Ja Morant has some amazing moves for finishing at the rim. Brandon Clarke looked good on defense.  The obvious things to point out about the Nuggets are how amazing Jokic is, and MPJ’s awakening. Mpj scored 31 last night after getting a new career high 39 points in their last game vs the Rockets. Last night Paul Millsap was the man. Looking at the box score he’s only credited for one steal but he definitely had a hand in at least one other one. He was also hitting some pretty clutch shots. Jokic had a full court pass to Austin Rivers for an easy two points. Aaron Gordon has been a revelation. He’s thriving on this team.   MPJ’s younger brother Jontay is on the Grizzlies. He got put in at the very end for the last 4 or 5min. But J Porter was fouled on a 3pt shot and made all 3 freethrows. MPJ was smiling at him from the bench. It was a sweet moment.  Next play Bol Bol got fouled. Made both his freethrows. The crowd was chanting MVP, lol. He also had a crazy dunk to end the game. His teammates and the crowd were loving it."

They are going to be a juggernaut in the Bol Bol era
University of Oregon legend Bol Bol*
"Serious question as someone who doesn’t watch Nuggets games (but still a huge Bol Bol fan), what are the reasons that Bol doesn’t get minutes"
Jokic is too ball dominant to fully unleash Bol Bol. Gotta be a 6th man
Quit trying to bring Bol^2 down
Bol
"Bol Bol, Paul Millsap, and Vlatko Cancar."
1. Bol 2. Bol 3. Whose number 3?
"Jokic, Gordon, McGee, and now Bol Bol on the same team? Got me thinking that Coach Malone will make Jokic the PG in some of their rotations."
Two plays before this he wasn't at all ready for the wide open three kick out pass and dribbled into a horrific contestant jump shot that barely grazed the rim instead. The two sides of Bol.
"Bol Bol wouldnt get major minutes for any team, he’s just not good enough"
"I'm now wide awake after watching this dunk, thanks Bol Bol"
I fucking love BOL BOL.
Bol Bol was also getting MVP chants at the line before this
BOL ON THE ROLL TO THE HOLE
"Don't know, it's down to him or bol bol at the moment"
"I don't care that jokic is the MVP, Bol Bol is a must start"
"Number comparisons with early career Barkley aren't easy.  While 80s basketball style were closer to the rim, he played with some truly amazing rebounders and scorers.  (I'm in agreement with you)  Barkley apprenticed under Moses, then carried a shit on shit sixers team with Manute Bol as their starting center for five years.  And he didn't even get in the best shape of his life until he went to Phoenix.  I think people need to earn their way up to comparisons to hall of famers.  Especially when Laettner straight up said Charles Barkley was easily the second best basketball player on the dream team.  Let's compare Zion to someone closer to his orbit for now.  Undersized power forward, playing with a young squad, taking their time to make the playoffs in a strong conference.  Larry Johnson anybody?"
Tier 1: Bol Bol
Tbf Poku is KD compared to Bol Bol right now
This sub highlights would have you believe bol bol is an allstar
"Actually I remember a lot of draft analysts pointing out that Wiseman wasn't even that dominant in high school. In Nike EYBL he averaged 15ppg/8rpg on 52 TS% (even guys like Bol Bol put up more dominant numbers), and he got outplayed in head-to-head matchups against his peers like Isaiah Stewart and Evan Mobley . All of this happened in front of scouts and there have been concerns about his basketball development for a while.  People were willing to overlook his red flags because of his measurables but so far he hasn't done a good job of disproving them. Doesn't mean he can't still be good if he works hard on his flaws, but he's probably more raw and further away than people realized"
I wanted Miami to get him in the second round. Was heartbroken that we missed out on Bol Bol AND Gafford for KZ. I’ve been wanting a Razorback to root for on my team for the longest. One season of Joe Johnson was the only real time my teams overlapped! Closest I got outside of that was a short Daryl Macon stint and one day of P Bev.
Bol Bol 💪
"Which is why every draft has KD knock off 6'10 guys trying to dribble like guards and shoot pull up jumpers. Ingram, Bol Bol, MPJ and in the coming years Bates, Chet, Victor W ect."
Bol Bol or Mo Bamba in a few years maybe
Noting that jokic is getting calls now so as not to be complained about. Bol lookin good finishing the game off aswell.
"As a Denver fan, I'd trade Bol for a 2nd round draft pick if someone offers that."
bol bol wore that 100k suit on draft night just to play 2 minutes every 6 games
2k told me Bol Bol is a superstar. I don't know what to believe anymore.
"That's awesome, too. I would much rather see that horror movie than a remake of Space Jam. Hell, KD can be the antihero: Slim Reaper vs Slenderman (Bol Bol in the supporting role, naturally)"
This is 100% correct.  Gordon+Barton covers the salary than add a young player like Bol or Zeke and a 1st.  But if the trade requires MPJ or Murray DEN walks away.  Simmons would be reborn in Denver's system.  But TC will not trade MPJ this early.
"Bol is dead weight, not a prospect. I'd even be willing to include MPJ but, Nuggets fans would crucify me."
They'd be lucky to get Gordon and Barton for him so getting a prospect with some potential in Bol or Nnaji is a lot. I floated the idea on our sub of including MPJ in a deal and everyone hated it
"I've been saying that for days haha. Jokic loves posting up with a guy in the Dunker spot. The only trouble is that would 76ers accept Gordon, Barton, Bol/Nnaji and picks or would they demand MPJ or Murray? Because, I wouldn't give MPJ or Murray up."
Bol?
"With bol, thon &amp; tacko coming off the bench i dig it"
You guys might get your bol bol wish. Joker gonna foul out
I'm fucking ready. Bol Bol is real good
Who's ready to see 2 FULL quarters of the Bol show
Malone needs to stop fucking around and put Bol Bol in
"Stop messing around Malone, give us Cancar and Bol Bol"
Nuggets better put bol bol in
But we do have Bol Bol Bol
Bol Bol minutes
Bol bol
Me too. Bol don't give a shit.
They should play in Denver so we can watch the Balls ball with Bol Bol
So pull up the numbers. How many bums in the league average under 10 points a game. At least one rapper could have been at least that. We had number 1 overall players be busts. Why not have a rapper who could bring something interesting to the franchise. The bullets were literally a freak show during the mugsy / bol era
Have you seen Bol Bol play lately? Much better chance he just stands there like a tree on defense and runs slowly down the court with poor body language. Dude has some serious attitude issues and I'll be surprised if he's on the team next year.
Giannis will request a trade to Denver to be with his bff (since asg) Nikola Jokic. In which the Nuggets trade future Hall of famer Bol Bol for Giannis.
Everyone in Colorado would smoke a Bol
It is not going to be Bol Bol.  Lakers legend Markus Howard is going for 50.
they would have a whole parade downtown if he scored 15 points. 20 points and bol bol day becomes a statewide holiday
Bol scoring 10 points would be considered him going off tbh
There's no reason the nuggets should have tried the last 2 games yet they've won them. Bol Bol is the canary in the coal mine. When he sees the floor you know the nuggets have accepted the outcome.
But he's cheap &amp; fun player to have in 2K My league. But Bol Bol is the best big man in the game lol. My KAT + BolBol twin towers is too fun
bol bol gonna be the point guard and iso his way on 48mins..
Bol Bol dropping a career high 50 and towed DEN to victory just to piss the whole team.
are we ready for 50 Facu/Bol Bol PnRs?
Bol looks like someone kidnapped him and forced him to play basketball. His attitude is horrible recently.
"Bol Bol starting and playing for 40 minutes let's gooo!!!  ...shit, he's gonna destroy them and we're going to win..."
You spelled Bol Bol wrong
Bol Bol drops 40 but the Nuggets lose by 30.
"Growing up in the 90s. Mutumbo and David Robinson were the most charitable players I've ever seen, oh and Manute Bol."
You the Bol Bol
"Kinda they were a preseason top 20 team then they faltered a bit, then lost Bol Bol and was pretty bad for a while (including losing to Texas Southern) then ripped off that 10 game win streak. Everybody could see the talent on that team"
Bonjour Bol Bol already in playoff form
"That Oregon team wasn't even projected to make the NIT (forget the NCAA tournament) but ripped off a 10 game winning streak, won the Pac-12 championship and made the Sweet 16 before finally losing to eventual champ Virginia.   Louis King and Payton Pritchard went the fuck off like every game, I watched every game of that run. Bol didn't do anything tho, he was hurt."
He was on the 2019 Oregon squad with Payton Pritchard and Bol Bol. Pretty nasty in college surprised he wasn’t drafted.
hes the tallest skinniest man ive seen since manute bol
Garbage time. Noone was taking the petal off the metal... Except bol bol. He was walking while everyone was running. It looked like he gave 0 fucks.
"Fucking, bol bol, man. Embarrassing play."
Good chat man.. BOL this year
Aaron Gordon + Will Barton + Bol Bol + 1RP
They can be up to two years. It's just not common for players to sign them unless like they're recovering from injury aka Boucher or Bol Bol.
Bol Ball
The old Dwight model ... Jokic on the block with 4 shooters spread out in Murray - Jimmer - MPJ- Bol
On pins and needles to see where Bol Bol lands
He ain’t no bol bol tho
Yao would be great. He was a rare guy who wasnt like a manute bol type player who was just very very tall he actually could dribble and he did have a jumpshot. But also i think regardless of era he would have a short career.
"Dr.J and Moses Malone were hella washed when Barkley was there. Barkely in his best times with the Sixers had a Johnny Dawkins who was the only real good player they had. The rest were players like Hersey Hawkins, Rick Mahorn, Mike Gminski, Manute Bol and a solid bench guy in Ron Anderson.  Horrible take by RJ."
Manute Bol Bol Bol
What does it say about me that my most memorable Sixers moment since Dr J retired is Manute Bol hitting 6 threes against Barkley's Suns?
Bol Bol???? Why give up a future MVP for Ben Simmons
"Morris, Bol Bol, AG, 1st round pick for Ben Simmons"
I would have to think that Bol Bol and Jellybean would struggle quite a bit playing 1-on-2.
Bol Bol is not a foreign player…
"Holy shit bro relax lmao  Look at bol bol’s stats. Obviously the guy was joking. Whether you found it funny doesn’t matter, you reacted like it was a serious comment and it wasn’t. That’s all I was saying"
I present to you... Bol Bol.
Bol Bol? 🤲🏽🤲🏽
He's signing here for the minimum and you're getting Bol Bol
Remember Peter bol is running the 800m tomorrow
He’s built like skinny Gobert and can do almost everything on offense. He’s a little like Bol Bol but projects much better
bol bol
I love when a guy who is not quite known for being a rim protector suddenly turns into prime manute bol
"yah I never thought about that, that'd be an amazing fit. S&amp;T with you guys getting back Bol Bol and salary filler would be perfect"
"Jeff is a better defender, Jamychel is a better rebounder, and we seem to love power forwards, we have 6 (7 if you count Bol) in the roster. We don't actually have any small forwards, and our only C is Jokic."
"Jeff is a better defender, Jamychel is a better rebounder, and we seem to love power forwards, we have 6 (7 if you count Bol) in the roster. We don't actually have any small forwards, and our only C is Jokic."
What good is all the greens in Denver with no Bol to go with them?
Bol bol and a second for Jalen green who says no
Bol bol traded for ~~Giannis~~ ~~nuggets~~ 50 chicken minis
&gt;Bol bol traded for ~~giannis~~ nuggets
Lowry to nuggets  Kawhi to nuggets  Bol bol traded for giannis
Ball Bol Bulls. Chicago what u waiting for
It’s not quite Ball Ball but maybe they can still try and shoot for Bol Bol
No thanks. We’re on the Bol o’ Bones train now.
"If like to see an all 7' team where they basically don't dribble.  Boban, KD, Bol Bol, AD, and Nowitzky back on a 10 day contract."
Bol
Bol
What about Bol Bol? Isn’t he the 2nd tallest after Falls
"Boban, Tacko, Poku, Bol, and Facu"
"Yeah we were in a really good spot to draft MPJ. Same with taking the chance on Bol Bol, doesn't look like that is gonna pay off as well though.  I'm just in general happy with the organisation being well run enough to try these things."
"&gt;Bol Bol is not playable at the NBA level, I guess Morris narrowly sneaked past league average in the 2nd half but he was below it for most of the season, and Rivers is an average 3pt shooter at best, not above average. Green is fine yeah, but he doesn’t play with Jokic much and is really low volume.  These guys are all just above or well above league average 3PT shooters. The only guy in your rotation who isn't really a shooter is Gordon and even he was half decent before going to Denver, went 2/4 tonight. The Nuggets have plenty of shooting, otherwise it's hard to 20/44 with five guys hitting multiple threes."
"He could make any NBA team a playoff team, never said he could make it to the second round if he was on the Pistons or some shit.   The reason it’s embarrassing is that it shows how much lower Portland’s ceiling is- any fully healthy team with hopes of contending (they definitely did at the start of the season) should be able to comfortably beat a team this crippled by injuries.    Bol Bol is not playable at the NBA level, I guess Morris narrowly sneaked past league average in the 2nd half but he was below it for most of the season, and Rivers is an average 3pt shooter at best, not above average. Green is fine yeah, but he doesn’t play with Jokic much and is really low volume."
"One comment you say Jokic could make any NBA roster a playoff team and the next you say it's embarrassing that Portland (a six seed) is struggling to beat them?  Can't have it both ways, how is it embarrassing if you're saying the teams are basically even?  Also, idk what Bol Bol's situation is but if he's on the roster you have him, MPJ, Jokic, Morris, Rivers, and Green all as above league average 3PT shooters."
"as im watching this Den game finish, easy cheat in NBA2K is to trade for Bol Bol, they'll ask for like a 2nd round pick and a some 77 rated veteran   Then change his position to PF  He moves from like 72 overall to 78 or something"
Play Bol Bol
"Play Bol Bol Malone, you coward."
We need Bol!!!
Mike(al) Malone needs to play my dude Bol Bol
"Him and Porter were the two worst defenders in the league last year. Now that Porter is actually good at defense, Bol stands with Bertans and Trae Young (though Trae plays 35 minutes a game and probably deserves more credit than Bol or Bertans).  And yes. He has major attitude problems and just seems super awkward. He thinks he’s a superstar already."
 i bet Jokic smokes Bol Bol every day. In practice.
"Good point.  The struggle back in the day was that only one team had even a single bol, and it was a small bol, Manute even."
"Bol Bol has already ascended, now he just needs to get good"
We'll give you one very lightly used Bol Bol for him in the offseason?
"I don't think bol is gonna be on the team next Yr man. His attitude has been atrocious in garbage time, like he's just jogging around man. N obv he's not gettin mins cos we can't figure out what position he should guard, cos he can't guard anyone."
Bol Bol will do it
fuckin love bol bol put that man in
Two bongs packed now I'm smoking Bol Bol!!  Shoutout that dude with the bars in that one thread.
"Most teams have the problem of there only being one bol to share, but the Nuggets have bol bol"
"If Bol Bol ascends, its a wrap."
"I think it’s awesome that 3 of the most (arguably) loved players are tall ass centers. (Tacko, Bol Bol, and Boban)"
TIL Porzingins is just Bol Bol.
Maybe Bol Bol
"Its Luka and and Bol Bol tbh, Luka looking like a top 5 player All-Time"
"I’m going to copy and paste what I told someone else  The other way is seeing what a player can produce per minute which they decided to choose “36 minutes” probably because that is what starters on average play  M. Bol had more blocks per minute than any player ever (maybe not Wilt or Russell according to legends) but as you can tell, everyone is throwing in their own opinions  Stats are arbitrary depending on era, pace, position and require context"
"You can already see less extreme but more widespread versions of this in modern times right? I’m not exactly an anthropologist but AFAIK there’s a bunch of Dinka families and tribes in and around Sudan that are all fucking enormous. Manute Bol being the most famous of them, but those kinds of lines where 7 footers aren’t that uncommon."
Nah a man who thought Bol Bol would be a good player def scouts talent well
"I mean that’s one way of looking at it  The other way is seeing what a player can produce per minute which they decided to choose “36 minutes” probably because that is what starters on average play  M. Bol had more blocks per minute than any player ever (maybe not Wilt or Russell according to legends) but as you can tell, everyone is throwing in their own opinions  Stats are arbitrary depending on era, pace, position and require context"
Campazzo - Argentina  Jokic - Serbia  Cancar - Slovenia  Bol - Sudan (grew up in the US though)  Kanter - Turkey  Nurkic - Bosnia  Leaf - Canada (?)
"You missed Bobi, I think the denver x portland has a bunch (Facu, Jokic, bol, cancar, kanter, nurkic, leaf if it counts)"
Manute bol special
Unleash Bol Bol! C'mon!
Bol Bol time?
I wanna see Bol Bol
Mosr Blazers fans love Bol Bol too (Ducks fans)
"Bol Bol is a beast. I'm honestly surprised he went for next to nothing, Denver is playing is incredibly safe but very smart. They can obviously see his potential or else they'd be playing him 20+ minutes a game. Dude can score.   He's like his father, mixed with KD, mixed with Bambi and I love it."
I want to see Bol Bol here
"And 3.5 was just his career average.   He had four straight seasons where he posted over 4 per game and one where he posted 5.6 per game.   The thing that was so impressive about his height was his frame. He was so proportionate.  Like, if you saw him without the comparison of other players, his looks like a normally proportioned guy with a thick frame.   Most C's that tall are spindly (Bradley, Taco, Bol) or not terribly well proportioned (Yao). But he was just like a truck.   He was just a phenom."
Bol Bol gonna get 12 minutes
Let Bol Bol shoot threes in these 15 minutes.
So what's the story on bol bol?
Bol bol time
"Bamba, Lauri and Bol are also a part of this strange breed of 7 foot shooting guards. Channing Frye should be proud. Lmao."
You didn't need to shit all over Manute Bol.
I think the fact that manure Bol hasn't played a professional basketball game sine 1997 and has been dead since 2010 means it'll be a little bit difficult for him to find a way to beat this record
"I think the point being Eaton's block counts are remarkable because he could actually be on the floor and wasn't a liability in other ways. Bol, while he may have blocked more on avg. while on the floor didn't have the ability to play enough to reach those numbers because he couldn't play those same minutes as Eaton for other reasons, which is definitely part of what makes it impressive."
"If you **strictly** look at per 36, Manute Bol dwarfs (no pun intended) him.  Bol's **career** blocks/36 was 6.4. Eaton's best season was 6.5, while Bol had 2 seasons of 7."
What's Bol Bol tho
Don’t forget bol bol
At least bol bol ain't afraid to move cause he's not constantly worried his knees will implode lol.
Man if Denver will give us bol bol straight up for KP at this point I'd take it. If we don't have to worry about the whole money thing lol
Would've been nice to see Bol Bol on this team getting actual minutes rather than KP being injured all the time to suck every single game that matters. Lmao.
"This. People don't understand the physics of this as he literally can't back down anybody up who isn't as tall and frail as he is (Bol Bol)  He can only shoot over anyone. The problem is that he's so soft that he fades away vs 6'2"" guards"
"Manute Bol, 6 three pointers in a half"
How close is Bol Bol looking to being a rotation player?
I NEED that Bol Bol v Makur Maker matchup
Bol bol
Has Bol Bol suited up in the playoffs yet?
"No he wants the call. Hes soft af, he's really not that skinny. If bol bol was falling down this much it would make sense. AD gets light shoulder to the chest from a 190lb guard and he's flying across the floor. He's either looking for a whistle or an excuse. Fuck AD."
I laughed so hard at this. Thinking about the announcers calling the turnover between the two.  Bol Fall let the ball fall.
Bol Fall
My money is on LAC trading their 2030-2039 draft picks in order to bring Bol Bol and Tacko Fall in to help Kawhi get past Dallas.
Bol Bol is not yet aware you're legally allowed to pass the basketball
"The whole time, the announcers just scream Tacko, Bol, Tacko, Bol, Tacko, Bol!"
Fall and Bol team up with them just passing the ball to each other over everyone's head all the way to basket.
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
Fall &gt; 1 light year &gt; Bol Bol
Shit.. I'm hoping for a Tacko Fall/Bol Bol match up so we can all get outta here with a Tacko Bol.
Bold move to disrespect Garbage Time God Bol Bol like that.
"Or, hear me out, Bol Bol."
BOL BOL can’t be worse then MPJ on defense right ?💀
you are a Bol Bol fan
"For sure. At minimum a very good role player or 6th man caliber. Hes very skilled. Nuggets would be wise to incorporate him. Jokic and murray are not enough to win rings. If they get porter jr in peak form and find a way to get bol minutes and grow, they can compare for the ring"
"Yeah I still have hope for Bol tbh. Dude looks good, just needs either the opportunity from the Nuggets or another team that'll let him loose.   I don't think he'll ever be a superstar like I thought he was gonna be, but he could definitely be a great role playing starter like a Brook Lopez or an overqualified 6th man who could be a leading scorer on a tanking team."
Bol bol is actually shaping up well. In limited minutes he's been performing . Even had some big games. His minutes could go up this year
Never forget the bubble scrims where the Denver Nuggets starting 5 looked like this:   PG: 7'0 Joker SG: 6'8 Jerami Grant SF: 7'2 Bol Bol PF: 6'7 Paul Millsap  C: 6'11 Mason Plumlee
"Just get rid of him. On a better team he might be decent. Bol Bol should also be traded away. If you have no intentions of playing a guy, do what’s best for both parties and trade him"
"What each team could offer (not necessarily *all of*)  **Warriors:** Wiggins, Poole, Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody.  **Knicks:** Barrett, Toppin, Quickley, Robinson, Grimes, McBride.  **Heat:** Bam, Robinson, Herro.  **Celtics:** Brown, Smart, Williams, Pritchard, Nesmith, Langford.  **Spurs:** White/Johnson, Murray, Poeltl, Primo, Walker.  **Nuggets:** Murray, MPJ, Bol, Hyland, Nnaji, Dozier, Morris."
Bol Bol gets significant minutes after the Nuggets Green/Green backup frontcourt fails
"I was poking around older drafts in case there was a fun one, and just stumbled across this ""1992 free agents still available on day ten"" stud farm from the 1985 draft:  * Manute Bol (31) * Tyrone Corbin (35) * Hot Rod Williams (45) * Gerald Wilkins (47) * Sam Mitchell (54) * Michael Adams (66) * Mike Brown (*69*) * John Battle (84) * Spud Webb (87) * Mario Elie (160)  1970, the bucket-gettingest class I found:  * Calvin Murphy * Tiny Archibald * Billy Paultz * Charlie Scott * Dan Issel * Randy Smith * Tidbit: The Lakers' #64 pick was Larry Mikan, George Mikan's son. Unlike George's other son, Terry, who was drafted #104 by the Knicks in 1974, Larry played a season in the league. Yes, Larry and Terry."
BoL brotha! We ride with Doncic and Porzingod having healthy monster seasons
They need to deal for Bol Bol to run point
Bol Bol?
"There’s no potential of him playing even 5 meaningful minutes per game?  Manute Bol, Shawn Bradley, Gheorghe Muresan, were taller guys and had adequate careers."
I was dead on that bol bol wasn’t gonna be in the league in a few years. The guy has 0 motivation to play.
Not everyone works the same way. Some players need a defined role in order to feel motivated and improve. Not everyone can make the most out of 2 minutes per game. And even then Bol is a prospect. The Nuggets aren’t gonna play him regardless unless he just takes a massive leap. Which considering his lack of game time is not likely. Why do you think great prospects function better on bad teams? They need a lot of minutes and opportunity to fail and learn in a game environment. Bol is just not getting that.
Bol Bol and Drummond
He’s what I expected Bol Bol to be. What a player!
Free Bol
Bol Bol would fit well with raptors.
"In the case of Poku, I am inclined to believe it  However, I am arriving here partly by thinking of him as ""basically Bol Bol,"" whose terrible plus minus accurately reflects his play"

"I literally don’t understand why the Nuggets don’t just waive him. I always hear Nuggets fans justify him not getting minutes with “He has no hustle, he plays no defense, he doesn’t try, etc.” and it’s like yeah he’s a 20 something that gets 4 garbage time minutes every other game. How do you expect him to have motivation to play well, and also develop and get better when he has no role? It sucks because I think Bol Bol isn’t cut out for the NBA but let him sign with the Rockets or Thunder or something and give him a shot. Sadly I think falling in the draft to a contending team killed his career before it even began."
"I still can't believe they rolled out in the bubble with a lineup of Jokic-Grant-Bol-Millsap-Plumlee, and won the game."
Bol Bol &gt; Balls
"No, probably not. He doesn’t seem to be in Malone’s dog house anymore, but it doesn’t look like he’ll be a part of the initial bench unit, which should be pretty small most nights. Bol would need either an injury from one or both of the Greens to crack the rotation realistically, or just really get a lot better in practice I guess and make it undeniable that he’s earned the minutes. The talent is there but the consistency and defense are not. I wouldn’t mind him getting time in G League this season if he’s not gonna play now that we have a dev team."
Now AND five years from now:  1. Jokic  2. Murray  3. Bol Bol  4. LeBron  5. Campazzo
They gotta get Bol Bol to create the ultimate spooky boys roster
This is what nugget fans wish they had in Bol Bol
I want a Poku vs Bol Bol showdown.
probably Bol Bol  He’s available they just won’t play him
Bol Bol #FreeBolBol
Bol Bol coast to coast
Did they raise the rim when Manute Bol arrived?
Mini Bol
"""Bol Bol, on the other hand... man were his reddit fans idiots"""
Naz Reid is our Tacko Fall/Bol Bol who suddenly became a legit NBA player and keeps improving. Soon everyone will be aware of him.
Late on this -  Manute Bol was actually 50+ when playing.  Can't find the full story right now but it's very googleable.
Ban all Bol Bol posts instead
Bol Bol can ball (Bol?)
Yeah I'm sure Bol and Tacko are crying all the way to the bank
That bol bol game was when we had some hope he would develop nicely into our fourth star so seeing him play was great. Then came the games with a lack of effort and Malone giving him zero playtime for a reason
There is something uneasy about the way Denver and Boston fans have treated their unusually tall players in Bol Bol and Tacko Fall as if they are circus freaks displayed in a carnival. I don't find this endearing at all.
Slimlong Bol
"It was like bol with the ball, alley oop the ball to bol into the bowl by bol bol"
I wouldn’t trade Bol Bol for a prime Michael Jordan. Bol Bol’s my homie
AG + Bol + Barton + 2frp + 1srp for Simmons and Korkmaz. Pretty sure the money works with a trade exception. Yay for 4 max contracts! But Murray/PJ/MPJ/Simmons/Jokic into Monte/Kork/Bones/Green as a 9 man rotation wins the title...
I was edging at Bones and finished at Bol
Free Bol
Has Denver done a Bol Bol Bowl promotion yet?
I can’t even imagine a front court of Wiseman and Bol. Their wingspans could probably cover the entire width of a court.
bol bol has always been pretty big tbh
"Bolbol can be a mispronunciation of ""bulbol"" in my country which means pubes. Local commentators here will probably have a hard time if Bol ever becomes big in the league."
Reed has no discernible NBA talent. Bol can’t play either but Reed’s rep around the league is bizarre
"doest look like he jumped, more of a skip for that alley oop.  free bol bol"
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
Agree that Dwight would help yall out.  Would love to take a chance on Bol if I was a young team with no pressure to win. He can't get any time on a contender though.
#Bol is Life
Bol looks like a stretched out version of KD
Trade you guys Bol Bol for Gary Harris back?
"Deal, give us Bjelly and we'll give you Bol and the conditional rights to Facu if he ever reaches his height potential and grows another 6 inches."
"Bol has a longer way to becoming a rotation level defender than Markus Howard. I personally love having him as a hype man in blowouts and just as a quiet, mysterious, slender-man chilling on the bench, but there have been more than enough occasions to make me think he does not vibe with the team or Malone much at all. While I would be happy shipping him out for anyone big and remotely competent as a rim defender, even Jordan, we did have Javale log a billion DNPs in the playoffs last year.  No one will ever be Mason Plumlee :("

"Has Bol put on any weight since he got drafted? I know it must be hard for him because of his height, but he still looks so skinny"
bol bol sounds like a ben 10 alien
I'll honestly take Drummond over Bol haha.
"He is a rim-protecting lob threat whereas, Bol is worth nothing."
Bol played pretty good the minutes he was in
*Bol Bol liked this*
"You're a Lakers fan, right? Let's trade Dwight for Bol straight up since you guys love him so much."
"Trust me guys, he is amazing. Which team wants to give us a good backup 5 for Bol?"
Putting Bol extended the watch time of this game honestly I was about to check out until he started walking to the scorers table
If there is one thing that /r/nba loves its drama but if there is a SECOND thing its Bol Bol highlights

Why does Bol Bol look 2d?
"Bol Bol is 7'4"" 205 lbs I think..Can you Imagine"
I just want Bol to be good so badly
Bol bol is like a fake 2k player where you max out he height and make him as skinny as possible.   Andre Miller was the opposite
Oh my bol
Okay that was actually sick from Bol Bol
Not used to seeing someone almost as tall as bol bol out there (moses brown)
All I want is a Bol Bol 3
Bol Bol just doesn't try hard enough. He looks lost when hes in there. I don't think hes ever going to be the player Nuggets had hoped for.
"Bones comes in, crowd goes nuts, Bol comes in even nutsier.  Poor Zeke."
"i’m scared Bol is gonna break an arm or leg just by landing funny, seesh"
Bol Bol!
BOL BOL
Mobley is what they promised bol bol was going to be
As someone closer to a Muggsy Bogues than a Manute Bol or Dillon Brooks I feel personally attacked.
No. They’d probably put Bol Bol at #1 or some shit
Bol Bol and Caruso going #1 and #2
Ladies don't like a Muggsy Bogues or a Manute Bol. They like a nice Dillon Brooks sized guy
Bol Bol looks like a typical bloke
Bol Bol for Siakam. Who says no?
"I doubt it, he’s kind of like bol bol, On paper he should be a cheat code but he isn’t athletic/fast enough to create space, isn’t strong enough to be a good post player or defender. I’m sure he’ll be drafted really high, but doubt he’ll do anything in the league."
Ant weighs more than Bol Bol
Knicks will handle the bulls no problem. Game will be over in the 3rd if not the 4th. Keep the receipt even tho you won’t need it.  BOL
Bol going to get his wish for minutes with Zeke being out again tonight.
"I mean he's not wrong. Bol is not happy and wants to be gone but, he hasn't earned any minutes."
Ball Bol
I always get a good chuckle out of folks who clearly don't know anything about Bol or his treatment here in Denver lol
Bol bol wishing for more minutes
"2014: Harris, Nurkic, Jokic  2015: Mudiay  2016: Murray, Juancho, Beasley  2017: Lydon, Cancar, Monte  2018: MPJ, Vanderbilt  2019: Bol  2020: Nnaji, Hampton  2021: Bones  Lydon and Mudiay are the only bad picks in his tenure."
Damn I haven't seen Tacko in awhile but he actually looks like he's putting on weight. Just saw Bol Bol the other night and dude still looks like a twig by comparison
"Nah, trade him for Bol Bol."
Denver was down 3 starters tbf   Bol bol got minutes
"Ugh, so sick of outside takes on Bol, if you've watched him play for us over the last couple of seasons, you would know why he's not getting play time."
you expected an MLA format essay on why Bol Bol should get valuable minutes from an r/nba user? Cmon buddy we’re both stupid here.
"They went away from Bol Bol in the second half, even when he was out there they never got him the ball. I know it's not sustainable long term, but if he's having a good game they can at least try to get him some more shots instead of sticking him in the corner."
bones is getting his minutes. he earned them. bol bol is fucking ass. you do not watch nuggets games
My guy Bol does not know how to set a screen to save his life. Every time he went to set a screen last night he slipped it/rolled prior to contact. I guess avoiding any contract was a business decision for him.
BOL BOl is just not that good guys. sorry. Hes to skinny. He shys away from contact. He mostly plays on the perimeter. And he has not got any better. For someone that tall you would think he would be a defensive factor. Well hes not. Personally I think this is his last season with the Nuggets and I don't think anybody will trade for him.
Love Bol Lauri Mobley  Allen  BIG BAWL MODE ACTIVATED
Bol Bol would get relentlessly hunted on switches if he was getting real minutes
Trash take from a box score watcher. If he was worth anything then he wouldn't have signed a minimum contract with us he is worth nothing at the moment and has pretty much the same issues as 2 years back. Bones actually cracked the rotation faster for those that say Malone hates young players.   Also kinda fucking weird how you treat bol bol as a circus freak he is a mediocre basketball player that can barely get his own shot against third steingers
I'll just say Malone is not the coach to give him the kind of opportunity to flourish.  I still think about how critical Malone was of Jokic for a while. He used to get flustered with the media and even claimed Jokic wasn't as good as people thought. Eventually he was proven so wrong he had to pretend he was a supporter all along. It was kinda gross.  I don't personally know enough about Bol Bol to know whether he's being mishandled but Malone is no stranger to that.
You got more passion for Bol Bol the basketball player than Bol Bol does.
So Bol Bol for ~~Butterbol~~ Butterbean.
"Yea, it seems like there a lot of young dudes there that need to get minutes to develop. I thing the G League would maybe expedite some of that. I hate to see talented guys just waste away on benches. I really like the Nuggets and was irrationally excited Bol Bol got to play non garbage time minutes today. I know people look at him like a circus freak, but he was really skilled at OR. I’d be down on myself too, if the guys getting minutes ahead of me weren’t doing well and I thought I could add something (but never had the opportunity). Hopefully all these young dudes get some time, so they can be properly evaluated."
thats a little different since Bol Bol never played lol. But this bald pothead fraud getting such an excessive tribute for scoring like 4 ppg is weird
"Bol Bol looks like a twig out there. I keep imagining his legs snapping or something, boy needs to eat something and put on some muscle."
Fr man if my team gave a tribute to Bol Bol I'd be like what the fuck man
"Wish Barton was starting right now, he is out with a back injury.  You know we are in some injury trouble when Rivers is starting and Bol Bol is getting meaningful minutes."
BOL BOl seems to shy away from contact. Hes to skinny. I would not be surprised if this is his last year with the Nuggets hes just not getting any better.
Bol Bol out there like someone messed around on create a player.
Finger bol
Bol Bol is not an offensive rebound threat at all.
Also fun to see Bones and Bol get real minutes not in garbage time tonight.
Aka Praying Mantis the Bol Bol roll
"Except, inserting Murray, Barton, and MPJ back into the lineup does wonders for the bench. It pushes Monte back to being the 6th man. Him combined with a healthy Bones with more reps to learn the game will vastly improve the scoring capability of our bench unit. One thing I don't feel good about is our backup bigs. The Greens have been underwhelming out of the gate, Jamychal especially. That's why I think it'd be extremely helpful if Nnaji or Bol can establish themselves a role within our bench rotation. If not, I wouldn't mind seeing something happen at the deadline for a reliable backup big."
Man imagine if bol bol ate as much as zion 😳😳
"So many players out Bol Bol got some minutes in the first half.  Even our deep bench is injured right now, with Naji going down too.  We about to have to run the Covid-7 out there again."
The bol rol
and bol
Finger Bol
Finger Bol.
Bol Bol is no Jokic that's for sure lol
Time for the Jokic Bol Pick and Roll
"Every time Bol Bol is on the court I worry about him getting injured. I’m a bit under his weight at 6ft tall, which is insane.  But if he can put on some more muscle over the next few years he could do so well with his height."
Max Bol Bol you cowards!
This is fake news there is no player named bol bol why not name him 12345? This is a computer simulation of a broken animation.
Please don't injure anyone Dallas we're already playing Bol Bol we don't ahve any one else
Bol Bol vs Chet Holmgren in a hot dog eating contest. Over/under is 5 hot dogs.
Just wait until Holmgren makes Bol Bol look like he's built like a linebacker
I feel like /r/nba should just have an alarm that goes off anytime the Bol Bol enters a basketball game
I swear /r/NBA should just have an alarm that goes off anytime Bol Bol is in a basketball game
Evan Mobley is just Bol Bol on crack
Bol Bol minutes make my dick hard
Bol getting actual minutes is a glorious thing to see
What made BOL get minutes tonight??
Nice to see Bol Bol having an impact on the game. He so rarely gets important minutes...
Bol earned his minutes in previous game by playing team bball and passing a lot.
bol bol's legs scare me so much
This is such a good game  finally Bol Bol is unleashed
Okay I'm not joking Bol could be a good sixth man on a good team.
These Bol Bol screens are kinda hilariously ineffective
Boy Bol Bol and Facu running a pick and roll is a very interesting looking sight
If Bol hit that 3 the place would have exploded
Porzingis looks like The Rock next to Bol Bol
Bol Bol dominating out here!
BOL BOL GETTING ACTIVEEEE
Bol bol looking good
Trade everyone build around Bol
Bol Bol heard us all talking shit
GO CRAZY BOL!!!!!! HOLY SHIT
wtf bol bol is killing it.
SHOW ME SOMETHING BOL BOL
BOL BOL BALL
Bol Bol !!
GET BUSYYYYY BOL!!!!!
BOL BOL GETTING IN THERE I LOVE IT
Show me something Bol Bol come on baby
BOL TAKEOVER
Bol Bol makes Porzingus look thick
I feel like a golden opportunity to match Bol Bol against Boban was missed.
But he has the Bol Bol bowl at ChiBoltle
"I know that, but Nnaji also DNP'd a couple games ago and no Bol so still surprising."
"Bol Bol. 7'2"", 220 lbs."
Bol Bol looks like spaghetti
They are not feeding Bol enough that man is skin and bones
WE HAVE A BOL BOL SIGHTING
What the Bol Bol
"Javale McGee, Tacko Fall, Precious Achiuwa, Manute Bol, Bol Bol  Checkmate"
Exactly! NOLA restaurants would love Bol Bol. Imagine the potential
Manute Bol
Physically? Manute Bol
So Bol Bol for Butterbol.
Yeah but imagine Bol Bol with a 350lbs frame based off turtle soup and crawfish.
Jokic would have to post 50/20/20 to get on 2k. Dude is a top 3 NBA player but doesn't care about that shit at all. He might not even be the most marketable center on our team considering how much love Bol Bol gets.
So you are saying Bol Bol to the Knicks could be possible in 2022?
This the softest center era and he still softer than every other center. Bol bol is better
Zion for Bol Bol who says no
"7'3 and up. Its him, Samson and maybe Manute Bol if you consider how well he moved at 7'7 when he was young"
That pass by Bol was really good tbh.
Unleash the Bol
Bol Bol incoming
BOL BOL TIME
"I’ve never thought of this lol, drafting boban tacko and bol bol tn"
"Nah. We love MPJ and have already told Houston no once with him apparently. We have literally said no to a trade likely very similar to this once.   I am not saying we can get Ben Simmons for it because we can't.  (Personally wouldn't want him).. but our pieces are way more likely Barton, Harris, Bol, one of our 2020 1st round guys and future picks. Our target should be Olidipo not helping Harden get his way. Since Pacers love Barton for some weird reason."
"Include Bol Bol and a few pics and you still say no? Your relevancy wants out of town bad, no offence."
If a few FRP and Bol Bol is included do you think that changes anything?
Joker is done for tonight.  It's Bol Bol time soon.
BOL BOL minutes incoming
Boo play Bol Bol at the 3 cowards
lmao I'd go in Blacktop on 2k20 with Bol Bol and absolutely shred. Dude is a bucket in 2k and can protect the rim nicely. He's like a 73 Overall and was my choice at Center no matter what.
"They signed him to a 2 year contract last year, so they must have had some hope of developing him. Probably could use some G league minutes, but I would guess Bol thinks he's above that."
Bol Bol and filler for Derrick Favors who says no
"While that's probably true, I would have rather have Bol Bol over Smailagic"
"As a Denver fan, I'm ready for Bol to be moved. I was almost the moment they drafted him.   Just be done with it and we'll all be happier."
Man....thank you so much. I always tell my friends that the quickest way to tell if somebody is actually a nuggets fan is to ask their opinion on  Bol Bol lmao. People are always like “they should trade him if they’re not going to use him” like...you don’t think we’ve tried? Nobody wants this dude lol
Bol himself believes this myth. I wish Denver would send him on his way. Both would be better for it.
That Bol Bol is as good as he was in college and should be given lots of minutes. Ppl just watch the highlights and think he’s KD
Bol bol would definitely fix all problems for New Orleans
Bol Bol
"We had Run TMC, that was no joke...and then Manute Bol shooting 3s."
Why doesn’t Bol Bol get NBA minutes yet? Is he still too small or something???
Meanwhile Bol Bol told the nugs “nah I’m not doing G league”
Manute Bol 1 through 12
I always knew he sucked. We'll take him off the Mavs for Bol Bol and a pick. He'll do better as the 3rd option behind Jok and Barton.
"He’s funny because he was impressive in his short minutes late season. Then he was terrible in summer league/preseason, and then last night he was awesome when he played real NBA minutes. I think he’s just a system player. Plug him in next to some good players and he’ll step up, but he can’t do much when sharing the floor with the likes of Bol Bol and Markus Howard."
Bol Bol
"I feel he’s in a similar group with bol bol, can do some amazing stuff but will never be a positive player"
Shoutout to that redditor who knew Bol will not play
