"Bickerstaff simplify the game for Sexton just get buckets and surround him with Jarrett Allen, Larry Nance Jr, Taurean Prince, and Issac Okoro play on ball &amp; help defense, set screens, and make extra passes."
Yes the Wolves have been bad for years because Larry Nance Jr was able to get in the huddle.   Thanks for the insight I'll call up Rosas right away
"The Cavs in LeBron's last season during his second stint. Right after making the trades that landed Larry Nance Jr, Jordan Clarkson etc."
Larry Nance Jr
Larry Nance Jr
How is that a favor?  How does finding out Larry Nance Jr has long balls help me?
"this is very role dependent  like George Hill for that dude who could bring the ball up, get it to lebron, spot up, he was good   JR obviously fucked up in game 1 of the finals, but he was fine in his role, not as good prior years, but fine for his role   i thought K.Love played awful  Korver for his role was good   Larry Nance and Tristan i thought were solid   Hood, Clarkson were big yikes   jeff green was ok.."
"I was about to talk about how Bledsoe, Hayes, Adams and Lonzo are a bad fit with BI and Zion and then I remembered how the Cavs have like two guys between 6'2"" and 6'10"", one of whom is Larry Nance Jr who plays like a center anyway."
"A lot of comments saying its like the 1st year LeBron was with the Lakers, but LeBron was injured (and many were also) and we didn't get to see them at full strength in the playoffs.  I prefer thinking of a supporting cast like George Hill, Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson, with Jordan Clarkson coming as the 6th man. If the Kings are just as good as these cats, than LeBron can make them contenders, as proven in 2018."
Jarrett Allen. Myles Turner. Larry Nance Jr.
Larry Nance Jr hovering around this kind of line this year minus the blocks. he's a big reason they're the 5-seed right now
Larry Nance Jr. hometown hero and arguably top 2 player on the team
I see your offer and raise you one ghost of Paul Millsap for Larry Nance jr straight up
"Well it goes basically  Horrible dumpster fire beginning era  Price/Nance/Daugherty big 3 that's really good, but can't stay healthy and just gets beat by MJ when they do  Mike Fratello slo-mo era (begins with Terrell Brandon and ends with fat Kemp)  Alternating between complete malaise and complete LeBron-aise  Larry Nance Jr era"
"I’ll give u Greg Whittington for Larry Nance, Jr. fair trade. Greg Whittington exists I promise"
"They lead the league in defections, Larry Nance Jr has turned a corner with his outside shot, and Drummond for all his faults still gives them plenty of extra possessions. Okoro is already a defensive menace. They definitely deserve more respect."
Larry Nance Jr is such a solid player
"The second he wasn’t on the Lakers / a Lebron Cavs team, his stats froze and he ceased to exist... didnt you know?    That’s how NBA media works until you go back to a large market. If KCP were traded to the Cavs tomorrow for LNJ, you’d be hearing “is Larry Nance Jr the slept on “third star” the Lakers have been waiting for??” takes 24/7. It suuuuucks."
I MISS LARRY NANCE JR!!!!
Alright here's a list of guys from mid-majors that had at least decent careers.   Chris Kaman Central Michigan  Kevin Martin Western Carolina  Danny Granger New Mexico  Patrick Bryant Bradley  Paul Milsap Louisiana Tech  Rodney Stuckey Eastern Washington  Jason Smith Colorado State  Jason Thompson Rider University  Courtney Lee Western Kentucky  George Hill IUPUI  Steph Curry Davidson  Gordon Hayward Butler  Paul George Fresno State  Larry Sanders VCU  Jimmer Fredette BYU  Kawhi Leonard San Diego State  Kenneth Faried Morehead State  Norris Cole Cleveland State  Shelvin Mack Butler  Damian Lillard Weber State  Kyle O'Quinn Norfolk State  CJ McCollum Lehigh  Isaiah Canaan Murray State  James Ennis Cal State Long Beach  Cam Payne Murray State  Larry Nance Jr Wyoming  Richaun Holmes Bowling Green  Ja Morant Murray State  Obi Toppin Dayton
"It was mildly amusing the first time I heard it like a year ago, now it's pretty much in every thread that has anything to do with Sexton, Garland, or the Cavs.    It's not that funny and has been beaten into the ground at this point. Also, according to Larry Nance Jr., Sexton and Garland don't like it, for what that's worth."
"Definitely not on as large of a scale as Middleton or the other guys listed on this thread, but Larry Nance Jr. is currently in the middle of completely changing his profile as a player.   Career high in PTS, Assists, 3PA and 3P%, while leading the league in Steals. He’s gone from a decent energy big to a Draymond Green-lite type of player. The lack of scoring volume will always keep him out of the mainstream’s view, but he’s been super impressive this year."
"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter  Larry Nance JR. gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Cedi Osman yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Austin Carr hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
**Cavs:** Won the trade.  **Sexton:** The new face of the NBA.  **Larry Nance Jr.:** Incredible. Sturdy. Talented.  **Allen:** Cute.  **Nets:** Literally garbage.  **Harden:** Fat.  **Kyrie:** Washed.  **KD:** Needs more help.  **NBA:** Please stop letting teams allow fans into the arena.
Larry Nance Jr has improved so much. I love seeing this.
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH LARRY NANCE JR
Larry Nance Jr is a really good defender
Larry Nance Jr. gonna make an all defense team at this rate
"KEEFE WAS EATING pizza outside in Laguna Beach, California, on Nov. 24, when his phone rang. It was Ingram. They hadn't talked in a while. Ingram told Keefe he had just signed his new contract in New Orleans, and thanked him for the work they had done together.  ""I was like, 'Wow,'"" Keefe said.  Before the Davis trade, the Lakers saw signals that work was paying off. Luke Walton, the Lakers coach for Ingram's three seasons there, was among Ingram's biggest supporters in the organization. In meetings, Walton and his staff debated Ingram's best position. Several argued he could be a point-forward. They tried him there when Lonzo Ball got injured in early 2018.  ""With no prior reps, he knew the offense,"" Walton said. ""He became a playmaker. It was only a matter of time for him."" The NBA on ESPN and ABC  The NBA is back! Catch all the 2020-21 season action on ESPN, ABC and the ESPN App.  Wednesday, Jan. 20 • Celtics at Sixers, 7 p.m. on ESPN • Suns at Rockets, 9:30 p.m. on ESPN  All times Eastern  He was getting stronger. Mark Madsen, the former NBA player and Lakers assistant, hopped into pickup games with players. On one defensive possession, Madsen rotated and tried to plow through an opponent. When they collided, Madsen stumbled.  ""Dang, whoever did that is pretty strong,"" Madsen thought. He looked up and was surprised to see Ingram. ""He plays much stronger than he looks.""  Madsen watched Keefe and Ingram work, and thought about one of his old teammates over six years with the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""Brandon reminds me of [Kevin Garnett] in terms of his consistency, his routine,"" Madsen said.  ""He is the hardest worker I've ever seen,"" said Larry Nance Jr., Ingram's teammate in L.A. for parts of two seasons. ""The rest of us would get [to practice], and he'd already be drenched in sweat.""  Pelicans officials eventually banned Ingram from showing up to their facility on off days. They showed him data from their training staff indicating he was overworking himself. ""I hate it,"" Ingram said. ""But I use those off days to visualize the game.""  In search of more tutoring, Stackhouse hooked Ingram up with Micah Lancaster, a Michigan-based trainer who has worked with several NBA players. Lancaster pushed Ingram to bend more while dribbling, and shorten his strides while zigzagging through narrow corridors.  The idea was to be faster changing directions. In a crouch, Ingram would be harder for defenders to grasp. He could lean forward and use his shoulders for leverage around the rim. Lancaster learned firsthand of Ingram's wiry strength. He has clients toss a special medicine ball off a wall at his facility in Grand Rapids. Ingram threw the ball straight through Lancaster's drywall, leaving a hole that is still there. They tried another wall. Ingram cracked it on the first throw. ""We had to stop him,"" Lancaster said.  Lancaster set up short cones in twisting patterns, and he had Ingram reach down to touch each one as he dribbled the maze. At first, Ingram slowed to tap the cones. Eventually, he performed the drills at full speed.  ""My job is to show you how bad you are at something,"" Lancaster said. ""Some guys don't have the stomach for that. Brandon does.""  The choppier strides seemed to contrast with Keefe's work in L.A. helping Ingram use elongated steps getting to the basket. In reality, the skills were complementary -- for use in different scenarios. Honing them all -- digesting where and how to use which style of footwork -- took time."
"Larry Nance Jr I feel like is the best accommodating player for a star.  Defends well, low usage, legit fits almost any scheme you put him in."
"The first step unfortunately, because I think it is admitting failure on a valiant cause of trying to save the kid, is to trade Kevin Porter Jr. I thought the situation was being handled remarkably well by Coach Bickerstaff et al until he set the whole thing back with his tantrum  SexLand™️, Okoro, Allen, Delly, and Nance are non-negotiable for me. Larry in part because he is one of us, born and raised on the shores of Lake Erie. Id also like to see Windler remain a part of the rebuild and Love to come back for the title run in 2024"
Larry Nance Jr has entered the chat
"&gt; I don’t watch a ton of Cavs but I have a hard time believing LNJ is a better player than Drummond  Drummond  - is totally incapable of scoring outside the paint so he clogs up the offense  - somehow incredibly inefficient even though he doesn't ever shoot outside the paint  - somehow commits lots of turnovers and takes a fuckton of shots even though he's so poor as a scorer  - has a long history of not putting in effort on defense after the halfway point of the season  Larry Nance Jr is just a very good defender who passes well, hits 3s, plays his role, and greases the wheels on a good team. Unfortunately he isn't on one lol  &gt; Booker is the best player on that team.  Booker has been fucking awful so far this season."
"Cavs, but Larry Nance Jr is better than Drummond. Could also make the argument for Randle because I don't see how his playstyle possibly translates to a strong team (which has always been his issue).  Sneaky answer right now is also Mikal Bridges on the Suns"
"Welcome to Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to complete a clean sweep of the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers.   The starting five for the Cavaliers tonight is Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. Look for big contributions from 6th man Larry Nance Jr off the bench."
Larry Nance Jr.
I ran into Larry Nance Jr at a grocery store once. Dude started screaming about electrical infetterance and throwing candy bars at me when I said I was a fan.
I'll take 1 Larry Nance Jr please.
"I get it.  I really like Larry Nance Jr., Meyers Leonard, Seth Curry, and some other non-stars. Dunno why, but some guys I'm just drawn to root for."
"Super team with old ass d wade, Tristan Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, jr Smith, George hill, Larry nance? You’re tripping"
"A- Lebron delivered a championship to every city he’s played in. That matters. He left in free agency not by demanding a trade that matters. He left if he was unhappy with the roster moves a team made.  B- The trade you are referring sent out Dwayne wade, Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas Iman shumpert Derrick rose and Jae crowder. They received Jordan Clarkson, Larry nance jr, George Hill, Rodney Hood and the draft rights for an overseas player. This trade made them both younger and healthier.  C- the trade was for 3 picks and two swaps. If it continues to work out and the lakers are better than New Orleans, those swap can be nothing Every trade you referenced is factually incorrect.  And to reiterate, it does matter if it worked out. Ask the fan bases involved. It probably feels a lot better to have made whatever trade(and lebron trades were focused and on what actually makes the team better not who he didn’t like in the locker room.) and won a chip than make several trades and have harden kick you in the nuts with his trade demands out the door."
"Hello? Did you just happen to miss Larry Nance Jr, Mason Plumlee, and Hamidou Diallo? Not to mention LaMelo at 11."
"True. Lakers recently have done well too with Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma and Talen-Horton Tucker all taken late"
"Yeah I don't think Drummond is in their long term plans, they've got Jarrett Allen, Javale Mcgee, Kevin Love, and Larry Nance Jr. They should be starting Jarrett Allen long term given his age - Drummond is superfluous for that team because Jarrett Allen does about everything he does but better for less money."
"Cutting Maker hurts. We had a lineup in our last game of Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, Thon Maker, Larry Nance Jr. and some guard (sorry, I don't know who's on my team at this point). They could have kept Thon for one game and given us Drummond, McGee, Maker, Jarrett Allen and Nance at PG."
"Vanderbilt is probably the best we have and odds are he might crack the starting lineup soon.   It was a known issue this roster is missing a 4. We tried to get Millsap, JaMychal Green, Derrick Jones Jr, and Jae Crowder in free agency. Some we couldn't afford but others just chose other teams. We've also been rumored to be probing trades for PJ Tucker, Larry Nance Jr, and Aaron Gordon.  Our GM has been trying but not much has come our way."
Y'all had the third splash brother Larry Nance Jr though
AND Javale AND Larry Nance Jr  ^^and ##sexland
Larry Nance Jr. running point.
Larry Nance Jr is a full time SF now.   We tall ball.
I miss Larry Nance Jr being on the lakers :(
"Larry Nance Jr, Kevin Love, Javale Mcgee, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond.    TALL BALL IS HERE MOTHERFUCKERS"
"Why do people on here abbreviate peoples names? I know you’re talking about Larry Nance Jr, but nobody ever calls him LNJ. I saw someone use TLC for the guys name on the nets I can’t spell."
Larry Nance Jr
Larry Nance Jr. is leading the league in Deflections.
"Yeah! Just like Caruso, Kuzma, Jordan Clarkson, Zubac, Larry Nance Jr.   Wait"
A laker fan forgetting former Laker great Larry Nance jr carrying that bum lebron in 2018
Larry Nance Jr is 6’7”? That can’t be right
All you need to know about this game is at one point in the 4th quarter the Cavs had Larry Nance Jr at the two guard. Just a weird game.
Is that Larry Nance Jr on top of the defensive points saved?  My man!
Larry Nance Jr. apparently
Hey hey that's Larry Nance Jr to you!
Bro these people out here really acting like nba legends have a trademark on names. Aw shit can’t call mike Miller mike because Michael Jordan is mike. Larry nance jr is not Larry since that’s Larry bird.
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
"Yeah, I definitely wish that we have more players available for the next game, our depth chart is looking rough:   &amp;nbsp;  [](/CLE)Cavs|**Starter**|**2nd**|**3rd**|**4th**|**5th**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |PG|~~Darius Garland~~ |~~Dante Exum~~|~~Matthew Dellavedova~~|Collin Sexton|-| |SG|Collin Sexton|~~Dylan Windler~~ |Damyean Dotson|~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |SF|~~Isaac Okoro~~ |~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~|Cedi Osman|~~Dylan Windler~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |PF|~~Kevin Love~~ |Larry Nance Jr.|Cedi Osman|~~Isaac Okoro~~|Dean Wade| |C|Andre Drummond|Larry Nance Jr.|JaVale McGee|~~Kevin Love~~|Thon Maker|   Also, unrelated, but Cole Anthony looked pretty good in there tonight for Orlando."

"Similarly, Larry Nance Jr was my last pick and he's become a surprisingly good assist man. Small sample size but 5.2 apg so far this year. Plus damn near 3 spg. He's like a mini Randle with hops😅"
Larry nance jr
"&gt;testament to their scouting  Now list Thomas Bryant, Larry Nance Jr., Josh Hart, Zubac, THT, Clarkson, Svi...all starting level to legit rotational pieces in the league picked in the late 1st to 2nd round. Discrediting scouting because of one #2 pick is laughable. Lonzo was also a consensus #2 pick. You can't have it both ways."
I'm gonna say Larry Nance Jr!

Get your hands off our Larry Nance Jr.
"""...and, therefore, Should Larry Nance Jr take his talents to Los Angeles, or Brooklyn?"""
Larry Nance Jr is staying
My gut says Larry Nance Jr. ends up in Dallas.
"Over Kyrie? If we are talking about overall greatest Cavs players as far as team culture, fandom, etc - and not just the most talented, here’s a few:  LeBron  Austin Carr Larry Nance Sr Larry Nance Jr (already) Mark Price Zydrunas Ilgauskas Brad Daugherty Tristan Thompson Bingo Smith Ron Harper Lenny Wilkins Tristan Thompson  **Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye**"
"I didn’t turn shit off, would have missed the golden moments like Kaman taking a snooze on the bench. Or getting pissed off at Jordan Clarkson for most of the game but having to suck it up because he was the only player that could make a free throw to save his life. The drama between Swaggy and DLO was better than any reality chick flick, and then laughing my ass off when Nick celebrated his 3 pointer early and then missed it. Kobe calling his teammates soft like shit was classic. Robert Sacre was my boy. Larry Nance Jr dunking on KD is still the background on my phone. Can’t enjoy the good times without reveling in the bad ones my friend."
Larry Nance Jr embodies NE Ohio perfectly
"A guy like Larry Nance jr could also be great, even better than Siakam because of his help D"
Larry Nance Jr. got to wear 22 in Cleveland (retired for his dad) so I guess it's possible to get special permission
"From 2013-2018 the 27th pick has been Rudy Gobert, Bogdan Bogdanavic, Larry Nance Jr, Kuzma, Siakam, and Robert Williams. It's been a very solid run but can't speak about the last two. That's 2 stars and 3 solid role players if Rob stays healthy.  Edit bonus is the 3rd pick Run. In the last 10 years The 3rd pick would produce a team of Luka, Beal, Brown, Tatum, and Embiid."
"I don't think anybody can get it done on their own. LeBron surrounded by Lonzo Ball and Larry Nance Jr. wasn't making the playoffs. And even with Kyrie and Love next to him the KD GSW just steamrolled him. Same GSW teams Harden would take to 6 or 7 with a one legged CP3 next to him if he's lucky.   LeBron's the second greatest player ever. MJ is the greatest. Even MJ wasn't getting it done on his own, he kept losing in the first round. People used to knock Wilt before that for not being able to beat 4 All Star HOFers by himself, which was dumb too.   It's definitely a team game, if we're going to hype people for succeeding with stronger teams you can't hold it against someone when they get a stronger team and get their turn at it."
"Larry Nance Jr isn’t gonna be a star, but he’s been a very good role player for a while too"
PG: JaVale McGee  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Larry Nance Jr  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Andre Drummond
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
Larry Nance Jr
"LeBron, Bronny. CJ, Larry Nance Jr, and Steph. Bring em all home baby LFG!!!!"
"Gotta make a trade  I'll trade you Jarrett Culver (6th overall pick!), Okogie, and Jake Layman for Larry Nance Jr"
"Larry Nance Jr is such an important player, his role for this team is so massively understated."
"I'll always have a soft spot for the pre lebron lakers. Clarkson, Larry nance jr, hart. We had some really great scouting for late round picks."
"This is the problem right here, players play for owners ie their money instead of for the fans and the city. Give me Larry Nance Jr over some mercenary (not saying Drummond 100% is only about the money, but too many players are) any day of the week"
Their defense was elite with Larry nance jr. He’s been out for quite awhile and their shooting has been piss poor over this streak.
"Summary: K Love injured his calf at the start of the season, missed 28 games after this game. Recently start practice again. there is no definite timetable for a return.  He will play, there is no trade on the horizon for an injury-prone player being paid 30 million. This Cavs team has no viable power forward option at the moment. Larry Nance Jr is also injured."
larry nance jr was the key to their success but that means ur team wasnt that well built and still need major improvements
So you really want to pair up both of the Jay's with Sexland and Jarrett Allen? And Larry Nance Jr off the bench
Does Larry Nance Jr. count? I love his dunk highlights. And his elbows are above the rim when he dunks. It's insane.
It’s a shame the lottery didn’t work out for us again I really wanted lamelo then to move Garland and make Sexton our true #2.  Tbh I’m not sold on anyone on this team expect Larry Nance Jr. Him and Allen are the only guys I could see getting solid minutes on actually good teams.
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"

"Fair enough. The Pistons aren't on often enough to see if Griffin can still play, so I just remember him for what he was - an overpaid Larry Nance Jr."
LARRY NANCE JR FANTASY OWNERS WAIT PATIENTLY AGAIN AND EVENTUALLY RISE UP HOPEFULLY STILL IN PLAYOFF CONTENTION
"shouldn’t it be implied that a 40 inch vert would come with generally good athleticism like quickness, speed and agility  Some anomalies like Larry nance jr exist but he’s no sloth either"
"Was really lucky to have the chance to play soccer with Steve Nash, Larry Nance Jr., Joel Embid and a few other NBA players.  Being around them was eye opening in that they were just hard working dudes who loved the game and were really focused and talented.  Seeing them in that light and taking the work ethic and love for the game really had an influence on me.  Well maybe not Embid he seemed lazy, lol.  Everyone else though was cool and Larry Nance Jr. is one of the nicest and funniest people I've ever met.  Also Luel Deng is chill and Tobias Harris."
"Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Zubac, Kuzma, Hart, Wagner, Svi, and THT since 2014. Caruso went undrafted and played for OKC's G League team for a bit before playing on LA's Summer League team and then signing a two-way contract with them. He should still count, though."
Shades of Larry Nance Jr
"Larry nance Jr/ Jarret Allen, (good luck tho)  Jeremy Grant"
Larry Nance Jr has an almost 0% chance of getting traded.
How much help does Larry Nance Jr. need?
"I mean KAT is an average defender. If he was paired up with Larry Nance Jr and we added a strong wing defender we could be above average defensively, but considering those things are unlikely I doubt it."
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
I think the most likely scenario is the Warriors trading a few of their assets (definitely not everything) for a guy like Jerami Grant and another starter like Larry Nance jr. There are very few non-playoff teams with All-Star/fringe All-Star players that aren’t on their rookie deals.
Larry Nance Jr.
"Oh KPJ is a stud for sure. Probably the more talented outright than Sexton, more likely on par with Garland. I was sad to see him go how he did, but it's what it is. Glad he's having success in Houston so far, just hope he keeps his head on straight.  Totally on the Sexland train though, 100%. Garland has insane talent and is on the right track, Sexton isn't as talented but makes up for it in freakish work ethic, Okoro just oozes leadership and has looked increasingly confident. Altman has taken some smack from Cavs fans and NBA fans alike but he's done such a good job putting this group together. We've got Sexton, Garland, Okoro, Allen, and Hartenstein who all have talent and are 22 or younger. Windler, Wade, and Stevens as well, all under 25. Larry Nance Jr. is 29 years young. I'd love him to age into a mentor role for all of the young guns as this team starts to take off. Really think we just need an athletic 6'8 or 6'9 forward to deal with the Kawhi/Lebron/Giannis super-athlete types on defense. Our best sub is Okoro right now, and while he is certainly talented, I don't know if putting on a bunch of muscle would be enough to handle guys that big. Okoro will be able to handle 1-4 in the long run though I'd reckon. All around the team is oozing with potential though. Really excited.  Also very happy to see your Suns succeeding too! Always been a bit of a Booker stan, he's my go-to guy when I'm trying to come up with creative midrange moves to pull out at the park. But for real it's great to see him, and the Suns get their due (desparately avoided saying ""time in the sun""). Just soooooo much talent, like every player on the damn team is an above average starter. It's strange, but beautiful to watch."
"Maybe not best but Larry Nance Jr is my favourite.   Hr has a poster on KD that was incredible, I'll try and find a link."
"Better question would be what metrics do you use to evaluate defenses? None of them are both relatively consistent year to year and predictive, which means it's pretty tough to use them in analysis. What I can tell you is that Okoro has played more minutes than every rookie not named Anthony Edwards, and has spent most of those minutes guarding the opponent's best perimeter player. Only other recent rookie I can think of with that responsibility is Lu Dort. I can also tell you that his defensive metrics aren't dog shit despite having almost no good defenders on our team. We were solid defensively early in the year, and there were 5 reasons for that. One of them was coaching. Then there was the surprise factor, as nobody expected us to be good so they didn't really prep for us. Then there was Javale McGee protecting the rim. Then there was Larry Nance Jr. being a disruptor. And finally, there was Okoro actually doing a pretty good job of limting the production of the oppoent's superstar. We already went through this business with Sexton and Garland. Advanced stats don't do a good job of measuring young leaders of bad teams. They can't differentiate the legit from the bullshit. But watch some of our games and then tell me Okoro isn't legit."
"The issue with the Deng signing was that the Lakers signed him to play small forward when he was only good as a small ball 4 by that point. The Lakers already had Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr. to play PF, and they had just drafted Ingram as the only other 3 on the roster, so the Lakers clearly thought that Deng could play SF while Ingram matured. However, once it became clear to them that Deng could really only play PF, then their choice was to either give him minutes that should be going to Randle and Nance, or play him out of position where he was getting killed on defense and couldn't score.  That's why Deng only played for half a season, then the Lakers simply sat him for the next season and a half before stretching him. $72 million for him to only play a few months because they had no use for him. At least they were able to get rid of Mozgov (and he was making less money). Deng was a worse signing, which is why the Lakers will still be paying him for another year before they're finally done with him."

Looking like Larry Nance Jr out there
I'm fooked because my favorites are all guards and Larry Nance Jr.
How dare you talk down on Larry Nance Jr
Larry nance jr. would be a good one. There were games when his hand was hurt that the Cavs announcers would interview him at half time and it’d run into the second half. At that point they pretty much just had him in there commentating the game with them for damn near a quarter.
it's because I traded him in fantasy for larry nance jr (who broke wrist the next day) and keldon johnson (covid soon after)  You're welcome nuggets fans
"&gt; he is so comfortable handling the ball, and his court awareness is really good   For real? The dude had a 5-, 6- and 9 turnovers game this season.  His ceiling is probably bargain bin Larry Nance Jr."
"Larry Nance Jr. Is one of those players you'd love to have on your team, plays defense, rebounds and plays within himself offensively"

Either Delly or Larry Nance Jr when healthy
Larry Nance Jr/John Collins/Jeremi Grant/Aaron Gordon   I think the pattern is clear...
Pacers get: Larry Nance Jr. Javale McGee 2022 top 8 protected 1st  Cavs get : Aaron Gordon  Magic get: Miles Turner
very likely but does that invalidate my point that Love got to play with Lebron in Cleveland which helped him achieve the Championship and that Sexton played with ..... Larry Nance jr and Cedi Osman.
"If we can snag larry nance JR or lonzo, and lowry or vuc, we could be primed for another finals berth. I think those are our most realistic paths towards making a finals appearance, using Nunn and robinson for nance or lonzo, and herro and precious for lowry or Vuc.   Not sure what the prices of those players will be, so somebody tell me if Im way off on the prices."
Larry Nance Jr should be here
"Ah yes, “prime” Larry Nance Jr."
The only way it would happen is if we do a legacy Jersey for Bronnie Jr like we did for Larry Nance Jr. but who would have the balls to even try this?
"Larry nance jr, by a pretty wide margin tbh"
"Pushing for PJ Tucker,  Larry Nance Jr., and Tomas Satoransky personally."
"Rodney Hood, GHill &amp; Larry Nance Jr also took off later on."
"&gt;*and they said Ingram takes shots away from zion and Ingram acts like it's his team.*  Players don't get to bogart shots. If it's a close game and Brandon has the ball at the end, it's because coaching staff asked him to take closing time shots.  Brandon's always been really supportive and complimentary of Zion (even to the point where it became a controversial Lebron story about him complimenting Zion lol.) With this year's insane schedule, it helps both guys to have another person on the floor who can help carry the offense so they aren't by themselves.  They haven't had a training camp together (Zion was hurt last year) and this is Zion's first real season playing with the team.  &gt;*I already know he don't really play any d but how has he at other aspects of the game?*  Yeah, the defense is bad lol.  We need a year of actual practices to work on team defense and we need a 3&amp;D Wing who can take those assignments on. (David Griffin was looking into Larry Nance Jr. who isn't available, but hopefully, that means he's looking for similar guys.)  Brandon's offensive load is still a lot and the bad spacing makes him expend more energy to get to the rim. So that probably takes away from the defense a bit too. He also needs to put on actual weight to stop getting shuffled around at times."
"Yeah, it's Larry Nance Jr."
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
Larry Nance Jr.
Larry Nance Jr. in shambles right now.
Don’t do Larry Nance Jr. like this
"The league wanted Kyrie in Boston and LeBron in LA to reignite the rivalry. Obviously they couldn’t do anything about Hayward getting injured like 2 minutes into the season. We got the Nets pick out of the deal, and ultimately brought Larry Nance Jr home"
Man if I have to watch Cade wearing Cleveland's nasty Walmart Thanksgiving tablecloth looking unis tossing lobs to Larry fucking Nance Jr. I'm gonna have heart attack
"Pretty much. Aaron Gordon,Bam or even Larry Nance Jr. would be the perfect pairing."

Larry Nance Jr just seems like a good dude.
Remember when Larry Nance Jr. refused to give an autograph to that kid and Kevin Love came to his rescue? Nance Jr. was on top of the world at that time too.
"He is 4th in total deflections (193), tied with Ben Simmons and behind Fred VanVleet (194), TJ McConnell (217) and Robert Covington (229). Per game, he is 10th with 3.1 per game, behind OG Anunoby (3.2), Smart (3.3), Jrue Holiday (3.3), Larry Nance Jr (3.4), Butler (3.5), TJ McConnell (3.6), Covington (3.6), Ben Simmons (3.6) and Fred VanVleet (3.9)."
"i don't know either well enough, but reading this my first thought was Larry Nance Jr"
"We'll see a few starters come out from this thunder team.  They had Jerami grant, Robert covington, t.j McConnell, nerlens noel who all improved afterwards.  Lakers had the same issue where the players improved afterwards like lonzo, Ingram, randle, and Clarkson. And Larry nance jr. Is injured.  They all played not good enough(for LeBron) because of both Walton and because they were so young."
Tbh I'd be happy with Larry Nance Jr.
"They don’t watch our games and they don’t know what’s going on.  Just don’t automatically try to clown us if you’re not actually paying attention, that’s all.  You’re gonna miss things  Ex. Larry Nance Jr is made a big jump this year while he was healthy but I don’t think people noticed at all!  When the Cavs had all sorts of really positive defensive metrics at the beginning of the season that was on him"
"Kevin wins for sure, they have McHale too.  John: Stockton Havlicek Starks  James: Harden Worthy  Michael: Jordan Porter Redd Finley Cooper  Larry: Bird Hughes Johnson Nance Nance jr"
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

"Pascal Siakam, Jonathan Isaac or Larry Nance Jr."
"Lmfao no, it’s because you don’t know shit about the Lakers and just hate from a distance. They literally drafted Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball in consecutive years.   They weren’t a dumpster fire because they missed out on overpaying Aldridge or Melo. They were young. They built a war chest of assets and cashed in on them to win a damn championship. If they were a dumpster fire they’d waste all their high picks like Sacramento, Minnesota, Orlando, etc. They attract stars because players know the organization treats players amazingly and will move heaven and earth to field a championship contender. Dumpster fire lmfao you sound like those morons who “protested” outside the Staples Center 😂"
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I’ll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Jordan Clarkson -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -traded for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Excellent drafting. How could anyone question your asset acquisition skills.
It's why the FO really tried to grab Larry Nance Jr.   Guy is such a nice vocal defensive leader and those type of guys are hard to find.
"Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -dumped for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Talen Horton Tucker  Jesus, Midas touch over here."
"It wasn't for tanking purposes, and I always found it amusing when people thought the Lakers were sitting Deng and Mozgov to tank, like those guys were helping the Lakers win too many games or something 😂  The truth was that the Lakers signed Deng cause they needed a small forward (rookie Brandon Ingram was the only other 3 on the roster), but the Lakers failed to realize that Deng was no longer quick enough to play SF, nor was he a good enough shooter to do so in the new pace and space NBA. Deng was exclusively a small ball 4, but the Lakers already had two good, young 4s in Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr, so there weren't any minutes for Deng there. The Lakers sat Deng cause they were losing anyway, cause him at SF was a disaster, and because they wanted to give Ingram more minutes in the second half of the year.   Then the following year the Lakers added Kyle Kuzma, who was looking very impressive for a rookie, and he just pushed Deng further down the rotation, and effectively out of it. The Lakers had Ingram, Kuzma, Randle and Nance at forward, so all they could do with Deng was offer him garbage time minutes, which would have been insulting for a vet, so instead they agreed he just wouldn't dress at all. But supposedly he stayed ready in case there were injuries.   He did that for a full year and then the Lakers bought him out and stretched him. If they'd bought him out a year earlier his remaining $35 million would have been stretched over 7 seasons, so by waiting that year, instead it was only $15 million stretched over 3 years ($5 million per year)."
"Yet he is still a big enough shooting threat that defenders will drift out to the arc to cover him.   Larry Nance Jr was averaging 36% from 3 and I can promise you he wasn’t drawing guys out the way Love does.   I’m curious, how many Cavs games have you watched this year?"
"It’s not about replacing the production, it’s about replacing the spacing.   His shooting hasn’t been good but I can promise you he still creates space and defenders still respect his shooting ability. Larry Nance Jr is shooting 36% and I promise you defenders aren’t drifting out to cover him the way we do with Love."
"Randle, Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, THT (the latter thee all being second rounders).  The scouting has been good."
Larry Nance Jr is the most impressive out of their draft picks tbh. Such a good player
"Barring a direction change based on the new ownership, the team seems to be barreling forward with KAT + Russell as their foundation of the future. That is in part why they took Ant Man #1 over LaMelo--too much overlap between LaMelo and Russell.   With that in mind, the top picks in this draft mostly seem to present the same issue once you add Ant Man to the mix.   With all that said, wouldn't it behoove the Wolves to look at trading back to add some more immediate punch to their team? There's going to be a rebuilding team or two that desperately needs some foundational talent and is going to get unlucky in the lottery, if the Wolves could trade back to 5th-8th they could nab someone like Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, or Corey Kispert that would pair great with the core they already have.  Here's three potential deals I could see  A package involving Al Horford + #5  Larry Nance Jr. + #6  Marvin Bagley  + #7  These all help the Wolves get more veteran help to be more competitive in the next year (when they'll owe their pick unprotected) while still drafting a high level talent that better compliments the core they already have invested in."
Really makes me wish the Jazz had made a push for Larry Nance Jr.
I miss watching Larry nance jr and julius randle outhustle everyone on the floor together while they were on the lakers
LOL you know who Klays dad is? Y’all can’t claim him because he’s white passing LOL. His dad is literally darker than me! You want Larry Nance Jr too? Lmfao
Ik Ben was short but come on. The man was a 4 time dpoy at like 6'9. Larry Nance Jr. is alright at defense but Ben was dominant on the defensive side
"With an elite coach and development? Probably a top four seed, maybe make a run to the conference finals. Legitimately their only path to a championship is through defense. If you could turn Larry Nance Jr. into Ben Wallace 2.0 (though trade 5-10% defense for being able to catch on offense) maybe you could recreate those early 2000s Pistons teams."
"Sure the money is good, but there are huge differences between teams. Differences in coaching/staff/management/ideas/mindset/medical staff/media exposure/...   Easiest example is Larry Nance Jr. I'm positive he would have loved and stayed in LA.   With the Lakers all you saw were his amazing high flying dunks. I don't see those anymore. Either he stopped doing them or no one watches the Cavs."
"Larry Nance Jr., SexLand is a fun duo but LNJ was leading the league in steals, anchored both our offense and defense, and was a glue guy. He did everything we hoped for and more. (KLove is our best player)"
"Jae Crowder (yes he was traded but he was on that team), Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance jr, JR Smith &amp; Tristan Thompson as support around a consistent 3rd option scoring 16-18ppg (there is max 3 teams in the league right now that could say no to such a 3rd option...) in Kevin Love, and THEN you have Kyrie and Lebron. Really don't believe i'm overhyping them, it's just not true Lebron was alone against the world."
Larry Nance Jr
Larry nance Jr on KD? that was like the highlight of Nance's career lmao
U gonna diss Larry nance jr like that?
"Oh no, that 2015-16 roster was just.... ugh  Kobe  Roy Hibbert  Brandon Bass  Lou Williams  Nick Young  D-Lo  Jordan Clarkson  Julius Randle  Larry Nance Jr  Anthony Brown  Tarik Black (one of my favorite Lakers during the down years)  Marcelo Huertas (the fucking GOAT)  Robert Sacre (the other fucking GOAT)  That's 13 out of 15 I can remember. I'm too lazy to check but I think Metta World Peace was also on it or maybe I'm thinking of 2016-17"
D'Angelo Russell   Jordan Clarkson   Kobe bryant   Luol deng   Roy Hibbert   Larry Nance JR   Tarik Black   Timofey Mozgov   Nick Young   Thomas Bryant   Julius Randle   I know I'm missing like 2-3 guys for sure
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I’m not giving you names of point guards to add. I don’t want to invest in point guard. I don’t want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that’s something I’m interested in adding… Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
Oh yeah I forgot him when listing players I'd rather have.  Hell even larry nance jr might have turned into something with more time with LeBron
He played against both Larry Nance Jr and Ivica Zubac.
And Larry Nance Jr.'s son Ivica Zubac
Yeah maybe they go for some lower caliber defensive guys like Barnes or Larry Nance Jr.
Larry Nance Jr.
"I don’t think he’ll leave. I was curious where he *could* go though, cause I hate the Lakers (not a LeBron fan either tbh) and it’d be funny.  -	Mav’s would be the best option, they’ve got cap space, a good coach, shooters, and a young star. He runs the risk of being called a snake since the Mav’s beat his old Miami team.  -	Miami has cap space too, and he could frame it as a “returning to his roots” kinda situation. I’m not sure how much better their roster is than the Lakers though.  -	Knicks have max cap space and need a playmaker. NY would also be good for his advertisement and investment potential -	Portland might be the best option legacy wise. They’ve never won a title and even non Blazer fans want Dame to win one. Dame would also be the perfect compliment to current LeBron.  -	The Cavs wouldn’t be the worst option in the world. They’ve got a bad record, so it wouldn’t look like he was just aiming for a “hardest road” situation. Despite this, the team is reasonably built to be a good fit for LeBron. SexLand can definitely make shots at the very least, and Larry Nance Jr and Jarrett Allen are good defenders. They’d need to dump salary though either by packaging Love with good draft picks or trading a combination of Taurean Prince, Larry Nance Jr, and Cedi Osman.  -	The Pelicans would be a hilarious option, and might be my favorite option. They’ve got two young start already in Zion and Ingram, and could potential keep Lonzo too. They’ve also got a ton of picks to facilitate trades and clear cap with.  -	The Raptors would be an out of left field option. LeBron may view it as a good way to boost his international brand.   How I’d rank them:  1.	Of all these options, the Mav’s seem like the clear cut winner. They’d probably need to find a way to dump Porzingis though, so that they can re-sign Hardaway Jr and have room for LeBron, but that seems do-able.  2.	The biggest knock on Portland is I don’t know enough about their Cap Space situation to know if they could manage to sign him. I’d imagine that it wouldn’t cost a ton to find a way to offload CJ’s cap space though. Dame would be the best possible fit next to old LeBron of almost anyone in the league though. It’d also look the best for his legacy since the Blazers have never won and Dame is universally liked. The other big negative is their porous defense.   3.	The Knicks wouldn’t necessarily be a good fit if he wants a guaranteed ring. However, it would look decent for his legacy. The team would be decent around LeBron if they could re-sign Rose too. Rose, Barrett, LeBron, Randle, Robinson is a decent lineup especial when you figure they’ve got all they’re picks available to find other pieces.  4.	The Pelicans would be hilarious but could turn really deadly, really quickly. Especially since the Lakers picks the Pelicans own become prized trade capital id LeBron just decides up up and walk. Ingram plus lotto picks could probably net them Beal or LaVine which couldproduce a Lonzo, Beal/LaVine, LeBron, Zion, Hayes lineup which could be very deadly."
"BI improved every year with the lakers and kept that up with NO.  Randle hasnt been on the Lakers in years but he just got really good this year.  Clarkson was good with the Lakers too but he's just gotten better as he gets older (as most players do).  Zubac's numbers have literally been the same his whole career.  D-Lo was good for a rookie but they traded him because of that BS with Nick Young, they only had him for 2 seasons.  Larry Nance Jr has improved but its not like he's anything special."
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"Zach Collins, Larry Nance Jr. and Paul Millsap are considered ""major splash"" ?"
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  &gt; Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  &gt; As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)  \- Dwayne Wade     \- Channing Frye     \- Isaiah Thomas     \- Jae Crowder     \- Derrick Rose     \- Iman Shmpert     \- Dimitrios Agravanis       \+ Jordan Clarkson     \+ Larry Nance Jr.     \+ George Hill     \+ Rodney Hood     \+ Artūras Gudaitis      It was a weird season."
"So I don’t know what Celtics games you’re watching, because we do those things every game. Per game, the Celtics are fourth in the league for charges drawn this year, tied with the Jazz for fourth in offensive rebounds, tied with the Lakers/Pacers/Heat for eighth most loose balls recovered per game, and tied with the Lakers for eleventh in deflections.   Our deflections/rebounding/loose balls recovered were actually all below our season averages today. The only guys who drew a charge were Smart and Kemba. Part of the reasons our numbers aren’t higher is that they’ve played 48 and 43 games respectively.   Kemba’s tied for most charges drawn in the league. He’s also number one in charges drawn per game if you don’t count Haslem who played only one game. Smart is tenth (not counting three guys who played under five games) and is also seventh in deflections per game behind FVV, Covington, McConnell, Butler, Simmons, and Larry Nance Jr."
"So the supporting cast severely underachieved in the playoffs. Guys like TT, Jr Smith (lol), George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Kyle Korver, and Larry Nance were/are all super solid. They all were good supporting cast players at that point in their careers and some even after that season."
"Larry Nance Jr, Jasean Tate for the future."
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron’s effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie’s exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron’s people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA’s other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn’t pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
I don’t think there are any league-wide rules about this. The team can decide. People get permission all the time too. For example Larry Nance Jr is using his dads number 22 right now.
Larry Nance Jr. and another backup PF.
"Ive been following the lakers since the druss, randle, larry nance jr days 🤡 but nice try  I cant watch games regularly because im not from the US"
"Personally? Resign Smart and Fournier, trade TT, use the rest of the Hayward TPE on Larry Nance Jr, sign TJ McConnell on the taxpayer MLE. I'm comfortable starting Smart at the 1 for this season, the numbers on it are solid enough that I think it's worth exploring more in depth, but we need rotational pieces at the 1 and 4 more than anything. That leaves us with a twelve-man of:  PG: Smart/McConnell/Pritchard  SG: Jaylen/Langford  SF: Fournier/Nesmith  PF: Tatum/Nance  C: Horford/Williams/Brown  I think Fournier starts over Nance for spacing purposes, but there's a ton of lineup flexibility here, and there's opportunity for all of Pritchard/Nesmith/Langford to get regular minutes while not relying on them to do too much. Are we a championship-caliber team? I dunno, probably not unless someone takes another leap, but we're a solid playoff team with upside and flexibility going forward. Not to mention actual depth for the first time since 2019."
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
PG- Steph Curry SG- CJ McCollum SF- LeBron PF- Luke Kennard C- Larry Nance Jr
"more upside than LNJ? A defensive 4 who's improving his 3pt shot currently at 36% on over 3 a game, and averaged 1.7 steals a game which would put him in at top 5 in NBA if he was healthy?  A guy who looked like a potential All NBA defensive player?  More upside than that? Hell nah. Dean Wade? tempting but not Larry Nance Jr."
"Any veteran bench player at mininum wage would be much better than shitty Cedi Osman and Damyean Dotson, and Delly will be missed for what he did for the Cavs when they contended but same time good riddance, cause he looks completely washed and his offensive game is completely nonexistant except passing.  The only good bench players on my team were suffering mad injuries like Larry Nance Jr who had a great defensive year, and Tarean Prince off the Allen trade was like the only productive bench player, and Wade before becoming a rotational piece was a G-league player filling in garbage minutes.  So 24M of Cav's cash for the bench suffering injuries and 11M cash on guys shitting the bed. And haven't even added in Windler who again suffered injuries and only played 31 games out of the total 137 games in his first two season. Add another 2M invested for another injured bench players.  So what's more of a waste. A Sexton max or an inconsistent bench currently wasting 35-37M on their cap."
"We already have that in Larry Nance Jr and Dean Wade who shoots 3s well and respectable defender and rebounder.  Trading a 24 point efficient scorer for another PF while we have decent power forwards behind an injury prone ass Kevin Love and soon, possibly Evan Mobley since Rockets are favored to get Green, is just dumb way to trade away good production."
"What is the meaning of ""Making teammates better""? The fact that Garland gets assists?  The Cavs' bench was awful. 2nd worst scoring, worst 3pt shooting in both percentage and made per game.  With the injuries that had put them into a pretty much tanking season, and the fact that with poor spacing, Sexton still gets an efficient 24 PPG while also being 12th in NBA in FTAs/game has to say something about his offensive bag and how poorly the FO is building the roster.  Sexton showed even flashes of playmaking when there was no Garland, no Delly, no Hart, no Larry Nance jr that are good passers.  He averaged 6 assists a game in month of may with only reliable 3pt shooting threat being a washed Kevin Love and Dean Wade who was a G-leaguer developed into a solid rotational piece.  It's gonna come down to how Altman will get talent around the Sexland duo and how JB Bickerstaff can take the next step to improving this team with the 3rd overall pick to get them to even more wins."
I don't think they accept any of our offers. I want Larry Nance Jr. since he's the realistic choice.
If I guess who the other players we are inquiring about it would be Myles Turner and Larry Nance Jr.
"This is a fascinating version of history.      The Cavs lost the last 8 games in which Drummond started. He sat for one game in between and they won that one. They were 9-16 when he played, so .360.       A bigger part of the Cavs early success was Larry Nance Jr… the Cavs were 8-11 when he played before his first extended absence. When he came back he wasn’t the same, and then Kevin Love came back into the mix and the Cavs were 5-18 in games he played."
"Nerlens Noel or Larry Nance Jr would be great. Simmons at the 4 would also be a great fit and would most likely have to be a 3 team deal in which the Sixers get Lowry, the Raptors get Rubio, Beasley and some picks and the Wolves get Simmons. There would probably have to be some more picks and fillers to make it work, but I think everyone benefits from this trade."
&gt;What moves would you make to make the Wolves competitive again?  Well you have to ride with this group because I don't see any good vets signing with the Wolves this year (if we make the playoffs next year I can see some of them buying in).   What moves I would make? Try to get Larry Nance Jr. or JaMychal Green since they are the only realistic targets.
"I know this isn’t an award that you typically argue who deserves more, but I have to say the stuff that Larry Nance Jr did for NE-Ohio was incredible and is award deserving."
"How the hell nobody mention JR Smith, Dwight Howard, Jason Richardson, Shannon Brown, Larry Nance JR etc lmaooo. Y'all just naming star players bro. Shit man. Do y'all homework!!"
"It's just really hard to tell.  I think if you got 2021 versions of everyone, that could actually work really well together.    As an aside, if this theoretical team actually stuck together, I also wonder if Clarkson would start, and D'Lo would be 6th man, since Clarkson plays better off ball.  And D'Lo-Caruso works better as a 2nd unit.  Also OP forgot Larry Nance Jr., who would still be with the Lakers potentially in this scenario (since he still listed Clarkson, and that was the same trade), and might start over Zubac if you want a 5-out offense.  That's a pretty good team with really solid depth, though they're still in the west with all that other superstar talent, so maybe you're right at 7th seed.    But I don't buy the development of all those pieces if they stay with the Lakers.  A lot them needed the various trades and new teams/coaches to get pushed to develop."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"
Seems like Green's stock has risen to be the #2 guy at the very least.  I don't know how to feel about the fit of Mobley and Wood on the Rockets - both strike me as guys that don't have enough bulk to protect the rim.  I'm also not sold on Mobley's fit on the Cavs either; Love is deadweight obviously but they're probably going to extend Allen and Larry Nance Jr is a super solid stretch 4.   Would the Cavs trade Sexton and #3 for #2? I guess that would depend on Houston not being super high on Green and if they have faith in Kevin Porter Jr being their big point guard of the future.
"In NBA circles they call this the Timofey, some refer to it as the JR Smith, while others call it the Larry Nance."
I want the Blazers to trade for him or Larry Nance Jr.
"This is the way, although I might target Larry Nance Jr or Rudy Gay rather than Delon Wright. I think our need's bigger at 4 than 1."
&gt;Is there not a cheaper option though? I just feel like Philly would ask so much for a guy who's been a proven liability in the playoffs.   Larry Nance Jr I guess.
"No one thought Larry Nance Jr. and Rodney Hood were going to be able to help LeBron bring Cleveland to another championship. Some folks didn’t even think they would make it out of the first round. Just stop, I know our Sonics drafted Durant but let it go bro."
"You obviously watch 0 cavs basketball  Darius Garland is better than you realize same with Larry Nance Jr  Do not want KP, even if it's a swap for Love (longer contract)"
"Well, shit. I guess I just became a Larry Nance Jr. fan."
"I think the team would get huge backlash if they got rid of him.  It's incredibly rare for a player to want to vocally want to be here, and being from the area is a big deal here.  I can't find the exact quote (it might have been during an in-game interview or something) but Altman said something around the deadline along the lines of ""If I traded Larry Nance Jr, I might as well trade myself as well because I wouldn't be allowed back in Cleveland"""
"He has a relatively team-friendly contract ([since it descends](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/larry-nance-jr-17855/)) and he's relatively old compared to the Cavs' young core (since he played 4 years in college), so he might end up getting traded within the next two years. Basically, he doesn't really fit the Cavs' rebuilding timeline.   If he does get traded, I could see him being a solid bench piece on a team trying to contend. He's obviously a very different player type than Jordan Clarkson, but I think that type of impact is possible. I could imagine Nance as a the 1st/2nd player off the bench for a team trying to win a title."

Larry Nance Jr: He dunk like Shawn Kemp but without the flair
"Larry Bird, Larry Johnson, Larry Krystkowiak, Larry Nance Jr not Sr., Larry Olowakandi"
"you’re taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton’s age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn’t do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn’t do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than Sexton😂 he’s passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you’re talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton’s entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
…yet he ranked 33rd for player efficiency this last season (which does factor assists and rebounds) . …between PJ Washington and Larry Nance Jr….at $25 mil a year.
"We will not trade Larry Nance Jr for any reason unless there was some sort of superstar in the mix and genuinely believe that. I hyped up Cedi for long enough though, he continues to fail to make jumps in his game year to year.."
"I dunno about that. If Garland stays healthy he could be an All-Star, and Sexton keeps hitting buckets and Okoro keeps building off his momentum from last year, then the Cavs got a pretty stacked team with Mobley and Allen up front. Larry Nance Jr and Rubio off the bench too. Bottom tier teams in the east can easily shuffle around this season, including us if we don't play harder."
Oh agreed their. That's why I hope we get a Thad Young or a Larry Nance Jr. We need another good rebounder for specific matchups of AD and Giannis and minimise their impact from say 50 points to 35-40 points
"No idea, I think it probably really depends on how this year plays out. I think this roster on paper is good enough for the play-in in the East, but we have a serious problem with the injury gods and we're absolutely going to either lose in the play-in or get swept in the first round, since the only players off the top of my head) who have playoff experience on our roster are Kevin Love (lol) and Larry Nance Jr.   There will be a point where we will have to deal one of our young guys though, not enough minutes to go around and you cannot succeed in the NBA with a big pile of 19-22 year olds. No idea who we could bundle picks with to get a franchise star, but I would be astonished if we kept all of our prospects two years from now."
"If the Suns get Larry Nance Jr and he stays healthy, they'd have the most balanced (non-super) team in the league"
"Jordan Clarkson, Julius randle, Larry Nance Jr, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, d’Angelo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have all turned out decent to amazing. You’re just talking out of your ass 😂"
"The Lakers problem was in not recognizing that Deng could only play the 4 when they signed him, because they gave him that huge contract to play small forward instead. Back then the Lakers had Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr at the 4, but only had just-drafted Brandon Ingram at the 3, so they signed Deng to be the starter there.   But Deng was not a good enough shooter, nor was he quick enough defensively on the perimeter to play SF anymore, so the Lakers ended up just wasting all that money. If Deng wasn't on such a gigantic contract they easily could have traded him to a team looking for a small ball 4, but nobody wanted him at $18 million per year, and the Lakers didn't want to just bench one of their promising young PFs, so Deng ended up getting squeezed.   So it wasn't that Deng couldn't play, it's just that the Lakers wildly overpaid him when they had no minutes available at the position he played."
"Not all that strange. Off the top of my head, Aaron Gordon and Larry Nance Jr have similar set up deals"
I’m cheating a bit and using Canton/Akron but our starting 5 is pretty strong.  Steph Curry CJ McCollum Larry Nance Jr Lebron James Nate Thurmond
"Norman Powell, Richaun Holmes, kevon Looney when he isn't injured, Larry Nance Jr,   Yeah the draft not only has several.multi time all stars but a lot of high quality starting level players too."

Throwing lobs to Larry Nance Jr
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
I’m hoping we can get Larry Nance Jr. Cavs should just focus on developing their young guys
"Larry ""Skywalker"" Nance Sr. and Jr. are both pretty nice  Mychal Thompson and Klay Thompson vs. the Curries in a shootout?  Rick Barry and all 3 Barry boys (Bones was probably the best)   Henry and Mike Bibby, though I think they still hate each other  Mike Dunleavy Sr. and Jr. would somehow finesse you out of every penny  Doc Rivers and Austin Rivers would probably call bullshit fouls  Fun fact: Melvin Booker and Devin Booker BOTH played against Kevin Garnett and Kobe. Imagine your pops giving you tips on guarding Kobe."
He’s really close with Larry Nance Jr
Considering he came from Cleveland we can pretty much write off trading him back to Cleveland for Larry Nance Jr.
"Remember when the crowd would chant ""LARRY!"" whenever Larry Nance Jr. did something spectacular? Shit was fun"
"According to Larry Nance Jr, those sources are fake lol"
Larry Nance Jr. I fucking love you.
Larry Nance Jr is overrated why is there news about him
&gt; according to multiple sources.  Larry Nance Jr: 🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
Based Larry nance jr
"Per sources:  Larry Nance Jr hates his fans, especially when they're children."
There’s no rumors about Larry Nance Jr.
Larry Nance Jr. woke up and chose violence.
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here.

"""hardest thing in the world is to say no to a kid asking you to ssign something""  Larry nance jr: say less"
"The Cavs are unlikely to trade for Siakam.  We have a logjam of bigs, specifically power forwards (Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love, &amp; Dean Wade).  If anything, a sign &amp; trade for Garry Trent Jr. could be on the cards.  He's a tad undersized for the 3, but, like I said, we're in dire need of wings.  Garland-Sexton-Okoro-Mobley-Hartenstein, with Rubio, Trent Jr., &amp; Nance Jr. off the bench to round out an 8-man rotation could compete for the play-in tournament.  Not lofty goals by any means, but realistic for the current iteration of the team."
Larry nance jr. has done a TON to bring awareness to struggling businesses during the pandemic and help them financially so maybe keep that in mind when judging him so harshly
"And besides it’s just Larry Nance Jr, it’s not like the kid was going to die for his autograph"
"There's a lot of negativity in this thread.  Larry Nance once did something really nice for me.  It was the final game of the 16-17 season, and the Lakers were playing the warriors in Oakland.  I live up in the Bay now and make a point of seeing the Lakers whenever they come by.  But this was a little extra special for me because it was probably Metta World Peace's last NBA game.  He is one of my favorite Lakers and I ran down to the Visitors bus in my Ron Artest Jersey hoping I could get him to sign it.  Metta had a disappointing last game and when he came out of the tunnel he had his head down and wasn't paying attention to the crowd.  Larry Nance Jr. was right next to him and saw me in the Artest jersey and right before Metta got on the buss he tapped him on the shoulder and pointed me out.  Metta came over shook my hand and signed my jersey and made me more excited than I had been in a long time.  Wouldn't have happened if Nance hadn't noticed me."
lmao you talk as if Larry fucking Nance is Kobe or LeBron.  It's Larry Fucking Nance.. Jr..
"I don't know what's worse, armchair psychologists or white knights for millionaires playing a game for a living. Also this is Larry fkn Nance Jr., not Michael Jordan, you think he's getting swarmed everywhere he goes? Half his own city would need to break out google just to recognize him if they saw him."
"Ok? Has Larry Nance Jr. been hypocritically complaining that his earning power has dropped ever since he stopped signing autographs fans apparently deserve just because they spotted an athlete walking outside?  It's nice to do something for someone, like sign a basketball. It's entitled to expect them to do it."
"Larry Nance Jr. has been doing a lot for Clevelanders during the pandemic, above and beyond what you'd usually see any player do for a city.

Dude you don’t know shit about Larry nance jr if you think he doesn’t give back to the community. He started sponsoring a local business every home game last season
Lebron gave Larry Nance Jr. anxiety
Anyone who’s had Larry Nance Jr. on their team knows he’s not this dude.
"I’d love a Larry Nance Jr, if anyone is handing him out"
have you seen the video where they edited larry nance jr so that he turns into patrick star while dunking 😭😭😭straight violated the man
"I know it's a popular refrain, but who exactly does LeBron make better? Here are a few examples,   George Hill was traded to the Cavs as part of a last ditch attempt to recalibrate a dysfunctional Cavs team. The movement in his efficiency was as follows: -2.5/-10 FG/3PT% and this was on effectively the same FGA/3PTA  Kyle Kuzma effectively peaked efficiency wise in his rookie year, when LeBron wasn't even on the team, and proceeded to get worse the following years.  Starting: 45/36.6 FG/3PT% and averaging: -1/-4 FG/3PT%. This is in spite of Kuzma being a 2nd year player when LeBron joined his team - you'd expect him to get better not worse.   Rodney hood: +2.5/-3.7 FG/3PT%. Worth noting also that his offensive production dipped significantly, by over 6 points, with that in mind it appears to be a decline to me.   These are a few examples and I could go on, but Lebron's teammates almost always declined relative to expectations when playing next to him as noted here by ESPN   (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better)   My view: LeBron plays a very unique style of basketball where he has to have the ball in his hands the entire time and dump the ball off to his teammates when **he** seems necessary.  Consequently, playing with LeBron is tough because it involves a lot of ball watching. Players get cold playing with him and thus do not benefit much from the catch &amp; shoot 3s that he generates as they can't catch a rhythm.   The players that DO benefit from this are players who don't need the ball to be effective. That is why players like JR and Larry Nance played much better than expected with LeBron, because their game just requires they get an open look or an alley oop.  This is why Westbrook likely won't work with LeBron. Neither know how to play off ball, and Westbrook is a horrific catch and shoot player, so he doesn't benefit from what LeBron does best."
just like Larry Nance Jr
"Even with Ross and Delon, they were packaged for Ibaka and Gasol which led to the chip.  The only player drafted after Ross within reason you can argue for is Drummond and with JV already on the roster (and JV being better than Drummond) it was the right pick. The ten picks after Drummond were Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, Mo Harkless, Royce White, Tyler Zeller, Terrence Jones and Andrew Nicholson. Getting Ross is a W for Masai and the Raptors.  With Delon, he was drafted 20th so getting someone who was a first guard off the bench player is a good return on that. The players drafted after him in the first round were Justin Anderson, Bobby Portis, Rondae, Tyus Jones,  Jarrell Martin, Nikola Milutinov, Larry Nance Jr, RJ Hunter, Chris McCullough and Kevon Looney. Other than Looney, Delon is good return based on the picks after, I don't consider this a miss.  Bruno was a miss no doubt though. But hey, we got the Raptors 905 built up because of him so in the grand scheme of things it worked out lol  So yeah, **basically** (key word basically) all our picks have hit. Other than Bruno we haven't missed a pick."
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."

WHEN will you people learn Larry Nance Jr. Is not on the table
"People on the internet are dumb. Even with his flaws, Ben is still a 3x All-Star, 3x All-Defense, possibly the best permitter defender in the league, and only 25 years old on a long term contract. They aren’t trading him for Larry Nance JR and a 2nd round pick LOL."
"If the wolves move off beasley (who has shown he can be a good scorer and is on a team friendly contract), I imagine they will likely move more towards a glue guy/defensive player with shooting like Larry Nance Jr, JaMychal Green, maybe Daniel Theis. you can get what Harrell and Kuz give you (ok scoring, poor defense) from alot of places."
"Uh we have. In multiple sports too. Players like Larry Nance Jr, for a recent example."
"Why is Larry Nance Jr all of the sudden available?  Hes from Cleveland, is on a very team friendly contract, great locker room guy, has improved a ton since he got here...  The only negative really is he is a little injury prone, but I'm not sure Malik Beasley and filler is enough or not."
"Okay fine: you got Larry Nance Jr, Taurean Prince, Cedi Osman and a protected future first."
"I want the Pacers to flip 13 for 19+21, then flip one of the Knicks picks with Lamb for Larry Nance Jr if he’s actually available."
I’ll take Larry Nance Jr off your hands good sir
junior swap:  POR receives Larry Nance Jr.  CLE receives Derrick Jones Jr.  jones is a little cheaper right now and will be off the books after this upcoming year to clear some space for cleveland. jones also is still pretty young at age 24 and may fit better with cleveland's timeline.
"The expectations really aren't the problem, it's the fact that his role constantly keeps changing:  * His rookie year the Lakers had Brook Lopez, Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr, and Brandon Ingram in the front court, so they asked Kuzma to fill in mostly as a backup 3, with a little 4.  * His second year they only had Javale at center, no longer had Randle or Nance and now had LeBron to go with Ingram, so Kuzma was asked to mostly play 4 with some backup 5.  * His third year the Lakers had Dwight and Javale at center, AD at center and PF and LeBron at SF, so Kuzma was in a vastly reduced role trying to fill in wherever he could, even sometimes at 2.  * It would have been more of the same this year, just with Gasol, Drummond and Trez at center, but LeBron and AD were hurt, and the Lakers had Markieff Morris and Wesley Matthews as well, so Kuzma's role again was all over the place.  I think if Kuzma was on a team where he could play more consistent 3/4 minutes (where he wasn't backing up All NBA guys at those positions), then he'd really blossom. I honestly don't think the spotlight or expectations bother him, I just think it has to be tough to know what the team needs him to do when whatever that role is is constantly changing."
"&gt;Nance is another player who was making his way into a solid role player until injuries. Lakers seemed to have a hardon for guys with medical issues.  What the hell? Adam Morrison wasn't drafted by the Lakers, he just wound up as a bench warmer with them on two title teams after it was clear he was a bust. And Larry Nance Jr. was a phenomenal pick at #27, a guy who has had a great career for someone taken that late. The guy they drafted that year who has had a rash of medical issues throughout his career is D'Angelo Russell. I wonder what ever happened to that dude?"

"My favorite thing is the assumption that good players on bad teams aren’t actually worth anything so please take this bad trade for them!  “Can you imagine how good Collin Sexton would be next to x player?  Larry Nance Jr would be awesome on our team, we should try to trade garbage for him."
"Oh man, I can name a few from the 2013-2019 dark years:  - Larry Nance Jr. making his own basket against the Clippers on Christmas 2015  - Robert Sacre inbounding it to fucking Jae Crowder and then fouling him as he makes the layup in a game in Dallas.  - D'Angelo Russell with that blunder on the fastbreak with Jordan Clarkson. Kobe then rolls his eyes afterwards lmao.  - Marcelo Huertas (the GOAT) and his backwards shot against the Heat.  - Jeremy Lin not fouling Mike Conley in crunch time while Kobe is yelling at him to foul so Kobe has to run up and do it himself.  - Lonzo passing up a wide open layup he could have got on the fastbreak and instead tries to pass it back to Javale McGee (who was behind him) but turns it over instead.  - LeBron not dribbling the ball to start the clock against the Nuggets and instead the ball just rolls out of bounds."

"I think every one of his peers know that he's an elite defender. You can listen to the Lowe Post when he invited Larry Nance Jr to talk after game 6. No one wants Jrue even if you're in the post with a height advantage.   The issue is with the media. Since they don't watch ALL games, they use metrics to determine the impact a player has on defense, be it advanced analytics or box score numbers like steals and blocks. Jrue has been a good defender, but playing in New Orleans with a couple of bad defenders like Zion, Ingram or Redick doesn't help your numbers. Which is why he didn't make All-defense last season."
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
"He is currently my favorite player in the entire league.

"That's a fair point, but I just feel with Jaren Jackson coming back that might be enough for y'all to get a pretty cozy 8th seed spot. Also Desmond Bane was getting busy in summer league so I think he's another plus for the Grizzlies along with Dillon Brooks.  I am high on Dame time, however judging from the Trailblazers off season moves...or lack thereof, I don't think they're that high on Dame time anymore. Dame and McCollum will give us what they normally do (until McCollum gets injured again), Norman Powell is good too. I also like that they added a bit more depth at the PF/C position in Larry Nance Jr and Cody Zeller since that seems to be where there injuries always tend to happen. However I feel like the Western Conference teams that are worth a damn made worthwhile moves/improvements while the Trailblazers kinda just put on a band-aid on a boo-boo that's getting infected now.  Spurs I completely forgot about them trading Derozan so yeah lemme get them outta there lmao"
Larry Nance Jr.
"Larry Nance Jr, or Jusuf Nurkic before he got injured in 2019."
"Monte Morris, Josh Hart, Otto Porter Jr, Larry Nance, Robin Lopez"
"It's also amazing to see how he makes those players look good when they were literally trash after he left. Half of that squad is out of the league and the other half is playing on minimum contracts or close to it, except for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr."
I'm a Pat fan but no it's Larry Nance Jr
Where would u place Larry Nance and Larry Nance JR?
"Melvin and devin Booker, Gary trent and Gary trent Jr, Larry Nance and Larry Nance Jr, Stan and Kevin love, Mitchell and Andrew Wiggins, doc and Austin rivers, Wes and Wesley matthews, Gary Payton and Gary Payton II, Terry and Ed Davis, there are way more"
"No, Portland probably won’t do this. Olshey has shown time and time again that he is willing to stick to his plan. He now has (probably) one more year with Dame with a new coach and the seismic move of adding Larry Nance jr to hang his hat on. Olshey has been allergic to big trades. SHOULD Portland do this? Absolutely. Simmons would change the look of our team, which is sorely needed. What we have been doing isn’t working, and we’re going to lose Dame anyway real quick here. And Simmons is likely the best player available for a trade right now. It probably doesn’t get us to the promised land, but we gotta do something."
"Yeah he'd be ideal.   It's the same reason we kept getting linked to Kyle Anderson, Larry Nance Jr. and to an extent Harrison Barnes.   A 2-way wing with some size and shooting is exactly what we're after.   Grant would be the best of the bunch though."
As a blazers fan I can tell you right now that Portland is not fucking trading Larry nance Jr (a piece we sorely needed and just traded for ourselves) for coby white. Get that delusional shit out of here.
"[This trade was absolutely a collaboration. I had expressed my desire to win now to Koby and the front office if we could find a deal that helped everyone, and they certainly did that. Going to Portland is something that I am extremely excited about. This is a team that has seen the biggest stages and is hungry for more, and I’m thrilled that they believe I can help them climb higher. This opportunity is one that I’m very ready to take advantage of and I have the Cavs to thank for preparing me for it.](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/08/larry-nance-jr-cleveland-will-always-be-home-for-the-nances-its-in-our-blood.html)"
Clearly the Larry Nance Jr. trade was the catalyst that inspired Dame to stay.
"Is there something bad about gaining Larry Nance Jr, Cody Zeller, Snell, McClemore to the bench and getting rid of Kanter, Melo, Harry Giles, and Zach Collins (who wasn't going to play this year because he broke his ankle for the third time in a row)?  That's an obvious upgrade?   The starting lineup wasn't the problem last year and had a top 5 net rating in the league?  The bench was god awful and has been completely overhauled with players that aren't defense deficient?"
"&gt;As someone who's kept a close tab on potential Simmons trades, I imagine that the 76ers would kick and scream to get RoCo back.  Agreed.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Ben's a flawed player, but two things he provides are wing defense and playmaking. The fact that he's a single player that can do both of those things are special. So naturally if the 76ers are looking to compete they'd probably look for a package in which they can get 2 players who do those things.     Exactly! You'd want to fill that hole if you cause it to open up.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The thing is, if the Blazers looking to retool around Dame they're probably looking to compete as well. The Blazers paid TWO first round picks for Covington already and I think there'd be a huge hesitancy to give him up.     So, my line of logic here is that   1) Dame explicitly WANTS Simmons  2) He knows their backcourt needs change  3) He knows they need another ballhandler  4) He knows they desperately need some defensive life breathed into them to pair with Billups new schemes.  This is a scenario where the FO just have to please Dame at all costs. Similar to the Bulls going all in for Lavine. There simply isn't another player on the market who addresses the Blazers weaknesses like Simmons does. If it means giving RoCo and picks along with CJ up, they do it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Granted, this is a bit easier to swallow now that they also got Larry Nance Jr, but he's not a great floor-spacer either. He's shot around 35% on 3 attempts a game the past two seasons while also dealing with injury concerns. A frontcourt of him, Ben Simmons and Nurkic would be clogged.     If the Blazers run Dame off ball more, and emulate GSW, I think that could work. It'd force defenders to step up to the level of the screen instead of sagging way back. A player movement heavy offense as shown by GSW can make clogged frontcourts work.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;As far as Seth Curry goes, I agree with your idea that if they're able to swing him you go for it but I just don't see the fit that well. But I guess he could help contend in the now or they could flip him for another first to help replenish the draft capital.     The fit here would be to make up for the lost offense. Seth is a flamethrower and had his best career year. Out of everyone on the Sixers, he can give some life to their offense best."

"If we wanted Simmons, we wouldn't have traded Larry Nance Jr. for Markkanen. He would have been too important a part of any package to the win-now Sixers, for his salary as well as his value as a player."
"Coulda had Larry Nance Jr, but chose FRP instead.  Unpopular opinion, but i think Derozan was paid marquee money to be the marquee player after Lavine is traded.  Gotta sell season tickets first.  Is Derozan shooting 3s after Lavine collapses the defense? Or is Lavine ceding the #1 role to Derozan and waiting for kickouts?  I dont see either one working.    And even if they make it work, i still dont think they are better than atlanta, boston, philly, milwaukee, brooklyn, and will be challenged thoroughly by the knicks and perhaps charlotte and the wizards, not to mention indiana.  If Dame is unsatisfied with Portland, why would Lavine be content with Chicago? Especially after not extending him last year cost him millions.  Why change agents if youre just going to sign a max deal with the Bulls?  To Rich Paul no less.   And why wouldnt it have  happened this summer already?"
"They're just generic F positions. When you're playing multiple wings it's semantics who plays which position.  If he can start next to	Danilo Gallinari he can start next to Larry Nance Jr.  3 or 4 doesn't matter, it's just matchup dependent."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
They’ve been a first round exit 4 out of the last 5 years.  Getting Larry Nance Jr. is not the solution to that.
"One of those things they’ll give us more of- ball movement.    Nurkic is a [top 10 passing big](https://stathead.com/tiny/LovL4), while Larry Nance Jr. clocks in at 13th and Cody Zeller at 15th, if you consider that we’re transitioning from Melo and Kanter who were players who never met a shot they didn’t like, not only will our bench be significantly better defensively, but our ball movement leveled up significantly as well."
"Yeah, offensively Melo and Kanter bring a lot but defensively they might as well not have been there. Now we can bring Larry Nance Jr. and Zeller who can give us so much more."
Larry Nance Jr.   Oh wait..
I feel like in a few months it will be Larry Nance Jr. but for right now it's probably RoCo.
Portland's defense should already be better with Nurkic healthy and the addition of Larry Nance Jr. The Blazers have been an average to above average defensive team when Nurkic is healthy.
"Somewhere in the multiverse, y'all won a few championships with Oden and Roy  I'm a big Cleveland fan and am pulling for you this year (CJ Mcollum and Larry Nance Jr are huge Cle guys)"
Protections on 2022 1st in Larry Nance Jr trade extend to 2028 so we don’t have tradeable picks lol.
"The Blazers were first in both isolation and pick and roll, because Lillard is incredible at those two play types- the defense with all the starters in ninth in the league too, the offense was elite as one of the best in the league and the starters were fantastic, but the team cratered with bench units.    Sending out Kanter and Melo, and bringing in Larry Nance jr, Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, all will help with that bench defense.  We’re hoping Afernee Simons and Nassir Little can grow and step up there as well, which would be huge to see growth there as Simons turned into a quality shooter and Little impressed in limited minutes."

Ahh yes.  I forgot how import it was for fans to be “productive”. I forgot who the fans want fixate the trades.  Second I will guarantee that Dame leaves Portland before this time next year.  Your really banking on Larry Nance Jr to save the franchise and keep him. Come on homie. He gone. Your playing with borrowed time at this point.  Whether it’s Philly or not is a completely different story but like they say. He gone.
Larry Nance Jr but he just went to the Blazers.
"[Yeah, it was Larry Nance Jr.’s FT percentage.](https://youtu.be/HSdL7Ho4_Sk)"
The disrespect to Larry Nance Jr
"Some of those, but he does a lot of bad passes too. Like it's clearly a person who's pretty wide open, but it's also definitely not the person you want taking that shot. Like one year I noticed he passed a bunch to Larry Nance Jr (or someone similar I can't remember) for wide open 3s low shot clock. Just a bad move, but he made it with the intent to pass, so he had to pass."
"I remember watching an interview with Larry Nance Sr. and his wife while little Larry Nance Jr. and his sister played with toys on the floor in front of him. I vividly remember his wife at one paint saying ""Larry is a good husband ... I guess""."
I just learned Larry Nance Jr. is 29. I remember watching Larry Nance Sr in is hey day. This makes me feel old and sad.
1. JaKarr Sampson         2. Stephen Curry         3. Larry Nance Jr.
Is that the reason why klay and Larry nance jr hate each other? Lol
"Because everybody else was either on rookie contracts, near-expiring contracts, or was Larry Nance Jr. It’s not like Cleveland was paying anybody else."
Shoutout to Larry Nance Jr for balling out in Love's role and making Love look even more like an idiot for sitting on the bench last season.

yes now they can build around Larry Nance Jr and create a dynasty
"Bulls: Derrick Jones Jr., 2022 lottery-protected 1st round pick from Blazers, 2023 2nd round pick from Cavs(via Denver).

I don't what are the Cavs smoking though."
"How do you expect anyone to take your seriously when one of the three points you made is about Larry Nance Jr, who is not a Blazer?"
Does this mean Larry Nance Sr. gets his jersey re-retired? He only took it out the rafters so Jr. could wear the number
"As a Portlander, I'll take Larry Nance Jr without thinking twice. Well worth the cost"
"I agree, he lost me on this one. Larry Nance Jr did so much for the culture and the city and he’s a better basketball player than Lauri, this trade sucks"
"Larry Nance Jr doesn’t deserve this fate, wtf Koby"
"Larry Nance Jr  I think he’s an elite role player on a bad team. Versatile enough to play 3-5, does all the little things, can guard the perimeter, rebounds well, and our defense went to absolute shit when he got injured."
"Larry nance jr , Aaron Gordon, Blake griffin self explanatory"

Larry Nance Jr is so good
We watched Larry Nance Jr develope a serviceable 3pt shot before our very eyes in the years he was with us.
"I agree with everything you said, but hopefully he can figure it out. Bol Bol kind of reminds me of Julius Randle when he was with the Lakers (Randle obviously being much better). Randle has a me-first, superstar type game but wasn't yet good enough to earn that role and didn't have the type of game that translated into being a role player...while Larry Nance Jr was a stud role player who fit perfectly and so earned minutes over Randle despite being objectively a worse player. Randle eventually figured it out but Bol Bol has a much steeper hill to climb."
"Big Ja Morant fan too  Jerami Grant (prob my favorite)  De’Aaron Fox  Larry Nance Jr  SGA  John Collins  Kent Bazemore   Luka is fun, but I don’t actively root for him  Edit: formatting. Also, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for Tony Snell"
"Thats the problem tho, I love their youth and talent but they could use another defensive 4. Larry Nance Jr would be dope on this team."
[Larry Nance Jr should be catapulted into the sun!](https://i.imgur.com/8Cgg2vU.gifv)
J..C.... J Caruso... Jose Caruso? Noo... Jose Calderon? \**reads Larry Nance Jr*\* Oh! Jordan Clarkson.
"For the spurs:  Malcolm Brogdon - 2016  Kawhi Leonard - 2011  Jimmy Butler - 2011  Nikola Jokic - 2014  Last spot is between Derrick White, Norman Powell, and Larry Nance Jr. I'd say."
"i can see tacko fall being one in the future, as well as matisse thybule   right now… dwight powell, larry nance jr, also lance stephenson if he were still in the nba i think would classify as a mid but rotation  gerry payton recently, not at the beginning"
"''You're that guy, Mozgov, trust me, you are.''  Especially in celebrations though, the Lebron Raptors baseline perfect connection and Larry Nance Jr assassination of Brook Lopez with Mozgov in it celebrating after made them 100x better.  He pulled a TNT CWebb with Charles' jokes."
I love him now that he's not on the Lakers  Same with Larry Nance Jr a while back
"Man this made me curious as to just how bad this is. My first shot was to go back to 2014.  They picked Jordan Adams 22nd. Rodney Hood and Clint Capela went in the next three picks. Ouch.   In 2015, the Grizzlies selected Jarell Martin 25th. Two picks later Larry Nance Jr. goes. Wow would this have changed history.   2016 is tough, hard to know who they would've taken at the time but Wade Baldwin at 17 surely was not the answer. Two of the next three picks...Malik Beasley and Caris LeVert.   2017 didn't select anybody.  2018 JJJ! A hit! Sure they could have had Trae Young, but I think they are happy with what they have in Ja and JJJ."
It's hard to dislike Larry Nance Jr. He comes off as a really good dude.
Don’t jump w Larry nance jr
"Larry Nance Jr would have to be an idiot to corroborate that or do anything but shut it down, really.  I'll take what the anonymous scout says with a gigantic grain of salt, but LNJ didn't really do anything to move the needle imo."
"I mean we all know the Cavaliers back then didn't have a great defensive rating and cruised through their offense, but we can still get on/off approximations on who anchored/ hurt the defenses the most. Defensive RAPTOR for example puts Love and Larry Nance Jr consistently above LeBron (in fact even in Lakers seasons LeBron ranks as average compared to AD and Caruso who are consistently at the top). Kyrie is typically near the bottom in defense rating. While reasonably LeBron shatters the offensive raptor stats in pretty much every season on his team."
Rick and Brent Barry would qualify; so would Arvydas and Domantas Sabonis. They’re probably the best father son duo actually.  Jimmy Walker and Jalen rose are another but they didn’t have a relationship   Dell Curry was a good player and obviously steph is steph  Larry nance Jr is HOF caliber and Larry Nance Jr is a damn good player  Mychal Thompson was the first overall pick and had a good career and Klay is Klay.    Gary Trent and Gary Trent Jr were/are both good players
"For what it’s worth, the defensive metrics weren’t super kind to AD as a rookie defender. Idk what that means and don’t have enough memory of rookie AD to put context to it, but watching Mobley, I highly highly doubt that is the case for him.   Stop here unless you want to read my fan boy take.   I’ve seen a ton of Jarret Allen, Larry Nance jr, Javale McGee and Andre Drummond the past year. Maybe it’s bias, maybe it’s wishful thinking, or something else. The most impactful defender today might be Mobley. Allen is more steady and fundamental,  Javale is longer, Nance is stronger and has fewer lapses, and Drummond may fill up the stat sheet more, but none of them have his combo of skill, athleticism, versatility and iq and he occasionally flashes that elite elite Gobert, Draymond, Kawhi and etc level of just knowing almost exactly what’s going to happen and just beating guys to the spot."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"That's an interesting thought experiment.  Portland has Anfernee Simons (Slam Dunk winner), Dennis Smith Jr (contestant), Larry Nance Jr (contestant), Ben MacLemore (contestant), and Dame Lillard (contestant). Though I don't think MacLemore and DSJ are guaranteed to make the team.  Still, a surprisingly large collection of good dunkers (in their primes)."
Larry Nance Jr. on Ezeli in 2015 comes to mind for me. edit: Forgot about Kobe on Ben Wallace. That was nasty as well.
"Larry nance jr, Jusuf nurkic, Jimmy Butler, Giannis, sabonis.   You have to be an above average defender in order to count as a hack of all trades, those are the rules. I didn’t make them so don’t get mad eat me."
"Larry Nance Jr is a name i haven't seen mentioned yet. Can score, shoot, playmake, rebound, defend. Not considered a top guy at any of those things, but really solid at them all."
Larry Nance Jr
Uh...   &gt;Pressure has been applied to the front office  Blazers' offseason additions:   * Larry Nance Jr.   * Cody Zeller  Wizards' offseason additions:   * Spencer Dinwiddie * Kyle Kuzma * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * Montrezl Harrell * Aaron Holiday   The Wizards had a bigger offseason than Portland did.
Interesting. A more realized Nasir Little and the addition of Larry Nance Jr and Zeller could definitely see the Blazers hovering around the 4th/5th seed.
"For the Blazers it would be Pascal Siakim, move RoCo to the 3. But who knows it could be Larry Nance Jr…."
"This is literally the reason we traded Lauri for DJJ and a pick instead of taking Larry Nance Jr, in case we lose the 2022 FRP."
"2011: Cory Joseph &gt; Jimmy Butler  2012: Festus Ezeli (pick traded to GS before draft) &gt; Jeffery Taylor  2013: Livio Jean-Charles &gt; Archie Goodwin  2014: Kyle Anderson &gt; Damien Inglis  2015: Nikola Milutinov &gt; Larry Nance Jr.  Butler and Nance would be significant upgrades over a journeyman backup PG and a big man who played zero NBA minutes respectively. Ezeli had a longer NBA career than Taylor, winning a championship with the Warriors even. Goodwin has the advantage of getting to play in the NBA compared to Jean-Charles. Anderson to Inglis is a major downgrade.  Not the end of the world though, given how the Spurs were in contention during this period."
I'm feeling Larry Nance Jr. It seems like a perfect fit for the Blazers. Will we be good at defense?
"Issue is Dame is the entire offense at that point, if they lose CJ they will have lost their 2nd, 4th, 6th leading scorers and replaced that with Larry Nance Jr and Ben Simmons...good players for sure but they aren’t providing much scoring at all.  Covington just averaged 8.5 ppg last season and Powell has been between 15-19 ppg the past few seasons."
"I don’t know if that’s on the table, Blazer adding Larry Nance Jr makes their need for Simmons much less pressing.  Maybe the Blazers move LNJ+CJ for Simmons or something like that but losing McCollum does take away a lot of scoring that they can’t make up."
Larry Nance Jr and Abdel Nader.
He was like love child between Melo and Larry nance jr. I was super high on him in high school and I still stand by that. If he didn’t have styrofoam ligaments he legit could’ve become an mvp type player
[Xavier Henry over Jeff Withey](https://youtu.be/7h8zVlCmX4w)  [Larry Nance Jr over Brook Lopez](https://youtu.be/5pqfvWthszA)  [Larry Nance Jr over KD](https://youtu.be/-n7MPfgeWJQ)
"Cleveland injuries last year had a lot to do with it.  Love, Larry Nance Jr, Delly, Exum (out for season), Prince, and Windler were out for over half the season."
Turns out trading away Larry Nance Jr didn’t hurt y’all
"I think 2 things will happen at the end of the season for the Blazers or midseason.  They finally bite the bullet,ship out CJ and picks and try to get a running mate for Dame. I also suspect Nurkic's time in Portland is done as well with Larry Nance Jr. taking more and more of his minutes at the 5 as the season has gone on. Nurkic's injuries have just sapped a lot of his athleticism and he's half of the player he was in 18/19. Covington is gone as well, either in FA or by the deadline.  If that doesn't happen I can see them just blowing it all up this summer and shipping out Dame and CJ and starting a rebuild. They have no cap flexibility because of Dame and CJ's contracts and its not like if they had any cap space a big time FA is going to come to Portland so the team is what it is at this point."
"Or they pointed out that they played Larry Nance, Jr. in the 2018 Finals against *Cleveland*."
"Yeah you can scrap together a contender if 10 ppg or less with Prime Lebron. You got the lineups already included on the thread but other players can be prime Trevor Ariza, Danny Green, Harkless, Larry Nance Jr., PJ Tucker, Marcus Smart is towing the line, Reggie Bullock and the like and scrounge up a decent core of prime 3 and d core around prime Lebron to contend. You can also look at old players that declined and had a couple bad season that dragged their career below 10ppg but they are actually better then that."
"You don’t need to have your feet set to draw a charge. The new rules further reduce the leniency that the ball handler had when charging.   That being said, that was quite possibly the best poster since Wade on Varejao or Larry Nance Jr on KD."
"And why do we use them? I get calling him Larry Nance Jr because Sr is relevant to us, but I don't care about Michael Porter so I'll call his son Michael Porter."
"So i used to watch the Lakers pretty regularly. And you can check out my post history to see if im qualified to talk about coaches.   Luke Walton was one of the worst coaches i have seen purely based on on court product.   His Xs Os are extremely simplistic leading with one action and no weakside or offball actions to setup counters to defensive counters. This means if the action is stopped, the play is dead and often in the old Lakers days this meant Jordan clarkson iso. Or Nick Young.  In fact, i dont remember the exact specifics but i predict if you look at the Lonzo era stats the team was probably #1 in transition offense and dead last with a half court set.  I remember Larry Nance Jr the first year without Walton saying in an interview how practices were very different than previous because they were much more structured.  I think Luke is a great player development coach, because by all accounts Draymond Green credits him with his development. Which i can see as a pinch post, triangle postion passer. But he’s not head coach material and it was evident from early in his Lakers tenure."
Larry Nance Jr.
"*Jordan Clarkson runs back on defense signaling 3 with his fingers*  *Larry Nance Jr dunks on someone and gives him a stank face*  *LeBron drops 53 at the Finals, but JR Smith forgets the score and clock*   Yeah, what about it?"
Yeah but let’s be honest wouldn’t you rather have Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson? /s
I forgot about that! Add Larry Nance Jr. to the list of good players who the Lakers shipped out of town for no reason.
"I dont think DeMar is at that level of an in game dunker anymore.   DJJ, Lavine, Giannis, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Ja Morant, Paul George, Anthony Edwards, Larry Nance Jr, Zion, and maybe Kawhi I'd take over him."
Don't forget Larry Nance jr
"It was something like:  OUT:  Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert  IN:  Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr,  Rodney Hood, George Hill,"
Tbh i have Caruso and Larry Nance Jr in my fantasy team and I had such a great time this morning. (European time zone)
"If you guys blow it up, we'll take 1 larry nance jr please!"
"Larry nance jr kept the blazers alive. He was doing everything.   Demar’s legs, i think, finally caught up to him during this road trip.   Oh well. Cant win them all."
TIL that Larry Nance JR is @ Portland now
Larry Nance Jr had an underrated good game. He was 7/7 even though a few of those were dunks.
"Cole Anthony, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry, Larry Nance Jr, Claxton, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland are all 2nd generation."
"Larry Nance Jr is decent, but his Dad was much better"
Does it matter lol it's not like Larry Nance Jr. is gonna be the guy to turn your bottom half of the standings team into a playoff contender
With Larry Nance Sr. I wish Jr. could’ve been here for this uprising but I guess Lauri and his shooting fits better. Also Mobley pretty much does everything Larry did for the past few seasons but like multitudes better.
One Larry Nance Jr. Is all I want!
"Larry Nance Jr has Crohn's Disease, which I also have. A bad flareup can basically make you feel like a zombie where something as simple as taking a shower or walking up some stairs totally exhausts you and your body has trouble absorbing vitamins/nutrients the way a normal person can. So it always kinda blows my mind whenever someone with this disease can overcome that and stay in good enough shape to compete with some of the best athletes in the world."
I feel like Larry Nance Jr is similar size wise
"They have developed players though, they just didn't have time to see it through because of injuries + Lebron/AD forcing a trade greatly accelerating the timeline.  BI went from legitimately looking like a bust to averaging 20/6/3 the second half of his final year. Julius put up one of his most efficient years ever (16/8 in 27 minutes). Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, and Alex Caruso all became solid rotation players. Other players like DLo and Lonzo just kept getting sidelined by injuries.  Not to mention the Lakers developing two of the rawest prospects ever in Kobe and Andrew Bynum."
Don't forget about Larry Nance Jr and Zubac. I feel like the lakers developed KCP to a good role player
Is there a reason Larry Nance Jr is playing the lowest minutes of his career? Has he sucked?
Why even play Zeller when you got Larry Nance Jr there?  Larry Nance is severely underutilized with the Blazers right now
The closest - 2020 Cavs:  * Kevin Love son of Stan Love * Larry Nance Jr son of Larry Nance * Darius Garland son of Winston Garland * Dante Exum son of Cecil Exum (drafted in the 9th round by the Nuggets) * Coach J. B. Bickerstaff son of Bernie Bickerstaff

"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
Those RFA rights turned into Larry Nance Jr. which turned into a first round pick+Derrick Jones Jr
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I’m not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It’a a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he’s been with the Hornets he’s drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte’ Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
"also: Kyle Kuzma, THT, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Ivica Zubac.    not on the level of Spurs &amp; Raptors, but still a good return"
Enes Kanter -&gt; Cody Zeller  Carmelo Anthony -&gt; Larry Nance Jr  Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking bad and not playing -&gt; Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking like passable NBA players and playing  Dame needing to score 60 to win -&gt; Dame can have bad nights and the team still has other scorers and playmakers contributing
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
