"Lamelo was definitely not the first real HS social media star hooper. Isaiah Washington and the Jelly Fam were a hit online and had a huge following back in 2014-2015. And thatâ€™s just the first I can recall. Iâ€™m sure there were more before them. Zion had over a million followers when he was in grade 10 or 11. Thereâ€™s Mac McClung, now Mikey Williams.  But outside of Zion, LaMelo is the first to really make good on the potential. That and heâ€™s been surrounded by a larger media machine than the rest of them, his dad is a successful troll, and has a brother is a former lottery pick. That all doesnâ€™t hurt his marketability."
Except he got locked by Mac mcclung
Heâ€™s no Mac Mcclung
Seattle gets a team again.  Emoni Bates is a top-3 player in the league.  Tyler Herro failed attempt at a rap career.  Surprise superstar duo Mac McClung and Julian Newman lead the Sacremento Kings back to the playoffs but lose 4-0 in the finals to the Ball Brothers who all (yes LiAngelo too) reunite with Okongwu in Charlotte.
Guys like Mac McClung who are big stars because some crazy highlights go viral from his small college but he currently projected to go undrafted.
ok but Mac McClung is better than Drummond let's be honest
"This isâ€¦not a good take.  Drummond is not the all-star that Drummond believes he is, but he would cook the professor 1v1 100 days out of 100 and twice on Sundayâ€™s. I remember a video of Mac McClung going against I think bone collector and torching him, and thatâ€™s a guy who scored 1 point in a summer league game."
You idiot. Can't you see? These moves were just the first steps in acquiring Mac McClung.
~~Matt~~ Mac McClung
Theres nothing obscure about mac mcclung hes been famous since high school
Mac McClung
Mac McClung is going to slide his nuts across Grayson Allenâ€™s face this season.
Foreal . For me its also straight up wasting a roster spot . You have jimmy butlet lowry bam tucker lots of leaders . No reason to keep haslem around . That org has developed talent as good as anyone why not use that 15th spot with players with actual potential . Its so stupid to me . Id rather have liangalo ball or mac mcclung at the end up my bench then fucking haslem
Mac McClung sounds made up. Are we sure it is not just Caruso with a fake moustache?
I feel like YouTube really helped Mac McClung get into the league.  He was only like a 3 ðŸŒŸ prospect I believe.  He wasn't anything special in college either.  But he landed in quite possibly the best situation for him.
Mac McClung sounds dope.
&gt; Mac McClung  Lakers fans found their new Caruso
Mac McClung will share a backcourt with Nico...in the EuroLeague.
"I enjoy the Summer League.  I was most interested as a Laker fan to watch someone like Mac McClung.  Obviously isn't projecting to be some sort of crazy superstar, but seems like he has a great feel and IQ for the game so far.  His athleticism may not be ELITE like it was playing in HS, but you can tell he seems to understand what his role is.  I know this is may be just my sadness and grief overtaking my mind - but in like 2 years or so...I can easily see him being like an Alex Caruso type guy.  hard nosed athletic player, who will use his motor and defensive instincts to get easy transition baskets for either himself or the team."
"Thatâ€™s very true, I honestly forgot about PJ Tucker. Heat could definitely upset the Bucks, especially with Lowry. At the same time even though Jrue wasnâ€™t shooting very well most of the time, he was harassing opposing guards and giving them a defensive hell. Thought he might give Lowry a hard time. Jimmy is a great player and could very well shut Giannis down. I just have a feeling his game wonâ€™t age very well without a consistent jumper so his championship window may be very short. Mobley is really really good I wouldnâ€™t surprised if he won it. My sleeper rookie pick would be Mac McClung, looks like he a has a feel for the game and has a good handle of the ball."
Sorry Mac McClung
and mac mcclung LMAO
Mac Mcclung!
Mac McClung
Mac McClung is really fun to watch
And Mac mcclung
Itâ€™s aight. They got Mac Mcclung. Heâ€™s Caruso with a hairline.
How did I only just find out they got Mac McClung lmao

"Alex Caruso leaving and the Lakers signing Mac McClung is the equivalent of a man (Lebron) divorcing his old washed up wife and marrying a younger, hotter woman."

"Some of yâ€™all arenâ€™t ready for the amount of Mac McClung bullshit we are going to get on Bleacher Report, etc."

Mac McClung and Trevor Ariza
"Mac McClung, once he has that NBA HGH in him that hairline is going. New bald man has arrived"
THT and Mac McClung
Mac McClung has just entered the chat
Who you gonna play tho? Mac McClung?
The Mac McClung memes start now
"ayayi could actually fit on a team. mcclung never developed into a pg, and canâ€™t defend SGs. mac is an iso player who doesnâ€™t shoot efficiently. heâ€™s gotta get way better to find a role."
whereâ€™s mac mcclung?  a comment on a video of his best dunks from high school told me he would be a starter.
We got kyree walker obviously the 2nd best since only mac mcclung has more instagram followers
"No need. Lakers just inked a deal with [the white Alex Caruso, Mac Mcclung!](https://imgur.com/o9BxSAT)"
Mac Mcclung will make an NBA roster and play minutes at some point in his career.
Mac McClung definitely didnâ€™t graduate from Georgetown in 2 years. Source: literally impossible
I hear Mac McClung is hung and once coughed up a lung
"Is anyone going to draft Mac Mcclung? Super fun dude to watch, at least."
"Yeah if mac mcclung comes on the last game in the season and drops 70, he won't get anywhere near a max. He'd get a spot on a roster the next season though."
"Yeap, Mac McClung and Talen Horton-Tucker"
"Lakers actually have 6 guys that meet the criteria of this post.   THT, Monk, Austin Reaves, Joel Ayayi, Chaundee Brown, and Mac McClung."
"Who better to coach Kostas, Wes, and Mac McClung to an NBA championship?"
How long before Mac McClung is a buck?
Mac McClung would do better than AD in the paint
"""mac mcclung is one of the best shooters in the league"" -some instagram page I saw"
"Yeah, in all honesty there are probably like 1000+ guys who could reasonably be the worst player in the NBA (ie the 450th best player in the NBA). There are a ton of different reasons why a team might decide on one of those random pool of 1000 players, raw potential (perhaps a foreign player who only started playing), great showing in NCAA tournament (Peyton Siva type guy), viral sensation (like Mac McClung), physical body (Tacko Fall), or if they have connections to the league (LiAngelo, Thanasis, maybe Shareef Oâ€™Neal in a few years), good narrative/story (Andre Ingram on the Lakers a few years ago). There are valid reasons to have any of those guys as the 15th man or on a two way contract for any team, it just comes down to what theyâ€™re looking for and what they value. Thanasis being Giannisâ€™ brother helped him get a foot in the door, but itâ€™s not like heâ€™s taking a roster spot away from someone who clearly deserves a spot in the NBA.  There 451st best basketball player in the league isnâ€™t that different from the 999th best, and when you factor in other things that are even more subjective and harder to project like potential, growth, etc. everything gets so muddied itâ€™s so hard to know whatâ€™s best."
"lebron, AD, and mac mcclung?"
What does Mac McClung look like?!
Mac McClung being related to Riff Raff is the only reason heâ€™s anywhere near a NBA floor
what is a mac mcclung
Rajon Rondo/Mac McClung/Wes Matthews/Trevor Ariza/DeAndre Jordan  Thatâ€™s the Lakers garbage time lineup in this years game 6 finals clinching win.
Mac McClung will probably be starting
Mac McClung is a meme name.  This is the same level as the Boaty McBoatface.
"&gt;Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown chose numbers 37 and 38, most likely in an attempt to make Dwight Howard not look so fucking stupid by wearing number 39. Conclusion: Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown are AMAZING teammates.  Rofl but for real what did Dwight bribe them with?"
Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown
TIL where Mac McClung is these days.
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
Mac McClung gonna be activated
mac mcclung in shambles
