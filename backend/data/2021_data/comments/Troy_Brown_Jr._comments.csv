Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I’ll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
"None taken, I feel like we do our best when we’re not in the spotlight. I feel like we could’ve definitely done better, but one thing to consider is that we’ve had one of, if not the hardest schedule in the NBA. We’ve only played two non playoff teams, but our youth and inconsistencies make our record seem worse than it actually should be. But yeah, I hope things pick up for y’all in Washington, always thought Troy Brown Jr was an interesting prospect as well."
Prime Troy Brown Jr 👀
"Can’t pin these losses on Beal. Of course his numbers are going to be inflated if you’re missing Rui Hachimura, Troy Brown Jr, Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Russell Westbrook and Ish Smith"
"I feel like there’s a trade between Washington and Denver that makes too much sense not to get done.   A pick, Troy Brown Jr &amp; Bradley Beal for Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.  I don’t do a lot of trade research or discussion so this may be one that’s been talked about a lot, but I think both teams benefit greatly from this."
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
"We’ll take Allen off your hands since Brooklyn used our pick to get him and we should never have traded that pick away! DAMN YOU ERNIE!  We’ll give you Troy Brown Jr., a half eaten can of Pringles and a pair of worn socks?  Thanks no trade backs!"
Can we get Wagner and Troy Brown Jr too?
"Yeah Beal really should have taken his team to the playoffs witj Davis Bertans....uh...a rookie Rui Hachimura...and uh, Troy Brown Jr and Thomas Bryant."
Hm more like 2 bad defenders (Russ and Bryant) and 2 bad offensive players in Troy Brown Jr and Jerome Robinson
"Bonga played 12 minutes, Troy brown Jr had a dnp"
Troy Brown Jr? We’ve played them twice but I’m not claiming to be an avid Wiz watcher
"The Wizards have shooters. They aren't being utilized correctly. See below with 2019 3p % stats:  Bertrans (42.4%), Beal (35.3%), Neto (38.6% and 45% this season so far), Bryant (40.7%), Rui (28.7% but shooting 100% this year so far), Deni (NA but shooting 47.6% this year so far) can all shoot and probably in that order for efficiency  Then you have guys like: Troy Brown Jr (34.1%), Isaac Bonga (35.2%), Ish Smith (36.7%), Robin Lopez (33.3%), Moritz Wagner (31.3%), Anthony Gill (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason), and Garrison Matthews (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason)  All these dudes can shoot too.  The problem is you need some semblance of an offensive scheme generating semi-open looks and the Wizards don't have that."
"easy.  Bertans couldn't guard anybody, was flopping all over the place, got a technical because he was frustrated.  Poor dude had a really awful awful game.  Deni was actually really solid in his place, especially defensively, especially for a rookie, he should have gotten a lot more playing time.  Same with Rui, same with Troy Brown Jr.  Wiz also desperately need a better interior defensive presence, but Bryant, to his credit played much better defensively in the middle in the 2nd half as well.  Really, the whole team played much better in the 2nd half aside from Bertans.    Like it wasn't a lack of hustle or anything that made the wizards bad defensively.  Partly their scheme sucks and their personnel is just a whole bunch of scorers, which is why they were so terrible defensively last year as well."
It feels like Troy Brown Jr has been in the NBA for longer than 3 years for some reason
you guys don't see to need KD that much. Hows about you trade him to us for a lil bit of depth.  KD for Alex Len and Troy Brown Jr? Can't see a reason you guys don't do it. Solves your depths problem by adding a net 1 player
Troy Brown Jr is about to drop a career high tonight
"Troy Brown Jr. ish smith, Robin lopez. Thomas Bryant and the 4 mill exception. Get it done. Thanks I’ll be waiting to draft Andre Drummond as a wizard on draftkings."
"Analytically yes, Troy Brown Jr and Isaac Bonga are analytically good defenders. But leave it to Scott Brooks to bury them on the bench"
Lmao same bro. Hopefully Troy Brown Jr grows with you guys. Seems like a mistake we let him go. But hopefully Gafford can grow with us too
Thank you. Troy Brown Jr!
I'd consider myself to be a decently informed fan but I completely missed that Troy Brown Jr trade
Troy Brown Jr is going to make an all star team
"1. Lavine 2. Vucevic 3. Thad 4. Theis 5. Sato 6. Williams 7. Temple 8. Markkanen 9. White 10. Troy Brown Jr 11. Aminu 12. Arci 13. Valentine 14. Javonte Green 15. Felicio  Not much separation at all between that 4-9 tier though, they’re all very, very close to each other and you could probably order them just about any way."
Can’t believe they’re this scared of YouTube star Troy Brown Jr
"1) lavine 2) Vooch 3) Thad 4) Lauri 5) Pat 6) Coby 7) Sato 8) Temple 9) Valentine 10) Archidiacono  Did not rank : Theis, Troy brown Jr, Aminu , Javonte green"
AD is Mo Wagner with weird eyebrows and LeBron is Troy Brown Jr
Troy brown jr
"Troy Brown Jr, but yeah gotta stop with the acronyms"
traded troy brown jr for jerome robinson to go 0-5 on rotation minutes only to play a little short.. rough
Give Troy Brown Jr all of Valentine’s minutes (also please please please take Lauri’s minutes away)
"I don't know much.  But i do know that Troy Brown Jr. was washed up the moment the NBA Bubble was over.  Despite averaging close to 15 points, 7RPG and 4 assists inside of it.  And you would be a fool and a Scotty Brooks hater if you thought differently."
Why is Troy Brown Jr. getting minutes? I swear every time I see him he's just jacking up shots and shooting like 30%.
"garrison matthews is that good though; he's not replacing an injured person, he's snatching minutes from troy brown jr, a lottery pick."
"Troy Brown Jr., welcome to the Denver Nuggets."
"Anyone that can actually run up and down the court to play defense. Troy Brown Jr, Rui Hachimura. There is no need to play Lopez.  Even Mo Wagner probably would've held his own."
Troy Brown Jr
All time I gotta go with Ben Gordon  I'm young so maybe some older Bulls fans have a different opinion but I don't think he got the respect he deserved.  Currently I wanna go with Troy Brown Jr. Really really good perimeter defender who hasn't hit his potential on the offensive end. Another option would be Thaddeus Young
"I've always been a big WB fan, but this year I feel like I've entirely shifted my NBA watching to the Wizards instead of watching various teams around the league.  Besides WB - we have:  \- Beal piling it on every game - 31.4 pts per game!   \- Bertans - LATVIAN LASER  \- Rising players in Rui and Gafford - latter in particular has been revelation since coming to Wizards, and to get him for Troy Brown Jr and Moe Wagner!!! He's been integral to this run.   \- A lot of solid vets and teammates - RoLo (CAPTAIN HOOK), Neto, A Gill, Len, Ish Smith - playing hard and not giving a crap about stats  \- Great team chemistry - everyone likes and playing for each other, going all out every game, hustling hard   \- I've said before that Brooks' game-to-game coaching is not good - but to have this team play this hard every night and with team chemistry at a high, have to credit him for that.  \- JK and Gooden being homers... but not unbearable homers, they're usually just stoked for the team (and esp compared to earlier in the season when they both sounded defeated most nights), and Gooden is good for a few random comments every night.   \- Entertaining style of play - they score a lot, don't defend that well, and don't know how to quit (or win a blowout).   It's been ENTERTAINING - and hoping the Wiz keeps rising, what a story after their crap start    to the season. Ignoring the triple doubles, you'll have to credit WB with a lot of the above - what a leader."
"We gone be getting bigger dubs this offseason with our shiny new aggressive FO.   For starters, Felicio's contract ends this season. Lauri is leaving, preferably in a sign-and-trade. Most of the bench will be upended, with The Athletic predicting that only White and Troy Brown Jr staying. Theis will bounce if some other team promises him starter minutes just like Drummond did. This offseason (combined with Justin Fields' potential) finna be a rollercoaster for Chicago."
"Also middle of the pack for Covid stuff at 11th in the league. Beal missed one day, Bertans 7, Troy Brown Jr and Demi and Ish all missed nine while Rui and Mo missed 16 for a total of 67.   76ers have missed 84, Bulls 98, Heat and Raptors 116, and Celtics a whooping 167 - literally 100 more days. You can add up the days missed from just our starters and first player off the bench and it’s more than the wizards total.   Doesn’t mean they didn’t have a rough time of it but a bunch of other East teams (and teams in general) have too"
Fuck the haters we havent won this amount of games in a long time so say what you will but its working right now. This wizards team was hardly a guarantee to win over 30 games and are already over achieving for what the expectation is. We also beat tough teams this year it wasn’t just bottom barrel. Beal russ and rui have all been hurt at separate as well as overlapping periods of time. Thomas Bryant has been out for a long time and troy brown jr was hurt the entire time before he got traded. Im proud of my city and everything russ has accomplished
We got troy brown jr and mo wagner for gafford and hutchison.  GMs werent drooling
Chicago Bulls reddit still saying Troy Brown Jr. is better
"still miss troy brown jr but hutchinson does play good energy minutes, hope he stays healthy. kinda got a brick jumper tho lol"
I'd like to see this as Troy Brown Jr effect.
Gafford was unplayable at a point of time because he couldn't catch a pocket pass. He always looked frustrated with himself. Probably a mental issue.   But we all knew what he could do. He's a good rim protector and a rim runner. Russ is elevating his game to another level.   I think we're just bad at handling guys. Wendell also looked lost and had confidence issues. Now I'm happy for both gaf and Wendell as they're showing their true potential.  I didn't mind trading gaf and Hutchinson because we got Theis and Troy brown Jr back. Both of them are doing well on defence which apparently the rest of the roster doesn't have a clue about
"Wizards-Bulls-Celtics trade:  Wizards give up Moe Wagner and Troy Brown Jr. to get Daniel Gafford and Chandler Hutchison  Celtics give up Daniel Theis and Javonte Green for Moe Wagner and Luke Kornet  Bulls give up Daniel Gafford, Chandler Hutchison, and Luke Kornet for Troy Brown Jr., Daniel Theis, and Javonte Green"
Troy Brown Jr. is better than Hutchinson and we flipped Wagner for Theis. Pretty even trade.
I knew he'd be good if given time to play through mistakes. But we've been really happy with Troy Brown Jr. so this is a win win trade
he and chandler hutchinson were traded for Troy Brown Jr and Theis
"Lots of people here clearly don’t watch the bulls. Zach lavine and vucevic have been good, their weakness on defense hasn’t been our problem. Vucevic, Theis, and Troy Brown jr have all been great pickups. Our problems are due to the fact that five players on our roster (Markkanen, Coby White, Thad young, satoransky, and Patrick Williams) have been absolutely useless when they had been decent or good earlier in the season"
yeah troy brown jr is definitely the best out of those dudes
Likely Troy Brown Jr? Unfortunately. Or maybe Aminu
"I assume bulls protect Lavine, Vuc , Patrick Williams, Coby white, Thad Young, Troy brown Jr, Theis + Lauri ( if both re-sign) ."
Protect  -Patrick Williams  -Coby White  -Thaddeus Young  -Zach Lavine  -Nikola Vucevic   -Daniel Theis  -Troy Brown JR  - Tomas Satoransky
"Bulls taking over the league next year with our big 3: Zach lavine, nikola vucevic, and Troy brown Jr."
"As a Bulls fan I gotta say that Lavine would probably be a 30 ppg scorer if he had spacing (which has been a problem with our inconsistency and roster changes every week or so) and capable playmaking. Zach is limited in defense and isn't the best playmaker but he's elite at scoring from anywhere. It's amazing he even puts up his numbers with the quality of the shots he takes. Gladly our FO is making moves to help take the load off him. Vucevic and Theis have been great giving us capable interior scorers instead of whatever WCJ and Markkanen are (I love them but come on guys stop regressing), Troy Brown Jr. being the defensive spark plug swiss army knife that every team would love and Javonte Green being... well actually decent for us."
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
So glad the wizards passed on MPJ to take Troy brown Jr
Cries in Troy brown Jr 😪
Gafford was for Troy Brown Jr .... Hutchison was for Wagner
So happy we didn’t draft this man. We were the pick after and got Troy Brown Jr instead
He's a players coach. The team likes him which has allowed him to stay way past his welcome. It also doesn't help that he let's Russ and Beal do whatever tf they want.   He was touted for his player development when he came here but has done nothing for Troy Brown Jr or Deni Avdija. Those two are playmaking 3s but are forced to become pure 3 pt shooters which they aren't. Because of that they don't produce and have a tight lease whenever they see the floor. Brooks does more harm than good when it comes to player development.
I remember my wizards took Troy brown jr ahead of him and we needed a big man. Ernie Grunfled is an idiot.
"We'll see. Their best avenue to competitiveness has always been internal development. Before they were banking on Markkanen and Carter Jr, now it's White and Williams. They don't have a lot of clear paths to external improvement but if those guys and Troy Brown can take strides then a full season of Vuc and LaVine should be enough to carry them past teams like Charlotte, Indiana and into the tier of Atlanta, NYK etc."
"We got theis and Troy brown Jr back in that trade.   No particular reason, he just didn't play that well when he was starting for us."
1. Lavine 2. Williams 3. Troy Brown Jr. 4. Player to be named later 5. Player to be named later 6. Player to be named later 7.  Coby White 8. Player to be named later
"It's hard with so many free agents (Theis possibly staying, Markkanen definitely leaving, etc.) but I'd go with LaVine, Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Coby White and maybe Troy Brown Jr as our only players that matter."
"Worse off, slightly. But It's not particularly fair reflection with Zach missing for 11 games or so and a harder schedule. Theis and Troy Brown Jr missing many too who were positive when they played.  We had some more complete performances, still enough stinkers to be frustrating but I believe if we had this squad for the whole year we'd be in the play ins."
Troy brown jr was injured for basically the last  quarter of the season but Bulls fans like him mostly since the trade DL.
"We traded up for one of the best bigs in the NBA, and shuffled off the pointlessly expensive Otto Porter Jr. and a slew of underperforming players that were given 1.5 to 3 seasons in a row of chances to improve(though I still see a lot of potential in Gafford.) Theis is a stud, and an underrated stretch big. Troy Brown Jr. is still kinda raw, but his upside is very high. And Moe Wagner and Javonte Green could come in handy when Donovan wants to play big on shorter forwards, or play short &amp; boxy on taller forwards. The last two aren’t total studs, but they’re no slouches either. Losing picks sucks, but the Bulls have 6 guys under the age of 25, and getting younger hasn’t turned into winning for Chicago.  I’m very hopeful for 21-22, but because injuries are random, I’m trying to not set myself up for disappointment. We’ll see how it all plays out!"
Some other \#15 picks in recent years:  2014 Adreian Payne  2015 Kelly Oubre Jr.  2016 Juan Hernangómez  2017 Justin Jackson  2018 Troy Brown Jr.  2019 Sekou Doumbouya  2020 Cole Anthony  I knew very little about any of these guys before they were drafted. The one guy who I had seen some of was Justin Jackson because of the ncaa championship.
"It's gonna be   Lonzo - Lavine - Pat - Young - Vuc  White, Troy brown Jr, sato as of now off the bench"
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
"&gt; The Bulls haven't been able to build a full team since the Rose team with the bench mob.  The Bulls have exactly 1 season under the management of AKME and the coaching of Billy D. Forgive me for not judging their success or failure against the past 10 years of Paxson, Forman, Hoiberg and Boylen.  &gt; Lavine can leave very soon and the Bulls have been an awful team with his play as the only bright spot since he got here.  Sure. Likewise, the Bulls can (and will) offer LaVine a max contract, and just made a big show of trading mediocre young talent and picks for a second all-star to help carry the load. And the early returns on Vuc are great, he played very well down the stretch while LaVine was out with covid.  I understand the shortcomings of this roster, but I choose to be more optimistic about the outlook. Donovan is a good coach. Karnisovas is a well respected personnel manager. LaVine and Vucevic are two all-star talents.  &gt; This is the year they need to prove something to Zack to get him to resign before a serious team shows him they can win something with him.  On this I completely agree. This season will be extremely important, and if they fail again Chicago will be in a much bigger hole. But this season hasn't happened yet, and I think there's a good chance that with a healthy roster and some development from young guys like Williams, White and Troy Brown Jr, this is a roster capable of making the playoffs in the east, and convincing LaVine to stay long-term."
"If Dame wants out do the blazers blow it up completely?  Maybe the Blazers want young assets?  Disclaimer I realize this isn’t the best offer the blazers could get, but its just the best i think the Bulls can offer so i’m throwing it out there.  Bulls can offer:  Patrick Williams Coby White Troy Brown Jr Tomas Satoransky Al Farouq Aminu Future first?  Why the blazers do it:  Patrick Williams is a promising young player, a lotto pick and the 2nd youngest in the nba before the draft.  Star potential.  Coby is another player with star potential who may have been held back by playing next to Lavine.  TBJ is a sweetner as a decent young prospect and the rest are salary fillers   Why the Bulls do it: Sucks to trade Williams, but you can’t acquire superstars without giving up something.  Dame is a top pg in this league and you hope putting him next to Lavine and Vucevic is enough to become contenders.  You cut 4 mill salary with this move too so you can attempt to keep Thaddeus Young as a valuable glue guy and maybe re-sign Theis to become your starting PF."
"2017 McDonald's All-American?   Notable NBA players from West: Trae Young, Ayton, Jaren Jackson, M Porter Jr, Gary Trent, Troy Brown  East: Bamba, Wendell Carter, Sexton, Lonnie Walker,  Mitchell Rob, Knox, Vanderbilt  MPJ was MVP and his team won 109-107"
Chicago Bulls' own Troy Brown Jr.
"I know it's not great, but we will give Coby White, Troy Brown Jr, Lauri Markkanen, and 2 pick swaps for Ben Simmons. Thanks!"
Still so upset the wizards passed on him or didn’t trade down in the draft when we were looking for an athletic big that year in the draft and instead we took Troy brown jr.
"Eh they’ll figure it put. Our perimeter defence already have some very solid players. Patrick williams, Troy brown jr, Lonzo ball, Caruso are all plus defenders. Tony Bradley doesn’t look too bad either. We have the pieces"
"I don’t get it either. Between Lonzo, Lavine, Demar, Coby, Caruso and Troy Brown Jr+ Pat sliding over sometimes we have the best 1-3 rotation in the league. Not to mention one of the best centers in Vuc. We need another big man but this team has a lot of potential"
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should’ve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that’s been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we’ve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He’d make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I’m a strong believer in him. I think he’ll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that’s still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who’s proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn’t playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn’t decide between. They’re the same price but I’m not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I’d honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
"Yeah, like I said, not the best. If we have Lauri that's a really solid 8 man rotation though. I'm also pretty high on Tony Bradley. Troy Brown Jr not so much. Simonovic is a guy to watch though, he was our 44th pick last year and had 1 more year in Europe before coming over this year. He's looked REALLY promising in SL, not in that ""he's putting up big numbers he's the next superstar"" way guys hype their rookies, but just the way he moves and his BBIQ are much better than I expected at 6'11. He could very well be a part of our rotation as well."
"Yeahhh, that might've been primarily a function of drafting KD/Russ/Harden/Ibaka as opposed to anything Scott Brooks did (I suspect that Ben Simmons brother could've ""developed"" those guys into amazing players).    If you ask Troy Brown, Jr., Satoransky, Deni, Rui, or even Oubre &amp; Otto, I think they'd probably tell you a very different story.  Even with Beal, it was going outside the Org and working constantly with Drew Hanlen that resulted in him making the 'leap.'"
"....Vooch?  Heck, he'll likely be their best overall player  Not just their ""Big 4"" either.  Pat Williams's growth is going to be exciting, and they have Caruso &amp; Coby coming off the bench, which projects to be pure fireworks  They've also got Troy Brown Jr, Tony Bradley, Jevonte Green, Dosunmu, possibly Markkenen, and this new Montenegren kid that Karnisovas took with last year's 2nd rounder Marko Simonovic, who is very tall &amp; very talented  Heck of a turnout job by Karnisovas &amp; Eversley, mopping up Paxson's disgusting mess of a roster/organization.  In less than 2 yrs, nearly everyone from the old Uncle Jerry/Paxson guard are goners"
I think the bench would look nice with Lauri.   Clear offensive focal points with White and Markkanen and three defense first guys.   Alex Caruso Coby White Troy Brown Jr Lauri Markkanen Tony Bradley
"1)  Gafford sucks.  You could put a broomstick in there with Westbrook, and if it can catch lobs at a respectable clip, Russ will make said broomstick look like Moses Malone.  Chicago moved him for Troy Brown Jr, who has considerably higher upside &amp; is a much more adequate fit for the contemporary NBA, on both sides of the ball  2) Chicago's defense will be fine.  It wasn't that bad last yr, and they shored up their perimeter D big time over the off-season.  Their overall D won't be stellar or anything, but it won't be terrible either.   Maybe actually go look up the stats/evidence before commenting?  The Bulls biggest weaknesses last season by far were ball distribution, turnovers, &amp; free throw attempts.  Both issues have been addressed &amp; subsequently remedied  They've also acquired Tony Bradley, who is a young, serviceable big body down low, and have a 21 yr old 7-footer from Montenegro, Marko Simonovic, that they've recently brought on board, who was their second rd draft pick last yr &amp; is already at the advocate centre practicing with Billy D &amp; their 2nd rd pick from this yr, Ayo Dosunmu, who also looks to be a solid NBA perimeter defender"
"I know you are just giving your opinion as of this time, but the offseason isn't over yet. The bulls will fill those holes. They have Tony Bradley behind Vuc, and Ayo and Troy Brown Jr are going to be on the roster as well. TBJ is a pretty good defender and Ayo is really versatile and mature in his game for a rookie. We'll see who else they pickup or get in a sign and trade for Lauri. Could possibly match Lauri if it's low enough and keep him for a backup 4. Even though his defense isn't great, his 3 point shot is still really good and he is young."
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
"Coby White - Caruso - Troy Brown Jr - Lauri (who is definitely gone but for now) - Bradley isn’t too far off from what the Bulls starting lineup has looked like the last few years which says more about GarPax than it does our current depth but I digress.   This squad runs fairly deep, the East is going to be a gauntlet. Can’t wait!"
"As of right now,  Alex Caruso  Coby white Troy brown jr Lauri Markannen Tony Bradley  Ayo"
Troy Brown Jr is still here too
"&gt;I just think one more defensive minded player to help bolster the second team would be huge.  you're absolutely correct and i think that's something AKME is prioritizing from here on out (especially a rim protecting big.) i mean i have no reason to believe that except for the fact that i think they're a sharp FO.  people are really sleeping on Troy Brown Jr. though, dude is a very gritty defender and just turned 22 years old. he could be poised to make a jump this year and based on what we saw after we acquired him this past trade deadline, he's a guy i want to keep for a long time off our bench for his defense."
"Uh, pretty sure Patrick Williams and Caruso are two of the better young defenders in the league. Troy Brown Jr. is also literally on the team to play good defense + Lavine's lack of defense is overrated, as you're seeing in the Olympics.  Nice armchair analyst though bud."
"That's because its not a big 3..   Most big 3 teams rely on vet minimum contracts &amp; g league level players. This team has Lauri, Sub Zero, The Paw, and please do not sleep on Troy Brown Jr..   Easily going to be a top 5 in the East with a real chance to compete with the top 2-4 teams."
They have Troy Brown Jr for backup forward spot
"Lonzo, Caruso, PWill, Troy Brown Jr...."
There really isn’t much left if they plan on leaving the rest of the core together. Aminu and Troy brown jr combine for about $15mil so if we could convince someone to take them that’s about the only way I see it working
"I would hope so but there’s still holes on the Bulls. They need Center depth if we don’t get Theis back. Our SF depth is Pat Williams and Troy Brown Jr and since Lavine isn’t a good defender, they would be the ones guarding guys like KD, Harden, Middleton, etc. Ball helps in adding defense in the backcourt which we desperately need and some play making for Lavine and Vuc. Hopefully AKME can make some more moves for depth"
"Troy Brown - probably not going to be a star, but, I believe he'll be an important role player on good teams. Feel the same way about Mo Wagner  Wendell Carter Jr. - solid to really good starter. Possibly an All Star"
"Well without Lauri, Theis, Thad, ...yeah, we *have* to play Pat at the 4. Which is what I think we want to do anyway. But my point is we will have no backup to pat/vooch off the bench, and with pat going to the 4, our SF position is ... troy brown jr. Need more than one center/PF u feel"
They need to find a starting SF tbh. Troy Brown Jr. Isn't there yet.
"They don’t need space if they do a S&amp;T, which I think they can accomplish pretty easily by guaranteeing Thad Young. If they throw in Troy Brown Jr., that’s about $20M to send back"
On the wizards noone but people thought that troy brown jr was going to be something and for the raps uh idk stanley johnson was a bust
"Championship - speak it into existence! More likely a first round exit but I can’t stand the people saying we gave up our future to be perennial first round exits. We kept Coby White, who averaged 15/4/5 on 40/35/90 shooting splits in his second year!!! We kept our prized possession: Patrick Williams, who we’re banking on to succeed just like any other team with young talent. We picked up young prospects who still have the potential to be something in this league such as Tony Bradley, Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr. etc...we have two first round picks this year (our own! and Portland’s lottery protected FRP). This isn’t me just drinking the Kool-Aid, we’ve been rebuilding for awhile now and it wasn’t working so the new FO said fuck it, we’re going to compete and build a team around Lavine, who we believe has superstar potential, while also keeping a solid young core intact to fall back on if this iteration of the team fails."
"Stanley, derozan, Patrick Williams, djj, Troy brown jr, javonte green, and I think one more I’m forgetting"
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"Our perimeter defense got leaps and bounds better with Lonzo, Caruso, DJJ and Troy Brown Jr who was playing amazing D before he got hurt. Plus Pat is more suited to guard 4s than guards so he should be even more effective on that end. Lavine and Demar will have to at least be locked in on that side for us to be above average but I think it’s possible considering they won’t have as much offensive work load. We can def be at or better than where we were last year."
"he will probably get a few minutes, we're low on wing depth with Demar as our starting 3 and then only Troy Brown Jr behind him. DJJ is a great depth pick up and I love the move ngl"
"Coby white, Lauri, Caruso, Troy brown jr, Tony Bradley is no bench?"
Don’t forget about Troy Brown Jr too. DeBrownBallZach is a possibility. We’re versatile
"Almost nobody on the Chicago roster currently is a 2 way player, *including* the guys AKME has added. DeRozan, Vuc, Troy Brown Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Bradley, Green, Johnson, plus LaVine, Williams and Coby are all predominantly one way players. Lonzo is a good 2 way guy, Caruso to an extent, but that's about it.  *Maybe* the FO wants to build that way long term, but right now I'd argue that high volume bench scoring is more valuable than yet another defender on that second unit."
"Caruso is playing 28 and lonzo 36 so far. I'd imagine they want to bring those minutes down. Also, I think Coby takes minutes from Troy Brown Jr. And Javonte Green"
"Still questions on whether Coby can be a consistent scorer too. He averages out to 15-20ppg, but he gets in his head quite a bit on 3pt shooting. I think he pans out though, he's got the skill &amp; overall mentality.   Vegas rates us at 7 on the moneyline, I think that's honestly pretty fair. The thing that's underrated is some of these bench pickups. I've really liked Javonte Green, Alize Johnson, and Troy brown Jr, their production has been key to our 4-0 streak imo."
"This team is so much better than this time last year. Lonzo, DeRozen, Caruso, Alize Johnson, Ayo Dosunmo are all new to the team this off-season.  Vucivic, Javonte Green, Troy Brown Jr joined at the trade deadline last year."
"Troy brown jr, Alize johnson, and tony bradley all seem decent. The thing is though they run small lineups most of the time and it still seems to work out so far even against the cavs"
"I mean, Gafford is less powerful and arguably a worse defender, with none of the offensive upside of Vuc, but by all means bench an all-star in his prime for a guy who got traded for Troy Brown Jr"

"Ball, Caruso, Green  Lavine, White  Derozan, Troy Brown Jr  Williams, Derozan, Johnson,   Vucevic, Bradley, Williams  Bulls can put a lot of different rotations. Billy Donovan loves small ball 5's a lot and I agree that Caruso, Ball, Lavine, Derozan, Vucevic might be the game ending 5 of the Chicago Bulls this year. Billy Donovan didn't played Williams most of the time last year as well in late 4th quarter. He also tried small ball 5 with Williams at 5 against Grizzlies for couple of minutes. I think he knows he can't trust Bradley for more than 15 minutes. Billy Donovan also known for using glue guys and getting maximum of them so don't be suprised if we see Green at forward positions a lot this season."
"Bruce Brown, Jaylen Brown, Moses Brown, Sterling Brown, Greg Brown III, Troy Brown Jr: they are all actually uh wait a second never mind, I pass, pay no heed to my flair"
"last season we played mostly drop with Vuc, with better perimeter pressure defenders like Lonzo and Caruso, especially playing the passing lanes like we showed against the first game against the cavs, especially with more defensive minded bench pieces like Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr, and Devonte Green, you can't say our roster has become worst defensively."
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
"Bruh the Hawks 8 best players played 3 minutes the entire season. Trae's team was never healthy to begin with the entire year. Now Bogy is a reliable shot creator, reliable 3 point shooter, Collins is actually a post-up face up typa guy player, Capela once in a while can create his hook shots. Hunter would actually take advantage of his height in mismatches, you know what huerter did in game 7 against the 76ers. plus gallo and lou will with young guys in jalen johnson, and shariffe.  You really think our whole offense is reliant only on Trae. Also due to size, Lavine is obviously more efficient. You cannot compare a 6'6 guard to a 6'0 guard through efficiency too be honest.  and sure let's say lonzo would actually make trae earn his baskets more, collins is gonna take advantage in the post against pwill/derozan, while hunter could easily isolate derozan. yes i do think hunter's iso game is underrated as people only know him through a 23 game sample  You act like the Hawks team ain't deep, in fact they are easily deeper than the Bulls, have a better core imho. Troy Brown Jr will literally not get PT from us, Tony Bradley would probably be cut from is.  The games might get closer, but on paper (as we haven't really see the Bulls do something during the actual season) the Hawks would defeat the Bulls"
"Troy Brown Jr and Javonte Green, both gonna be important pieces off the bench."
"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
"LaVine and Vuc aren't great defenders, but neither of them are bad at defense. DeMar is obviously not a good defender but let's not fail to mention that we have Lonzo Ball and Patrick Williams in the starting lineup and off the bench we have Caruso, Tony Bradley, Troy Brown Jr., DJJ, Stanley Johnson, etc. the entire bench was pretty much molded with athleticism and defense being the two highest priorities.   12th in the league defensively last year, 8th in the league after trading for Vuc, and despite losing thad i don't think that's enough for us to even be in the bottom half defensively this year and looking at our roster we clearly have guys who are capable of playing good defense."
"DENVER: Marquese Chriss, Bam Adebayo, Troy Brown Jr., Leandro Bolmaro; other 1st rounders would be Guerschon Yabusele and Caris LeVert"
We have Coby White a frp and Troy brown jr available
Devon Dotson Alize Johnson Matt Thomas Mario Simonovic Troy brown jr
Troy Brown Jr and Daniel Theis
"TBJ = Troy Brown Jr., which would largely just be an expiring as a salary match"
"The Nuggets picked 14 in the 2018 draft and the Wizards picked 15, where they scooped up Troy Brown Jr.  I have a friend in the Wizards org that’s a part of the front office team. Very low level. You know when social media teams send out “draft night hype videos” of the war room and there’s a bunch of intern looking guys on computers? He’s one of those guys.  Anyway, I’ve asked him before that if MPJ fell one more spot to 15, would the Wizards have scooped him up? He claims that MPJ was red flagged because of his health and the Wizards wouldn’t have drafted him. His family has a weirdly devastating history with weak knees. His one sister, Bri, tore her ACL 5 times, and his other sister had to retire from basketball because of her knee problems.   The more concerning part was the nerve issues in the back. If you remember, there were reports that MPJ was suffering from Foot Drop, which apparently the Wizards wanted nothing to do with.  Anyways, obviously Troy Brown turned out to be somewhat of a nothing pick, so this is not a “ha ha the Wizards are geniuses” post. Like I’d honestly rather have the promise of MPJ even with the injuries over a guy that’s battling to get minutes his entire career. Still, I’m watching the MPJ story unfold and wondering if the 200mil payday was a lot for a man that had very noticeable issues."
Derrick Jones Jr and Troy Brown Jr gets you about 2 million short. They could add in another player on a minimum contract I suppose. That might be giving up too much for him though
"Fuck, can't believe we really traded Gafford for Troy Brown Jr."
I've seen enough Troy Brown JR for allstar
Ehh take a Troy brown jr and the portland first lmao  I know we’re not getting Grant but Coby ain’t getting traded
I see your Burke and raise you the MUCH TALLER Troy Brown Jr for Nance
"Well they turned Westbrook, Troy Brown Jr, Moe Wagner, and Chandler Hutchison into Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Aaron Holiday, Isaiah Todd, Daniel Gafford."
You guys should totally trade him.  Doncic for Troy Brown jr straight up. Who says no?
Troy Brown Jr and a 2nd for Bagley  who says no?
Troy brown Jr doesn’t play
"Plus minus also depends on the line up on the floor with Lavine…  Having a bunch of meh players like Troy Brown Jr, DJJ and Tony Bradley with Lavine means offense is trash and Lavine has to carry which could lead to minus number"
I think Derrick Jones Jr and Troy Brown Jr are pretty expendable as far as the Bulls go. Neither one is all that special.
"yeah, that's why I don't get people who talk about trading Coby. the whole second unit is built around what he offers. Caruso, great defender, decent playmaker that let's coby play offball which is where he's strong. DJJ and Troy Brown Jr, both have great defense, not volume scorers. Tony Bradley, defensive minded. like you go through the bench and it just needs an offball volume scorer, oh wait that's Coby White!!"
"yeah we’re currently still missing Rui and Thomas Bryant. Pretty crazy how much depth we have this year, it was out of nowhere.   last year our bench was ish smith, garrison matthews, troy brown jr, bertans, and robin lopez"
