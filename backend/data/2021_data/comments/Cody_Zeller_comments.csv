"No hear me out, Cody Zeller😎"
Cody Zeller
Cody zeller
"yeah, Cody ""Godzeller"" Zeller deserves to win it this year"
"Well that but also I don’t think everyone realizes how much our young players have grown.  Terry and now Malik are having breakout years, Miles has taken a step forward and Cody Zeller is having the best year of his career since he came back from injury.   Lot of good stuff happening in Charlotte."
"Can you really blame OP? A couple years ago, they had Cody Zeller, Kaminsky, and one of the Plumlees (specifically Miles) all on the team at the same time. It's easy to get them mixed up :)"
Think you meant Cody zeller

Cody zeller
We need to get Cody Zeller so we have run a PnR with him and Trae. The best hair duo in the league
Cody Zeller looks like the largest middle aged father I’ve ever seen
Cody Zeller
"Of course he is but here on this subreddit, there are people who would love to see him traded for Cody Zeller and a used Ricoh printer."
Any time I reference Cody Zeller I always mention how he’s ‘The Big Handsome’   Better than ole zig zag nose Tyler Zeller.
Damn Cody Zeller got you thinkin about this a day later huh

Caruso is like the lovechild of Cody Zeller and Joe Ingles lol
Wow. I bet you 99% of the nba would have done some sort of celebration. Cody Zeller not only posterized him but he gave giannis nothing to get fired up about.
"Damn he really punched it on him. Cody ""draft camp standing vert champion"" Zeller"
CODY FUCKING ZELLER
Lol that was brutal and super unexpected. Cody Zeller looks so unimposing and unathletic which made this dunk even more nasty lol
Wow! Cody Zeller did that 🤣🤣
Cody Zeller

I like Cody Zeller because he looks like he is 47
"I agree he was making lazy passes yesterday maybe some arguably because Cody zeller was in his first game back and had no chemistry with him but like I said it’s not even benching melo alone, it’s giving all his minutes to a player who shouldn’t even be getting significant minutes on any team. Caleb Martin literally checked in at 4:53 in the 3rd and checked out at 3:18 in the 4th. He played for over 13 minutes straight as a hustle player who provides almost nothing offensively or defensively."
To be fair Cody Zeller was the cause for 2-3 of Lamelo’s turnovers
"Did Lamelo Ball sleep with James Borrego's wife during the course of the game or what? Cody zeller lack of awareness gave Ball a turnover and Lamelo just got benched immediately lol, for the rest of they game!!  Also, Stacey King is a treasure"
"I find myself constantly baffled by the fact that Lamelo hasn't started a single game yet despite the fact that he's proven to be one of our best assets. Seems like he barely even plays tbh.  Also, good to have Cody Zeller back, hopefully Biyombo loses minutes because he really isn't a net positive for us."
"Is there any more randomly cursed player than Cody Zeller? Every year he comes back, looks like a legit difference maker as a role player big, and then suffers some new injury which ends his season."
"The Grizzlies can say all they want about Cody Zeller, but I doubt they have the proper info"
"I’m not sure if Cleveland will give Drummond up without getting a pick in return, but other than that I like the deal from both sides. Cleveland’s return seems a bit light, and I’m not sure if Charlotte will want to thin it’s wing rotation that much. Other than salary matching issues (of which I don’t know exactly how they work, and I also refuse to look up the salary of Cody zeller), I think a Cleveland to Charlotte trade would probably look a lot like this!"
This is why I laugh when hornets fans always bring him up in trade talks. Like I get our center rotation sucks but have we watched the same past half decade where he always got frustrated and played like shit when...Cody Zeller of all people started to rough him up on defense? He probably got ejected or fouled out half the times he played us. Dude is the biggest black hole center in the entire league too on offense
"A trade I'd be a big fan of is:  **Cavs trade:** Andre Drummond.   **Hornets trade:** Miles Bridges, Malik Monk, Cody Zeller.   Monk is out of favour there, Bridges has lost his starting job to Hayward, and Zeller expires at the end of this season just like Drummond.   Cavs get another wing in Bridges and the chance to take a swing on Monk."
Y'all just need cody zeller
"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"
I’m sick of the Cody Zeller slander
I think Cody Zeller when healthy is the best player and one most likely to be able to score on the others and has at least a little bit of range. I’ll give Zellers the edge
Great question and very evenly matched. If it’s 3 on 3 it may come down to who can play some on the perimeter. Mason Plumlee can probably play a little PG as you mentioned because he’s a good passer. But Cody Zeller is pretty quick for his size (same with Tyler Zeller too actually). I’ll go with the Zellers but it’s a toss up.
Terry Rozier and Cody Zeller
"Miles Bridges, Cody Zeller, PJ Washington, Biyombo.."
"the Zeller family as a whole are very wholesome people. I've actually been in the presence of Cody, Luke, and the parents on separate occasions and they're like all just generally happy and humble people."
"That’s dope man, I was the same year at IU so I love stories like this. I sat next to Cody Zeller sometimes back in finite math, super quiet and nice guy. Also yogi Ferrell hit on my girlfriend (now wife) once at a party and she had no idea who he was. Good times."
Is that Cody Zeller or Tyler?
"As a Hornets fan, I’d love to do Cody Zeller for Drummond. Would the Cavs be interested in Cody and Malik Monk?"
"My freshman year at IU was the year with Vic, Cody Zeller, and Yogi. I'm kinda sad now"
Ah yes the missing key:  Cody Zeller
"Domas and Embiid both have huge cocks. If they don’t have massive fucking hogs, they should go the KAT, Cody Zeller route."
"And we did it despite not having our 2 franchise cornerstones and future max-contract guys in Cody Zeller and Malik Monk. LaMelo who? Kid will never play big minutes once Malik is unleashed.  And Cody is the OG ‘Big Handsome’, not Gordon Wayward"
"I think the starter numbers are a bit misleading. Top picks generally go to bad teams, which means being a starter isn't as meaningful. Also those teams have an incentive to start their top picks for development and fan engagement.   If you keep going the pattern seems a bit shakier:  2015, 3 out of five starting, 3 all stars  2014, 3 out of five starting, 1 all star  2013, 3 out of five starting, 1 all star, 2 out of league  2012, 2 out of five starting, 2 all star, 1 out of league  2011, 2 out of five starting, 1 all star, 1 out of league  A lot of those starters are pretty borderline ones, as well. Guys like Cody Zeller and Kris Dunn. So I'm not sure if the return on investment is as high as you'd think.  It's possible we're getting better at identifying players over time, but I generally think picks in the 4-10 range are a bit overvalued.  Wolves will still find a way to lose the trade, though."
"kind of off topic but just watched the highlight video, anyone else think cody zeller looks kind of like james van der beek?"
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"

"Well, he did miss a bunch of games, so he wouldn't *quite* have the mileage of a typical 34yr old pro athlete. Still a crazy contract to give him, but it would have been even crazier for him to turn it down.   Besides, when Batum is getting $27m and Cody Zeller is at $15m, Hayward at 28-30m doesn't seem all that bad (considering this is the Charlotte Hornets we're talking about) provided he can stay healthy."
Cody slander deeply wounds me and yet I consistently bring up Cody Zeller to other fanbases. I think something's wrong with me
We have one Cody Zeller
This feels similar to finding out Cody Zeller is only 28. I thought he was ten years older than that.
There’s a reason embiid has shit on us 13 times in a row. We have had the worst center rotation in the league for like 5 years now. Maybe aside from that one year we had Dwight but he was still trying to do too much back then. Mj really has tried to do absolutely nothing making us suffer with Cody zeller who’s made of glass and acquisitions such as Roy hibbert marshal plumlee and bismack biyombo again
LaMelo  PJ Washington   Miles Bridges  Jalen McDaniels  Terry Rozier  Devonte Graham  Cody Zeller
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
How is Cody Zeller doing for ya?
Un-popular pick: Cody Zeller
"Wood is such a weird story. I was pretty high on him when Charlotte signed him in his second year. On paper he had all the tools to be a rotation big on a bad team.   Like even if he had zero basketball IQ, the 2016-17 Hornets should have been perfect for him- back then, if you could run pick and roll and kinda rebound and hustle a bit on defense, you could play center in Steve Clifford's system, and quite well at that.  Yet Wood saw a grand total of 107 minutes on a team that rolled out the following players at C/PF:  Cody Zeller - the incumbent started, played 62 games, starting most of them and playing 27mpg. The Hornets went 3-17 in his absence.  Frank Kaminsky - in his 2nd season, he played 75 games at 26mpg  Spencer Hawes - played 35 games, 18mpg before being traded  Roy Hibbert - played 42 games at 16mpg  Miles Plumlee - played 13 games 13mpg after a trade  Mike Tobey - played 2 games. His most memorable moment is because of our announcer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17do6ATYT_U  Johnny O'Bryant - played 4 games prior to an injury  Wood never even received an opportunity to get consistent minutes with that PF/C rotation. He must've really rubbed his coaches the wrong way or something, it made absolutely no sense at the time, and way less now."
Greatest prospect since rookie Cody Zeller
"The Hornets. I saw Cody Zeller at the theaters before here in salt lake, with Spencer Hawes and Tolliver (I think). They were kinda blocking my view but the theater was empty since it was super late at night so my friends and I moved up a row. We laughed super loud during a scene and Spencer Hawes jumped up because he thought nobody was behind him. The film? Wolf of Wall Street."
"im interested to see what stone does with the 4 FRP he got in trades this offseason. if the season is going well by the trade deadline, i could see a potential trade for a solid big man (tho it also depends on whos available)  maybe if the raps arent doing great, a trade for baynes? or cody zeller? tho i dont think we've got the salary to make a zeller trade, would prob need a 3rd team. or, potentially try and swing big for myles turner  if harrison barnes wasnt on such a big contract that we cant afford, id love to pick him up too. him and wood in the front court kinda make up for each others weaknesses (outside of rebounding)"
Cody Zeller.
"Ahh yes. The twin towers, two of the best centers to ever do it. Cody “Godzeller” Zeller and Bismack“no points” Biyombo"
Ok but they still can’t contain Cody Zeller
I’m 90% sure that the warriors will not trade steph curry and James wiseman for terry rozier and Cody zeller
smh cody zeller would never miss that
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn’t have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year’s. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte’ Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We’ve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he’s definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he’s still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We’re still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we’re young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we’ve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
"Giannis has been put on posters quite a bit, even getting dunked on by cody zeller but he's one of the most popular players in the league."
Shot 12-35 and French Cody Zeller got eaten alive by Embiid but yea refs
"look, I get it, you're missing key players, but every team does, especially this season.  Hornets were missing Gordon, Devonte Graham and Cody Zeller (3 starters) through most of this road trip."
"dont think dlo and beasley can be compared to cody zeller and graham, but it is worrying kat cant dominate biyombo cause every other premier big in the league shits on us."
donovan mitchell is a 6th man and rudy gobert is french cody zeller
Naw Cody Zeller
"Damn Kemba with a slow start in Celtics, before it was Kemba against the world now its Scary terry and the talented new hornets seems to see them hopefully in the playoffs they just need one big that's it. I mean Cody Zeller is meh and he can come off the bench i just don't know who they could actually sign for the starter roster."
Caruso doesn't look that bad since he completely shaved his head so I still gotta go with Cody Zeller
Cody Zeller is at least 48
It’s Cody zeller
Cody Zeller or Joe Ingles
"* Overrated: not really anyone is super overrated but it’s either Hayward or LaMelo. Both are good players, but have flaws. Hayward is good but seems to refuse to take over games and goes cold, two things he needs to avoid to put him in that caliber of “great” player. He doesn’t deserve to be an All-Star, but he was discussed as a candidate and mentioned in some snub lists. Melo is fairly rated by most (good passer, acceptable shooter/defender, super high effort/energy) but the Ball stans waayyy overrate him.   * Underrated: Cody Zeller. I don’t think most neutrals realize how big an impact Cody has on this team. We need a C who can pass and move- that’s Cody. Over the past few years, whenever Cody has been out, we’ve lost games. I don’t think he’s exceptional at any one skill, but I also don’t think he has any huge, glaring limitations. He’s just solid, reliable, a metronome relative to Biz’s stock market ticker."
"Lamelo, Lebron, with your announcers and casual Miles Bridges and Cody Zeller murders would make me basketball horny all 96 games"
"Highlight is not posted on this sub, but I don't remember seeing cody lower his shoulder at all and I can't find it. You got a replay? They didnt even mention zeller lowering his shoulder when the call was challenged, they just said cody didn't give him enough time to react."
Cody Zeller is the GOAT at posterizing Giannis.
&gt; Hornets nobody would care.  If bald white guys are hot right now then Cody Zeller is wondering where his endorsements are.
"If he wants to start over Christian Wood, he's going to want 35mpg when his competition is Cody Zeller."
"Cody Zeller man.....shave that hair off, jesus christ."
"This might be a blessing for Cody Zeller, who gets his bashed in every other game"
"jonas V, marc gasol, Cody Zeller. What do they all have in common? They are currently more agile and athletic than Boogie rn. Man can't play a lick of PnR Defense and he thinks he should still get superstar calls but usually gets laughed at while 9 other players run back."
"Wait, you’re telling me paying Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, and drafting Frank the Tank Kaminsky are mistakes?"
"Big handsome: Cody zeller, he’s a big man but far from handsome"
I think Cody Zeller was my math teacher
I don’t think it’s because he’s white. I think it’s more because his premature balding makes him look middle aged lol. The might have said the same about Cody Zeller but they wouldn’t have said the same thing about Herro or Myers Leonard.
"Hornets fans: Yeah ok, I’d still rather have Cody Zeller tho"

"I dunno, but Cody Zeller had a standing vert of 35.5” in the combine, which is the highest of anyone above 6’9” in over a decade."
Thaddeus Young and Cody Zeller  *that’s it*
"Hard dissagree. We have a good 4 guard rotation which we use very well. Our success this season has come through having those guards, especially since Graham has been hurt. We'd be giving up THE best catch and shoot guy in the league for an inefficient post up guy who doesnt run the floor. Zeller fills his role as a rebounder and screen setter while also having the ability to playmake out of the high post. Drummond can rebound but he refuses to screen, he doesnt run the floor like Cody does and he turns all of his post ups into shot attempts that rarely go in."
"I mean, look at the rest of the east. The sixth and seventh seeds are currently a Hornets team starting Cody Zeller that has no three point defense, and a Knicks team with absolutely no spacing. So many teams in the east have issues that hold them back. This Magic has a huge amount of defensive length, plus Vooch’s shooting breakout + the addition of Cole fixes their spacing. And Fournier/TRoss/Bamba/Birch/Bacon is much better depth than most eastern teams."

28 Year Old Cody Zeller took everyone's baldness traits for himself
"Hell yes I would, fucking Cody zeller just made Jonas valancunias look like prime shaq."
I think you’re underrating Plumlee to be honest. Easily better than Jokic and Embiid. I’d even put him up in the top tier of centers with Whiteside and Cody Zeller.
Cody Zeller def makes the all-wouldn’t-flop-that-way-with-4-seconds-left team
bizmack biyombo and cody zeller against valencinuas and gorgui dieng seems less than ideal.
Cody zeller made valancunias look like prime shaq and our entire defensive scheme made their role players look like unanimous mvp steph curry
Sure.  Cody Zeller would never flop the exact same way with 4 seconds left in a 1-point game.
Not right now but in the future most likely yea. I mean LaMelo is nice but *the team clearly is not ready for a run yet*. Cody Zeller + Bismack Biyombo are not centers you can get out of the Eastern Conference playoffs with lmao.
Nah. MJ/Mitch Kupchak(GM) had the bases loaded and needed a clean up hitter.   &amp;nbsp;  Draft Sleepers &amp;nbsp;  Malik Monk 2017  Miles Bridges 2018 traded draft day  Cody Zeller(Questionable addition) &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Expensive Mercenaries(Surprisingly from the Celtics) &amp;nbsp;  Terry Rozier  Gordon Hayward
I have him on the bench most nights instead of Cody Zeller on my fantasy team. It's such a crazy thing to wrap my head around.
"Underrated: Cody Zeller. The Hornets instantly got better with Biyombo out of the lineup. Our system is ball-movement heavy, and having Biyombo's stone hands in the center was an easy way to kill offense. Zeller can actually execute a drive and kick or catch the ball in the post, that's huge for our offense. He's also better on defense than Biz, Biz is too immobile to hang with all but the slowest of Cs. Cody can actually move around.   Overrated: Terry Rozier. People look at Terry's stats (19/4/3) and assume he's playing well. But those averages are emblematic of the law of averages. Terry will go for 45 one night on 11/18 shooting, then 9 points on 4/18 the next night. He's incredibly streaky, but doesn't have an off switch for when he's playing poorly. He can kill our offense by chucking inopportune shots, but he has gotten much better at this. His defense is also heinous; he's undersized at 6'2"", which doesn't help him, but he can be guilty of ball watching or zoning out; some nights he'll clearly be more focused on defense than others. He's a good player and been solid for us, but he's more of a LouWill bench adrenaline shot than a true starting level SG."

cody zeller looks like the type of dude that complains his back hurts but he'll still mow his lawn.
"I was really hoping you were the same guy that made the Cody Zeller thread.  Edit: Also, to answer your question, the same way KG's hoods work and stick to the side of his bald head, I imagine."
That's true.  I guess Cody Zeller is always too injured to be the starter.
"Kyle Anderson vs Cody Zeller, matchup of the century."
Sabonis   “DPOY” candidate Myles Turner been slipping of late got absolutely embarrassed by Cody zeller the other night
cody zeller
"Main observations:   - Game was won imo because of Indy's turnovers (pretty embarassing ball security overall and carelessness) and the free throws certainly helped when we decided to actually make them. Indy just looked pretty flat throughout. Lack of Sabonis and Brogdon also helped   - Wanamaker was prolly our best guard tonight lmao imagine saying that   - Add another injury to the list smfh. Three of the four best scorers now out.    - Loved the resilience and grind by the guys to get through with the injuries that we had after that horrible loss on national telly. If Hayward is out for a while Terry can't be shooting so poorly because when his shot isn't falling things can get ugly.   - Big games by Goaty Zeller and Miles. Love to see that    - If we make the playoffs, this is the C rotation that would be best. Ideal would be Biz no more than 6 minutes at the start of each half and big Cody and PJ C minutes"
Against the Hornets with Biyombo and Cody Zeller. Not so much against teams with big men who can dominate.   Still love Claxton as an option to close.

"I think people heavily underestimated Terry Rozier and Hayward while just letting your young guys fly under their radar. Y’all have decent depth everywhere except the 5. And even then, Cody Zeller isn’t the absolute worrrsttt center."
You know your center depth is bad when cody zeller is eating you alive. Game high +15
"You sure? The only non-bust of the top 5 picks was Oladipo and even he’d be disappointing as a number one overall pick. Next all star was Giannis at 15, the entire first half of the draft was complete shit. Cavs managed to somehow take the stinkiest of all the shit but they’re still getting mocked years later if they take Alex Len, Otto Porter, or Cody Zeller."
"&gt; I assume half of the TPEs will expire unused...  They have a ton of cap to use up too.  They can do some interesting things for restricted free agents, but they are going to have to overpay some people while those picks play out.   But who is signing with them?  Oladipo and Cody Zeller?"
" Russel Westbrick.... It doesn't matter that he is averaging a triple double, he is a still a bum who can barely dunk and can not dribble the basketball. He is no better than my favorite basketball player Cody Zeller!!! He is better than him in almost every facet of the game!!! Russel Westbum doesn't deserve this.   Sincerely, SCPFANMOVIEMAKER (I'm 12)"
I mean the reality is that Balls minutes are being replaced with more Graham and Monk and those are both very good players.   Whereas if we lost Cody Zeller who is an objectively worse player than Ball it would fuck our team since we would play Biz for 30 minutes a game.
I know this isn’t fair but Cody zeller is way too bald for a 28 year old guy
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"
Cody zeller turns into Lebron for one series only
"Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Devonte Graham. Maybe PJ Washington. I'd say the hornets have been more affected by injuries."
Cody Zeller is not better than Nerlens Noel LMAO I cannot believe you actually think that  Have fun overpaying for Andre Drummond or Daniel Theis or some shit
"Devonte Graham is the 4th guard on your team and you desperately need a center. His value has tanked this year and he's not going to magically get more playing time now that LaMelo hath arrived.  Noel and Graham are the same age, are both expiring, and the trade would fill a need for both teams. Graham isn't moving the needle for the Hornets or helping against elite teams either. In fact, he's been ridiculously inefficient this year.   Noel is better than Cody Zeller and Biyombo. He's a clear upgrade for the Hornets and has not been injured this season even with Thibs minutes."
I don't think Noel would start over Cody Zeller
"Agreed they should trade Graham because obviously he is still on his rookie deal &amp; since lamelo is only going to grow &amp; become a star plus if they package a bigger contract with graham in a trade it could be worth it , tbh surprised they haven’t tried getting Drummond so they have a forsure C instead of starting Cody Zeller considering they are above .500 &amp; with lamelo only going to grow in the future why not get him some playoff experience as a rookie to help him grow even more."
"Hm. I think Gordon Hayward, Goran Dragic, Payton Pritchard, ~~Tyler Herro~~, Duncan Robinson, Cody Zeller, and Doug McDermott are more similar to Larry Bird than Kevin Durant is."
"Someone that has the athleticism and verticality to be able to catch lobs and finish dunks, at the 5 meaning as a Center (positions are numbered 1 through 5). A good example is if you look at the sixers, our main 5s/centers are Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard. Embiid’s obviously amazing, but he’s not much of a lob threat. He doesn’t get up in the air super quickly, he’s quick on his feet moving around but he’s not jumping out of the gym on a consistent basis. Dwight has a far more limited skillset, but he’s a terrific lob threat. He has a huge “catch radius” meaning he has a lot of range for where passers can put the ball on an alley oop, it doesn’t need to be perfectly placed.   LaMelo is an incredible passer, and plays extremely well at a fast pace and in transition, and having a center who is a true lob threat (compared to Cody Zeller and Bismarck Biyombo who are not), would benefit both players a lot."

Which means guys like Mason Plumlee and Cody Zeller have better ratios than a guy drafted as a combo guard
Just wait until Cody Zeller goes into playoff mode. He's gonna go super sayain like Goku and average 20-15 on 60% shooting... from three
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
Yea but Cody Zeller went at 4 and hes the goat
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Our coach staff confused Cody Zeller with Cody Martin and Cody Martin with Caleb Martin.  Our entire game plan got thrown out the window.
"We already had Cody zeller, but I see your point."
Cody Zeller and then the Clippers as a franchise
"Trade Zach LaVine, Wendell Carter, and 2 1sts for Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo, then fire myself"
"Baby discount warriors vibes  Rozier = Monta ellis  Lamelo = curry  Malik monk = no defense discount klay  Pj Washington = dray  Cody zeller = white center (David Lee, zaza, bogut)"
On the flip side Cody Zeller had one that lingered for an entire off-season and likely caused other knee problems that had him in and out of the lineup for like 3 years.
You can get a better expiring than Dipo. Dude was an allstar a few years ago. Get lik Cody zeller or some shit 😂
Yeah Cody Zeller has a brother named Tyler who played for the Celtics once upon a time
Cody Zeller and Mason Plumlee
"In my eyes in the not distant future the team that have a lot of great pieces but not a experience coach, Charlotte, Michael hired kupchak and he draft well, and have a a couple of good free agents and a couple of good trades.  And look the roster having a future ROY in melo, and another great picks, pj Washington, devonte graham and miles bridges. Having a great players in a good age bracket, Gordon Hayward and scary terry, a couple of ok role players in Biyombo and Cody Zeller. And a great thing is that the team can improve a lot with a couple of trades for a couple of veterans. Good roster and ok management. A great job for a experience coach. Maybe I’m stretching things, but I really thing Melo can become a great player."
"Drummond hate has got to the point where he’s seriously underrated IMO. He’s not a max player but he’s certainly no worse than Adams or Cody zeller. Adams just got a 17mil extension, Robin Lopez got 7mil ffs. I think he’s worth 12-15mil a year at min"
I. Fucking. Love. Eric Collins 🥺 I thoroughly enjoy hearing him call every Hornets game. This article made me so happy 🤓  I love when he yells “TERRY ROZIER!!!!!” And I swear I heard him make a crack about Cody Zeller balding and I cried laughing 🤣
Cody zeller to the moon
Shit I'd throw LaMelo in there just so you don't have to type Cody Zeller when talking about top players
"I'm not even sure the Hornets *have* 12 viable great players. Kemba, Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Glen Rice, Dell Curry, Muggsy Bogues, Gerald Wallace, Gerald Henderson, Al Jefferson, Emeka Okafor, Baron Davis, Cody Zeller?"
"Like could you get Cody Zeller as a backup big. Would Reddick take a discount. I'd be down for Olynyk even.   Just get Fournier back and use the rest of the TPE is a good deal.   Then sub out Grant, Carsen, Semi, Kornet and maybe even Langford for proven vets."
Cody zeller with some of the best D i’ve seen on Jokic this year
"Kat has played more games than gordon hayward at this point, monk has played 2 more games than dlo. Terry has been relatively healthy for us but devonte has missed 15 games, cody zeller 24 games, then u got shit like miles in health and safety protocol now. Our squad has been banged the fuck up man its not really that far off you guys."
This is how I feel towards the hornets because my player got drafted there in 2k21. Unbelievable how bad Miles Bridges and Cody Zeller are in that game
Longevity only really helps if you're above average. Like someone like Dell Curry. Upgrading from Cody Zeller should have been a priority for the last 4 years.
Is Cody Zeller lowkey a top 10 Hornet?
"The full list is   DJ Augustin, Bismack Biyombo, Cody Zeller, Kemba Walker, Garrett Temple, Jared Dudley, Anthony Tolliver , Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (unsigned this season)"
I watch the game last night.  Cody Zeller made a lay up and that guy almost creamed his pants
"He took a little bit of getting used to, especially coming off Steve Martin who was the classic PBP guy.   But after his first season, he really grew on me. He genuinely seems excited when things happen. His dynamic with Dell Curry is also great - Dell is a fantastic straight man to EC’s enthusiasm.   The pair also does a great job being fans of the Hornets while not being homers - a couple games ago, Cody Zeller took an elbow to the face that resulted in 5 stitches in his mouth. A lot of announcing teams would have been FLAGRANT TWO THROW HIM OUT but EC and DC were like “nope, basketball play, keep it moving”.   Also, EC (and I’m sure his producers) most underrated thing: he will find some random historical facts related to somebody on the opposing team and how it relates to the hornets/Charlotte/NC and they are almost always fascinating. It’s usually random stuff like “so and so is the 5th leading scorer in North Carolina high school history” and then he will quiz Dell on the top 4.   It’s great."
"His contract is 3 years $40 million. Players who make around that: taurean prince, patty mills, Cody zeller, Davis Bertans, Rudy gay, justice Winslow, dion waiters. Kuzma has been big for us all year if you watch the games. And what are you on about we kept him over lonzo? There was no way we kept lonzo or BI in that deal."
Drummond is basically Cody Zeller
Also Every time Cody zeller does something athletic I feel like I’m watching a deepfake
"Considering how Drummond has never played well at any point in his career, yeah I’d be very surprised. I’d also be very surprised if Cody Zeller suddenly turned into prime Shaq and led the Hornets to a 16-0 playoff run."
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."

Cody Zeller. Like a Pure Moods CD come to life.

I'd rather go with...   PG: Alex Caruso SG: Brian Scalabrine SF: Joe Ingles PF: Cody Zeller C: DJ Mbenga
" No, he’d have to play against Cody Zeller"
"Hornets protect:  Ball, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, Monk (RFA rights), Graham (RFA rights), McDaniels, Hayward*  Hornets leave unprotected:  Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin  UFAs unable to be claimed:  Biyombo, Zeller, Wanamaker, Riller, Darling  --  * I would honestly consider leaving Hayward unprotected- I really don't think an expansion team would want him taking up so much cap room given they operate under a reduced cap for the first couple years, it would be incredibly restrictive. But I do think that Hayward does have some amount of trade value,  so we shouldn't risk it just to save Vernon Carey, who would definitely get snatched up by an expansion team."
"He does hunt for blocks but he is an excellent defensive player by basically all metrics. To the eye test he really stands out, particularly his length and shot blocking. The Pacers’ defense total collapsed without him, which is proof of his value. And, if you prefer advanced stats, 538’s defensive RAPTOR ranked him as the fifth best defender in the league, behind Gobert, Poetl, Thybulle, and Capela. While I do think his blocks (and block hunting) make him look better to both the eye test and to advanced stats, he is one of the league’s best defenders- maybe not DPOY level, but certainly All-Defense level and  a huge upgrade over Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo.  In reference to your other comment, I think it’s unfair to expect Turner to be a one-man defensive anchor. NBA defense is inherently team based, and the Pacers are a team with extremely poor defensive personnel. The switched far too much for what they had, and Sabonis being a massive defensive liability who happened to occupy the same position didn’t help Turner. Aside from that, how many guys are offense-altering defensive anchors in this league? Gobert, Draymond, Simmons? Poetl, Capela, and Bam are all great defensive Cs but don’t have that kind of impact- maybe you can argue Turner isn’t DPOY level because of that, but he’s still a huge defensive positive and not just a stat hunter."
"To any Clipps fan that wants to slander Zubac; I got a fresh Bismack Biyombo for you. Or a nice, balding Cody Zeller."
Just wait until Cody Zeller puts it all together next year
"Shoulder injuries are a different category for NBA players vs. knee injuries. Kobe had rotator cuff surgery in 2015 and came back fine. Patty Mills, Cody Zeller, and Tyler Johnson have all had shoulder surgeries.   If you were a pitcher, a torn labrum might be a potential career ended. But it doesn’t seem to be the case in basketball."
having to watch the combo of bizmack byimbo and cody zeller has me feeling DESPERATE
"And ends up drafting Anthony Bennett, Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len with the top 5 picks"
You can’t look at me with a straight face and compare Porzingis to Cody Zeller 😂
"Because he cant. Why would a team run plays for cody zeller? It doesnt work, he cant even use his size like Boban can."
Which might say something about his Thibs-Lite style of veteran heavy play. When he left Charlotte and we fired the entire medical staff suddenly only the old heads like Cody Zeller stayed brittle.
"Kemba, Bismack, DJ Augustin, honestly lost after that.   I want to say Cody Zeller at least was drafted a bobcat? Maybe he’s on there  EDIT: he was."
"Kemba, MKG, Cody Zeller, Biyombo  All I got"
Fuck Cody Zeller is only 28?
Frank Kaminsky  Cody Zeller  Wily Hernangomez  Goga Bitadze  Mason Plumlee
"&gt; but Centers just aren't that valuable   Yes they are.  &gt; You can get a guy who gives you 70% of Aytons production on both ends, for like $10m.  No, you really cannot.  $15M gets you Cody Zeller and a 10/7.  $11M buys you Dwight Powell and a nightly 8/5.  Ayton is giving the Suns an 18/12 *in the playoffs*, and he's still only 22 years old and improving.  Capela would get better than 5/$90M if he hit the market today."
God KP for Cody Zeller would make me so happy as a low key Dallas fan
" Along with Joe Harris, Frank Kaminsky, Grayson Allen, TJ McConnell, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Tyler Herro, Myles Leonard, Cody Zeller, Gordon Hayward. LOVE those guys. First team all class."
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Have you seen Cody Zeller lately?
Or of Cody Zeller growing his hair out like Dirk.
&gt;Will lebron finally go bald or *will he grow his hair out like Duncan?*  This has the same chances of happening as Cody Zeller winning Finals MVP lmao
"Kwame is not saying he wasn't a bust. He is just sick and tired of his name being used as a punchline when he was a serviceable player that lasted 12 years in the league. His only crime was getting drafted No. 1 and he didn't draft himself. PG13% is not personal, it's a joke. If someone gets on TV calling him a scrub, saying he is less than a player or a fraud who fleeced the Clippers then that's personal. MJ has drafted several busts from Adam Morrison to Cody Zeller to Frank Kaminsky why don't they get similar disrespect? Kobe also played with several other busts too. Let him be. He has retired. I am surprised he waited 20 years to finally fire back at these idiots. It took way too long. Should have happened a mighty long time."
"Context is key here. The 3 players picked after Bennett were Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter, and Cody Zeller. The 3 guys after Darko were Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwayne Wade."
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
Cody zeller is trash man...
Hear me out:   Cody Zeller with Trez's grill.
"Better Defender? Cody Zeller might be the worst defensive big in the league. He’s statistically the 9th worst defensive center in the NBA.  Better than guys like Metu (who?), Hermangomez, Damian Jones, as well as the corpse of LMA.  I’m a Hornets fan and have been listening to homers defend this guy since he went 4th overall. He sucks! Just stop.   There was a clown on the sub (Hornets) saying he was a top 10 center. I was called an idiot because I disagreed.  Cody Zeller isn’t good. And he sucks at defense. Maybe my fellow hornet fans will stop thinking he’s so awesome when he’s not wearing purple and teal."
"He is worse than Zeller, at least for the Hornets. Cody is a better passer and a better defender, issue is he can't stay healthy. Trez is an undersized C with no outside game who's bad at defense, he provides great bench offense but that's not what we need. We need someone who can lock down the paint, pass well/execute a basic drive and kick (cough cough Biyombo), and hang with the bigger centers like Embiid."
Cody Zeller would like a word.
Have you seen Cody Zeller play basketball?
Came here looking for this too. The only thing i will say though is that the reasons he was ahead of zeller is due to poor Cody being as tough as  Papier-mâché.
The Cody Zeller slander has gone too far
The one who got paid $205 million to shut down Cody Zeller
Cody Zeller over Biz  ^^^please
"He could stay with Golden State until he’s 50, he could retire now, Cody Zeller could become a superstar leading to Curry wanting to play with him in Charlotte, or he could think Utah’s a cool place to live. Anything could happen."
"Steven Adams, Andre Drummond, Cody Zeller, Mason Plumlee. Those kinds of guys are overhated because they don’t fit mainstream conventions of what a basketball fan thinks makes a good center. Fact is that they come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Not every good center is a floor spacer, efficient scorer, or switchable defender. That said, that does not make them bad players because they all have pretty great talent, it’s just not as visible as it would be with a center who fits into the modern paradigm."
I’ll answer my own question here because I just thought of it. Cody Zeller Hornets
"What a braindead take. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is in a league above Cody Zeller, and I don't want to hear anyone challenge his rightful title."
When did Cody Zeller become the GOAT?  As we all know Cody is already considered GOAT and I don't think you can argue otherwise unless otherwise unless you just really hate Cody. Right now it's a pretty clear 1.) Zeller 2.) Herro  What about you?
"The Hornets just had bad injuries throughout the season. Lamelo, Hayward, Cody Zeller, and several others each missed games due to injury. Whenever it seemed like the team had weathered an injury crisis, new ones popped up. It's no surprise we fell so hard."
"Don't expansion teams automatically get the top pick in the draft? Like Seattle gets #1, Vegas gets #2, then Vegas picks first from the player pool?   If you're Seattle and you go in knowing you have Cade, that changes things dramatically. I also think you focus on free agency (you have crazy money to work with, starting from scratch) and use the expansion draft to round it out.   I'd get Cade, then pursue solid guys in free agency who I know are probably going to go for the bag, or young guys you could overpay and gamble on. Guys like Otto Porter Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Cody Zeller, Doug McDermott, Lauri Markkanen, Malik Monk.   Then in the expansion draft add Winslow, Thompson, Okogie, Okpala, Holiday, Arcidiacono  Cade/Payton/Arcidiacono  Monk/A. Holiday/Okogie  Hardaway/Porter/Winslow  Markkanen/McDermott/Melli  Zeller/Thompson/Okpala  I think this team has a good balance of young guys and vets, it makes up for a lack of star power with depth, it'll be about as competitive as an expansion team can be.  Good spacing, good size, nobody too old."
"Don't look now, Cody Zeller is 7-7 FG.   Though Sabonis did outrebound him 21-3"
"Poor Cody Zeller, dude was balling just for these bums to wet the bed"
"clown on lamelo all you want he's still a teenager and his best teammate at the moment is cody zeller  he'll be just fine, he's very talented"
I think vet is the wrong word. They need a proven winner whose playoff tested. They need a leader who knows what it takes to win games. Cody Zeller hasn't been on many good teams but correct me if I'm wrong
I missed this game cause of work I just checked the box score  how the fuck is rozier 7-20 and cody zeller 7-7
Tfw Cody Zeller is the best Hornet on the floor tn
Cody Zeller is the lead scorer on the same team as Scary Terry and LeMelo...
Disrespectful to Cody Zeller
I'm just here to watch Cody Zeller get a perfect game
Is Cody Zeller the best center in the NBA?
Cody Zeller gone make the comeback himself. FEED the big man.
"Cody Zeller is the only one playing NBA level basketball for the Hornets tonight. Rozier and Graham insist on taking trash shots. Inconsistent defense. Inexperience is hurting the rest of the roster, LaMelo / PJ / Miles are deer in headlights."

Cody Zeller
"I'm not at all really sold on the idea, as I don't really see the fit.   If you let Lonzo play the 2, he's not nearly as great of a scorer as Terry is in that position. LaMelo definitely isnt as well.   If you play either of them at the 3, you completely make no use out of Gordon Hayward (when healthy).   LaMelo at the 4 and Lonzo at the 1 is something I'd do in 2K, and itd probably be fun as hell, but I know it's not at all practical. Plus, I'd like to see Miles play starter minutes at the 4 next year.   I like the idea of the Ball Brothers together, because the hype would be stupid, and LaVar would lose his mind out of pure bliss. But I don't think we're the team for this.   We have so many other problems to deal with, getting another guard isnt one of them. Please, someone free me from watching Cody Zeller, Biz, and PJ at the 5. We've needed a real C for the last 5 years."
Cody Zeller
"You need big men *period* and the market is really thin. It's like a Plan C, when I see Holmes returning to Sacramento, Allen getting paid by Cleveland or getting traded, and the next level of alternative is like Cody Zeller or Daniel Theis."
"Jordan takes a percentage of Jordan Brand revenue. He is literally making money off jersey sales from every team with statement jerseys and has the ability to potentially tamper with endorsements such as Cody Zeller, Bismarck Biyombo, Kemba, and MKG all having Jordan endorsers at some point while playing for the bobcats/hornets. If MJs conflict of interest is okay then everyone’s should be okay."
"You’re probably correct. Which begs the question — why didn’t they select anyone taller to the select team either? One of two purposes of the select team is to scrimmage against the main team, to help prepare them for what awaits them at the Olympics. I get there are few great US 7ft-ers, but at least bring in someone like a Cody Zeller or Whiteside or anybody and park his tall ass in the middle of the paint."
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
I feel like Cody Zeller is perfect for international ball. He moves and rolls really well and plays smart team oriented basketball
"All three Plumlees, Cody Zeller and Kevin Love."
Cody Zeller ? 😂😂😂
"Kuzma's hustle is nice but not after he negates all his hard work with bone headed plays.  Kuzma is a sieve on defense makes Andre Drummond look like a future DPOY candidate.  Kuzma is not just on defensive assignments he is thoroughly embarrassed. MPJ cooked him multiple possessions in a row in the year of the title run.  Plus dont get it twisted, Drummond is out for his next big deal and will be putting effort.  I just dont see who the Lakers can sign besides Drummond to back up AD.   Here are the Lakers most realistic options for free agents. Gasol/Trez was a terrible replacement for Dwight/McGee. They need a quality back up C to eat up minutes for AD.  Here are the top free agents for the Lakers: Nerlens Noel, Cody Zeller, Kanter, Whiteside  **Zeller** - 27 years old - 9 pts /7 rebounds/ 2 assists on the Hornets in 20 minutes  **Noel** - 27 years old - 5 pts/6 rebounds/2 blocks on the Knicks in 25 minutes   **Whiteside** - 32 years old - 8 pts/6 rebounds/1 block on the Kings in 15 minutes  **Drummond** - 27 years old - 12 pts/7 rebounds/ 1 block on the Lakers in 25 minutes  Besides Noel (and maybe Whiteside although he only was asked to play 15 minutes a game on the Kings) who else can the Lakers go after?  Only way the Lakers arent bringing Drummond back is if he asks for some ungodly amount of money."

"I think 2014 just has Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Marcus Smart  2013 is Cody Zeller, CJ McCullom, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Rudy Gobert  Pretty much it’s only the top players in any given draft and Cody Zeller who stays with their team 7+ years"
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
I'd rather have Cody Zeller on 4/56  -Rich Cho probably
2018 Dwight wasn't even as good as 2018 Cody Zeller
Biyombo + Cody Zeller.... Damn the league preaches parity and these two have been together for 5 years. Unacceptable
"The entire Warriors core 3 has been together a while but those other 2 pairs round out the top 5 I think. For comparison, the KD + Westbrook Thunder pair was 8 years. The Spurs Trio was 14+ years for every pair.  Giannis + Middleton: 8 years  Dame + CJ: 8 years  Green + Steph: 9 years   Klay + Steph 8 years (10, if you count Klay's injured seasons)  Klay + Green 7 years (9, if you count Klay's injured seasons)  Others with at least 5  Smart + Brown: 5 Years  Bismack Biyombo + Cody Zeller: 5 years (Biyombo left and came back)  Goran + Udonis (hey, he played 1 game this season unlike Klay): 6.5 years"
"Gordon Hayward, Cody Zeller, Mike Conley.  wished greg oden would've panned out. had to google some other ones. not many ""stars"", but Romeo langford and carsen edwards are some younger players  Edit: Forgot Eric Gordon and George Hill!"
"Then Cody zeller should’ve been invited, much better than love at this point"
Dario Saric is good but not quite as good as Cody Zeller
"Lakers had hobbled LeBron and AD. Jazz had half of Donovan and no Conley, sixers have half embiid, hornets had half of Cody Zeller"
He's a french cody zeller
he has less offensive tools than cody zeller.
We have 1 lightly used Cody Zeller the can give us picks for
" bledsoe has two years left, but last year is only guaranteed like $100k so its basically a one year contract. He's pretty much an expiring contract.  Adams goes down to $17mil/yr next season, for two seasons. Which is right above Ian Mahinmi and Cody Zeller"
yeah you think he would get minutes behind cody Zeller and biyombo ?
"i apparently was in an elevator with MJ and Pippen and another Bulls player when I was 3. My mom says I came up to Pippen's socks  I've seen Cody Zeller, Ben Gordon, Michael Carter-Williams, Gerald Henderson walking around uptown Charlotte during their stints with the team, and I think that's it. I also think I saw a Marvin Williams lookalike in my old apartment complex but I'm not quite sure it was him. the dude was tall but not sure he looked 6'9."
But imagine if the Bucks had Cody Zeller instead of Giannis and T.J. McConnel instead of Jrue. What would KD average? Lol
Are we taking competition into account? Because the league back then had way more scrappy gym rats if you know what I mean. Imagine KD playing against a league with a bunch more JJ Reddick and Cody Zeller kinda dudes lol he would feast
Swear everybody has a good game when Cody Zeller is playing. I was watching a highlight of Lauri Markenan and it was against Cody too. The hell
"well he made jumps at 25 and 26. I'm not holding my breath for yet another jump at 27 or 28, but we'll see. I'm not holding my breath for a massive cap jump either. Last time we thought there was going to be a cap explosion, we got the privilege of signing Nic Batum, Marvin Williams, Cody Zeller and took on Miles Plumlee for like a combined $60M in one season."
"isaiah thomas, khris middleton, timothe luwawu-cabarrot, marvin bagley, cody zeller  they beat the boston celtics once"
"This is awesome!! Table 3 is so weird, are you sure it's right? Half of the 4th overall picks are worse than Cody Zeller? In general this list seems like the players are worse than I expected. Maybe the best players have low average win shares per year because they play more years? Like, Wade and Dirk had really slowed down by the end but they kept playing. Or maybe it's because the best players are outliers so the median is below the mean? What players are nearest the mean? Sounds like you're enjoying playing around with this stuff and I think it's really interesting!"
Cody zeller averages about 40 games a season. If we don't get a 3rd string center we're fucked. Also still not back up PG so once again relying heavily on our starters.
Their bench defence probably got better since they won’t be playing Kanter and Melo together anymore. Cody Zeller alone makes their bench far more viable. I think they could surprise some people. Their starting lineup has been competent defensively despite starting Lillard and McCollum.
Cody Zeller and Alex Len would be a great duo.  Charlotte Hornets wet dream
"You're down the bottom, but you probably have the most realistic expectation. If you get an All-Star in the top 5 picks you're hitting above average, but a good starter seems about right.  Since 2010, All-Stars: Wall, Boogie, Kyrie, AD, Beal, Dipo, Embiid, KAT, Russell, Zinger, Simmons, Ingram, Brown, Tatum, Trae, Luka, Zion  Not All-Stars: Turner, Favors, Wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Kanter, Tristan, Valanciunas, MKG, Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Bennett, Otto, Cody Zeller, Len, Wiggins, Jabari, Gordon, Exum, Okafor, Hezonja, Bender, Dunn, Fultz, Lonzo, Josh Jackson, Fox, Ayton, Bagley, JJJ, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland"
"millsap is turning 37 next year and he didn't look great last year   james ennis isn't ""way better"" then any player in the nba   cody zeller however, is way better then biyombo"
Yes I would in fact trade Cody Zeller and Derrick Jones Jr. for these two
"Outside of the Antetokoumpo family, I don’t think it’s about diplomacy. I think it’s more about people believing those other guys could have some talent or physical ability close to their brothers/father, and they gotta prove it. For every example you said there’s many more of relatives than never got a chance or a contract, or not even 5 games on the NBA because they were not NBA players. David Stockton, Ralph Samson III, Glen Rice Jr, Drew Barry, Mychel Thompson, Patrick Ewing Jr, Shawn Kemp Jr, where’s the diplomacy with them?   Why would people go for diplomacy with Plumlee, Zeller, Gary Payton? What are they getting out of it? I don’t really get it from that diplomacy point of view, nobody is salivating to get Mason or Cody. Tyler and Miles got contracts because they showed something, both of them had at least one decent year at an NBA level. Gelo gotta prove something to get one.   You think Lamelo would go to a team that gave his brother a chance over going to a team that can pay him the max or give him the best chance of winning?"
"What???? Cody Zeller on the Olympic team??? In Rio? No. He didn't lmfao. Like, at all lol  Yes, I'm fully aware of Cody Zeller (go Hornets) being well liked, but to compare teams signing his other brothers (who were actually NBA players even for a short while) to the likes of how you're presenting this Gelo signing, is laughable at best, and borderline offensive at worst lol."
Why? I mean you realize Cody Zeller made the US olympic team in 2016right?   Clearly they’re well liked around the league. You don’t think teams consider the value of having a mouthpiece in the us men’s national team? Even if that mouthpiece is a brother tagging along for the ride.    To most teams that’s worth more than a minimum contract.
is this like how one of the Zellers and Plumlee's was always getting a contract because Cody Zeller and Mason Plumlee were starter level players?
ya know who else isn’t a dog? Cody Zeller. but he’s started 3 years straight for the Hornets. If you can bring other things to the table you can still carve a name for yourself.
"I mean, I think you have to incorporate the alternatives. Oladipo’s had a few good seasons, but it’s not like Cody Zeller or Otto Porter Jr. have been blowing the league out of the water. The next three selections after Darko are all automatic HOFers."
Cody Zeller is gonna be the last piece they need for a ring
Cody Zeller?
I'm actually just surprised Dame hasn't demanded a trade already after the off season/free agency they just had. Man lit a fire under the Trailblazers FO's ass to get him some help and I think the biggest thing they did was re-sign Powell...Powell is great but do they think that's enough to keep Lillard happy? Is Cody Zeller *really* that missing piece? He's an upgrade over Zach Collins sure but that's not saying all that much.  They didn't have to blow their load and overpay on guys but damn man...they did nothing in this off-season that pushes them pass the first round of the playoffs.
"MJs real obsession is just with college guys who were NCAA tournament stars or who had lots of hype in college.   Since he took over with final basektball say in 2006   2006: Adam Morrison---NCAA star tons of hype   2008: DJ Augustin--1st team all American, SI cover boy  2009: Gerald Henderson--Dukie well known commodity especially amongst people in North Carolina   2011: Kemba Walker: Tourney hero rare pick that worked out like this   2013: Cody Zeller: All American, on a no 1 seed Indiana team  2015: Frank Kaminsky: Big name on a Wisconsin team that made the Finals  2017: Malik Monk: SEC player of the year, shooting/scorer on an elite 8 Kentucky team.  The scouting drafting process is akin to what I wouldve done in high school ""Who was the flashiest biggest name most recently on a stage like the NCAA tournament that's left? That's who I want""."
"Just insane that the Hornets started Al Jefferson, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, AND Cody Zeller (who attempted 1 3-pointer all 2014-15 season) together. Absolutely ZERO spacing.  Edit: MKG didn't attempt a single 3-pointer that season! Lmao!!"
"I’m so tired of this narrative behind pushed:   They added Ben McLemore, Cody Zeller, and Tony Snell aka The Needle Movers"
And dame is stuck in the west with CJ and his FO got him cody zeller and ben mclemore after years of disappointment. Oh and he's 31.
"&gt;We just hired a new coach, and despite what dumbass fans of other teams say, had a pretty solid off-season in terms of bolstering our bench defense. While I would like to see CJ traded, it doesn't look like that will be the case.  You lose me here. Dame, by his own admission, said ""this team isn't good enough and a coaching change won't be enough either to make us a contender"". You've added Tony Snell and Cody Zeller, lost Kanter and Melo, and kept Nurkic, CJ, Norm, and Covington. It sounds exactly like the same team with a different coach.  This is the whole reason people keep talking, because Dame was pretty clear in wanting to compete for a championship and pressuring the front office to make a change. So far you're talking about two bench pieces, Dame isn't dumb he knows this team would be in the same position. He literally said pretty much that, in the same press conference you quoted down in this thread"
Why is Portland not even asking around? Do they think Cody Zeller is enough of an upgrade to keep Dame?
"Ok go by what he said. His words earlier this summer was that the team “wasn’t good enough” and that a coaching change wouldn’t be enough. So far what has Portland done to address his concerns? They’ve signed Cody Zeller and Tony Snell so far…they have the exact same team more or less, that Dame publicly said wasn’t good enough. If he’s serious about wanting to compete for a championship, he knows his team is not at that level"
You guys got Cody Zeller! That’s a major dub!
"I am surprise Dame hasn't demanded a trade yet with Portland not making any impactful changes during FA (other than a new coach?).   Re-signing Powell (kind of a given) - but won't move the needle, just another undersized ISO scorer.   Signing Snell and Cody Zeller - not impactful.   Losing Melo and Zach - not too impactful either.   Just another waste of a year for Dame - I am guessing Dame is giving Billups a chance before he straight-up demand a trade."
"Probably just running the guys to see if they can actually play, though tbh I think only one of the trio could be regular contributor to the Blazers (ie play more than just garbage time minutes)  Michael Beasley has a realistic shot at making the Blazers roster, they need someone to replace Melo's production from the bench after all.  Mudiay is unlikely unless he's ok with being a 3rd string guard, or 4th. Blazers are pretty deep at that position with Dame/CJ/Norm/Simons.  Faried is an undersized center who doesn't defend or shoot the 3, and the Blazers already signed Cody Zeller to backup Nurkic. I don't really see a role for him on the Blazers tbh"
Dame: We need to make some changes to improve our team!   Olshey: Adds Cody Zeller and Tony Snell
"Edit, some of these only have 2 brothers but still cool: Or the McDaniels, the Zellers, Morrises, the Martins, Curry's, the late gasols, Rush's ect..  I challenge anyone to find more nba siblings on a roster than the hornets past two years  Last year 20-21 5 siblings : Cody, LaMelo, both martin twins, Jalen McDaniel  5 again 21-22: This year we lost Zeller and a martin but gained a plumlee and possibly liangelo"
"As is, the roster isnt good enough to make a deep playoff run. They got destroyed by Nuggets starting Campazzo and Austin Rivers. That should be a wake up call. The West is stacked as hell and in a year where tons of contenders were injured, they couldn’t make it out of the first round.  Olshey is also incompetent. Dame asked for help and they got fucking Cody Zeller and Tony Snell. That should tell you enough."
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
Smh not even adding the GOAT balding player Cody Zeller…
Cody Zeller with a hat on is surprisingly handsome
Dame PLEASE LEAVE PORTLAND. They signed Cody Zeller and Ben McLemore🤣🤣. Portland front office is wasting such a great talent with Dame. Sorry Dame get ready for another 1st round exit
I think cody zeller left charlotte dude
and low on gangly white guys without Zach Collins.  There's only so much Cody Zeller can do to hold up that mantle
Probably distracted how cody zeller was there best  FA signing beside re-signing Norm lmao
I wonder how much the lackluster Blazers offseason is affecting him. There was all that drama  before the Olympics and then almost nothing happened. Their major FA acquisitions were Tony Snell and Cody Zeller. Norm extension was basically the only good thing they did.
"I'm trying to delude myself into thinking Lauri would be a good signing but frankly he is just a bit shit isnt he?  Poor rebounder, atrocious defender adding to an already shit defensive team that lost two of our best defenders in the offseason (Malik and Cody Zeller)   We'll see though"
"PJ Washington was our best defensive center last year by a wide margin (it wasn’t a super hard competition though). He’s built like Draymond Green. He’s 6’8” with a 7’2”+ wingspan. He’s got a taller standing reach and longer wingspan than Cody Zeller, Draymond Green, and PJ Tucker.   As for Miles Bridges, he is better as a 4, but can play pretty well as a 3. That means a lineup of Bridges (SF), Markkanen (PF), and Washington (C) could theoretically work for short bursts."
"They also lost Zach Collins and Enes Kanter, and have brought in Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, and Ben McLemore. So, they have made some other moves, as well as re-signing Powell, but the question is if these move the needle for Dame. Either way, I think he lasts there until at least the trade deadline, if not into next offseason."
I actually think Cody Zeller might really help them if he can stay healthy (big if). Bench defense was their biggest problem last year.
Someone told him he got Cody Zeller and Tony Snell as his “big additions” when he gets home
The Cody Zeller disrespect
"It’s become an abusive relationship at this point.   Dame: “This isn’t working out. You can’t get your shit together, so I’m leaving.”  Portland: “Baby, I can change! Just give me a chance!”  -six months pass-  Dame: “Fuck your loser ass, I’m leaving from real this time.”  Portland: “C’mon baby, I signed Cody Zeller!”"
This is crazy.  Loyalty in a business is bullshit 9 times out of 10. Lillard has given them his all and the Blazers FO has been completely dicking around throughout this man's career. They seem perfectly content with just drawing fans in with Dame while doing the bare minimum. They clearly aren't serious about playoff success and I hope Dame sees through this.   No one can honestly believe the roster as is represent contenders. Imagine signing Cody Zeller and Tony Snell and then having the audacity to tell your superstar who has voiced he wants serious moves that.
“We got you Cody Zeller too. You want more? Now you’re just being unreasonable”
"Our starters dominated theirs, our bench got lit up badly. That's on Olshey. If we had a semi decent defensive 5 off the bench we would have likely taken this one out.   He clearly hasn't learned anything if he think an oft injured Cody Zeller fixes our defensive woes."
"""What? So you think that changing coaches and adding Snell, Cody Zeller McLemore isn't enough to make a team that lost in the first round against an injured Nuggets into a contender?"""
"This is not going to end well for the Blazers. Dame flat out called them out for not having a good enough roster, and they're essentially going to run it back with Cody Zeller and Tony Snell added. And they're still in the absolutely stacked West. I can't believe how badly Olshey is fumbling this."
"14: Cody Zeller, Tyler Zeller, Luke Zeller"
This hurts my feelings but yeah.   I don't think Cody Zeller is that much of an upgrade though.
"Although interesting that the blazers went after Cody Zeller rather than the much more durable Hassan for their very min backup center spot, even though he was decent with us and filled in for Nurk for almost an entire year. Obviously the Portlamd FO does not believe he is a good fit at the backup C spot."
I think he's down to fourth now that we signed Cody Zeller and Tony Snell.
well cody zeller is 6'11 250 pounds so he's definitely big
my boy neil olshey is exhausted already copping cody zeller was a big move for him
Adding Cody Zeller isn’t a big move?
I was hopeful too but with Cody Zeller leaving it will be tough for them

"I feel like you answered your own question when you typed out Cody Zeller, Ben McLemore and Tony Snell tbh."
Cody Zeller might literally die on the Blazers
He should be really excited to play with Tony Snell and Cody Zeller. Those are the guys that are going to bring him a championship.
Dame's *definitely* staying now that you've signed... Cody Zeller and Tony Snell! lmao
"I disagree  Plumlee one is actually the deal I am fine with and actually quite like. Cody Zeller, while better on both ends, was gonna leave, he made it clear. We needed a stopgap early doors and Mitch got one while also moving up twenty spots in the draft to select imo the best value pick of the four selections with JT Thor at 37  While Plumlee is very poor on defense, he at least brings similar stuff to Cody on offense with his athleticism and drive and kick ability. His contract is fine too    -----   Not extending your 23 lottery pick guard after he has shown improvement on both sides of the ball year after year is just so shortsighted   Devonte' too, like whatever, we got a lotto protected first. But now we're stuck with what Brad Wanamaker? Grant Riller? as the backup. George Hill is worse than both those players  The fact is all the reasonable free agents we can get are worse than Monk/Te' in my opinion    ----   All of his decisions I would deem more acceptable if it's clear we were going on a rebuilding route, but then the question becomes if you're rebuilding why sign Hayward, who has hay and chalk making up his knees, to 30m AAV while also waiving and stretching Batum (the most ridiculous thus far).    We are reeking towards mediocrity (like at best a 6 seed) for the next couple years or so unless LaMelo becomes idk someone like a Trae Young level player of impact on the offensive end. And while he is a very very promising point guard, I'm skeptical that we have anyone on our roster who can go get you 25+ PPG and be a superstar like that"
Highs - getting Norm back on a great value deal  Mid - signing Cody zeller to a min   Lows - not working out a S&amp;T with Collins. Signing McLemore he’s a decent backup but we really don’t need more 6’3 guards. Unless this is a precursor to a CJ trade cause we got his replacement in Norm locked up and a decent backup in McLemore than I’m cool with it
"If Nurk stays healthy, hopefully we won't have to run Zeller that hard. I'm pretty happy with this signing as far as Blazer FA periods go.  We needed all the help we could get on defense and Cody is a solid rim protector, especially as a backup."
"And Portland. Dame gave us the ""do something or I'm out"" talk and Neil signed Cody Zeller."
We signed Cody Zeller.
We signed Cody Zeller apparently so that’s our backup C now.
Whadya talking about - we signed Cody Zeller. That was the missing piece
"Dame: ""Make moves to win or Im gone""   Olshey: ""Here's one slightly used Cody Zeller""   Blazers baby what are you doing?? CJ needs to be shipped out yesterday."
Fuck you Olshey if you don’t trade CJ + assets for siakam or Simmons. Dame is so gone if we run it back with this same squad + Cody fucking zeller
Cody Zeller
signed cody zeller   lost zach collins  hotel trivago
Getting Cody Zeller
Don’t disrespect Cody Zeller like this
Cody Zeller peak your interest?
this is who i wanted instead of fucking cody zeller
Cody Zeller my man
"They got Cody Zeller, they’ll be fine."
"Hey bro, they have their new lord and savior, Cody Zeller"
Dame ain’t leaving now. They got Cody motherfuckin Zeller baby
"People joke, but this is a solid signing. Cody Zeller is a good backup C"
Dame Dolla x Cody Allen Zeller
No doubt good athletes. 6’9 dudes that can jump. But what im saying is that that is so common now and everyone is like that compared to a few guys like that. For example here are 2 clips from world famous mega athletes Cody Zeller and JJ Hickson. They each look as if not more athletic that the guys in your clips.   https://youtu.be/sGyqgBnwVFE  https://youtu.be/TiTkL3b51HY
"CHA already does have Cody &amp; Caleb Martin ,  and Cody Zeller.  If they get Zo and sign Tyler Zeller as the 21st man off the bench they could have a record"
"Can we name a few? Not challenging you or saying you’re wrong, but not many really come to mind for me for picks that high.  On the other hand you’ve got people like Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Harry Giles, WCS, Mo Bamba, Cody Zeller, etc, all off the top of my head who never really panned out. Feel like there’s tons in the opposite direction."
Seems like you need Cody Zeller then lol.
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"We were literally 4th in the East and right at .500 until:  Gordon Hayward gets hurt.  LaMelo gets hurt.  Devonte Graham hurts his hip.  Miles Bridges gets Covid.  Cody Zeller gets hurt and misses some time.   We're not nearly as bad as most people want to think we are. Kai Jones is raw, yes, but he could easily be an excellent player down the road. Obviously hard to tell right now, so it's foolish to think--today--that whoever the Knicks *might* get will be better than Kai.   Lot of NY copium in this thread."
There's also a third Zeller brother in addition to Tyler and Cody (Luke).
Another guard? I mean excellent player but I really want someone other than Cody Zeller playing center lol
"And the Hornets were quite worried about their center rotation with Cody Zeller making clear that he was leaving, they only had their rights over Biyombo.   And Plumlee is better than Zeller."
Huh I thought he was already on the hornets… oh that was cody zeller
This may mean that we are losing Cody Zeller.  Its only right that we gain a Plumlee.
"That's a fair point, but I just feel with Jaren Jackson coming back that might be enough for y'all to get a pretty cozy 8th seed spot. Also Desmond Bane was getting busy in summer league so I think he's another plus for the Grizzlies along with Dillon Brooks.  I am high on Dame time, however judging from the Trailblazers off season moves...or lack thereof, I don't think they're that high on Dame time anymore. Dame and McCollum will give us what they normally do (until McCollum gets injured again), Norman Powell is good too. I also like that they added a bit more depth at the PF/C position in Larry Nance Jr and Cody Zeller since that seems to be where there injuries always tend to happen. However I feel like the Western Conference teams that are worth a damn made worthwhile moves/improvements while the Trailblazers kinda just put on a band-aid on a boo-boo that's getting infected now.  Spurs I completely forgot about them trading Derozan so yeah lemme get them outta there lmao"
Cody Zeller is ELITE
"People overrate how big of a reach he was.  The top like 6-8 players were all viewed as interchangeable more or less.  The closest thing to consensus 1 was Nerlens and he even fell to #6.  Dipo was viewed as a “safe-ish” top 3 pick with higher floor and low ceiling.   On paper his upside is intriguing.  Elite rebounder who can stretch the floor.  Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlens Noel, Ben McLemore was your top 7  Basically everyone high lottery was fucked in some way"
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
"And only Kyrie was the great selection.  Drafted Bennett way way early (Cody Zeller is much better and is still in the league)  Wiggins was overhyped and thankfully they packaged him for Kevin Love.  If LeBron didn't comeback, it would be funny to see Kyrie dragging one of the worst defensive teams in the league to wins with young Wiggins, Dion, Tristan and Bennett."
"It was a horrible draft pick obviously but that draft was notoriously bad. There was no clear number 1, if I recall before the draft most had Nerlens Noel going 1st but he tore his acl so his stock dropped. People like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Cody Zeller were in the top 5.   To me, what’s worse is when you have a strong draft and you passed on an obvious option to take a guy you thought had more potential, like Bagley or Flynn"
Cody Zeller and Ryan Anderson. Case closed.
Cody Zeller on the Hornets has a very in-depth LinkedIn profile
"1) Mason Plumlee. Cody Zeller had a similar effect where he was such an important piece of what we needed, we couldn't afford to have him out. I know Plumlee isn't the sexiest name out there, but he's going to get the job done efficiently and effectively for us at the C position, and I think his impact will be great.   B) Gordon Hayward. Yeah, his injury history sucks, but we're such a different team with him than without. He brings a legit vet presence and calming ""easy bucket"" factor on offense for our young team. You can't deny his production when he's healthy for us."
"I may not remember the facts accurately, and this was bad but our team was bad but whatever- This was the 19-20 horrifying golden State team and this was just a few games after Steph went out where a few homers (like me) had hope because ukw dlo had just had 50 the other night. Well we're playing the hornets and Its crunch time, down by 2 and a hornets player is shooting a free throw. Easy enough right? Get the ball, call time and hope for something. Well he misses the free throw, and we lose the rebound to fricking Cody Zeller. We foul again. No biggie hope for one miss and then a miracle three. It's a lot harder but you hope. makes the first, magically misses the second. Guess what we cannot get a rebound lmao, and they get the ball AGAIN. Foul again, down by 5 and lose the game. Not bigg but like cmon don't lose 2 rebounds in a row!"
"Cody Zeller. I have literally no idea why I dislike him, he just fuckin boils my blood."
"Because he’s stuck on a mediocre team with a bad GM. He’s never really been a championship threat type of player. They got swept by AD and the Pels minus Boogie (injured), swept by the Warriors minus KD despite Portland leading like every game at the half. He ain’t gonna get far without help and as long as Olshey is their GM and they have CJ, they aren’t gonna make it far in the stacked West.   Every season, same shit - he asks for help, they get mediocre upgrades. They got Norm Powell and re-signed him while keeping CJ.. so they now have their entire cap taken up by guards (Powell is better as a 2 and is undersized as a 3) and got who for help? Cody Zeller? Some dudes from the Hornets who aren’t really gonna move the needle. And a new coach so it’ll take time to adjust. Olshey needs to go, they’re delusional or just content being a first round exit year in year out."
Well that makes no sense since we only got mason at the off season  Are you thinking about Cody zeller?
"Is there something bad about gaining Larry Nance Jr, Cody Zeller, Snell, McClemore to the bench and getting rid of Kanter, Melo, Harry Giles, and Zach Collins (who wasn't going to play this year because he broke his ankle for the third time in a row)?  That's an obvious upgrade?   The starting lineup wasn't the problem last year and had a top 5 net rating in the league?  The bench was god awful and has been completely overhauled with players that aren't defense deficient?"
"Definitely. There are only a few sets of brothers trios to play in the NBA to start with. I can only think of:  * Will, Caldwell, Major and Charles Jones * Frank, Campy and Walker Russell * Jon, Brent and Drew Barry * Luke, Tyler and Cody Zeller * Jrue, Justin and Aaron Holiday * Giannis, Thanasis, and Kostas Antetokounmpo"
"So I guess Boogie Cousins is considered such a locker room headache that he remains unsigned? While no longer a star,  he has to be the best traditional backup center on the market. Like why did the Lakers sign DJ and Dwight instead of Boogie? Or the blazers parted ways with Kanter, but signed injury prone Cody Zeller instead?"
"I remember when he was extremely promising as a freshman on that really good 2012-13 Indiana team, playing with Oladipo and Cody Zeller. That team was awesome."
"One of those things they’ll give us more of- ball movement.    Nurkic is a [top 10 passing big](https://stathead.com/tiny/LovL4), while Larry Nance Jr. clocks in at 13th and Cody Zeller at 15th, if you consider that we’re transitioning from Melo and Kanter who were players who never met a shot they didn’t like, not only will our bench be significantly better defensively, but our ball movement leveled up significantly as well."
We’d be trading two starters for a defensive player with no offensive game. We’d have Cody fucking Zeller start. No thanks
"Point is, if he's less productive than Cody Zeller then it's not that big of a deal. They could have filled this roster spot with any number of low cost vets."
"it's not that it's a big deal, it's that people are really downplaying it  it's not the same thing as the blazers getting cody zeller cuz y'all aren't title favorites"
"He's not really a needle mover at this point in his career. He's fine in small doses, but it's just not that big of a deal. Like, the Blazers signed Cody Zeller with a min contract. I fully expect him to be more productive than Millsap. So why would we overreact about the Nets signing him?"
If Cody Zeller were still there then I'd agree with you
"The Blazers were first in both isolation and pick and roll, because Lillard is incredible at those two play types- the defense with all the starters in ninth in the league too, the offense was elite as one of the best in the league and the starters were fantastic, but the team cratered with bench units.    Sending out Kanter and Melo, and bringing in Larry Nance jr, Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, all will help with that bench defense.  We’re hoping Afernee Simons and Nassir Little can grow and step up there as well, which would be huge to see growth there as Simons turned into a quality shooter and Little impressed in limited minutes."
"I’m as happy as anyone that we’re finally making good moves, but A- gives us too much credit. As soon as I read “Mason Plumlee is an upgrade over Cody Zeller” I know the author doesn’t watch the Hornets.  Edit: unless he means specifically that Mason has fewer injury concerns. In that case, sure."
ATL - Joe Johnson  BOS - Larry Bird  BKN - KD  CHO - Cody Zeller  CHI - MJ  CLE - LeBron  DAL - Dirk  DEN - Jokic  DET - Billups  GSW - Steph  HOU - Yao Ming  IND - Danny Granger  LAC - Kawhi  LAL - Kobe  MEM - Marc Gasol  MIA - Wade  MIL - Giannis  MIN - KG  NOP - Zion  NYK - Randle  OKC - KD  ORL - Dwight  PHI - AI  PHX - Steve Nash  POR - Dame  SAC - Vlade  SAS - Tim Duncan  TOR - DeRozan  UTA - Andrei Kirilenko  WAS - Gheorghe Muresan
"We've got Cody Zeller as our backup traditional 5 and RoCo is our starting 4 who can (and has) easily slid down to play small ball 5. RoCo and Nance at the 4/5 sounds really, really fun when we decide to go small."
cody zeller
"&gt;I mean, don’t forget the disgruntled KAT rumors last year. If we’re just daydreaming here, we might as well talk about KAT leaving as well. 😂   Yeah and then we got him D'lo and drafted Edwards meanwhile you got Dame Cody Zeller."
The disrespect to Cody Zeller
Bruhhh Giannis got postered by Cody Zeller wtfff
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
Blazers really are lucky Dame is so loyal. What other team with their franchise superstar threatening to leave because of a poor roster could just throw a bag at Norman Powell and sign Cody Zeller and Ben Macklemore and call it a day.   I guess there could be moves yet to be played but it feels like the market is working against them w moving CJ
My man Cody zeller put him in the torture chamber on every switch
"If you think a stat that has AD as the 34th best player in the league (behind Cody Zeller and Eric Bledsoe) from 2015 to 2019 is reliable, I don't know what to tell you."
Lol Cody Zeller top 5 hornets player of all time
Here's the list from 2019-2020. A lot of the same guys show up on both.   Ante Žižić  Cody Zeller   Moritz Wagner  Nikola Vučević  Noah Vonleh     Omari Spellman    Dwight Powell        Kelly Olynyk         Nicolò Melli       Kevon Looney      Frank Kaminsky    Nikola Jokić      Willy Hernangómez  Dewan Hernandez       Harry Giles     Cristiano Felício      Andre Drummond    Ed Davis            Marques Bolden  Jonah Bolden         Ryan Anderson
Just the sight of Cody zeller makes me mad
the dastardly Cody Zeller trying to make himself better than Zubac in the only way he can
"Klay Thompson vs Kemba Walker 2018-2019 Regular season  Klay - 21.5 ppg / 3.8 rebounds / 2.4 assists on 57.1% true shooting, 25.6% usage. 78 games played.  Kemba - 25.6 ppg / 4.4 rebounds / 5.9 assists on 55.8% ts, **31.5% usage**. **82 games played**.  Klay - 16.6 PER / 5.3 Win Shares / **-0.3 BPM** / 1.2 VORP  Kemba - 21.7 PER / 7.4 Win Shares / 4.2 BPM / 4.4 VORP  Klay was the third option on a team with 2 top 5 players. Kemba was the minutes leader on a team he dragged to 39 wins. Here was his supporting cast, in descending minutes played -    Nic Batum, in the totally checked-out part of his career   Jeremy Lamb   A 32 year old Marvin Williams   A rookie Miles Bridges   Sophomore Malik Monk   A sometimes healthy Cody Zeller   And to close it out, 8th man, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  You swap Klay and Kemba that season, what do you think happens? I think Kemba gets a ring, and those Hornets don't come anywhere close to 39 wins.  The only thing that's wild to me is that in 2021 people would question this all-nba selection."
Cody Zeltron Zeller
I mean Cody Zeller was a good player when he was healthy. He was just never healthy. And we haven't drafted a center in the first round since Frank before we got Kai this year
Did you not see new Blazers goat Cody Zeller??
"Playing with CP3 certainly helps his efficiency.  I was talking about his usage.  He went from 14.9 FGA per game in 2019-20 to 10.0 in 2020-21, and his USG% dropped from 23.7 down to 18.2.  Cody Zeller had a higher usage rate last year.  Obviously it's better for the team, but it's also pretty shocking for a #1 pick who's generally looked pretty solid.  For the sake of comparison, that's a lower USG than Blake Griffin on the Nets last year.  It's the 3rd lowest USG season by any player picked #1 in the last 15 years (ahead of Oden's stint in Miami &amp; one of Anthony Bennet's 4 seasons)."
cody zeller most likely
*cody zeller
I was gonna say Cody Zeller but he’s not there anymore :(
Biggest reason this year? Not Cody Zeller.
"I think sometimes we're guilty of looking at these things as just numbers on a piece of paper. ""Like bro, why would you pay this much for DeAdnre Ayton, when you could get Cody Zeller for the league minimum"" or something, when it doesn't work that way in real life."
I’d be willing to let them have Cody Zeller a year earlier If they send back Ayton
"You're right, they should just let him walk and sign Cody Zeller in free agency."
Cody Zeller would like to have a word
I’d add Nurk and Cody Zeller to this list. Blazers are in trouble
"It would take longer to list the ones he is better than over the reverse. Shit Cody Zeller is better than him and our bench isn’t even good.   Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Zubac, kanter, Zeller, Dwight Howard all better just off the top of my head and I’m sure I’m forgetting some"
Cody zeller
He is also Cody zeller. There was no chance of Cody zeller in Portland being free from random injury.
"What do you mean breaks? First, noses don’t break, technically they displace, you can only break a nose if you saturate it with liquid nitrogen, I don’t see any of that here. Second, Andre I is a delusion you are having. The real AI? This is just a psychic projection of what you wish Allen iverson was, tall, sensual, and prudently invested. In this video I see Cody zeller, if that is his real name, twist his own Schnoz to keep the dream of iggy alive. You should thank him."
I don't think any player in the league has ended up randomly getting hit in the face as much as Cody Zeller. God bless him
"I think they’ll be very good too. I love the additions of players like Larry Nance and Thad Young to their squad. Dame, CJ, Powell provides a ton of perimeter scoring too.  I think Cody Zeller is a good backup center as well. I imagine they are hoping Simons makes a leap too. Could be a real good squad."
"Blazers didn’t get better? The min we let Melo and Kanter walk we got better, we replaced them with Larry Nance and Cody Zeller that makes it more than an upgrade.   As long as we don’t have our starting Center and Shooting guard miss a huge chunk of the season again we should win a lot more games."
Uh...   &gt;Pressure has been applied to the front office  Blazers' offseason additions:   * Larry Nance Jr.   * Cody Zeller  Wizards' offseason additions:   * Spencer Dinwiddie * Kyle Kuzma * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * Montrezl Harrell * Aaron Holiday   The Wizards had a bigger offseason than Portland did.
Yup a full season of healthy Nurkic would be nice. We’re in trouble if he doesn’t stay healthy this year because I don’t have faith in Cody Zeller being able to start a bunch of games for us and we don’t have a 3rd string Center
"Eh, I'd like to see how this team winds up after a few years under Kupchak. Not a fan of the tank efforts they've made in the past, and always seeing the 7-59 worst team ever label just to wind up with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Cody Zeller, Noah Vonleh, and Bismack Biyombo. ^^^and ^^^Kemba"
If Nance is nothing than sure. Also Cody Zeller is replacing Enes Kanter which is a massive W.
"The Blazers have incredibly underrated bench depth. Larry Nance and Cody Zeller are both guys who could easily be starters on different teams, and we have a bevy of lethal shooting from our bench guards as well as a guy in Nassir that is poised to have a breakout year and could be an x-factor in how well we do this season."
"I mean look at random athletic small forwards drafted in the 2nd round.  Comparisons are  to all-stars not random roleplayers most of the time.  No one out there going ""Ben Simmons best comparison is Justin Holiday with a pinch of Cody Zeller"""
Damn that's incredible finishing from PG. He looks like a marginally less athletic Cody Zeller.
Bismack Biyombo -&gt; Brandon Knight   Kemba -&gt; Jimmer   MKG -&gt; Beal   Jeff Taylor -&gt; Satoransky   Cody Zeller -&gt; Len   Vonleh -&gt; Elfrid Payton   PJ Hairston - Bogdan Bogdanovic   Frank the Tank -&gt; Winslow    This honestly winds up being just as bad lol
the big handsome cody zeller
"Jarrett Jack, DJ Augustin, Cody Zeller, Garrett Temple"
&gt; Cody Zeller  Dude is 29 and looks like he's gonna turn 45 next year.
"Honestly, for guys that are balding like Caruso, shaving is just such a better option. Cody Zeller needs to do it as well."
I saw Cody Zeller play in high school. Great player!
"Their defense with him is 108.8 defensive rating which would put them at 19th in the league so yes still terrible with him  He is allowing 65% at the rim and has been a terrible rim protector, the only thing he was good at, and obviously the defense gets way worse when Cody Zeller is your back up and Kanter was the back up last season"
"Draft pundits were high on MKG (as high as people can be on any of the clearly inferior players taken after consensus #1 Davis). NBA-ready physically and already a ""pro-level"" defender. Easy to pan the pick now but that was at the time when people thought you could develop someone's shot (influenced by Kawhi's ""improvement"" from the previous draft).  Forgot Cody Zeller? Biyombo is high upside? I guess those two and Frank are good picks for a 90's team. I don't mind the Vonleh and Monk picks (there were better players taken after but no obvious higher upside prospect around that pick). I'm not saying they'd surely be better off now with that approach - after all, they'd have ended up with MPJ instead of Miles (and worse off) if they followed that. But I think that's your approach when you have a team that sucks, have no franchise player (no, Kemba wasn't one), and are missing on these ""safe picks"" anyway.  You're right about the picks having improved under Mitch. And developing low picks so you can trade them for value (Graham) or they play quality minutes (Martin) now means you can bring along the likes of Bouknight at a reasonable pace."
"Charlotte has been ""missing"" for a number of drafts but haven't exactly been ""swinging"". This analogy of swinging for the fences applies to instances wherein the team goes for a prospect with a higher potential ceiling (home run) over the ""proven"" product (single). A lot of times Charlotte has gone to the prospect who was productive, or came from an established program, or had his ""one shining moment"", or ""ready to play"" (or from North Carolina).  Swinging is going for small-school Dame over the ""winner"" MKG, or Giannis over Cody Zeller. Even if Dame or Giannis didn't pan out, it's better to have taken a chance at someone with the potential to be quite special instead of ""NBA-ready"" prospects with low ass ceilings. Given Charlotte's roster in all that time, they seemed to be drafting for a veteran team that was a solid bench contributor away from Finals contention when they should've rather crashed and burned with a Trey Lyles pick than go with a Frank Kaminsky.  I know that Miles was picked earlier but, now that they have LaMelo, this is actually the time go for the Bridges types over MPJ as you now have someone to build around. No one is saying that results don't matter - just that the ideal approach *at that time* called for more risk tolerance."
"Closest we got is Luke, Tyler, and Cody Zeller. Triangle maybe?"
I tried hard to find the record for FTs in a row in a season. Couldn't find it. But ultimately what it means is small sample sizes are misleading. I bet I could find a small sample where Cody Zeller had the highest EFG % for instance.
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Cody Zeller looks like a science teacher
"Cody Zeller aka ""the nice history teacher"""
1) Cody Zeller has been great  2) We're not really giving him that many minutes anymore because Larry Nance is amazing but better as a 5 than a 4
"“Cody Zeller offensive rebound, BRIDGES, OH MY GOODNESS!!! HUM DIDDLY DEE!!! A THUNDERBOLT FROM BRIDGES!!!” - Eric Collins after Miles baptized Capela"
Blazers. They are giving Cody Zeller minutes.
Hmm... Nurkic has been suspiciously healthy to start the year. Even Cody Zeller has been healthy!!!       OMG theory confirmed!
Cody Zeller is goated.
How dare you disrespect Cody Zeller like that
i’m sorry but that man is a backup center. it shouldn’t be hard to be an upgrade from Cody Zeller
"Steve Nash, Cody Zeller"
"I would say he’s in a tier with De’Anthony Melton, Shake Milton, Cody Zeller and Jimmy Butler."
"Not the best, but the Hornets are pretty good:   PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Malik Monk  SF: Nic Batum   PF: Christian Wood  C: Dwight Howard  Bench of Devonte' Graham, Jeremy Lamb, Garrett Temple, Frank Kaminsky, and Cody Zeller. All in their primes, this is a solid squad."
Masked cody zeller
"I was discussing this yesterday but there's way too many exceptions to wingspan and big hands. MJ had big hands and long wingspan. Jerry West was notorious for a long wingspan and was an elite shooter. More examples below:   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.  Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.  Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.  Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.  KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan."
"Like I said, you're pointing out a correlation.   Okay we can look at the more average joe. Shane Larkin had a wingspan of 5'10, mediocre if not bad shooter.   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.   Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.   Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.   Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.   Wilt despite having Gobert level wingspan and shooting terribly from free throws, had actual reputation for being an elite perimeter player at the time. KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan.   I'm not really seeing a pattern here."
"Glad to see rational discussion. I even thought he was solid in limited minutes against the Suns, especially before AD went down... but people were acting like he’s a bum. Cody Zeller is a solid player, especially if he’s coming off the bench for you, and I’d definitely take Drummond over Zeller. He’s just not an allstar"
Seeing Frank Kaminsky go off on Cody Zeller is invoking memories of ancient Hornets sub debate threads. Just need to bring back Biz and Dwight into the mix for old time's sake
Cody Zeller plays for the Blazers on a vet min
Hornets should do something to get him and replace Cody Zeller
They should probably just play Cody Zeller more minutes in order to maximize efficiency of getting to Billups end goal of losing the game.
"Jusuf Nurkic, absolutely dominating - 26.5 minutes.   Cody Zeller, playing like hot steaming garbage - more than 0 minutes."
Isaiah Hartenstein vs Cody Zeller is the Wilt v Bill of this generation
"Cody Zeller has big ""dad hooping at the Y"" energy"
good thing we knew this going into the off-season and did jack shit besides retain the exact same team plus cody fucking zeller
Cody Zeller has a Costco membership.
What’s he gonna leak? Signing Cody Zeller? Or maybe Nance? Lmao
Imagine Luka but w Cody Zeller hair
Cody Zeller on court with Austin Reaves looks like a teacher-student exhibition game.
We letting Cody Zeller dunk on us... smh
You mean let Cody Zeller hold it down
I never thought I’d say this but Cody Zeller. Solid backup big that does the nitty gritty things. We finally have a back up big that plays defense.
Bro what are you talking about. I loved enes on offense but his defense was atrocious. I’ve watched every game this year and Zeller is a nice upgrade on defense and knows his role on offense. Cody Zeller blazers legend already
This is a comically bad take. Cody Zeller is completely washed and barely deserving of rotation minutes.
"Terry's had a career resurgence in Charlotte. Fun fact, he never shot above 40% in the regular season during his time in Boston.  Last season with Charlotte - 20.4 / 4.4 / 4.2 on .450 / .389 / .817. He might be an undersized shooting guard, but he fits perfectly as a secondary ballhandler next to LaMelo.  So yeah, I like the fit a lot and at the end of the day there's not a lot of teams that can pair Terry with a bigger playmaker.  Apparently Charlotte tried to offer PJ Washington, Cody Zeller and a 1st for Myles Turner. That's not a bad offer in my opinion, but we didn't take it. Nowadays if we were interested they'd have to include Oubre instead of Zeller for salary match.   We'll have to wait and see, but yeah I don't see Plumlee being the long-term solution. The idea of Kai Jones blossoming is neat, but centers take a long time to develop unfortunately."
For us it’s unquestionably Cody Zeller. Dude is like the garbage man who does all the grunt work that isn’t always flashy but it’s super necessary
Do you think charlottes FO lost Cody Zeller and just went out to find a mfer that looks just like him and that’s why they signed Plumlee?
yet after all of this the biggest moves neil could make was landing larry nance and cody zeller lol
"He didn’t really break out until year 5 and was on his 3rd team at that point.               Nerlens Noel, Cody Zeller, and Ben Mclemore spent time as the #1 prospect. That draft class was so bad at the top."
"I guess the mavs could use Cody zeller too. Surely he's got enough ""the next dirk"" energy for the trade to be fair"
"Cody zeller been a stud for us, better than nurk at times"
For a future first and cody zeller we can immediately cut? Sign me up
"I don’t understand! the blazers added Cody Zeller and Larry Nance, how are they not contenders yet!?"
"Cody Zeller is actually good, he just missed half the games every season. Before him idk I guess Dwight but he was annoying and not liked"
Enes Kanter -&gt; Cody Zeller  Carmelo Anthony -&gt; Larry Nance Jr  Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking bad and not playing -&gt; Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking like passable NBA players and playing  Dame needing to score 60 to win -&gt; Dame can have bad nights and the team still has other scorers and playmakers contributing
"Last year we started enes Kanter for 30 games and when we didn’t we had Carmelo Anthony and Kanter off the bench. We were average defensively in the games Nurkic played.   This year it’s Larry nance, Cody Zeller, and nassir little(who is turning into a contributor this year). That plus the new defense and guys are trying really hard is making a big difference"
How dare you besmirch Sir Cody Zeller?
Look forward to Lillard going nuclear and writing a battle rap that names drops all his less then stellar teammates like Cody Zeller ... On that note a trade request through a song would be amazing
At this point Cody Zeller looks like he's survived several murder attempts. So at least he looks the part
“Real mobsters on my roster” yessir talkin bout my guy Cody Zeller
"Who would win a 3 on 3, Tyler Zeller, Luke Zeller, Cody Zeller vs Marshall Plumlee, Mason Plumlee, and Miles Plumlee"
Nice backup for Cody Zeller.
"Uhh, hate to break it to ya but lamelo has to pass cody zeller for title of franchise goat, not kemba"
"“How about a big round of applause for the newest Cavalier...., Cody Zeller”"
Cody zeller is a free agent
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn’t be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"I don't think Simmons worked less or more on his shooting than an average NBA player who couln't shoot in college (let's say Cody Zeller who is also still complete non-shooter), but there is obviously more eyeballs and pressure on Simmons and he can't handle that. Maybe 1% of players in the league had Kobe's work ethic, that's just unrealistic standard."
cody zeller in shambles
"That's fair, it's just that their current centers is Cody Zeller and....that's it.  They should try for someone else -- Myles Turner would be perfect -- but I'm simply saying I think Montrez could have a much better year in Charlotte than he did in LAL -- they just play much faster and looser with a shit ton of lobs.  On offense, he makes some sense.  He will never make much sense as a defender, of course, so as I said, it isn't ideal.  I still stand by that it isn't a laughably bad fit or anything."
Cody Zeller
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
I irrationally stan Cody zeller
2020 - Patrick Williams - Bulls   2019 De’Andre Hunter – Hawks   2018 Jaren Jackson Jr - Grizzlies   2017 Josh Jackson  – Suns   2016 Dragan Bender - Suns   2015 Kristaps Porzingis - Knicks   2014 Aaron Gordon  – Magic   2013 Cody Zeller - Bobcats   2012 Dion Waiters - Cavaliers   2011 Tristan Thompson - Cavaliers   2010 Wesley Johnson - Timberwolves   I wouldn’t trade Ben for a decade of number four picks now that the unicorn has vanished.
"From 2010-2019, the number 4 picks have been deandre hunter, jaren Jackson, josh Jackson, dragan bender, KP, Aaron Gordon, Cody zeller, dion waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Wesley Johnson. How many all star appearances do those guys have between them, 1 (KP in 2018)? The draft is a massive crapshoot, prob bigger than people think Edit: JJJ and hunter are obviously good young players, but the median player in that list is probably Tristan Thompson"
"Anthony Bennet, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlins Noel, Ben McLemore for Luka. You still game? You would need the top 27 picks of the 13 draft to have a playoff team."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
