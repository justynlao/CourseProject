"Harden, KD, Ibaka, Jeff Green, Paul George, Patrick Patterson, and Reggie Jackson all played for OKC at some point. Am I missing anyone?"
What about Patrick Patterson?
Y'all even dusted off Patrick Patterson against the Knicks and he went ham.  Everything clicking.
Patrick Patterson??
Patrick Patterson was 6-20 from 3 before this game. 3-3 today lol
not to brag but Patrick patterson is the best Kentucky Alum in the NBA
Don't forget Patrick Patterson
Damn!  That's demarre carrol and patrick patterson levels of OPEN shot percentages
"Still tho  The clippers guys career averages are   38%, 41%, 38%, 37%, 38%, 36%  Kawhi, Kennard, Pat Bev, Morris, PG 13, batum  They also have lou will - a career 35% shooter, serge ibaka a career 36% shooter, reggie jackson a career 34% shooter that has shot over 37% since the start of the 2018/19 season.   And Patrick Patterson is still a solid stretch Big in limited minutes"
Yo Patrick Patterson look like Madlib tf
I am now a Patrick Patterson fan.
"Patrick Patterson, if you are reading this, I'll trade you some shiny Pokemon for some NBA tickets. Fair trade for sure."
im a patrick patterson fan now. thats whatsup
Patrick Patterson genwunner confirmed
This is even funnier when you know that patrick patterson is mainly on the team because of Paul George's fiance and Patrick Patterson's girlfriend are really good friends since they were on the Thunder together. I think they even started a business together iirc.
I’m suddenly a Patrick Patterson fan
Charizard is a cool Pokémon. Patrick Patterson has good taste in video games and Pokémon. I find basketball video games very boring.
"Patrick ""Stay Ready"" Patterson"
patrick patterson has been practicing
"“Presti, please...”  “How does Patrick Patterson sound?”"
The team may not be cohesive but the individual players are. DeMarre Carrol or Patrick Patterson we’re not better than this
Grew up with Patrick Patterson at Kentucky. Never understood how he has never gotten a chance to be a top tier role player in the league.
"LOL. Also Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Patterson  Now that most players from past OKC teams Wiggins played against have dispersed across the league, I hope he thinks he's playing against OKC every time he sees a former OKC player on the opposing team:  * Blazers (Melo, Kanter) - current split 1-1  * Pistons (Grant) - 1-0 so far (do we play Eastern conference teams 1 more time in 2nd half of season?)  * Kings (Corey Brewer) - 1-0 so far  * Pelicans (Steven Adams)  * Wizards (Westbrook)   * Nuggets (PJ Dozier)  * Sixers (Terrance Ferguson)  * Pacers (Oladipo, Sabonis, McDermott)  * Suns (Cam Payne, CP3)  * Lakers (Schröder, Markieff Morris)  * Nets (Luwawu-Cabarott, KD) - 0-1 so far  * Knicks (Noel, Taj Gibson if they sign him)  * Bucks (DJ Augustin) - 0-1 so far"
Jesus Christ has Norm's IQ gone down this year. I'm going to call him Patrick Patterson until he gives me reason not to
Norm 1 touch 1 TO. Dude is looking like a swingman version of Patrick Patterson this year
Throw in Patrick Patterson and bala you've got a stew going
"While I get what you're saying, but I doubt our FO will be doing the Clippers any favors after they openly courted Kawhi during the 2019 season and have the clippers not offer a better deal then Philly. We ain't trading away Lowry for Zubac and some spare parts, we already got those from our roster spots 10-15,   (Lou Will said he will retire if he is traded, Pat Bev is redundant with Fred, Reggie doesn't fit our timeline and has been declining, Mann is interesting but we already have a lockjam at SG, Kennard is massively overpaid for his production, Batum has a nice fat expiring which won't match Lowry if he's paired with Zubac, Mfi/Oturu are projects which aren't bad but meh, and Patrick Patterson is Patrick Patterson lol.)  I mean maybe if Lowry just wanted to go only to the clippers but he seems to be open to heading to the Sixers as well."
Are 11 2nd rounders worth enough?  u/LAClippers get:  Bradley Beal  Alex Len  u/WashWizards get:  Lou Williams  Marcus Morris Sr.  Luke Kennard  Patrick Patterson  2022 - RD 2  2022 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2027 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/Oe3lbVZ00
"I think you have the causation backwards there, to be honest. The reason that bench looked good is because Lowry elevated them (a pattern that has continued to this day). Quite a lot of those dudes had little success after the Raptors. Patrick Patterson, Greivis Vasquez, James Johnson, Lucas Nogueira ... they were not high end bench players.  Don't get me wrong, we had some legit players in there as well (young Siakam/Anunoby/FVV, Powell, Corey Joseph), but the reason Lowry + bench lineups kicked ass in the regular season is because of Lowry, not the bench (and the regression models that account for teammate impact all reflect this, because those lineups without Lowry weren't nearly as good)."
Luke Kennard and Patrick Patterson
"New York's hottest club is *A S S E T S*  This place has everything; picks, young players, and what's this? An aging Andre Iguadala? No! It's Patrick Patterson and he is ready to *mingle!*"
[yikes wasn’t even aware that happened](https://hellobeautiful.com/3065299/patrick-patterson-black-women-bulldogs/)
Patrick Patterson is a douche
*Patrick Patterson has entered the chat*
"Patrick Patterson in his last year with the Thunder. He had a long stretch where his TS% didn't crack 10%. He got like 2 rebounds a game. He was the literal definition of ""just running around out there"". Usually it's an exaggeration but in this case any basketball player in the world above 18 years old could've done the same thing. I don't understand why he got any minutes"
We need forward depth. I’d rather have Blake out there than Patrick Patterson.
Like a worse Patrick Patterson
Patrick Patterson
patrick patterson still can't get minutes lol
Lol I was sure memphis won that trade too. I'd watched Mayo since he played in High School with Patrick Patterson so I was all over the hype.
"Patrick Patterson.   You bring him off the bench to get you a few points, some boards, ok defence, he’s got it covered.  You promote him or give him more minutes, he’s still gonna cap out at those same numbers and same effort level.   He’s good enough, but if you’re relying on him for more than the bare minimum get ready to lose."
"Amir and Patrick Patterson had that one year when they were incredible defensively, switching everything and covering the whole court.  All downhill from there unfortunately"
"&gt; he can shoot better than Rubio and plays decent defense  What's the argument then for why the Clippers suddenly get ""insanely dangerous"" if they downgrade at shooting and defense with Rubio instead of Beverley? Also, keep in mind that because of the hard cap a straight swap of Rubio for Beverley doesn't work, the Clippers would also have to add either Lou Williams to the trade, or both of Patrick Patterson and Daniel Oturu (while being unable to spend any money to replace those two empty roster spots because of the hard cap)."
"Because of the hard cap the Clippers would either have to send Lou and Patrick Patterson (along with probably all their 2nd round picks), or they'd have to trade Beverley for him. Lou for Hill straight up doesn't work as it puts the Clippers over the apron."
"What about the return of Raptors legend, Lou ""Maple Pepper"" Williams? Throw in Patrick Patterson and Ivica ""close enough to JV"" Zubac. We can probably get Amir from the G League for peanuts too. It's 2015 all over again."
damn. patrick patterson puttin in work
"The +/-'s of our big 3, Reggie Jackson, Patrick Patterson, and Nicolas Batum."
Patrick Patterson is +16 in 5 minutes LMAO
"I mean it's for a 14th/15th guy, they just have to be serviceable for spot minutes.  He's probably a better center than Patrick Patterson ."
He's probably about as useful as Patrick Patterson is.  This won't make a difference to our season.
"They're obviously good, LA is way better at full strength.  Do you think Patrick Patterson is anywhere as good as Serge Ibaka or Reggie Jackson as good as Rondo-Beverly?"
What cost him his career was that he did not want to play in the G league because he claimed it was bad for his mental health. He wanted playing time in the nba as a rookie on a team over other young guys like Marcus Morris and Patrick Patterson. Rockets were more than willing to accommodate him on his fear of flying
"I know every year he shoots a decent percentage, but I swear I've never actually seen Patrick Patterson make a 3"
Patrick patterson?
When did Patrick Patterson become a center?
"This year no College team is nearly dominant enough. I do think the 2009-2010 Kentucky team has a chance to hang with a bad NBA team.   PG: John Wall SG: Eric Bledsoe  SF: Darius Miller  PF: Patrick Patterson  C: Demarcus Cousins  Depth is an issue but that starting lineup is solid.   The 2014-2015 Kentucky team is also a possibility. You had Andrew and Aaron Harrison, Trey Lyles, Karl Anthony Towns, and Willie Caulie Stein starting with Devin Booker, Tyler Ullis, and Dakari Johnson off the bench.   Not saying they would win, but saying they’re maybe in the “on a random night” proximity."
Of course patrick Patterson is involved in this awful defensive play lmao
"Indy Heat. Mike Conley played with them too. They tore my AAU team up when we played them. Conley was by far the best player on that team, maybe the best in the country. Huntington Express out of WV had Patrick Patterson and OJ Mayo as well."
Patrick Patterson iso
Williamson demolished them in the paint. Zubac got a couple of good stops at the rim but other than that he just did what he wanted. He got his last 6ish points in garbage time by just completely destroying Patrick Patterson though
"He can't be traded because he signed a contract extension. So we can't trade him till the summer even if we wanted to. We also can't trade Paul George, Reggie Jackson, or Patrick Patterson even though I see them in a ton of trade rumors."
throw Patrick Patterson in there too and you got something special
Patrick Patterson is still in the league?
"&gt;	Melo, Patrick Patterson, Jermi Grant, and Corey Brewer.   &gt;	That was much better than 2016 with Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Roberson, and Ibaka.  Roberson shot better from the field than KD and was their best perimeter defender. Ibaka was an incredible rim protector that year anchoring a historic defense. And Waiters was an excellent secondary playmaker. You started watching basketball in 2018 if you think the teams are remotely comparable. Maybe if you stop regurgitating ESPN you might see what I am saying.   &gt;	2014 KD carried OKC to almost 60 games with Russ missing half the season and the other half playing limited minutes.  Ya and then what happened the momment Durant had to increase his volume, playmaking and ball handling responsibilities in the **first round**? He shit the bed and got bailed out and still managed a turnover for every assist he made.  That’s pathetic for an MVP. It’s hilarious too even think KD had Harden (future MVP) and Russ (future MVP) and KD *still* couldnt get it done. In fact, 2016 Westbrook was better than Durant significantly in the ability to create for others."
"2018 Thunder was just as good as the 2016 Thunder if you take out Paul George and KD. With George they lost in the first round. With KD they push the 73 win Warriors to 7.  The 2018 Thunder had Melo, Patrick Patterson, Jermi Grant, and Corey Brewer. That was much better than 2016 with Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Roberson, and Ibaka.   2014 KD carried OKC to almost 60 games with Russ missing half the season and the other half playing limited minutes."
Those patrick Patterson minutes killed the clippers. The bench is really what swung the game.
I guess Patrick Patterson comes the closest?
&gt;Patrick Patterson  FTFY
"LA already owned PHO 2x this year missing key players &amp; aside of Payne hitting circus shots like tonight they'd have lost again to a LA team missing Kawhi, Ibaka and Pat Bev.  LA is getting away with playing Patrick Patterson in place of Ibaka lol, I mean Pat's cool but he's barely an NBA player at this point in his career, Ibaka is a major upgrade when he comes back, Toronto fell off totally without him."
Patrick Patterson should never set foot on the floor for LAC ever again. Those 12 minutes he played were abysmal.
Patrick Patterson better not play another damn minute tonight. Cp3 is tearing his ass up
"Patrick Patterson could have me guarding him, him posting up and taking a hoot shot is simply never going to be a good shot."
"37 non-lottery picks aren't enough to win titles either. Superstars win titles, and our best chance to get superstars is to draft in the top 3. I agree that Shai is a home run, but one superstar ain't enough. And we can't sign anyone we want no matter the cap space, we're in fucking Oklahoma City haha. Biggest free agent to come to OKC is.... Anthony Morrow? Patrick Patterson? I rest my case."
Watch Patrick Patterson. Just whenever the camera is on him. Good chance he's doing some kind of a thing.
Patrick Patterson actually guards AD surprisingly ok which is hilarious to me
I love that Patrick Patterson is still getting minutes somewhere. He was a part of those wildly average Kmart/Luis Scola teams his first couple seasons.
"what dark magic does patrick patterson have over ty lue that not only gives him minutes, but has him starting next to zubac?"
"Curious why you think Phoenix is a bad matchup.  In two games thus far, the Suns have played at (effectively) full strength and lost both times.  This was despite Marcus Morris (third in scoring on the team, shooting 47% from 3) missing in one and the statue that is Patrick Patterson getting one of his longest runs of the season in the other (mostly because starting center Ibaka was still out).  The second meeting was the second night of a back to back for Phoenix, but LA is 10-1 in that situation and doesn't have a home court elevation advantage like Utah or Denver, so it's a weak excuse for losing."
"Timberwolves announcers are curious to know why Patrick Patterson is dancing.  All I can say is, he's into his little rituals. It's not a reflection of anything in the moment, he just does that. Honestly wish I knew more."
"You’re absolutely correct. It’s similar to people crushing dudes for not crashing the boards. It *seems* like a bad move to not jump the boards after a miss, but if you have a man in rebounding position, you’re honestly better off to bust ass up the floor for a faux fast break. It’s a big reason Russ would crash the boards more often for OKC than half of their big men. Russ pulling it down and immediately finding a wing or big with a lane to the cup is arguably more valuable than Patrick Patterson pulling it down, waiting for the defense to get back, and then handing it to Russ for them to jog up the floor and set the half court offense.   The thing I like about your comment is that it takes a situation where it seems super obvious what you should do, and sheds light on why that’s likely not the most efficient or competent decision. When you dissect things, the details often paint a much different picture than you first saw on the surface."
Why isn’t Patrick Patterson in the mvp conversation?
"Holy shit, Patrick Patterson is still in the league?!"
Not really an excuse when the clippers are playing patrick Patterson as a back up C vs Embiid cause Ibaka is out.
gg. Please get Patrick Patterson out of the state. Dude is scary for light minutes.
I only watched the 4th quarter but all the Embiid fts were legit. Clippers were trying to guard him with Patrick Patterson lol.  The only thing that was annoying was how the 76ers didn't get the ball to him every possession. I feel like it was a guaranteed bucket or freethrows if they did.
"We did it, we survived the Patrick Patterson game..."
Patrick Patterson is 7 foot Curry
"Clippers are missing more.  You must not remember the TOR-Philly series, Kawhi was taking rebounds away from Embiid, stripping him, providing help defense on him, Kawhi is a much better defender than Patrick Patterson."
patrick patterson taking over the game
"We 're gonna lose to Patrick Patterson having the best game of his life, what is this"
"If you ignore my past comments, then I have never said anything bad about Patrick Patterson"
Where does this game put Patrick Patterson on the MVP list
"As we all expected, Patrick Patterson is keeping us in the game lol"
"If you let Patrick Patterson shoot that, he will miss and you will at least get the ball back"
Patrick Patterson
"What’s a statistic you like then? Literally every single stat will have something like this. RAPTOR has Conley&gt;LeBron/Harden and Trez and Caruso &gt; Dame and Jrue. RPM has Graham &gt; Jokic. Not sure if RAPM or PIPM are still publicly available, but Jae Crowder was ranked as 5th by RAPM in 2016-17 and Patrick Patterson at 11. Every statistic has these situations. But at the end of the day they more or less provide a decent indicator of player quality in whatever metric is being measured, be it passing, impact, etc"
"He's been OK.  I hate Patrick Patterson, so I'd much rather his minutes go to Cousins once he gets in a little better shape."
Thaddeus Young and Patrick Patterson are both younger than Steph Curry
Wasn’t Patrick Patterson one of the guys received from the Rudy Gay trade or was acquired after??? Or am I just misremembering.
Fuck Patrick Patterson
irreplaceable\*  Also what I'm saying is pretty well documented: [https://raptorsrapture.com/2017/06/12/raptors-will-miss-patrick-patterson-value/](https://raptorsrapture.com/2017/06/12/raptors-will-miss-patrick-patterson-value/)
The huge difference would be that if Doc was still the Clippers HC I doubt T. Mann wouldn't have gotten the minutes he got tonight. It probably would've been a steady dose of Rondo or Patrick Patterson.
I remember some color commentator asking if Patrick Patterson is the American equivalent of Bogdan Bogdanovic
Patrick Patterson
"We also have 2Pat for Patrick Patterson.   Don't know why 1Pat never caught on for Patrick McCaw, but my partner and I call him that.  And 0Pat (ZeroPat). That's Stanley Johnson."
Oh yeah Patrick Patterson and I used to talk a lot here and there. He's really into his horror.   I recommend watching:  - Frailty (really underrated serial-killer type film that features Matthew McConaughey)  - The House of the Devil  - Oculus   - The Sixth Sense
What u got against patrick patterson
Yeah.  I looked at the RES source - apparently a little while back you wrote in a thread how you and Patrick Patterson exchanged DMs with your opinions about horror movies
Patrick Patterson
1. Carmelo 2. Anthony Bennett 3. Patrick Patterson 4. Brandon Jennings 5. Jim Jackson 6. Kevin Porter Jr 7. Michael Porter Jr 8. Richard Jefferson 9. SVG (Stan van gundy) 10. Ben Gordon
2016 Patrick Patterson would be nice to have. He'd be playing better defense than Batum or Zubac. Luka is toying with these big men on the Clippers with the screen and roll.
Play Patrick Patterson at center
Patrick Patterson too. Tried to talk shit on his way out of here. But it’s not an intense hate since he’s barely a 3rd stringer.
I know you’re joking but looking at the box score for that game they tanked is fucking hilarious. Clippers had some guy named Jay Scrubb play 36 minutes? He had 68 DNP-CD’s this year. 42 minutes of Patrick Patterson?!
Melo had the 3rd highest USG% on the team in the regular season.  He's not used like Patrick Patterson so he shouldn't be compared to his role.
"I don't even like Carmelo, but there's like at least 5 guys in the rotation that are supposed to be bigger contributors than him so it's sorta corny to post his bad game stats. He's just a low-level role player now, we know this. It's like posting about Patrick Patterson or some shit"
"Your comment is actually the entire reason I am such a Bron Stan  If anyone who’s followed his career has clearly noticed, LBJ knows when it’s okay to slack off, not because it’s “okay” to slack off, but because he’s on that MJ level of the game where he’s essentially just trying to beat himself at this point? You know??  What I mean by this, is he’s just so ahead of the game at this point, and has been for YEARS   The dude literally told Patrick Patterson on the OPPOSING team, he was in the wrong spot on the defensive play they were setting up 🤣   So when I see people say oh he backed off, or didn’t do this, 9 times outta 10, Bron did it for a reason   I’m not Tryna get to on his nuts here, because obviously he’s not ALWAYS thinking ahead and he obviously makes mistakes, but there’s a lot of things he does that I don’t think your average viewer understands, and sees something positive he’s doing, as a negative"
That sub been toxic since day 1 lol.. Don't you remember all the salt with Demarre Carroll and Patrick Patterson?
"Screw it, give it to Patrick Patterson"
"Patrick Patterson  He was easily OKC’s worst rotation player for years. Couldn’t make a 3 to save his life, and then he had the galls to talk shit after leaving. You won’t find an OKC fan who likes 2pat."

"Patrick Patterson never really filled up the stat sheet but he was a consistent starter/6th man in the league for many years and I’ve honestly never seen someone so bad get so many minutes.  If the game was out of hand he was great, nailing 3’s, getting putbacks, etc.   If the game was even relatively close it was like watching a guy who barely knew how to play, every shot was a brick, his already bad defence dropped to another level, he was never in the right position. It was hard to watch. But he looked the part and his end of the year stats were alright so he would always get a job somewhere before they also realized he sucked and shipped him out."
"Biggest free agent signing for the Thunder was Patrick Patterson and I've seen PG, Russ and KD all leave during my time as a Thunder fan. The bleak reality is that small markets face competitive disadvantages that are hard to overcome."
yeah idk where he got Rondo from. Also puzzled by Patrick Patterson.
"Again Harden dragged a lineup of Jeremy Lin, Chandler Parsons, Omer Asia and Patrick Patterson to the playoffs and won two games against the first seed.  And your excuse is Curry “only” had a multiple all star and defensive player of the year, and capable role players in Wiggins and Oubre?"
He does have Early Bird. As does Patrick Patterson.
"JV was better than both the trash bros in 2014-2015. Powell won the game 7 vs. the Pacers. Derozan and Lowry were about equally trash all of those years and it's revisionist history for Raptors fans to say Lowry was never the problem, just because he stayed and DeMar got shipped. If Lowry was traded for kawhi fans would say the opposite.  Also Dwane Casey's lack of an offensive gameplan was the biggest issue. Way more than the talent. Literally made zero adjustments and watched his team get swept multiple years. LeBron was telling Patrick Patterson where to stand on an inbounds play for Christ's sake."
I would normally clown on Patrick Patterson but he didnt do anything either ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
"“Guys like Luka” was only Luka. He averaged around 20 minutes against Utah and around 25 minutes against Phoenix. He seemed to do well against regular-sized guards (Booker, CP3, Mitchell). It’s only big guards like Luka that he can’t defend.   Also, even if he’s bad in certain matchups, buying him out has no benefit to the team. It doesn’t get them anymore cap space. It opens up a roster spot, but the Clippers literally have Yogi Ferrel and Patrick Patterson on the bench so they’re not hurting for roster spots"
"Rondo is washed as hell as is Patrick Patterson at this point. Kennard, Ibaka, and Kawhi is not enough"
"Raptors legend, patrick patterson."
Patrick Patterson
"I actually used to like the Clippers a lot with CP3, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Jamal Crawford. It was fun to watch them. Now it's impossible for me to like them for so many reasons  **Paul George** - dude saying so much dumb shit all the time, plus deluding the entire OKC and Indiana.  **Pat Beverly**  - I love his defense, but the guys never know when to shut the hell up, and plays very dirty, resulting in various injuries.  **Marcus Morris**  - Do I even have to say why this guy is an asshole?  **Boogie Cousins**  - Again, a complete asshole who can't keep his emotions. Should become a boxer instead of a basketball player if he likes to fight all the time.  **Patrick Patterson**  - just have bad memories of his time in Toronto. Never worked out, partied all the time, didn't care whatsoever.  **Kawhi Leonard**  - I know I should adore him for helping the Raptors get their first ring, he's not an asshole by any means, but holy fuck is that guy boring as hell. I respect that he prefers his game to speak for him, but it's hard to root for a guy who avoids any talk, and constantly looks like he just wants to go home."
Patrick Patterson is a bum. Fuck that guy and what he thinks
KL rather chill with his family than sit beside patrick patterson
Patrick Patterson gonna show y’all
"Thing ive seen is that he can play good enough to be a bench player on a mid-low tier team.  But teams at that tier you'd rather take a younger player for that role that can potentially develop. Lastly he has the reputation of being a injury prone player which also is playing against him.  From the outside it doesn't really look like he has strong connections to other nba players. Ie like how Lebron can try to bring his buddie JR smith to the Lakers or how Patrick Patterson is somehow follow Paul George around. I don't think people see him as a ""locker room guy"" like a Jared Dudley type either."
Patrick Patterson is still on the Clippers???
"Daniel Oturu, Jay Scrubb, and Patrick Patterson took that personally."
Patrick Patterson
Why is Patrick Patterson shirt off lmao
 Pat Pat is Patrick Patterson. He's talking about Pat Bev.
"Im happy for Kawhi, Ibaka and Patrick Patterson (no joke). All former players that helped us over the years in building our program to where it is today"
"I saw after clicking the link, but initially the only names I could think of were Paul Pierce and Patrick Patterson"
"I still think about this Tweet from January – ""Patrick Patterson says he's been playing Pokémon Sword and Shield nonstop on the road and that his teammates look at him funny. He says he's very excited for the new Pokémon Snap."""
"nah, he'd be playing patrick patterson lmao"
My man Patrick Patterson came through the Limestone Chipotle and I asked him when the lockout was gunna end and he said man I hope tomorrow
"I think any random top 25 team is off.  And maybe not even the best teams some years could pull it off.  But I do believe some of the best college teams in history can definitely pull off some wins given 82 tries.  2018 Villanova I think has a shot.  They had Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divencenzo, Omari Spellman and Eric Pashcall who all made the NBA.  Phil Booth was in the G-League and Colin Gillespie was an all-American who will probably make the G-League or a European League after he 'graduates' next year.  Jermain Samuels might also go pro after he graduates next year as well.  That roster has 5 NBA players and 8 pros.  They were really good.  &amp;#x200B;  The 2010 Kentucky team was also really stacked.  They didn't win the title, but had John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, Daniel Orton, Patrick Patterson, Deandre Liggins and Darius Miller.  7 NBA players.  There are also a couple UNC and Duke rosters as well as Michigan's Fab Five.  Some of these teams I think can do much better than 1 win too.  Wouldn't be surpised if that Kentucky team could get at least 5."
OJ then up and transferred to play with…Patrick Patterson. I can assure you that matchup was no more fun to play against.
"I literally just quoted it. If you think a lineup of Omer Asik, Parsons, Patterson and Jeremy Lin, or a lineup of Capella, Gordon, Anderson and Patrick Beverly are extremely strong supporting cast you must be the most ignorant fan ever."
"Are you seriously using other players having great supporting casts as an argument for Steph? The guy who never won a tittle without at least 3 other hall of fame level guys?      And Harden made the playoffs with Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, Chandler Parsons and Patrick Patterson. There isn't really and excuse is there?"
"Why is it pretentious though? He was the best player on a team that was consistently winning 50 games there are only a handful of guys in the league you can say that about. in 15-16 the Raps won 56 games. Their top 8 guys in the rotation were Lowry, Demar, Carroll, JV, Cory Joseph, Patrick Patterson, Bismack Biyombo, and Terrence Ross. OKC had Durant, Westbrook, Serge and Adams and won 55."
"Well, the most bothersome thing is his response to the NBA postponing the Lakers Clippers game after Kobe's passing: ""What if we said no thanks don’t want to play the game you chose to cancel?”  Maybe it doesn't look as bad looking back but I was so pissed off at him. Guys like PatBev may be dickheads on the court, but Patrick Patterson is one off the court for that comment."
Why? Did Patrick Patterson hurt you?
"Patrick Patterson is a lot like PatBev in that whenever I see his name I feel the need to just feel the need to mention hes an absolute POS. Actually, I hate PatBev, but Par Patterson is worse"
"That sounds about right to me, Toronto Patrick Patterson was my comp before the Draft but he's honestly pretty versatile defensively"
Except they started Patrick Patterson over Grant even after Melo left lmao
"7 years later with a championship, smiling peacefully &amp; serenely thinking about John Salmons, Patrick Patterson, Greivis Vasquez, and Chuck Hayes all being more valuable to the Raptors than Rudy Gay was from the moment they were traded for each other. i miss 2014"
Let’s re-sign Patrick Patterson and the two losers can chill at EFS instead
"Generally players hate coming to Canada, but they also hate leaving Canada.  Patrick Patterson had a great Players Tribune article, when he got traded to Toronto he phoned his agent angrily as was like ""get me the fuck out of Canada, I'm not playing there"" and now he still comes back in the off-season despite not being Canadian nor being on the Raptors"
I think Patrick Patterson and Admiral Schofield are two other recent waivees by OKC.
"I'm so jealous lmao I had to hype myself for Alec Burks, Patrick Patterson and Raymond Felton for years and then the Lakers do this in two days"
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don’t bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"

"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
are those reasons that you're a raptors fan? a fanbase that historically overrates any and all players? Lol Yall had a bunch of funny nicknames and were really trying to sell the league on scrubs like Grievous Vasquez and Patrick Patterson
"Patrick Patterson, Marc, Serge, Kawhi and Lou Will before the deadline"
"Prime DeMar and Lowry were playing with Biyombo, Carroll, and Patrick Patterson."
I don't think being an end of the bench journeyman was the plan for Patrick Patterson but go off
best thing about Patrick Patterson is his wife
Fuck Patrick Patterson. Dude's a clown
Clippers F Patrick Patterson
Putting Patrick Patterson back on the Raptors is not cool
" Marquese Chriss, Quinn Cook, Patrick Patterson, Dennis Smith Jr.  Not a bad group to pick the 15th guy off the bench."
"Yogi Ferrel. I thought he was good, but since we waived him and he doesn't have another NBA destination at age 28, he seems to fit. We're not bringing Patrick Patterson back either, who was like obviously good enough for the NBA for a while but is fringe now."
"&gt; Curry was carrying straight bums, Juan Toscano became one of the best players and Mychal Mulder was having heavy minutes.   Harden carried a *starting* frontcourt of Omer Asik and Patrick Patterson to 45 wins."
It’s been FUCK Patrick Patterson since the bulldog comment 🤷🏾‍♂️
Patrick Patterson.
I’m pretty sure Patrick Patterson is
Kings isn't actually horrible:  Demarcus Cousins Bogdanović Rudy Gay Patrick Patterson Rajon Rondo
Its the story about Cavs Bron telling Patrick Patterson (Raps) where he needed to be on the offensive play.
Philly got horford our number 1 free agent was probably Patrick Patterson
"""one of our players""  bro you guys make a big spectacle about every scrub on the squad, do you remember when you dorks were called Grievous Vasquez ""General Grevious"" or calling Patrick Patterson ""2pat""? yall had other dorky names for everyone up to the 15th man  Every team does this but its just yall and the Lakers that do this shit extra extra"
"Patrick Patterson sent shade towards Toronto and OKC, but he’s too irrelevant for anyone to care lol."
Patrick Patterson still in the league jeez
"Just because one player is quoted as misunderstanding how things work, it doesn’t mean that that’s the way it is.  Living close to the US border has taught me about currency exchange.  We can do an exercise if you want…  Where are you located?  How much does bread cost?  Milk?  Eggs?  Make sure you list it in US currency.  Now I’ll list the same things in Canadian currency.  Bet you mine are significantly higher… or at least pretty close to the exchange rate on the whole.  American dollars will always equal Canadian dollars plus or minus the current exchange rate.  It can NEVER be different, even if Patrick Patterson thinks it is.  Also: it says *living* in Toronto.  Not many American players stay in the off-season and make their home there.  They’ll usually go back to whatever state they live in."
"https://torontosun.com/2015/01/21/getting-paid-in-us-cash-a-bonus-for-raptors-living-in-toronto  Raptors players are paid in American currency, which means as the Canadian dollar drops, their paycheque goes a lot further. While many focus on the perceived negative of playing in Canada where taxes are high (never mind that they are just as high or higher in many states), they can overlook the advantages of playing in Toronto when the dollar is sinking.  Few seem to recognize that there can be some financial positives to playing north of the border for players.  “Yeah, a lot of people don’t understand that we get paid in American money, than it gets converted over to Canadian or Canadian money gets converted to American money,” Raptors forward Patrick Patterson told the Toronto Sun on Wednesday"

"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
"I played a lot of AAU ball into early high school against OJ Mayo, Patrick Patterson, Mike Conley, and Greg Oden. Conley especially was just unreal. So fast and skilled, nobody could stay in from of him."
Sort of a random one but Patrick Patterson. I know he had decent stats and numbers but I hated watching that dude play. No idea why. Maybe all the bricks from three when all we needed was one man. Smh.
"Thomas was only good one playoffs, and was dreadful in his others.  Also why is that your definition of good, it's a guard dominate league saying there is only 4 good points guards per conference is wack. So if curry and Paul suddenly join the east, then 2 of the people on your list aren't considered good playoff performers anymore?   If Lowry and DeRozan were as bad/lackluster as you said, then how did the team manage to be a conference finalist and consistent 2nd round playoff team when we were giving Patrick Patterson and Demare Carrol 30 min a game"
Still getting the milli a year through 22-23 season. We’re Patrick Patterson this year too!  And we owe Kemba $53 Million. 26M this and 27M next season. Yeeesh
Patrick Patterson.  Should have been a perfect 3-D PF. But just isn't.
Bucks vs OKC biggest free agent signings who wins. I submit OKCs team. Everybody in prime  Derek Fisher  Caron Butler  Patrick Patterson  Mike Muscala  Nerlens Noel
"Reminds me of when we flipped Rudy Gay for Patrick Patterson, John Salmons, Grievus Vasquez, and Chuck Hayes lol     We lost the best player but actually became an NBA team again, and led to us acquiring what we needed for the run that followed.     Ended up flipping Grievus into Powell and OG."
"Rudy Gay, Aaron Gray, Quincy Acy for Patrick Patterson, John Salmons, Greivas Vasquez, Chuck Hayes.  Rudy Gay was the bad contract."
