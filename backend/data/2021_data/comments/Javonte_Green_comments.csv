"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
javonte green is a rocket
Javonte Green
I really really like Romeo Langford and Javonte Green also. Semi less so but he’s a fine 3 and D option.
"Did you see javonte green? I don’t even know how he’s in the nba, but he is athletic af. He’s ripped too."
"Boston needs bench depth, but Wings... as crazy as that sounds. last year we had Brown, Tatum, Hayward so there was no reason to get a wing because 1 of them was always on the floor and most of the time 2 of them were out there. Without Hayward this year on the wing we have Jaylen and Jayson. after that the depth is really: Javonte Green, Semi Ojeleye, Romeo Langford (injured), Aaron Neismith. the back up ball handlers are Teague, Pritchard, Edwards and Waters. IT was one of my favorite players, but we couldn’t really use any point guard help right now unless we move some guys."
I like Javonte Green
"It's insane. Dragic-Doncic-Bojan Bogdanovic-Saric-Jokic was right there.    Nurk backup 5, Vucevic backup 4 because he can shoot and Nurk can probably guard the 4 spot when they're in together, and Bogdan Bogdanovic handles 30 of the 40 minutes the perimeter 3 starters sit and surprisingly Montegrin Javonte Green gets the final 10.   Maybe even close with Bogdan in for Saric and Doncic at the 4."
"Mike and Scal saying they don’t think Korkmaz knew Javonte was right there, I think it’s the opposite. I think he knew he needed to dunk it because Javonte was right there, but the bobble on the catch led him into dunking reverse. If he laid that up softly it would’ve gotten spiked off the backboard, hell green actually got a piece of the ball while korkmaz was dunking it."
"Plays like that one always make me feel a little bad for the guy who picks up the foul (unless the dude who got fouled is on my team obviously): Javonte ran hard, went straight up, got his hand on the ball clean (though not enough to stop the dunk), and only ran into Korkmaz because he grabbed the rim to stop his momentum (which would have been goaltending if Green had done it too).  Refs 100% have to call that kind of contact to protect the players, but there was nothing reckless or out of control about either guy’s decision making there. Shit just happened.  Anyway, the real story is _damn_ what a pass by Simmons."
"I mean, think of it as lame all you want, but having Tatum playing instead of Javonte Green is a pretty big upgrade."
No Tatum? Running Javonte green in crunch time And embiid has to score 42 for you too... snatch the game in the last 3 minutes 😂😂😂 na fam we good you have faltered in too many post seasons against us for us to give a fuk
"Uh yeah I do. Tatum is also a very good defender and Javonte Green made multiple costly mistakes down the stretch. We also had a few stretches where Marcus Smart was our only starter playing, when normally we have one of Brown or Tatum in at all times. While Smart played well, Tatum scores more and more efficiently. And really the biggest thing is that we had every chance to pull ahead, but down the stretch we really struggled to get into our sets and get good looks because we were missing our best player. Not saying you specifically, but I don’t think people realize how much we play through Tatum—his on/off stats over the last couple seasons are insane."
"No, but at least we won't be playing Javonte Green in the 4th quarter"
Or maybe Tatum? We had Javonte Green on the court with three minutes left...
"Javonte Green,PP, Semi, Theis, and Smart to close out the half. Yikes"
"Javonte Green is that hyper dude that you know just wants to dunk it on every play, and I say let him."
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
Russell Westbrook wishes he was Javonte Green.
"How is Javonte Green not a better player? He’s a freak athlete even by NBA standards. I know that isn’t everything, but it’s pretty important in basketball."
Javonte green feels like he's too talented to be a 11th guy on a roster
Javonte Green is so fast
Javonte Green &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   Then and now
"Horford to Toronto is pretty interesting. I don’t think we’re in the running for Hill. Payton Pritchard has turned out to be a really good bench PG, especially for a rookie and Brad Stevens trusts Jeff Teague with reckless abandon. Plus, we still have our tiny toons guards.  We need another wing to be honest. Semi Ojeleye has actually been very good this season so far but after him and the Jays, it’s pretty barren. Javonte Green is an exciting deep bench guy but he shouldn’t be getting many minutes, we don’t know if Romeo Langford will be able to stay healthy and Nesmith just isn’t ready to contribute yet (he looks fine, just needs to be in the nba system to catch up to the game).  Plus, Danny ainge almost NEVER makes roster adjustments mid-season outside of 10-day contracts."
Jeff Green   Draymond Green   Javonte Green   Danny Green   JaMychal Green   Josh Green
"Man somehow this guy plays more than Javonte Green, Carden Edwards, Romeo Langford etc. but gotta admit he’s been ballin"
"I liked the Pritchard pick as well but was really opposed to Nesmith. A 20% jump in 3pt shooting in one season rarely happens, not to mention it was on a pretty small sample size against non-conference opponents. Plus he doesn’t do anything else well offensively. On the other side of the floor, his lateral quickness and defensive IQ leaves a lot to be desired. All in all, he looks like a project.   I liked Bey because he could fit into our rotation like a glove and give us much-needed wing minutes. Right now we have to rely on Semi Ojeleye and Javonte Green for backup wing minutes."
You forgot javonte green
We don’t have any other wings to play lol. Semi was already out there. Javonte Green is in COVID protocol. Unless we wanted to go super small and put Carsen Edwards out there
"you say bench forwards, but we are fucking playing two bigs most of the time, or starting Semi Ojeleye or Javonte Green, OR BOTH.  But yeah, Jerami Grant doesn't seem like a guy who wants to be 3rd-4th scoring option."
"I was taking a weighted average of the Celtics roster.  Theis=5th man.  Semi, Javonte Green, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters &amp; Jeff Teague are all 11th-14th men to out of the league so they drag him down with them."
Semi ojele and javonte green are just too valuable you know?
He didn't have Javonte Green in the corner with the hops to bail him out that time.
Fine  u/celtics get:  Bradley Beal  Davis Bertans  Moritz Wagner  u/WashWizards get:  Kemba Walker  Tristan Thompson  Javonte Green  2021 - RD 1  2021 - RD 2  2021 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/qr\_UOhwtQ
"Would somebody please invite Javonte Green. Idgaf if he's a 3rd string bench guy, the dude can dunk a basketball"
Didn't see it but I'd guess javonte Green.
"Sadly in this case it is. Grant Williams, Javonte Green, and Tremont Waters are not NBA players. Semi Ojeleye and Carsen Edwards are maybe 12th men. There's 5 guys, an entire lineup, that doesn't belong on a contending team. The only real case is Ojeleye would be a fine 12th man on a contender.  There's plenty of current free agents that would be better. The Nets just released like 3 guys who would be upgrades didn't they?"
We already have Javonte Green
"It’s not about total games played. Having a couple extra days off in early January cuz of COVID does not make playing so many games in Febuary any easier. And looking at Boston’s top 5 of Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, and Theis, every single one of them has had injury problems and have had to miss games. No team has had to consistently play without 2+ of their top 5 players (but different guys missing each time) all season. You also just ignore Boston’s lack of depth in general makes a more condensed schedule much harder on them than other teams. Boston has had guys like Javonte Green, Jeff Teague, Carsten Edwards, Semi, and Grant Williams start games this season. The Pacers haven’t had to stoop that low this season."
"Boston doesn’t have a middle of the pack record, they’re a middle of the pack playoff team by their record. Those other dudes were on some of the worst team in the conference.  I get that all teams have had to deal with their own issues, just frankly none of them have been on Boston’s level. Smart and Kemba have only played half the games and most of Kemba’s have been rough coming off of injury. Theis, Jaylen, and Tatum have also had to miss a few each. And no other team has had a schedule as compressed as Boston’s. Indy played 16 games in January, 31 days. Boston’s having to play 19 in  February, 28 days. Those are not comparable.  Yea Sabonis is having a great year. Tatum and Browns stats are a little better tho when you factor in the usage rating and lack of quality teammates hurting their efficiencies. Indy doesn’t have to deal with guys like Teague and Javonte Green getting minutes."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
"Because all 3 are better than the perimeter players they have besides Pritchard, and Pritchard can't play with Kemba.  I think he could play Javonte Green a bit more, but the other wings are just bad, hopefully for them Langford gives them something when he comes back"
I don't think it's that complicated. We're putting multiple fringe-NBA players on the court at the same time for long stretches. We had Javonte Green as our primary defender on Trae Young. We're playing 11+ players when we have 3 rotational players injured because we're searching for any signs of life from our bench.
Javonte green
Semi has started the last two games. Obviously he doesn’t start when healthy but if we are missing Kemba and Smart and have to resort to starting Semi Ojeleye and Javonte Green we have a problem. We need 2/3 more good bench pieces.
"I want a cavs 2018 type deadline. Like get rid of Semi, Javonte Green, Grant, Carsen, Teague. That's 1/3 of your roster that is legit terrible"
We can waive Javonte Green and trade Jeff Teague to clear the space
"Just in theory: a trade of Tatum, Brown and Smart go to New Orleans and AD comes to Boston.   Kyrie and Al both leave and who knows if you sign Kemba but we'll play along and say you do (he probably doesn't come without Tatum and Brown here)  That leaves you with:  Kemba, Edwards, Hayward, AD, Theis,   Wanamaker, Langford, Grant, Timelord, Kanter  Javonte Green, Semi and Poirier.  That's not a championship roster. That's not even an ECF roster. So no it's not a guaranteed title. You have to look at how your roster is currently constructed."
"Im intrigued on Javonte Green, I'd sign Adreian Payne  and offer him instead."
"For sure that’s part of it. I just mean having Brown/Tatum/Hayward all being facilitating wings made it crowded. You’re seeing Brown take on more ball handling this year because it’s not split between him and Hayward. None of those 3 guys are effective as just spot up shooters, even if they’re capable of hitting the shots, which is basically the role Brown had last year. I remember recalling he needed the ball in his hands more but there were plenty of games where he just didn’t touch it in the 4th. I don’t blame the injury on coaching or the year after where Hayward was legitimately a liability on defense. Rushing him back for the Miami series last year was also just not him being 100%. They just never got a real shot at full strength with him and Kyrie.  I think the real problem, especially this year, is missing a key piece whether it’s Tatum, Smart or Kemba (them + Brown have been on the floor together for 21 minutes I think was the stat) is having that extra playmaker spaces the floor better. Right now their drives are getting stifled by collapsing defenses and their other guys aren’t getting open enough looks or just aren’t knocking them down because they don’t have that extra guy to account for so they can crowd the paint and guys like Semi Ojeleye or Grant Williams aren’t good enough without being wide open. Hayward also helped in this regard which is why he would be useful right now, because Boston’s half court offense looks totally inept. It’s the exact same problem they had against Miami’s zone and they really need the extra guy.  Yeah the coach needs to make adjustments to the personnel but when you don’t have the depth I think there’s only so much you can do because you’re not going to see guys like Aaron Nesmith or Javonte Green drive and distribute the same way that Tatum, Brown, Smart and Kemba can."
PP Kemba Teague Tremont Waters Javonte Green.
"He had precisely one good shooting game where I was like ""oh, I see why we picked him up"", the rest of the time he was pretty bad. We ended up taking Javonte Green over him which was a reasonable decision at the time, and Green has at least been playable so I'm not as miffed as I would've been if he was 100% useless."
We cut him to sign Javonte Green    Edit: Ainge paid him like 450k for a summer's worth of games
Javonte Green?
"I think Kemba is just what he is at this point. If we could move him on for a PG that can get to the rim and score and defend better then I would. idk who is going to want him at this point though.  We need to do something with that trade exception too. It is possible that something big happens esp with the 9 role players currently getting time/looking serviceable.  Kemba/JT/JB/Smart/Thompson/Theis/PP are the only playoff worthy players they have right now.  Teague/Grant Williams/Timelord/Semi/Edwards/Nesmith/Javonte Green are not realistically good enough. If we could turn 3-4 of them into one player to get into the first group, we could be in business.  Edit - Grant Williams looks like the closest to knocking on the door of the other group. He has played really well. Gotta see it for a long time first though."
Javonte green and Payton Pritchard
"Half of Bostons games lost is just by Tristan Thompson, Langford and Javonte Green lol"
"when we were mostly injured, yes. Our bench consisted of pritchard, edwards, javonte green, nesmith, tacko"
"1. Lavine 2. Vucevic 3. Thad 4. Theis 5. Sato 6. Williams 7. Temple 8. Markkanen 9. White 10. Troy Brown Jr 11. Aminu 12. Arci 13. Valentine 14. Javonte Green 15. Felicio  Not much separation at all between that 4-9 tier though, they’re all very, very close to each other and you could probably order them just about any way."
Tristan Thompson Jeff Teague Daniel Theis Javonte Green and semi ojeleye and 2 2nd round picks all for JJ . Or we could keep Thompson and Ojeleye and deal the rest of the players for Fournier Wagner and Kornet.  Ill take the younger guy who might sign with us for the future
"I think it was also salary dump to get off of Kanter's contract... which is also dumb considering that Kanter would be better than TT.  It's just a bad move, we could've easily cut Carsen Edwards or Javonte Green or someone to keep Bane too but anyway"
"1) lavine 2) Vooch 3) Thad 4) Lauri 5) Pat 6) Coby 7) Sato 8) Temple 9) Valentine 10) Archidiacono  Did not rank : Theis, Troy brown Jr, Aminu , Javonte green"
"I don’t know how the season will play out given how close all these teams are to each other, but I do think there’s some context missing about our losses to you. Not only didn’t we have Kemba in both our losses, but we were also missing Smart (who we’ve been missing all year) and in our first loss, we also didn’t have Theis. As a result we had Jaylen Brown as point guard in our first game against you in a lineup with Tatum/Javonte Green/Semi Ojeleye/Tristan Thompson. This was against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela. In our second loss, we were on a back to back on the road having played four games in six days and we had Jeff Teague starting. In the one game Kemba played, he led our team in scoring, plus minus, and steals and really was the difference throughout the game."
"TT, Javonte Green, 2021 second from OKC, and our 2021 lottery protected first for Norman Powell."
Celtics got depth? Lmao what? You’re a casual bruh  They’re playing Javonte Green and Semi Ojeleye lol
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
"Celtics have one Javonte Green available, will gladly send him to Denver for the low low price of Jokic"
"Our centers arent great but playing Robert Williams, Theis, and TT is a lot better than playing Ojeleye, Grant Williams, and Javonte Green."
"Javonte Green. Pretty much nobody outside of Celtics fans knows who he is but wow, he can throw it down"
"We've had by far the most games missed by Covid, which includes Tatum really struggling for a full month after returning. Both teams have had it bad.   But also, see the title of this article - the Hawks have good depth. The Celtics do not. Depth is our problem, and that becomes exasperated when we miss games. You have Solomon and Goodwin starting; we've had Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Tremont Water, Mo Wager and Javonte Green start games.  And remember, this conversation was originally about top end players, not the team in general."
Javonte green. If there’s one thing he loves to do it’s just dunk the ball as hard as he possibly can.
Javonte Green = DaBaby  Jaylen Brown = Khalid  Kyrie Irving = Uncle Drew
"Ok Danny, time to go get these 2 and get javonte green back please"
Javonte Green was key tonight
I wish Javonte Green was still on the Celtics.
"I will stay we were in a worse shape, both teams were shorthanded as you say, but we f'in started Javonte Green who's not even an NBA player. I still really like Marcus Smart on Trae Young much more than Hunter on whoever he's guarding"
"Wizards-Bulls-Celtics trade:  Wizards give up Moe Wagner and Troy Brown Jr. to get Daniel Gafford and Chandler Hutchison  Celtics give up Daniel Theis and Javonte Green for Moe Wagner and Luke Kornet  Bulls give up Daniel Gafford, Chandler Hutchison, and Luke Kornet for Troy Brown Jr., Daniel Theis, and Javonte Green"
While talking with respected nba player and at the time teammate javonte green tatum was saying when he gets a fresh cut he feels like hes top 5. Green asked top 5 what giving us the infamous just top fye quote.
"Look I agree that from an asset standpoint, it's an objectively bad trade, but there are some other factors at play here:  1. Remember that Moneyball scene where Billy Beane tells Art Howe to play Hatteberg since he can't play Pena anymore because he plays for the Tigers now and Beane traded him? Well that's kinda what it was like for us with Theis and Timelord. In order to open up minutes for Rob to keep developing, we had to sacrifice one of Theis/Thompson and because Theis was an impending FA, made more sense to trade him.   2. Wyc wanted to duck the luxury tax, we don't really pay the tax very often. Not unless we have a ""contender"" according to Wyc's words, and this team obviously demonstrated that it wasn't anything close to that.   Trade in essence has turned out as:  Theis, Teague, Javonte Green, 2 2nds for Fournier, Kornet, and now Jabari.   I'd still do that trade today, Kornet has been surprisingly decent, might be our Baynes replacement."
You can add Javonte and Josh Green for depth too!
"As a Bulls fan I gotta say that Lavine would probably be a 30 ppg scorer if he had spacing (which has been a problem with our inconsistency and roster changes every week or so) and capable playmaking. Zach is limited in defense and isn't the best playmaker but he's elite at scoring from anywhere. It's amazing he even puts up his numbers with the quality of the shots he takes. Gladly our FO is making moves to help take the load off him. Vucevic and Theis have been great giving us capable interior scorers instead of whatever WCJ and Markkanen are (I love them but come on guys stop regressing), Troy Brown Jr. being the defensive spark plug swiss army knife that every team would love and Javonte Green being... well actually decent for us."

Idk what's up with Kuzma tbh but more forward depth wouldn't be terrible. He'd be a whatever 8th man and he has more trade value than TBJ or Green probably.   I'd rather have Kuzma just to keep the Denzel's out of rotation since TBJ misses a lot of games.   With Javonte I could flip a coin since he's probably better than Kuzma imo.
Me too. Sato is a decent playmaker even if some areas of his game are just bad. Pat is a raw project but he has talent so nope. TBJ is a pretty great defender who has shown flashes of being more capable on both sides so nope. Javonte is Javonte. Maybe over Javonte Green but this series hasn't done Kuzma any favors.
"If this is true, I almost have to believe Ainge wanted to use the full TPE this off season, but Stevens knew they needed help this season with both their jobs on the line and so Fournier was the compromise to not have the season totally fall apart  I wonder if Ainge’s long-term plan just got derailed by Stevens’ requests (which ownership sided with Stevens) and Ainge had enough where it’s heading back towards rebuild rather than contention.  That’s the only thing that makes sense if it was centered around the trade deadline where they dealt Theis and Javonte Green (Tatum’s best friend on the team) and wanted to wait to use the TPE and missed the boat on Vucevic"
"Yeah iirc it was Gafford and Chandler Hutchison to the Wizards, javonte green and theis and Troy brown to the bulls, moe Wagner and Luke kornet to the Celtics"
I'm glad to see Javonte Green is finally getting some recognition
"We traded up for one of the best bigs in the NBA, and shuffled off the pointlessly expensive Otto Porter Jr. and a slew of underperforming players that were given 1.5 to 3 seasons in a row of chances to improve(though I still see a lot of potential in Gafford.) Theis is a stud, and an underrated stretch big. Troy Brown Jr. is still kinda raw, but his upside is very high. And Moe Wagner and Javonte Green could come in handy when Donovan wants to play big on shorter forwards, or play short &amp; boxy on taller forwards. The last two aren’t total studs, but they’re no slouches either. Losing picks sucks, but the Bulls have 6 guys under the age of 25, and getting younger hasn’t turned into winning for Chicago.  I’m very hopeful for 21-22, but because injuries are random, I’m trying to not set myself up for disappointment. We’ll see how it all plays out!"
Leaving out Javonte Green! And Gerald Green should get a shoutout even though it's a G
Javonte green
How could you forget Javonte Green
Forgot about Javonte Green
Eh he probably won’t get to play unless somebody is injured and even then I would think Javonte Green would play in that case but he’ll able to develop with a good roster instead of thrown to the wolves. He can be a really good back up in the future
"But they also can't sign anyone until Lauri is off the books, not even their 2nd rounders. They're ~44k away from the hard cap with Lauri's cap hold, and given that they only have 10 players signed right now (including Tony Bradley and Javonte Green) they'll have to just take what they can get at some point."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Theis, announced. Javonte Green, announced. Caruso, not officially announced but he's already posted an official goodbye to LA, so it's safe to assumehe's agreed to terms. I agree the resolution of Lauri's situation is probably causing the delay."
"javonte green might be the better option than gerald at this point, but that would be pretty dope honestly."
"Reports are that Chicago is still trying to deal Lauri, so they may be waiting until that deal is finalised before announcing anything. The Bulls have announced the signing of javonte green, because he was a basic signing with the same cap hold as his contract. All their other signings may be affected be other parts of their dealings"
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jamychal Green, Javonte Green, Jalen Green… who else?"
"Poirer was already on a guaranteed contract. It came down to him and Javonte Green. I liked Green, he played his role really well. I do wish we had Strus instead of Poirer though, that would be a no brainer today."
feels extremely good watching USA basketball when the team works and your 3-level scoring outliers actually look the part. Pure luxury watching Lavine play like he’s Javonte Green. Your guys getting 12% usage and standing in the corner get the ball and reveal they’re also Kobe. Absolutely surreal feeling.
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
Sign with the Nuggets. Then we'll acquire Draymond from GSW to have a monopoly on Green.  Edit: Forgot about Javonte and Josh.  Make it happen TC!
marcus smart with javonte green athleticism
Javonte Green? Pop Smoke?
Is Javonte green from STL? What is his connection with Tatum again? I knew they were friends but forgot the origin
"Curry brother in law , Lebron with Dudley &amp; James Jones , Tatum with Javonte Green he might be coming back &amp; Jr Smith when he was a knick"
"Stanley, derozan, Patrick Williams, djj, Troy brown jr, javonte green, and I think one more I’m forgetting"
"Javonte green, super athletic and sometimes looks like a stud when he plays, but then will have a stretch shooting like 0-10 and making rookie mistakes and ride the pine again."
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
Javonte Green has a German league all star nod. It's basically the same thing.
"I would like a team of Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jalen Green, Draymond Green and Javonte Green please."
"They still have javonte green I think, so DeGreenBallZach might work"
"Caruso is playing 28 and lonzo 36 so far. I'd imagine they want to bring those minutes down. Also, I think Coby takes minutes from Troy Brown Jr. And Javonte Green"
"Still questions on whether Coby can be a consistent scorer too. He averages out to 15-20ppg, but he gets in his head quite a bit on 3pt shooting. I think he pans out though, he's got the skill &amp; overall mentality.   Vegas rates us at 7 on the moneyline, I think that's honestly pretty fair. The thing that's underrated is some of these bench pickups. I've really liked Javonte Green, Alize Johnson, and Troy brown Jr, their production has been key to our 4-0 streak imo."
"Jeff Green, JaMychal Green, Javonte Green, Jraymond Green, who else?"
"This team is so much better than this time last year. Lonzo, DeRozen, Caruso, Alize Johnson, Ayo Dosunmo are all new to the team this off-season.  Vucivic, Javonte Green, Troy Brown Jr joined at the trade deadline last year."
"I'm sorry, what ? Caruso is an amazing bench player, okay. Then afterwards none of these players would play minutes in the playoffs for a contender.   Coby White is the 7th best player on this team and he's shot 40% from the field in his career, he's not a good player. Then who ? Javonte Green is very average and hasn't played a lot of NBA basketball, I know Alize Johnson as a Nets fan, lots of potential but he's still very raw. He has only played in 50 NBA games and it's his 4th season. TBJ is average, Bradley is average and Ayo is a rookie.  You say that's a very good bench, I say that's a very bad bench and in the playoffs you will have to play liabilities a lot of minutes. One major injury and the team falls off hard"
"The disrespect to Ayo, Alize, and Javonte Green in the Bulls blurb is absurd. I know none of these guys are going to be in the running for 6th man, but all 3 have been nothing but solid 3 games in."
The Lonzo/Lavine/Caruso/Javonte/Pat lineup is going to be demonic va teams who don’t have a full blown post up threat. And having Demar (offense) and Caruso/Green (defense/overall aggression) as mentors should push Pat even further towards the trajectory of being a star.
Javonte Green
Jalen Green  Josh Green  Javonte Green  Jamychal Green  Jeff Green
You forgot Javonte Green.
"Why do all the Celtics 15th men go on to become decent rotation players elsewhere? And why can't we keep any of these guys who would clearly be better than many of our current options?   Abdel Nader, PJ Dozier, Max Strus, and now Javonte Green."
"Celtics could use an athletic, defensive minded player coming off their bench. Maybe someone like Javonte Green?"
Javonte Green is the man.
javonte green is nice
Javonte Green is the engine
We manhandled them with 6’4 Javonte Green starting at power forward
"Obviously Caruso is amazing. Coby will be great when he's back as a spark plug scorer.  Beyond that it's shallow, but I'm pretty hyped about hte potential of: Green/Johnson/Derrick Jones Jr. as defensive rotation guys.  Javonte Green especially was playing out of his mind in the preseason.  I don't think all three will be particularly good, but I think one of them is going to pop and give us something consistently.   Ayo is fun but super raw so I think he'll have moments where he helps but won't look forward to any stretch where we rely on him. I think we'll do a fair bit of staggering DeMar and LaVine even though they can start/close together so we can paper over some lack of scoring."
"If only they were all on Houston they could triple up with Jalen. They night even be able to swing the trade for Josh green from Dallas and Javonte green from the Bulls. They could legitimately get J. Green, J. Green, J. Green, J. Green, and J. Green on the court"
So is 28 year old preseason superstar Javonte Green who has never established himself as an NBA regular **NOT** actually a stud?  Bulls need more from the bench.
Javonte green
i think the fact that P Will is p much a lockdown starter meanwhile Caruso is coming off the bench means Caruso fits a bit more.   That being said my vote for darkhorse important bench piece vote goes to Javonte Green ngl. He's impressed me this preseason
"""There's five Javonte Greens out there"" as applied to high-energy guys like Green and, previously, Nwaba (I can't remember who else) is a favourite of mine too!"
The Chicago Bulls resigned 1 Javonte Green and ended up with 5.
"That's true, OG is one of the best defenders in the league.  My point was that the Bulls have recruited a ton of good defenders. Even if they aren't as good as OG (and very few players in the world are) guys like Caruso, Lonzo, Troy Brown, Javonte Green, Derrick Jones, Tony Bradley, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Pat Williams - up and down the roster Chicago is filled with lengthy, athletic wing defenders who can help offset the deficiencies of LaVine and DeRozan.  Toronto went the other way by finding solid two way players."
"Based on the last 2 games (small sample size I know) but the scheme seems to be for our good defenders (Lonzo, Troy Brown, Javonte Green, Caruso etc) to pick up their man really early and pressure every pass by swarming the ball handler. It may work it may not but I don't think the Bulls will be the worst defence in the league running this type of defensive scheme"
"Whoa whoa slow down a bit. Javonte has had 2 great preseason games and as a C's fan I love to see him killing it. But Williams is a better defender and more importantly can play the 4 position where Green is like a generous 6'4"" / 6'5"". He's also a better 3 point shooter. I can't wait to see Green play alongside Caruso off the bench, pair them both with Lonzo and there will be so many buckets in transition"
Javonte Green has been looking nice for us too
Also Jalen and Javonte. All J. Green starting five baby let's do it
"I've been extremely impressed by Javonte Green. He was an afterthought of the three team trade we were in at the deadline, and now he's running with the starters and actually holding his own."
"Troy Brown Jr and Javonte Green, both gonna be important pieces off the bench."
"Javonte Green, if this guys hustle carries over to the regular season I think he can be a good contributing rotational player"
"I feel weird saying this but I bet we take a brief step back on that when Pat Will comes back. Javonte has no fear or timidness and fits right in as needed amongst the “stars.” Pat is the 4 we need, and he will be a monster defender, but I hope he’s ready to rock the way Green has been."
Javonte Green looked amazing in the first preseason game yes it’s preseason but still
Javonte green just for his putback over markkanen
Caruso was the underrated pickup IMO. And Javonte Green.  Caruso looks like he spent a few years under Bron and is happy to wheel out some very fun passes.
Just watched the highlights and I'm both sad and really happy that Javonte Green is getting some decent runs. Absolutely love his energy and he can really run and dunk. Looks like he is finally in a good spot for that to be valued!
"everybody though Theis was the main piece of that trade last season, little did they know that the real main piece was Javonte Green"
Javonte “New Finnisher” Green
Miss seeing Javonte Green in green but glad he's getting better opportunities.   His dunks are so fun to watch.
Javonte Green is an absolute joy to watch. Really fast in transition too.
Javonte Green is Gary Payton reincarnated btw
Javonte Green has half of them on his own
"Lavine, DeRozan, Derrick Jones Jr., Caruso, Javonte Green, and Lonzo for lobs.  This team feels like it was BUILT to generate highlight dunks, and there's substance to the style too, since the Bulls proved last year that they can create a good defense out of bad-to-mediocre personnel."
"So am I wrong to say that this Bulls team is a highlight dunk factory?  Think about it: Lavine, DeRozan, Derrick Jones Jr., Caruso, Javonte Green, and Lonzo for lobs. This team is gonna lead the league in posters-per-minute."
Javonte Green is now my favorite player
"Lonzo is shooting lights out from 3 this year, Javonte Green is a dunk machine, and the skills challenge always has somewhat older guys so I chose DeRozan especially because of the year he’s having."
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
Lonzo little bro’d Melo tonight with that fire pg energy and 3pt range and Vucci Man3 had himself a 30 piece tonight hitting all them 3s we knew he had in him. AC Fresh showin out with his usual self and Javonte Green bringing that hustle energy. Oh and DeMar DeRozan is a midrange god but we already knew that.   Fr tho Charlotte is a fun team to watch and this was definitely one of our most fun games so far.
"If you commit to it and leverage the advantages in other areas it can be a viable strategy. Chicago is doing something similar, playing 3 and 4 guard rotations and playing big minutes with guys like 6'4 Javonte Green and 6'5 Derrick Jones Jr at C. Even though true bigs can bully them inside it's difficult to crash the boards against them because you have 5 guys on the floor who can punish you in transition.  Obviously every strategy has counters so it's unlikely that it'll be a go-to strategy long-term, but when you're only playing each team 2-3 times a year there's less game planning than in a 7 game series, so you can get away with it for a time."

Man i was ready to throw some hands once i saw Javonte Green but then I kept reading your comment 😂
We got P Will coming back from injury just in time for the 2nd round. And Javonte Green. He scares me
when javonte green was recently out the bulls were starting tony bradley for a couple games and it was so hard to watch
Javonte Green  Edit: o shit he’s 28 my bad
"We've been playing 6'5 Derrick Jones Jr and 6'3 javonte green at center and it's been working for the most part. They've been better than Tony Bradley on everyone who's not a bruiser, and then we have vooch when he comes back for that"

"It was Dunk City in Denver tonight, mostly from bawler DJJ dunkin all over everybody. Zach once again showing why he’s one of the hottest players in the league right now (in more ways than one obviously). Javonte Green showing everyone that hustla mentality. He’ll make that big ass dunk one day lmao. Oh and Bulls fans pretty much took over Ball Arena 😂"
I am a Javonte Green Enjoyer
Zach Lavine and Javonte Green have had an amazing last 2 minutes.
also put some respect on DJJ's name and also mr 2xtremebounce Javonte Green
Yeah not sustainable with Javonte Green and DJJ playing the 5... It will help to get our all star center back.
"Bulls small ball line up is full of vertical athletes: Lavine, Derozan, DJJ, Javonte Green  Pat Williams when healthy and Lonzo are pretty nice too"
"Patrick Williams got hurt so we are rotating the 4, Javonte Green was starting there and now Caruso is."
"Also shout outs to great contributions from our bench mob. DJJ was fucking amazing and the best back up center in the league, Javonte Green is the best Green in the league. like this team NICE"
Bulls are anime as fuck.  Lavine playing one handed and 6’3 Javonte Green owning AD because he can jump super high
"At the same time, however, the Bulls had 6’6 Jones Jr. at C and 6’4 Javonte Green at PF which was how Westbrook was able to score in the paint with ease. Although, the Bulls’ athleticism &amp; quick switching on D has worked very well this year."
"Attended the game and it was awesome! It felt like there were almost as many Bulls fans as Clippers fans — as a Bulls fan myself, it was a great feeling.  DeMarvelous DeRozan was so dominant all game, but in the first half he was automatic. I’m starting to see comments here and there about him being a dark horse MVP candidate, and while that’s an optimistic take IMO, his impact for this team cannot be understated. He keeps the offense afloat when the bench is in (bench mob has a lot of high energy guys but no real playmakers while Coby White is out), and he’s a real calming presence with the starters which really showed on nights like this. Every time the Clippers pushed to within 5 or so down the stretch, the Bulls answered. When we just needed a bucket, DeMar got one for us. The team was poised under pressure and pulled off a solid win on the road. This sort of thing never happened in the last few years. Usually, it’s just Zach playing hero ball (out of necessity), and when his shot wasn’t falling (as it wasn’t in the first half tonight) we’d fall apart. But with DeMar, Zach doesn’t need to force as much and can focus on hitting the big shots he’s now proving he can hit.   Then add in Lonzo looking like a bonafide sniper and Caruso locking down everyone. Plus high motor guys in Javonte Green and Ayo Dosunmu off the bench. This team is so much fun to watch.   I’M HYPE, NEIL FUNK!"
Watching Javonte Green try to guard him as a 6’5 power forward was too funny. Javonte was really playing great defense most of the game. It didn’t matter at all to Durant. He took every shot like no one else was on the court.
Javonte green
I thought JaVonte Green had been pretty solid for the Bulls?
"Along with Javonte Green, he’s the one starter I look and went huh. Who he play for? But god damn if this guy isn’t good. I thought Ingram coming back would impact him but there’s no stopping the Herb."
To be fair to us we're missing 2 starters including an all star center and had to play javonte green at the 5 half the game.
I'd say this play was less chemistry between them and more Javonte Green playing terrible defense. He wasn't really doing anything and watched Looney take his sweet time to set the pick on Caruso.
"Draymond gestured to Poole to clear out and then Steph points to the spot he wants the pass. Caruso misses it because he's busy watching Draymond, but the real lapse is Javonte Green not sniffing out the action and switching onto Steph when he gets the screen from Looney."
Someone let Javonte Green know Steph takes being picked up full court as disrespect. Before Steph gets angry
Javonte will play so Green won't be out dw
But also his primary defender was 6’5” javonte green
"if we keep this shit up and don't end up trading for a 4, Javonte Green MIP"
JAVONTE WOOO GREEN
"Gonna sound corny but our biggest strength right now is team chemistry. I didn't foresee that all these new guys were gonna adapt to each other and LaVine so quickly.  Our biggest weakness is obviously depth at 4 and forward defense. With Patrick Williams gone, we can only make do with Javonte Green and DJJ for so long. Also we probably need a more experienced backup 5, Tony Bradley is fine and I like his game actually. But someone gotta be able to challenge and/or complement Vucevic."
"I like the conscious effort to get Vuc going early. Really liked Vucs pass to Green down low, Javonte just has to calm down there and recognize he had some time"
Javonte Green co-signs this.
Javonte green is so chaotic
Maybe I'm wrong but Javonte Green seems like he's running around doing a lot of nothing. Is he normally like that?
They look good but they are gonna have to find a 4. Javonte Green is fun there but KD and Giannis would be feasting in the postseason.
"Well the thing about Williams is that he is a pretty replaceable player as it stands. People are really high on him because of his potential, but he is basically a net neutral for now. Javonte Green is very similar in that way as he plays defense and scores easy baskets. Him and DJJ should be fine in covering for Williams production, but offer little of his upside."
"I loved that Billy Donovan realized Javonte Green was struggling to defend the bigger forwards so he sat the rest of the game for a different lineup.  I like Green, but it wasn’t his matchup tonight and Billy made the right change to try something different. It will be so interesting when Coby White returns to see what lineups Billy runs with."
That guy is Javonte Green
"&gt;How good would the All-Green team be? Add Javonte, Draymond and Danny.  What color would their jerseys be?"
"All-Greens:  Jalen Green, Josh Green, Jeff Green, Draymond Green, JaMychal Green.   6th man: Javonte Green"
"thats only 4 though, you need one more. Someone ring up Javonte Green"
No probably Javonte Green  Edit: I’ll leave this up since I was dumb enough to be the tenth person to say it
I just think Javonte Green is better than Pat Williams this year
"It is too early to talk about a trade but our options at 4 are DeRozan, Javonte Green and Alize Johnson right now. I don't know if that's tenable for a full season.  Hopefully he'll come back better than ever, that's all I care about right now. I still believe in Patrick Williams and his future is gonna be bright."
Javonte Green started in his place during preseason
Javonte green started at the 4 in preseason and was objectively a better player than Williams. This sux but honestly the bulls are probly a better team without his entitlement minutes
"I highly doubt we trade White before he plays with us. Bench scoring is a pretty big issue and he can bring that when he comes back. Maybe if it doesn't work out we could trade him in January, but if we're looking for a quick solution we have DJJ and the Portland pick to trade. Until then, it's the Javonte Green show."
Javonte Green will start.
"He's the best defensive wing we have, by a shit load. We now have nobody on this team who can be even asked to defend the Durants/Giannis/Randles/Tatums of the east. The expected plan is to play Javonte Green at PF, and Javonte Green is 6'4. We basically have to become a ""outscore our opponents because we can't really hope to contain them"" team without a major trade right now."
I’ve only watched 3 of their games this year but wasn’t impressed with Williams tbh. I think Javonte Green has been way better in every game I’ve watched.   Long term Williams has all star potential but he is so far away from that right now.
"Javonte Green is a much better defender, Williams’ defense is more theoretical at this point especially on ball, but it does suck that he won’t get the chance to grow into his role this year"
Our next best Power Forward is either Derrick Jones Jr. or Javonte Green. How do you think they could handle defending Julius Randle?
