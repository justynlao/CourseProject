Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo  Duncan Robinson  Max Strus  Omer Yurtseven  Gabe Vincent
Omer Yurtseven could develop into an All-Star. His work ethic and drive is better than people realize.
Omer Yurtseven for the Heat. Been balling in summer league and has the length and shot to be a good stretch
"I think we had to include something to incentivize the Raptors to sign and trade.  Plus, I 100% believe Omer Yurtseven would've ended up taking Precious's minutes if both were on the roster (another dude ballin in summer league...averaging 25 &amp; 13 with 2.6 blocks per game)."
You must not know about Omer Yurtseven
"The others years didn't really matter but this year  1. Oladipo is out most of the season 2. guys like Gabe Vincent, Max Struss, Kz Okpala, Omer Yurtseven are projects/unplayable 3. Miami actually is opting not to use the 15th spot to stay under the luxury tax leaving them with only 14 spots  including UD thats 6 unplayable pieces right there leaving only a (playable) 8 man rotation for the season. This team went through tons of injuries and if you include the possibility of covid protocols thats a very short rotation to go through a season. On top of that they need decent a backup PG and SF. So some heat fans are angry that instead of being able to sign one of these veterans that are still on the market that can be a rotational piece they are giving the spot to UD when he could just stay on the bench in some coach type role."
"This summer league has me in love with Max Strus and Omer Yurtseven.  But in six months I will probably want to trade them both for a stick of gum and an Arby's coupon, and I don't go to Arby's."
"Hawks signed Johnny Hamilton as 15th man..  Couldve retained Nathan Knight (who is genuinely awesome) snagged Omer Yurtseven, or pursued Paul Millsap/Isaiah Hartenstein  Dare I say it but this was Travis Schlenk's only misstep this offseason"

"Who the fook is Omer Yurtseven, and why was he signed ahead of Dennis Schroder?"
Omer Yurtseven is winning ROY
Omer Yurtseven is gonna be on offensive menace off the bench for the ~~Heat~~ Bulldogs.
"Heat is also deep especially if Dipo is healthy.   PG: Lowry, Oladipo, Vincent  SG: Duncan, Herro, Strus  SF: Butler, Okpala, (best SL player)  PF: Tucker, Morris, UD  C: Bam, Dedmon, Omer Yurtseven"

"yea for sure, we all gas up our young guys. right now omer yurtseven deserves the max"
I remember when he was really hyped up after [scoring 91 points in a U18 game](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2640303-omer-yurtseven-scores-91-points-in-turkish-u-18-basketball-game) years ago. But then haven't really heard anything about him until now
"We have Lowry, Robsinson, Herro, and Strus. They can all shoot the 3. Although at less volume, Markieff can still shoot and our young center Omer Yurtseven can shoot. If you know Erik Spolestra, then you know we're going to have multiple starting lineups this season. Jimmy and Bam still have good midrange shooting and can drive to the rim, so they'll still attract bodies and leave someone open."
"&gt; And now we get to the strawmans.  You literally listed Noah Vonleh as someone who was dominant in Summerleague... then went on to say Alperen was inefficient.  &gt; Obviously summer league is basketball, but not all basketball is indicative of how play will translate to the professional level...  And all 5 on 5 basketball has some correlation with how they play in the league.    &gt;With vonleh, to the point I was referencing, he was above Sengun in points and efficiency.  Nope, he was terrible. Whether you take his rookie year or even all  years averaged he was worse than Sengun AND he didn't have the blocks, steals, assists, rebounds that Sengun had. You need to make sure your facts are  straight otherwise you seem like a complete idiot when you try to correct other people when you yourself are completely wrong.  &gt;the other 15 or so names I mentioned that you conveniently ignored.  I mentioned a couple of them, for example, Omer Yurtseven was older. Like I said elsewhere, you did the shotgun approach of not having a single good example listeing a bunch of names which even you yourself know is completely bullshit. If you think Noah Vonleh was a dominant Summerleague player, you need to stop wasting peoples time online with this nonsense.  &gt;Again, summer league means nothing.  Yes it means absolutely nothing, has zero correlation with how people play. Centers play like guards and guards play like Centers. Someone who shoots 5 3's a game in Summerleague is just as likely to be a back to the basket center in the NBA. You can't say I strawman when it comes from your mouth again in the same reply once again.   If you think Noah Vonleh was a dominant Summerleague player, I don't have the time or craysons anymore to educate you."
"&gt; a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form  Ya it has zero correlation whatsoever. We see people like Hasheem Thiabeet shoot from the 3 point line at an amazing percentage and volume and we see people like Trae Young average 10 rebounds a game. It is 100% flip of the coin stats.  &gt;And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample.  He had the most rebounds, blocks, steals, assists, and least turnovers. Sure he missed a couple layups so he shot a couple less points then some and less fg then some, but cannot deny he didn't dominate without being heavily biased. All those guys like Alan Williams and Omer Yurtseven you mentioned that were also bigmen were much older than Alperen though.  You can't mention a single example of someone who filled the stat sheet like Alperen as a teenager and wasn't good because not a single example exists. He has an outlier summerleague performance. You did the shotgun approach of listing a bunch of names who don't qualify because you don't have 1 solid example. For example Ante Zizic couldn't score, couldn't steal, couldn't pass until 4 years later. Bam was very good overall in summerleague and he became a very good overall player in the league as well. What you have stated is actually the opposite of true and hopefully this clears up your confusion."
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Pj tucker is definitely starting for the heat. Spo is going for the toughest most defensive minded lineup for the starters he’s the guy that’ll play his role.   Omer yurtseven is the future and will be developed to eventually start with bam but the way spo usually develops these prospects is by starting off in the g league and slowly giving them back up nba minutes. I would love to see yurtseven play more but I really doubt his first year he’s going to get much action.    Markieffs defense is fine but his lateral quickness isn’t the best which gives a weakness for the starting lineup and offensively his skill set suits a bench role for offense rather than the starters where the ball will be in Jimmy’s, kyles, and bams hands the most"
"* My bold prediction is that Bogdan Bogdanovic will not hold onto the starting spot in Atlanta. Seems like a lot of younger guys are ready to break out for them. * Unsure of the Nets lineup--other than the Big 3 (and KD can play multiple positions), I think we'll see a variety of lineups. They sure have a lot of talent. * I know Charlotte played Rozier at the 2 and Ball at the 1 last year, but I think that will change depending on the matchup given LaMelo's size. * Porzingis at the 4 and Kleber at the 5 is not happening IMO. I see Porzingis at the 5 with Kleber or Finney-Smith at the 4, unless Moses Brown earns the starting center spot. Not sure why teams keep bouncing on that experiment, he had a great season last year. * I think Olynyk will start the season at the 4 for the Pistons, moving Grant to the 3. * I don't see any way Marc Gasol starts for the Lakers. Luckily LeBron can be slotted in almost anywhere, AD has some flexibility, and there are some other role players that can get a shot.  * Sorry, but P.J. Tucker should not be starting for the Heat. Even Markieff Morris would be better, ideal situation is Omer Yurtseven comes in off his hot Summer League and moves Bam out to the 4 for a twin towers effect IMO."
"When the fan base is hyping undrafted free agents (Yurtseven), you know the depth is shallow.  Sorry Omer."
"I've met a few before they were NBA players or after they had retired. Never met a current NBA player.  I met Kyrie when he came to my highschool while he was at Duke. Honestly don't know why he was there. He wasn't insane yet at this point. He was chill.  I met Dennis Smith JR, TJ Warren, Lorenzo brown (in and out the league), and Omer Yurtseven, Caleb and Cody Martin all at NC State when I was a student there. All were chill. Dennis Smith thought he was god on campus though lmao.   I met Sidney Lowe at a basketball camp NC State held when he was the coach when I was a kid. All I remember is he had monster size hands.   I think that's everyone."

"yep. home to jimmy v who was not just a basketball icon but one of the most influential and inspiring figures in all of american sports. not to mention NC state is almost always competitive and attracts decent talent. we’ve had the likes of TJ Warren, Omer Yurtseven, DSJ, and others who have made the NBA or at least made alot of noise in college. you’d expect a little more respect or fandom but it just comes with the territory of being neighbors with the 2 best college basketball programs of all time i guess"
Omer Yurtseven fans got real quiet after Mamukelashvili dropped 20 on the Nets
Dude. I'm not arguing that COVID doesn't care how famous you are.  But what I'm pointing out works both ways.  Let's say Kyrie was making pro-vax PSAs and encouraging folks to get the shot to protect themselves and their communities.  And let's say Omer Yurtseven was doing the same thing.  Both are doing good things.  Which one has more impact?
"So many takeaways. Not just what Lowry does for us, but it feels like all our young core players got better.  * Bam, Tyler, and Duncan all got bigger and faster * PJ feels like Ariza and Iggy combined into one person * Probably too early to judge but it seemed like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent (and maybe even KZ) took steps, though Gabe still needs to rein in those turnovers  And these two impressed:  * Caleb Martin. I didn't even know we had this dude, apparently we two-way'd him in mid-September. I don't know if his game tonight is representative of what he can usually do, but he showed out * Omer Yurtseven. He played his first NBA minutes tonight. In just 14 minutes he got a team-leading 8 rebounds. He's still green and made all the typical rookie mistakes like too many fouls and low shot clock awareness, but he absolutely did his job and filled his role"
"If it was preceded by Bam, Tyler, and Duncan continuously not putting in the effort needed to win, so much so that he took Caleb Martin, KZ Okpala, Omer Yurtseven, and Marcus Garrett in practice and bodied the shit out of the aforementioned starting players, and then those players didn't have an ""aw shit he's right we gotta be better"" moment but just doubled down and got defensive and called him a locker room cancer?  I would then say ""Damn Jimmy deserves better"".  Thankfully I don't have to worry about any of that in Miami as they all feel the same way as him and care more about winning than their fragile egos."
Then you havent seen Omer Yurtseven LOL.
"Tbh I think it's more that we could use a good big man in general as opposed to UD being the difference. We're pretty undersized and guys like AD, Embiid and most 7 footers give Bam a lot of problems. I've been pushing a Myles Turner for Duncan Robinson trade for a while lol.   We have Omer Yurtseven as a prospect who should be getting more mins in that situation (and he did well in the mins he did play) although he's still pretty raw. But once we ease him in I can definitely see him getting more minutes at the expense of UD. It was largely just foul trouble that meant we had to spread the big man load a bit"
