No. D'Angelo Russell had the worst net rating in the league. But his shooting % is much better than Jerome.

D'Angelo Russell. There are other candidates (Rubio lately) but D'Lo definitely draws the hottest takes from his supporters and detractors alike.
"+/- is not a good stat for measuring individual performance.  That said, here are the minus leaders:  1. D'Angelo Russell    /  -165 2. Cory Joseph         /  -117 3. Glenn Robinson III  /  -113 4. Darius Bazley       /  -111 5. Ricky Rubio         /  -102"
Holy shit D'Angelo Russell is rocking -165
"I don't understand the D'Angelo for Wiggins trade. Minnesota swaps guys with similar contracts and similar stats (points, win shares, etc) and has to cough up an almost unprotected 1st rounder too?   Like, the team has been a lottery team for a while, did they really think Wiggins for Russell was really going to be the trade that got them out of that rut???"
"Barnes, Harrison. Westbrook, Russel. Russell, D'Angelo."
It's way more like the Lakers deciding to trade D'Angelo Russell
Rondo better than D'Angelo Russell? Also not sure how I feel about Tatum over Beal. That's a tough one.
"Picked 2nd overall by the Lakers as a PG. Traded on his rookie contract.   D'Angelo Russell  was traded in part so that Zo would have his chance.   Not many teams would commit as hard. Even if not as long  Zo had flaws starting out, and injury and fit robbed him of some chances to try to fix them sooner.   He wasn't good enough to demand that others fit to him.   D'lo went to the Nets and did well. He got traded again, was a bad fit at GSW , but got moved as a good chip  Zo isn't following that path, quite.  This ""give up on him"" is an odd phrasing. Zo is going to be in the league for years. But his chances for flipping a switch and becoming the next big thing or a key player is going down. His next contract  might not be as good. And he might not get catered to on role"

"STEELING INGRAM FOR NBA physicality was perhaps the Lakers' most important challenge when they drafted him No. 2 in 2016. Ingram would always be skinny. They believed he could be skinny and strong.  When Ingram was a kid, his father placed a No. 2 pencil and a wire-thin length of steel next to each other, and he asked Ingram which object would snap more easily. The wider pencil broke first.  ""You don't have to be fat to be strong,"" Ingram told his son.  Gunnar Peterson, the Lakers' director of strength and endurance training from 2017 through last season, put Ingram on a regimen of lifting and muscle exercises. ""He was all-in,"" Peterson said.  The summer after Ingram's rookie year, Stackhouse connected him with Raphael Edwards, a New York-based trainer. Edwards went to work strengthening Ingram's core. Ingram did bicycle exercises with weights strapped to his feet. Lifting drills targeted Ingram's arms, legs, back, and abs. Edwards used medium weights, not heavy ones. The goal was for Ingram to perform exercises rapid-fire -- to become more explosive. ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen  The Lakers had already begun reconstructing Ingram's jump shot, which took too long and had too many moving parts; Ingram brought the ball behind his head, generating power from his arms instead of his legs and core.  ""It was like he was shooting a dart,"" said Brian Keefe, a Lakers assistant from 2016 to 2019.  Edwards had Ingram step into his pull-up so that his left foot hit the ground first. (Ingram was going right-left.) He demanded every jumper reach peak height above the square on the backboard.  For dribbling drills, Edwards sucked air out of the ball, forcing Ingram to bounce it harder and work his fingers more to control it, he said.  Ingram returned to the Lakers and struggled in his second preseason. Team officials called Edwards, asking what he and Ingram had done all summer. Stackhouse joked he would station someone outside Edwards' house until Edwards returned half the money Ingram had paid him. ""Relax,"" Edwards told them. ""The kid is fine.""  Keefe kept on Ingram about his jumper, and tried to help him adapt to playing off the ball alongside D'Angelo Russell. ""He had to picture himself being a catch-and-shoot guy,"" Keefe said. ""You could see him thinking: Am I open? Should I shoot? But I'm such a good driver.""  In New Orleans last season, Boylan organized 3-on-3 games with special constraints -- including one in which Ingram was not allowed to dribble. Ingram is cagey moving without the ball now, key next to Williamson. But early in L.A., he confided in Edwards: ""Nothing is going right. I can't hit a 3.""  Ingram spent hours in one-on-one drills where he would drive at Keefe, take contact, and finish. Keefe wanted Ingram to realize how long he was -- to power through him, and keep the ball high where no one could reach it. During one session, Magic Johnson, then the Lakers president of basketball operations, observed before interrupting, Keefe and Ingram recalled: ""You're already at the rim."" Johnson meant Ingram was so long and athletic, he didn't need to resort to floaters or contorted layups.  ""It was get fouled or dunk,"" Ingram said. ""For someone like Magic to tell me that, it really gave me confidence."""

"Lol, basketball isn't anime.  Taj gibson grunting at Anthony edwards won't make him become a respectable shooter.  It won't make D'Angelo Russell not the slowest guard in the league, it won't make Jarrett Culver show any sort of offensive skillset"
D'Angelo Russell an ardent student of The Book of Five Rings I see
"I think it helped a lot that last year they played as the starters basically (the ones that were on the team then at least, with D'Angelo Russell). But even though they obviously sucked as a team last year with everyone out, it gave them real time to improve and shine (especially Paschall)."
"The trade was dumb don't get me wrong, your pick this year was always gonna be super valuable given how strong the West is and your roster + D'Angelo being, in my opinion, insanely overrated. I just don't think either Russell or Wiggins particularly contribute to winning, so giving up a lottery pick is weird."
Are D'Angelo Russell and Vic Mensa the same person?
"""D'angelo Russell still playing to the final buzzer""  Are you sure about that?"
"damn  its hard to believe Blake is now a veteran  but then I remember that he ain't even stretch doe vid of D'Angelo Russell in college watching Blake dunk, and D himself has been in the league EIGHT YEARS now"
"Here's the thing though, he absolutely *does* care about the memes and reaction on social media. In fact, his long time friend and former high school teammate D'Angelo Russell is on record saying that he thinks this is the main reason Ben doesn't shoot the ball more.   [https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2020/09/04/dangelo-russell-explains-why-ben-simmons-wont-shoot-jump-shots/](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2020/09/04/dangelo-russell-explains-why-ben-simmons-wont-shoot-jump-shots/)  How can you make 100s of millions of dollars and be worried about what some average joes on Instagram/Bleacher Report/Reddit think? This is why people throw around terms like mental midget, mentally weak, etc"
"All 3 are efficient scorers, Booker and Beal are also really good passers for non point guards. All 3 are really good offensive players (great for Booker and Beal actually), and yeah Lavine and Beal are pretty bad defensively (Booker isn't bad anymore) but they are not the ones that kill their teams defense.  And all 3 ""carry"" their teams offense to pretty decent level.  &amp;#x200B;  Empty stat guys are guys who get stat that amount to nothing, for example D'Angelo Russell the ""awesome"" all star that carried that Nets team to the 19th offense that year and has never ever played in a decent offense (and despite that most year those offenses are actually better when he's off the floor). Or like Hassan Whiteside and his perenial 13 rebounds/3 blocks per game stat lines while his team can't actually stop anything at the rim"

"I mean you could do this for every team right. Here I'll do it for the T-Wolves:  Malik Beasley has been good for them averaging over 20 points a game, Anthony Edwards looks like he's going to be a star, Ricky Rubio is good enough to contribute for a contender, and their own pick could fall top-3 this year and they could get Cade Cunningham. D'Angelo Russell has had a rough start but once he gets going he's gonna be scary. KAT's mom passed away through COVID and he's going through a lot rn as well, and he's missed a few games through a hand injury, but there's a great chance he could get to all-NBA level play soon enough and Wolves could go on a winning streak.  But nobody gives Wolves or any other team extra context for no reason. So I'm not sure why you feel Warriors need so much extra context."
At least they didn't trade assets to get either. Giving up D'Angelo Russell to pair KD and Kyrie and gamble that it works out? 100 out of 100 times in the summer of 2019.

Is Saunders supposed to call 30 spread pick and roll plays a game? D'angelo russell doesn't have a ton of versatility in his game because of his lack of athleticism.
"Getting to the line is a legitimate skill and can be the difference between a good and a great player. It requires body control, good handles, and the ability to read the defense. It's basically why D'Angelo Russell is an average player while De'Aaron Fox is very good, despite having similar skillsets (defense and athleticism notwithstanding)"

Over/under +/- for D'Angelo Russell tonight set at -20
Don't  forget D'Angelo Russell.
"The lost of Durant and Klay really screwed them over. With Durant gone, they sorta panicked and sign D'Angelo Russell just to get some talent to help a prime Curry so his 19-20 season isn't wasted. It ended up being wasted anyway and Russell got shipped out for Wiggins, which isn't an upgrade. Then Klay got injured again and they panicked once more and got Oubre. At best, he's a solid role player more on defensive end, he ain't gonna help a prime Curry win. It will be another wasted year for prime Curry. I would tank if I were them unless they somehow get Harden. Maybe they send Klay and Dray to Houston for Harden and Gordon."
"He's actually born in the US and has an american dad so he's neither new to the country nor the language. Second the guy has been an absolute horrible shooter his whole career (check his stats in europe, I've also seen him play alot), so of course he's not making these shots. Whoever expected him to be the second coming of D'Angelo Russell (like The Ringer's mock drafts did) is gonna be in for a very rude awakening. Guy's cost his team last year tons of games with turnovers, too. Unfortunately verry overrated prospect."

But D'Angelo Russell is worth Kuminga  😂 😂
You can't be that bad of a team with KAT and D'Angelo Russell on the team.
When your best player has been D'Angelo Russell for 90% of the season I wouldn't expect you to play any better than a pickup game
Because their teams are not really that good lol. D'Angelo Russell is barely even an All-Star. They have no bench. Rubio became a bum after signing with them. Their defence sucks.
"Ingram had 3 seasons. When it was just D'Angelo Russell/Julius Randle, I might have been inclined to agree with you. But considering all of the hits, you think one of them would have developed earlier in their rookie contract."
Makes me remember D'Angelo Russell having a - 48 plus minus for the Warriors last year against Brooklyn I think.
"Probably not, but maybe. Also Kyrie has health, mental health, and personality issues that might pull him down  I'm not afraid to say players are better than Nets players. When D'angelo Russell made the team a couple of years ago I was pretty shocked and thought it was awful. As in one of the worst all star selections of the last 20 years"
&gt; Not a good year for the Ricky Rubio stans  Rubio has been turning it around with D'Angelo Russell out. He's been a starter all his life and I don't think coming off the bench was good for him. I also think that playing off the ball with D'Angelo Russell running point is a horrible terrible awful atrocious misuse of Rubio. What the hell is the point of a Ricky Rubio when you put him in the corner while Russell dribbles the air out of the ball?

D'Angelo Russell = info broker/peddler
"Chris Bosh - programmer  Blake Griffin - stand up comedian  Giannis, Kelly Oubre Jr - male model  D'Angelo Russell - photojournalist  Damian Lillard - rapper"
The Lakers once had all these players together: Julius Randle/Jordan Clarkson/Brandon Ingram/D'Angelo Russell. Possibly three all-stars and one 6th man of the year.
"Oubre wasn't on the team last season, Wiggins barely was, JTA barely was, Looney was a shell of himself, Wanamaker and Bazemore weren't on the team, Draymond wasn't trying. Even Wiseman wasn't on the team last season, though I don't think he's been very good defensively yet.  This is a roster full of defensive talent. Last year they were playing guys like D'Angelo Russell and Jordan Poole huge minutes, there was no defense to speak of.  Curry is definitely carrying the offense, but there's more to basketball than offense, therefore, not a one man team."
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"
Some dude that painted this [glorious masterpiece](https://imgur.com/a/VU27rnl) ^(NSFW-ish) with Timberwolves guard D'Angelo Russell
"Right now, to finish this season, would you take Clarkson or all-star 	D'Angelo Russell on your team?"
Brad Stevens and Kemba Walker for D'Angelo Russell who says no
"I have never thought, nor have I ever heard anyone else suggest that D'Angelo Russell is a top-5 passer in the NBA. It's an absurd ranking.   And frankly, I could give a fuck less what Ben Taylor of all people thinks."
"Its not though. The Suns and Timberwolves are two examples of the worst run teams in the league. Outside of the tanking, this has been known for years. The Twolves rushed their rebuild and traded for Butler, only to then have to trade him to Philly (who also rushed their rebuild and lost assets on Butler + then again with Tobias and Horford). The Timberwolves signed older players who've all since either left or have been traded, leaving them with a bunch of below average replacements and some draft picks that haven't really panned out. They then, once again, tried to rush things by trading for D'Angelo Russell and they're awful again. The Suns, meanwhile, drafted Booker and then made some bad picks in the next few drafts (e.g. Dragan Bender; picking Ayton over Doncic). They created an unhappy culture and mistreat veterans, who they then were either forced into trading (Bledsoe) or who they bought out (Chandler, who could have been used as an expiring deal to bring back assets)."
"You literally got a trio of which 2 guys who are top-15 players in the league, and another who is near that.  And you got 2 of those guys in free agency, gave up nothing except D'Angelo Russell in a sign-and-trade who isn't looking so hot right now in Minnesota anyway.  Tf are you whining about honestly? Would you rather the front office NOT try and win a championship?"
"D'Angelo Russell can make some beautiful passes, but he can't really run an offense."
"D'Angelo russell has been ruled out for the rest of the game. Started out 2-2 from 3. Officially left leg soreness, a different injury then the right quad issues hes had. I want to die :)"
D'Angelo Russell is capable of some truly gorgeous passes.  [Like this](https://streamable.com/gjaei).  So don't give up on him.
"I'm not shitting on the achievements of Andrew Wiggins and D'Angelo Russell as a human beings, relax. People who @ them on Twitter just to shit on their achievements are losers, but on a board dedicated to NBA discussion then people are going to talk candidly if they think a player has underachieved or been overrated, and I'll comment positively about other players I think deserve it."
"I'm glad to see these reponsible players doing what they should as public figures, unlike D'Angelo Russell"
Tonight though no Beasley.  Just Towns and a re-habbing D'Angelo Russell.  Other than that there's few players you'd want taking more than a handful of shots
"I agree, surely some guys are more athletic than others, I'll be crazy to define D'Angelo Russell, Justin Holiday or Bogdanovic as athletic for example, it's just that the word *athleticism* in general encompasses more than just speed and explosiveness. Just as very few players (if any) could match Jordan's first step or Rose's speed, I don't know how many can run around like Curry does all the time (while having his usage rate). I think we can all agree that long distance runners are athletic and you always hear people criticize Harden, Westbrook, LeBron or whoever, for standing around a lot to preserve energy, then why shouldn't we consider *athletic* players that maybe need less rest?  I think other aspects, like strength, could also be more discussed when talking athleticism, without even disturbing things like hand-eye coordination, deceleration or processing speed."
D'Angelo Russell  Kyle Korver   James Donaldson   Antonio Davis  Jamaal Magloire
"D'Angelo Russell is a heck of a shot and I'm glad he had a great night with the scoring, 25 points is nothing to sneeze at that's for sure."

I didn't know that they were trying to trade him or not re-sign him. All I know is that the Nets knew they were in the Irving and Durant sweepstakes so they didn't have plans for Russell. Just say you hate D'angelo and things will be much simpler
"&gt; D'Angelo Russell  &gt;ruin their tank  I don't think so, they're just so far down, they have already maximized their chances at the top picks. I'm sure the Wolves fans are just happy enough to see them all healthy and playing together finally."
Poku was still a mid first round pick though.  It's not like Wiseman is being compared to...  Marko Simonović.  Yes i took that name from the 2020 draft list and have no idea who he is.  It's like how D'angelo Russell was the 2nd pick but Booker was the 13th in the same class.
"The fact that D'Angelo Russell is the 2nd guy is exactly the problem the Twolves have though. No one wins anything with just an All Star + a fringe AS. Even if he was playing, the Wolves wouldn't have been one of the 8 best teams in the West"
"&gt;all those high draft picks  Ingram was the only asset in that trade that dated from the Bryant era.  And devoting those years to Bryant arguably caused them to waste the 2015 #2 D'Angelo Russell, so that's basically a wash.  It also cost them a very good coach in Byron Scott, and one of the best GMs ever in Mitch Kupchak.  The price that franchise paid for Bryant's 3-lap victory tour was extremely steep, and probably unprecedented."
"It would've been interesting to see how good Minnesota would be if they had their Big 3 available (KAT, Edwards, D'Angelo Russell).  They were doing pretty well, then KAT got injured for a month and then right before his return Russell went down.  They would likely be in playoff contention if they were all healthy together."
"I mean rookies are very rarely considered even average players in comparison to the whole NBA. Especially not Anthony Edwards. I don't see the surprise that Wolves are bad when they made him the first option for a big part of the season.   Edwards has the lowest true shooting percentage in the league among guys with such high usage; lower even the infamous chuckers like Russell Westbrook or Andre Drummond. The fun fact is that he doesn't even stand out that much in a team with Rubio, Okogi, McDaniels, Nowell or McLaughlin.  They're a bad team, although they are closer to average when they have Karl-Anthony Towns fit. Either way they will be among worst defences, but with KAT they are closer to average offensively.   Yeah they're tanking, I guess it was not the plan when they'd got Rubio or D'Angelo, but these guys didn't change nothing and it turned out like always."
"They traded KD in a sign and trade for D'Angelo Russell and then flipped him for Wiggins and a valuable pick  They haven't really had money to make any major moves outside of that seeing as how Curry, Draymond, Klay and KD/D-Lo/Wiggins all make big money"
"I respect Dame for his approach to his career  I also respect others for their approach to their careers, excluding Latrell Spreewell, as i have no issue with a person doing what is in their own best interest personally or from a career standpoint  For every Dame, there is a Lue Wiliams, Lamar Odom, Blake Griffin, Norman Powell, Isaiah Thomas, Andrew Wiggins, D'Angelo Russell, even Andre Drummond was bench to avoid hurting his value, and so on.   Loyalty is great but for most guys it's definitely a one-way street. Once Dame's game slows down the real question will be if he ends up the trading block for his replacement.   If a player wants to put themselves in the best position to achieve a dream they've been chasing since they were kids, I'm all for it."

"Don't think they can do a 'match-and-trade' thing during that same offseason though, I forget the details but based on the rules that's not possible I believe (I'm tryin to think but it's comparable to what D'Angelo Russell did with the Nets, the Nets couldn't just match anything and then turn around and trade him for KD, he had to be a willing participant in it). They can match and then trade him at the next trade deadline tho I think."
"Can the Timberwolves get rid of D'Angelo Russell without pissing KAT off?  If they can, I think they could be a playoff team real quick."
"You're overthinking it brother.  The signing would have nothing to do with a championship run next season or getting asses in seats, it is simple asset management.  Let me use KD as an example.  When he left OKC for GSW, he left in free agency, meaning the Thunder let possibly the greatest NBA talent of his generation walk, and got nothing in return.  KD took a lot of shit for this, and learned from his mistake.  When he left for Brooklyn, he did so in a sign and trade, which forced Brooklyn to give up a solid asset in D'Angelo Russell to the Warriors in return for KD.  Afaik, KD had nothing to gain as an individual from this, but he realised he had made some enemies in the league by abandoning OKC, and didn't want a repeat offense.  This same line of reasoning is why it is unlikely Kyle walk for nothing, as the Raptors have provided him with a mutually beneficial for so long now.  That being said, Kyle absolutely could walk as there is nothing stopping him.  In fact, he has amassed so much good will from the people here, I doubt it would change anything if he did... but that doesn't seem like the person he is.  Beyond that, how the salary cap works, the Raptors are the only team that will be able to go over the cap by signing him, so a team like Miami or Philly that is already cap strapped actually couldn't just sign him outright, but could go over the cap by acquiring him in a sign and trade."
"That does not apply to your sixers back then. They were purposefully losing games. There is no ""first step"" to acceptance. There are no moral victories that you take there. You didn't fight. You accepted defeat before even deciding to play. The fact that you're okay with that tells me more about who you are as a person.   There is losing. And then there's not fighting. The lakers at that same time were complete shit. But they still competed. In fact, the year leading up to our #2 pick (D'angelo Russell), we went on a winning streak to end the season that lowered our odds. Why? Because ""accepting"" losing isn't some ""first step"" we take like some drug rehab brochure. That's the difference in culture and integrity. As long as you condone purposefully losing, you don't get to have say when it comes to those things."
"&gt; It's been that way since the New Jersey Nets of the 2000s. They've always been known to have the best medical staff in the league. It sort of makes up for the horrible scouting, coaching and other staff they had in those times. Dr. Riley Williams, one of the top orthopedic surgeon in the world, had been their medical director since the Kidd era, and it's quality all the way down to the trainers.   &gt; As for examples, besides the obvious Durant recovery from a potential career ending injury, Dr. Riley did the ACL surgery with Dinwiddie now, fixed Claxton's shoulders (labrum injury), ankle injury on Richard Jefferson,  wrist injury with Richard Jefferson, Brook Lopez foot injury, and knee injury for D'Angelo Russell. I think most of those, if not all those players returned from injury in top form, besides Dinwiddie who's not back yet. Dr. Riley is also the head medical director for Team USA basketball when they play because he's just the best around. A lot of what he does too is injury prevention, so he has prevented aggravating injuries like what happened to KD in GS, and had his trainers make players do a stretch routine that loosens them up so they don't get injured as frequently.  &gt; Anyway, that's not to say other teams like the Mavs and Suns don't have great medical staff, it's just that the Nets have the best orthopedic surgeon around running their medical department, and fans may not know that, but the players definitely do."

I think most of those, if not all those players returned from injury in top form, besides Dinwiddie who's not back yet. Dr. Riley is also the head medical director for Team USA basketball when they play because he's just the best around. A lot of what he does too is injury prevention, so he has prevented aggravating injuries like what happened to KD in GS, and had his trainers make players do a stretch routine that loosens them up so they don't get injured as frequently.  &gt; Anyway, that's not to say other teams like the Mavs and Suns don't have great medical staff, it's just that the Nets have the best orthopedic surgeon around running their medical department, and fans may not know that, but the players definitely do."
"Man I just don't get why the Wolves are so bad. I know D'lo isn't exactly efficient but I really thought (defensive issues aside) him and KAT would flourish plus they have solid rotation guys. Haven't watched them much but I do occasionally to check up on D'Angelo Russell and they seem so disjointed as a team. Sucks to see, I know being in the west just makes it that much worse."
[Karl-Anthony Towns has now shared the floor more with Ricky Rubio since the All-Star break (96 minutes) than he has with D'Angelo Russell all season (90 minutes).](https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1372029495813795841)  That's just nuts
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
Pretty good defender. Better on ball and as a perimeter guy than as a secondary rim protector or weak side help defender but his off ball defense has gotten better. I thought he was better defensively in 2019 than in 2020. Very versatile guards anybody from AD to D'Angelo Russell. He isnt quite the absolutely perfect 4 defensively to pair with Jokic as a weak side help defender hence but it still would work pretty well.
scouting reports say Harden/D'angelo Russell
Paul Millsap was a 4x all star lol. Because he was in the East. D'angelo Russell made an all star team
&gt;The real question is why the Wolves traded for a 30 year old point guard who is making close to 20m a year and came off his best statistical season of his career to have him on the bench.   The Wolves had ~17m of extra salary by the name of James Johnson and only 1 PG on the roster coming off a long term injury in D'Angelo Russell. They thought it was better to pay Rubio to be a 6th man than it was to pay James Johnson to give you below average NBA quality play
D'Angelo Russell-Stover
"Blank canvas?  The Nets were a playoff team prior to Kyrie/KD signing, KD was sign-and-traded for D'Angelo Russell  The Nets had a young core™ in LeVert/Dinwiddie/Allen  Tatum/Brown were still on their rookie deals when KD/Kyrie signed with Brooklyn"
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
"TBF, Harris shot 47% from 3 in 2018-19 when he was surrounded by D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Caris LeVert."
"Basically all of the vets from the 2018-2019 season: Ed Davis, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll.   Obviously there's D'Angelo Russell but he's not random.   Other guys (some not really random but no stars) who weren't on the team for long but made a memorable impact when they were: Shaun Livingston, Alan Anderson, Gerald Green, Thaddeus Young, Trevor Booker"
D'Angelo Russell and KAT
"I always thought if Randle could just get a reliable jump shot, especially a 3-pt shot, then he'd be a max level player. I was not at all happy when the Lakers simply let him go, but I know it was part of whatever their feud was with his agent, Aaron Mintz (who also was the agent for D'Angelo Russell and Paul George)."
D'Angelo Russell to Naz Reid
"D'Angelo Russell makes so many shots like this. Half the time he takes them we all yell about how it's a horrible off balance shot, but then he just drains it"
"The Wolves have won six of their last nine games. KAT has been balling out in that span and has 20+ points in 26 of his last 28 games. Barring a nosedive in the final 3 games, Ant is on pace to average 20+ points a game for the third straight month. D'Angelo Russell is averaging 18.3 points and 9.2 assists a game in that span.   This team is relatively healthy, have been playing well and haven't been blown out since playing at the Clippers a month ago on the road. And to top that off, they seem to be having a good time off the court. After all the things they've had to deal with this year, they're finally finding success. While their last couple wins have been against bad teams, they've been a tough out for good ones along the way, and have beaten some very good teams this year too.   Their final three games are home games against Denver, Boston and Dallas, all of whom have something to play for in this final week. While it might seem like a foregone conclusion to pick those three teams to all beat the Wolves, you never know."

It's because OP just said Russell in the title instead of Saying D'angelo. I thought he was going by first name as well.
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook
"You can absolutely rather want D'Angelo Russell, but all of your complaints about Wiggins here generally apply to D'Lo too, plus injuries. On top of that, Russell makes just $2M less per year for the duration of their contracts. An inconsequential amount with no real cap implications. Now, if you want to bring up overall roster fit, then D'Angelo compliments KAT and now Edwards much more as the point guard...whereas Wiggins would just be another swingman scorer taking up a big chunk of the cap. That would make sense, and why both teams were happy with the trade (even if you exclude the pick, which is now essentially gravy).   Wiggins as the third option is perfect for us. They're asking him to fill the role of 2014-2016 Harrison Barnes on offense, while locking in on defense. That's it, and it's such a relatively low bar. On defense, thank God we have him because there's no way we can rely on Klay to be our first option perimeter defender coming back from two major injuries. We'll see."
"😂😁 It doesn't look like D'Angelo Russell got hurt bad at all, but I bet you he's embarrassed more than anything else. It will be bloopers reels on NBA Inside Stuff and Shaq's comedy skit on Inside the NBA on TNT for years to come."
Anthony Edwards stats since D'Angelo Russell returned 18 games ago:  Points: 22.7 Rebounds: 6.1 Assists: 3.7 Steals: 1.4 3P: 35.6% 2P: 56.0% TS: 58.0% (above league-average) USG: 26.3%  So that's 23-6-4 on above-average efficiency and high usage.

Spencer Dinwiddie  Joe Harris  Demarre Carroll  Allen Crabbe  D'Angelo Russell
"Wiggins was barely with the team last year. Draymond missed a ton of time and didn't seem especially motivated when he did play. Looney was out for most of last year as well.  They basically replaced Ky Bowman and D'Angelo Russell with Curry and Wiggins, and got a healthy and motivated Draymond back.  They added Oubre for nothing, and while he started off horrendously, he's found his fit as the season has progressed, and if nothing else, gives them an athletic wing with decent D who gets 15PPG off the bench.   Poole developed (despite his inconsistency) into a solid bench scorer and backup PG.  JTA went from a fringe G-leaguer to another solid rotation piece.       Their rebounding still sucks.  It feels like they've lost half a dozen games this year just giving up offensive boards. And they still don't have any reliable playmakers outside of Draymond and Curry.  Having Looney on the floor with Draymond makes for a very smart team on both ends of the floor, but having two starters who score a combined ten points per game and shoot 25% from deep is a big part of their spacing problem."

"LeBron has played 10,811 playoff minutes, which is more than the regular season minutes any player from the 2016 draft class except Buddy Hield (10,906). He has more playoff minutes than Cody Zeller's regular season minutes, and he was drafted in 2013.

D'Angelo Russell looks like prettyboyfredo from YouTube if y'all know who that is
"That's just objective not true, he's not very explosive at all. He plays a lot like a small forward version of D'Angelo Russell, he makes up for his lack of acceleration by mixing pace and decelerating, sometimes he can dribble into the paint at jogging pace and find a way to score just by finding tiny openings."

You must really suck to lose to a team led by D'Angelo Russell
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I’ll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  So I said... eh, was it drafting assets? Or were they just bad for a long time and had some shit they were able to package with a shit load of future picks? You come back at me explaining how they really were drafting well this whole time, but what.. they suck at asset management? I'm confused.  &gt;Julius Randle was the Lakers best player in his last season there, averaging 16/8. They let him walk in free agency as he was in a redundant position with LeBron  Huh, so they drafted a great player, he turned into the best player on their team, and they let him for nothing? That sounds like bad asset management. Maybe you're on to something.  &gt;D'Angelo Russell was a good player for the Lakers (15/4/5 at age 20). He allowed them to get out from under Mozgov's contract which was killing them. For better or for worse his weird Snapchat snitching thing with Nick Young made the rest of the locker room turn on him  So DLo was another good player for the Lakers. They did a great job drafting him 2nd overall in your opinion, and he was playing great for them. They new he was a great player, but he offended Swaggy fucking P. So they traded him after two years in a salary dump move. Clearly another example of excellent asset management.   &gt;Nance and Clarkson were definitely salary dumps but they also created the cap space that allowed for LeBron to get signed. Both were decent with loads of potential. They also got a FRP  So another two young players, loads of poential. Traded in salary dump to clear future cap space. They got the 29th draft pick out of it. Another excellent example of drafting and asset management.  &gt;Zubac I have no idea why they traded him, that was a terrible move he was really good for them  Fair  &gt;Ingram was definitely not disappointing. He had a potential career-ending injury his last season with the Lakers but was their second best player his last year there. He got better every year and his potential was obvious  &gt;Lonzo like Ingram couldn't stay healthy. Can't say he was worth the #2 pick but I think most teams would have taken him there  Here's the thing. I personally cannot square the notion that BI and Lonzo were good 2nd overall picks if they had to be packaged with a #4 overall, 2 more FRPs, a FRP swap, and Josh Hart. Look at the value of other top picks *when they actually hit.* Look at how much value young tatum had. Or how much value Ben Simmons had. Or so many other young stars. When guys actually hit, you don't need to have such a massive haul in a trade for a disgruntled star. Cavs were able to trade Wiggins and fucking Anthony Bennett for Kevin Love. And that still doesn't erase all their other fuck ups."
Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Jordan Clarkson -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -traded for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Excellent drafting.

I'm not a fan of the Timberwolves but I'm a huge fan of D'Angelo Russell. Hopefully next season he can contribute and help them make the playoffs.
"D'angelo Russell is literally nothing like Jamal Crawford and Lou Will tho? He's a much better 3 point shooter and playmaker. He's elite in the pick and roll and is a perfect partner offensively with KAT. Obviously defensively they are gonna have issues, but their best starting lineup includes DLo lol. You didn't rebut shit with that Ginobili example. Again, him and DLo don't play the same. Also Tony Parker in his prime is better than Ginobili. You're not Popovich, you're just an idiot."
Kind of like Nick Young and the D'angelo Russell video except Nick Young also had no basketball accomplishments.
"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."

This is what I thought D'angelo russell would be like every game.
"D'Angelo Russell is a bitch, pass it on"
"I think the rim avoidance thing Im referring to is more about this   2019: 25.2% of his shots at the rim  This year: 11.2%  It's a big drop off. Only a few guards I see who are lead ball handlers/initiators around that level. CJ McCollum, Chris Paul, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell. CP3 is a historic level outlier. CJ is dynamic off the ball as a weapon. Conley I think is a better floor general and passer out of the P/R we dont really think of him as a scoring guard per se. There just alot of plays with Kemba you see him drive and not taking the shot at the rim at the big. It just changes how dangerous a weapon he is and how difficult he is to defend, can focus alot more on just chasing him off the 3 point line. He's still a good weapon and important to that team. I just think the fit issues wouldnt as big a thing if this was the Kemba of 2-3 yrs ago, he would stress the defense in a way it would create alot for others even if its not through his assists per se."
They literally just did a podcast called 'Reassessing the 2020 Trade Deadline' in which Hollinger admitted he was wrong about the D'Angelo Russell - Andrew Wiggins trade.  https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/262189/Hollinger-Duncan-Reassessing-the-2020-Trade-Deadline
"Everything is partly luck. The goal is minimize your luck. If you run a team consistently and effectively, you'll often walk out of those it could either way situations on the right end. Losing so you hope you can luck into a high draft and hopefully you get lucky the pick turns out to be good is an awful way to run a team.   Also ask yourself this, why did Curry potentially not want to go to Minnesota? Why did D'Angelo Russell and Kristaps Porzingis not want to go to Philly? Players aren't interested in a process (Embiid is a human meme, he wouldn't really be happy playing on a team winning 15 games), nor should teams want players they want to be in a process.   There's a difference between not making moves that impact your future (meaning trading picks or assets to make a run for the 8th seed) vs. not trying to squeeze out every win with your current squad. The teams that do the latter are not going to be good teams."
"Last decade:  **2020:** James Wiseman (TBC)  **2019:** Ja Morant (potential All Star)  **2018:** Marvin Bagley (bust)  **2017:** Lonzo Ball (solid player but not #2 worthy)  **2016:** Brandon Ingram (All Star)  **2015:** D'Angelo Russell (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2014:** Jabari Parker (bust)  **2013:** Victor Oladipo (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2012:** Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bust)  **2011:** Derrick Williams (bust)"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."

"obvious/dumb answer but it depends on who you replace him with  without mitchell and replacing him with a fringe all-star (let's say like d'angelo russell or something) utah is a mid/low playoff team. mitchell is important to the team, but he isn't the team. conley/rudy/ingles with a decent crew around them is definitely a fringe playoff team at worst"
"I kinda agree. I think teams still didn't put full emphasis on small-ball but teams were definitely gearing towards that imo. Example: if I recall correctly, the reason why the Lakers passed on Okafor (when it was widely accepted by many that Okafor was going to be a Laker), was because they thought D'Angelo Russell had that Curry factor."
In OKC he once had a 47 pt 15 rebound game with no turnovers and he shot 46% from 3. But that was against a Nets team with D'Angelo Russell in the regular season.   So i'd say this was his best game.
"D'Angelo Russell, not Bill Russell /s"
Remember D'Angelo Russell blowing up his teammates relationship through the media? That's pretty drama shit. Getting into a scuffle on the court isn't attention seeking.
D'Angelo Russell   Jordan Clarkson   Kobe bryant   Luol deng   Roy Hibbert   Larry Nance JR   Tarik Black   Timofey Mozgov   Nick Young   Thomas Bryant   Julius Randle   I know I'm missing like 2-3 guys for sure
No. Several guys were break even or positive and D'Angelo Russell was +2.6.
Ngl I actually thought the D'Angelo Russell Nets team was cool as shit. A real flip flop to today.
&gt;All NBA players make it to the league on athleticism and height. These are the top .01% of athletes in the world.   You have players like D'Angelo Russell or Steph Curry for instance who aren't great atheltes in the traditional sense but still are succesful in the NBA. Height and jumping high aren't a recipy to succeed in the NBA.  &gt;You truly have bizarre theories. Classic ignorant shit. Like great  What's bizzare? That players who failed to develop any fundemental skills on the NBA level(the majority of NBA players are these kind of players)  aren't good HC material?  &gt; Athletes can’t be coaches. All dog whistles like black athletes can’t be QBs.   Players who were exclusively athletes and showed nothing else aren't usually good coaching material. Yes.
"Exactly, I'm a life long Nets fan since 2004. I've been dying for a meaningful playoff run, but this ain't it. Technically my team are title favorites/contenders, but they're not my team; it's just a core of mercenary superstars that just happened to pick my team. This team is not the Nets, it's just the hollow shell that Kyrie, KD, and Harden chose to play under. Whenever I express this I get downvoted and told that I'll forget about all that once they win, but that's just not true. When operating under these circumstances there is no team culture or team identity, there is literally nothing but the name that identifies the team as the Brooklyn Nets. Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Nenad Krstic, Brook Lopez, Caris Levert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen, and others in the same vein meant something to the identity of the Nets. They may not have all joined the team in the same way, but they put roots down in the organization and tried to build something meaningful. A key component of the joy of winning a championship as a fan is building up to the point where your team can win it all. If the Nets win it all, I won't look at them and say the Nets finally won a title, I'll just say Kyrie, KD, and Harden won a title and that won't mean shit to me."
Yeah but the D'Angelo Russell game winner should've totally disqualified him from winning!
"Okay good, I get annoyed when people are all ""Joe Harris numbers are inflated playing with stars"" when he shot the same percentage with D'Angelo Russell as his best player"
Watch D'Angelo Russell. Highest percentage in the league at 15'.
Lol People were saying he ball hogged to 60.  Even though it was the last game in a meaningless season.  Also shot a decent percentage.  Nobody was going to tune into that game to see D'Angelo Russell.
D'Angelo Russell was like texting his teammates girlfriends and shit and being a complete ass hat so they didn't want to play with him. 3rd or 4th year in the league but how many as a human being? You get what you give
didn't he say some petty stuff about d'angelo russell after he was traded lol?
They didn't need to trade for KD. That was a sign and trade for D'angelo Russell. KD was signing in BKN as a FA regardless.   Unless you mean trade for Harden?
"What on God's green Earth does the last three years have to do with this one? It's not gonna be Al Horford against D'Angelo Russell if the Sixers and Nets meet in the ECF. That'd be like me judging the Knicks off of their last three seasons, it wouldn't make any sense."
D'Angelo Russell has played in same number of playoff games as Twolves since 15-16 season...
"LaMelo and Rozier for the Hornets. Was worried about Melo being more flash than substance and being a horribly inefficient offensive player. Kid is amazing. I thought Rozier's year last season was a flash in the pan but turns out he's just an amazing Catch and Shoot guy now and looks way better next to two other facilitators.  other players:   Worse: Josh Richardson, D'Angelo Russell  Better: Randle, Grant"
"Not to take away from any of the young players in the league, but I think part of that is that it's never been easier for young players to get numbers in the NBA. So many teams run their offense through one player who gets to make all the decisions. D'Angelo Russell is a great example of how depending on circumstances, an ok player can look like a bad player or an all-star."
"Griezmann is also a big Nets fan. He flew to New York just to go to a game last month, and has been coming to games since D'Angelo Russell was traded here from LA."
D'Angelo Russell has entered the chat
"Most overrated ""all star"" since D'Angelo Russell"
"Marcus Smart was considered a PG when he came into the NBA.  D'Angelo Russell was thought of more as a combo guard, but he was touted enough to be the #2 pick in a loaded draft. I'd say the answer would either be him or Beal, who was touted enough to be the #3 pick in the most hyped draft I can remember since 2003."
"Jordan Clarkson, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram"
Huge props. Pretty interesting to see some of the young talent that has come out of the Lakers organization over the last few years develop into studs: - Randle- Lonzo- BI- D'Angelo Russell
"Lol check this one out:   &gt; Would you rather have Luka Doncic or D'Angelo Russell on your team? They're both good for 20 a night or so, so there's not THAT much of a difference  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nkp4hz/curry_and_irving_swap_teams_in_the_2017_finals_do/gze1ej6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3"
"Would you rather have Luka Doncic or D'Angelo Russell on your team? They're both good for 20 a night or so, so there's not THAT much of a difference"
nah you're the type that would be telling everyone D'Angelo Russell is better than Damian Lillard if he was still on the Lakers lol.
"well they had moved on from D'Angelo Russell at that point, who is a trash defender. he's back on the squad now. also Brook Lopez was the center and he's a very solid defender. I completely forgot about Josh Hart tho, imagine he's on this squad too."
"No they didn't 😂. D'Angelo Russell sucked in LA, Jordan Clarkson got traded for scraps and Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram did NOT live up to expectations."
"No because the Lakers are an incompetent organization that can't develop jack shit. Literally the second D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle left they became all-stars. Jordan Clarkson became the 6th man of the year, Lonzo Ball became a good point gaurd and even guys like Ivica Zubac are thriving."
"D'Angelo Russell is slow too and this is his best move. It puts the defender ""in jail"" where unless they have that superhuman bounce and length they can't block. Any reach is gonna be a foul and they can't get in front of them either because then all you have to to do is speed up a tiny bit and then the defender won't have legal guarding position and it'll be a blocking foul.   1:1 it's super effective. If there's a guy in front or a help defender that can come at him from the other side he's fucked.   But forreal the slowness really really makes every step so easy to dissect too. And it definitely fucks with defenders who aren't used to going for a block from their walking pace."
D'Angelo Russell to the Kings confirmed.
"I mean you can handwave it all away because of KD, Kyrie and Harden but the Nets absolutely made some great moves in the past few seasons. D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen just off the top of my head are/were awesome players for them and helped get them to where they are today."
"There is an error with apostrophes in player names. D'angelo Russell, O'Neals, etc. when you select them it only populates the name up to the apostrophe and you have to manually type the rest out."

Here's my top 5 protected when taking contracts into consideration.  1. Karl Anthony Towns  2. Anthony Edwards  3. D'Angelo Russell  4. Jaden McDaniels  5. Malik Beasley
"Zach arguement for LaMelo:   I've heard from partisans of both Ball and Edwards suggesting the race is a blowout. Nope. Advanced numbers suggest a blowout -- for Ball. Edwards is 12th among 34 rotation rookies in PER, 26th in value over replacement player, and 29th in win shares. Ball is first, second, and ninth, respectively.  Those numbers penalize Edwards for taking tons of shots on a losing team, and hitting them at a poor rate (41% overall, 32.7% on 3s, 48% on 2s) -- and playing the bad defense we expect from rookies. They say Edwards' impressive traditional numbers are empty calories. There is a sound argument that Haliburton should finish No. 2.  But what would happen to basically any rookie working as a pseudo-No. 1 option for the Minnesota freaking Timberwolves without both Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell? That was Edwards' lot early -- when he missed and missed and missed, and his advanced numbers sunk into the abyss.  But alongside real talent, Edwards has exceeded expectations. In 35 games since March 1, he's averaging 23 points on 45% shooting: a semi-respectable (considering how many pull-ups he takes) 34% on 3s, and 53.3% on 2s. The Wolves are 15-19 in that stretch, and 9-7 in their past 16 games. They are a real team, and Edwards is part of that. You can tell he has earned the respect of opponents, because they often assign their best perimeter defenders to him.  Edwards leads all rookies in minutes, with about 800 more than Ball. He may unseat Ball, the presumptive favorite all season, and that would not be some sort of travesty. But Ball has made positive contributions to a team with real stakes since day one. He has been the better shooter, playmaker, and rebounder. His statistical edge in everything but raw points and minutes is overwhelming. Given some baseline threshold of availability, I don't prioritize minutes quite as much in the ""of year"" awards as in MVP. Ball wins here, but it's close. Haliburton is an easy choice at No. 3."

my day old hot pocket &gt; D'angelo Russell
So you are saying Bill Russell &gt; D'angelo Russell?
I remember when D'Angelo Russell was an instrumental piece to their future
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
"I don't hate the Wolves for any Bulls related reason (unless you count the Jimmy Butler saga).  I just think they're the worst NBA team in existence. They've got KAT, who's supposed to be incredibly talented and able to win, yet they can't do anything positive despite having him. Wiggins was a bust. They get Jimmy for one year and he drags their asses to the playoffs for the first time in forever. He leaves because they're all garbage. They get D'Angelo Russell to complement KAT and they're still hot garbage.   No matter what they do, they're the worst. An embarrassment to Minnesota."
"Ah yes because Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle and D'angelo Russell/Brook Lopez is definitely a worse team than the Kings starting 5...."
"Jaren Jackson, D'Angelo Russell, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Austin Rivers and Norman Powell(somewhat) were some that came to mind for me."
"Twolves would have a pretty strong unit of young guys in Simmons, ant, D'Angelo Russell, and KAT and they've already expresses interest in Simmons."
D'Angelo Russell as well
I just dont really buy in situations like these that teams will find better ways to spend that $30+ mil. There are just very few teams who keeping as much cap space for 2022 FA is really a rational move. If you are trading for him you are a believer that he can still improve alot and maybe follow a Zach LaVine path as a higher end outcome as an ex. And even if he doesnt the way you want these types of players who put up high PPG tend to be tradeable D'Angelo Russell has been overvalued multiple times on the market now.  It really is just a question of the luxury tax for your owner. Which if your owner wont pay it you arent really that serious about wanting to win a title anyway and in that case you are probably not a huge market team and hence dont need to be saving cap space for FA.
D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young snitching fiasco
His trade value currently is someone in the CJ McCollum/Malcolm Brogdon/Buddy Hield/D'Angelo Russell category.  Not sure any of those guys put the Sixers over the top though.
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"Doncic is a good pick imo. I think he could ""easily"" average 30 if he really pushed for it.   A very darkhorse-ish pick would be KAT after healing up from injuries and COVID, finally being able to play alongside healthy D'Angelo Russell as well who's one of the more underrated playmakers in the league.   Russell's a standout pick'n'roll and pick'n'pop player - if Ant doesn't take away as many shots I could see KAT emerging after a down year again. He's one of the best shotmakers in the league and once his career comes to an end he'll also go down as one of the best scorers in league history period.   Next season the Wolves could have a good enough roster around him to unleash his first true prime year. Open catch and shoot 3s are 45% for KAT, he's incredibly well-rounded and balanced on the offensive end. I think people are sleeping hard on KAT's talent but I believe he'll dominate in the correct setting. Has all the tools to become the Dirk of 5s."
I'd say Julius Randle is more than a ok rotation player. Same with D'Angelo Russell

"i'd personally take Bam above like 20 guys on this list. And there's 0 shot im taking Anthony Edwards, Lamelo, John Collins, D'angelo Russell, CJ McCollum over Bam."
"Twolves might want Simmons but these reports are just laughably bad offseason click bait.   &gt; D'Angelo Russell?  &gt; Beasley + Rubio + Picks?  Jesus Christ, did Daryl Morey just stop being Daryl Morey and start doing crack and heroin all day? Or is he so many bong rips in that he needs Michael Beasley to bring his stash just to survive?  Edwards is the only remotely valuable non-KAT piece on the roster and the idea that Philly wants to pair prime Embiid with a 19 year old is still a huge stretch."
because those players dont improve our situation? pretty simple  Like do people think russell is going to get us to the finals? What's the point of making a trade that has a 99% chance of repeating the same thing we had this year? There's literally a better chance Ben Simmons gets hypnotized and fixes his shot than there is of D'angelo Russell being a 2nd option on a finals team
"&gt;they would have gone #1 and #2 without question  You realize the draft includes college players too right? They way KAT and Jahlil Okafor were hyped up, no one would have take an unproven in Skal high schooler over them 2014. Simmons was much more hyped and woulda definitely been top 3.  And you think without the one and done rule all of those guys would have skipped college? That's not how it usually works. Usually only the top 2 or 3 guys decide to enter into the draft and the rest go to college.   Stephen Zimmerman would have most definitely not been a lottery pick coming out of high school if you include the fact he's competing with not just his hs class but guys like KAT, Okafor, Porzingis, and D'Angelo Russell.  I don't know how this shotty analysis is getting so many upvotes"
Organized by D'Angelo Russell
D'Angelo Russell
"It's just ironic seeing someone with a D'Angelo Russell flair talk about how a bad max hampers roster construction, referring to Wiggins, but not the guy he was traded for.  Also, almost all those off-the-dribble shots come out of spread pick and roll, he's a total one trick pony."
D'Angelo Russell and Lamelo ball....?
"D'angelo Russell pick any year, even his make-a-wish all star season with the Nets  Andre Drummond entire career  Whiteside in portland  Jerami grant this year  Sexton this year"
"Definitely the Timberwolves in my opinion. Not only did they forfeit their top 10 pick this year, I see a likely scenario where KAT wants out and the Timberwolves (who are already one of the worst teams in the league) lose their best player and are stuck with D'Angelo Russell. They always have the bright spot of Anthony Edwards though."
I'll never understand why anyone would trade D'Angelo Russell for Kyle Kuzma.
"Did he really have better teammates tho?  Outside of this year his two best teammates were D'Angelo Russell for like a couple games, Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler  Boogie not counting Golden State has played with jrue holiday, IT (for a short time), AD and rondo"
"It's D'Angelo Russell, the fit is seemless.  &amp;#x200B;  hes an elite shot creator that will fit perfectly with Joel Embiid and defense wont be a problem.  His handles are great and can actually be a halfcourt threat. Dlo is a Top Tier PnR threat in the league, him with Embiid is Dangerous."
D'Angelo Russell.
D'Angelo Russell for Ben Simmons.
"Brook Lopez, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen for the Nets. None of them left on their own though so no reason at all not to like them. They were all traded."
Beverley D'Angelo Russell!
I disagree. even though I'm a nets fan I feel like I have a pretty unbiased ranking.   Five: Kobe  Four: Lebron  Three: D'Angelo Russell  Two: Michael Jordan  One: Brook Lopez
Am I the only one that thinks D'angelo russell and picks for ben simmons is a good deal for both sides?
"No. As I said, sometimes guys get stuff wrong, are hearing only part of the story, or are talking to someone who had an agenda.   Which is very, very different from the reporter making it up from whole cloth.    As an example, I would point out how early rumors of issues with Carlisle were unsourced, while the defenses of him were sourced (including by Cuban) and he was gone within two weeks. Clearly the early unsourced reports were talking about *something* accurate and the people going on record were lying through their teeth.  Also, people give way too much credit to players as always being truthful. For example, a whole bunch of Hawks players who are record in the last few weeks about Trae's change in play and how much better everything is now were on record early in the season after the Athletic report, saying that there were zero issues with his play on the team. Or, another, it's easy to find quotes from the players themselves saying there were no issues between Harden and CP3 in the run-up to CP3's trade, for example.   Also: if you're a role player on a team, you have a very strong incentive to say only positive things on the record about your star, because the team will trade you in a hot second if the star wants you gone. It's interesting to me how r/NBA jumps all over the assumption that a reporter must be making stuff up for clicks and completely ignores many players' much more profound incentives. If Luka was the biggest asshole on the planet (and I'm not saying I think he is) do you think Maxi Kleber is going to go on the record and say so? Or is he more likely to grouse quietly to a reporter (or behave in a way where a reporter in the locker room can clearly see there are issues) while publicly saying things are fine?   Players have a very strong culture of ""what happens in the locker room stays in the locker room,"" and guys who are caught violating that (D'Angelo Russell on the Lakers, anyone?) don't stick around very long unless they're HUGE stars."
"So did this happen when they received D'Angelo Russell? I'm inclined to believe you because you seem to know what you're talking about lol But also, Wiggins plus Wiseman contract is well over a max slot in money going out"
"This is 100% recency bias.  I want to remind you, the Wolves had to attach a first round pick to Wiggins to get D'Angelo Russell from the Warriors.     Wiggins was a great success last year, but that is much more likely due to the Warriors system than anything else.       Simmons is someone who has already made an All-NBA team, was a DPOY finalist and made back to back ALL 1st D teams.  Not to mention, the Warriors system would likely be a dream for Simmons, as he likely can do the Draymond role if needed, or cut to the rim during Dray + Steph pnr.     The only reason Ben's value is this low is because of the flameout in the playoffs."
"Everyone already mentioned Luka and Harden, but D'Angelo Russell is an even more unathletic example of a guard who can still put up some big stats at times."
"How tf did you get 2 lotto picks again? The D'Angelo Russell trade? Imagine if you guys got 1 &amp; 4... the NBA world would have burned to the ground. I did make fun of it in another comment, but I get it. I'm a Sabres fan and I'm disappointed every time we don't win the lottery. We did get Eichel and Dahlin but God dammit we should have gotten Auston Matthews and everyone else as well! I just generally don't say it out loud otherwise everyone will tell me to fuck off because we already got Eichel and Dahlin"
"They traded the 1st pick (2014), 7th pick (2021), and 37th pick (2021) for D'Angelo Russell."
"I think it's been blown a bit out of proportions how bad he's been. Lowe suggested a Malik Beasley and D'Angelo Russell for Simmons trade and i'd take that in a heartbeat. Even with a pick included that trade still seems a bit lopsided.  He *really* shines in full court offense and there's less of that in the post season, but that shit helped them go 49-23 in the regular season and secure the 1st seed in the east."
A tiny flying D'Angelo Russell?
It's insane how far Simmons' stock has fallen...imagine going from a centerpiece in a trade for James Harden to a centerpiece in a trade for D'Angelo Russell in like 5 months
D'Angelo Russell and John Wall
"D'Angelo Russell is probably the next All-Star that could be a decent fit with Joel, but if your best return is D'Angelo Russell for Simmons, that might be a bad look lol. Still, if the Wolves throw in Beasley + D'Angelo/cap filler since Simmons has a 15% trade kicker, I could see them biting on that.   &gt;However the Twolves would have to have faith in Edwards as their closer which is very early in his career to assume he can do that. Plus Simmons contract is massive so the Twolves may have to throw in Rubio or Beasley to make it work.  Wolves have already committed to building around the Russell/Edwards/KAT big 3, although I don't know which one of those are expendable."
"For the wolves, absolutely. I don't think D'Angelo Russell for Simmons is a bad trade tbh."
"KAT, D'Angelo Russell, Porzingis &amp; Myles Turner.  Booker's been better than all of them, but most of the other guys are out of the league or on the dead-ass end of someone's bench"
"Every Laker young player magically learns how to shoot the moment they leave LA and people pretend ""they were destined to become good all along had they just stayed in LA!"". Ben Taylor called 2020 Brandon Ingram the biggest single season shooting jump in NBA history last yr. Larry Nance and Julius Randle werent even taking 3s in LA. D'Angelo Russell literally finished 2nd in most improved player of the year voting after leaving LA."
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.    Past 10 drafts  2010 Best Players  * John Wall (1)  * DeMarcus Cousins (5)  * Gordan Hayward (9)  * Paul George (10)   2011 Best Players  * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * Jimmy Butler (30)  2012 Best players  * Anthony Davis (1)  * Bradley Beal (3)  * Damien Lillard (6)  * Draymond Green (35)  * Khris Middleton (39)  2013 Best players  * Victor Oladipo (2)  * Giannis Anteokoumpo (15)  * Rudy Gobert (27)  2014 Best Players  * Joel Embiid (3)  * Julius Rangle (7)  * Zach Lavine (13)  * Nikola Jocic (41)  2015 Best Players  * Karl Anthony Towns (1)  * D'Angelo Russell (2)  * Devin Booker (13)  2016 Best players  * Ben Simmons (1)  * Brandon Ingram (2)  * Jaylen Brown (3)  * Domantas Sabonis (11)  * Pascal Siakam (27)  2017 Best players  * Jayson Tatum (3)  * De'Aron Fox (5)  * Donovan Mitchell (13)  * Bam Adebayo (14)  * John Collins (19)  2018 Best players  * Deandre Ayton (1)  * Luca Doncic (3)  * Trae Young (5)  * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)  2019 Best Players  * Zion Williamson (1)  * Ja Morant (2)  2020 Best Players  * La Melo Ball (3)
d'angelo russell said when they played together in high school he was a lot better at just throwing up shots and he reckons the confidence issues in the league are what's fucked ben since. going 2-17 and seeing it all over social and the news? i can imagine that tbh
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
PG - Jeremy Lin SG - D'Angelo Russell SF - Derrick Rose PF - Dirk Nowitzki C - Nikola Jokic  Admittedly pushing it here with the abysmally defensive 3 guard lineup but hey what can you do.
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"So, you're saying that (using the 2001 team as an example) Wally Szczerbiak, pre-Detroit Chauncey Billups, and Rasho Nesterovic are 27 games better than D'Angelo Russell, Ricky Rubio, and Malik Beasley?  Come on."
Probably worth specifying Bill Russell not D'Angelo.
"D'Angelo Russell is the problem.  He thinks he is better than he is, has no interest in playing defense, tends to want to play hero ball, is on an undeserved contract.   All this is being overlooked because he is ""KAT's friend""."
"I know everyone thinks the Lakers were tanking all those years, but as a long time Lakers fan I can tell you that was all just legitimately due to horribly incompetent front office management. They were actually trying to win, especially while Kobe was still playing, they were just awful at how they went about trying to do it.   Part of the problem was that they'd gone all in with the trades for Dwight and Nash, giving away a bunch of unprotected picks to do so, and part of it was that Dwight left immediately afterwards and Nash and Kobe suffered career-altering injuries that year, and were never close to the same players again. They bet it all and it blew up about as spectacularly as possible.  After that the Lakers approached every off-season like just cause they were the Lakers, eventually a star would sign with them, so every year they would only sign guys to one year deals so they could keep cap space for the next season. And then when nobody would sign the next season, they'd do the same thing again. They finally stopped doing this in 2016 when instead they blew all their cap space on Mozgov and Deng, which obviously was a terrible decision.   And then on top of that, the guys they picked in the draft were never home run selections. They'd show hints of promise, and have gone on to be good players since, but none were prodigies right out of the gate. D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball are all pretty solid players now, but they were mostly kinda disappointing when they were on the Lakers (especially before LeBron signed).   Like I said, they weren't trying to lose, they were just absolutely awful at trying to win."
D'Angelo Russell was 2nd pick and was able to progress to All-Star status.
Would either team say yes to a D'Angelo Russell and a protected first for Tobias Harris trade
"No it doesn't, that would be a double sign and trade lol.  That's one possible option of infinite. They could have taken back a trade exception. There's so many other possibilities lol.  The Warriors got D'Angelo Russell when KD left who they turned into Wiggins and Kuminga."
Prolly D'Angelo Russell. He and KAT sometimes people forget the are in the league.
2020-21 Warriors MVPs:   1. Steph Curry for being the league's leading scorer 2. D'Angelo Russell for getting traded 3. Andrew Wiggins for becoming an impressive defensive wing 4. Ja Morant for dropping 35 to send the Warriors to the lottery
I'd say D'Angelo Russell - because I've seen the way he plays defense.
"Being a superstar is hard. It takes more than just a PR machine. PR works for awhile. Lord knows the Lakers tried to keep Lonzo an D'angelo Russell looking like future superstars.                                                 If you can’t get wins though, fans see things more clearly. A superstar needs to get wins and keep his team contending. LaMelo seems good, maybe like an all star. But he also looks like he has a lot of PR around him, which makes me suspicious of his actual ceiling."
"That's probably because most people only watch their team. Sabonis feasts on mediocre front courts and struggles against better defenders. The fact that he made the all-star team this year is ridiculous. Money notwithstanding, I'd much rather have D'Angelo Russell over him. He shoots AND keeps his shit defense on the perimeter, where it's much less impactful and easier to build around."
D'Angelo Russell
"I think this might not be that big of a reach, but i really think D'Angelo Russell can still become an All-NBA level player, he still has so much potential"
"Not like LAL can develop talent to save their lives anyway...  Outside of Caruso, and *maybe* KCP, what players drafted by the Lakers have actually blossomed there?  Julius Randle - After leaving LA, he gets huge MIP noise, and even some MVP discussion after leading NYK back to the Playoffs.  D'Angelo Russell - After leaving LA, he becomes one of the centerpieces of a young Brooklyn team that made it back to the Playoffs after a decent absence.  Jordan Clarkson - After leaving LA, he wins 6MOTY on UTAH, is instrumental in putting The Jazz in the position to make the (admittedly disappointing) post-season run they did.  Lonzo Ball - Has greatly improved his shooting to become one of the more coveted 3&amp;D guys on the market (4yrs, 85mil coveted).  Brandon Ingram - Turns into KD-lite, shows flashes on Tatum-level ability. Very impressive young guy.  Point is, even without Lebron not allowing some of these guys the chance to grow, which of them were even likely to grow when The Lakers talent development is such booty?  Leaving the team seems to have worked out better for many of them in terms of improving their individual game."

"These are very good.  The only one I'd disagree with is the D'Angelo Russell one. I think he's a good point guard, especially if your team has little other offensive creation, but if there are other players will high usage, his value goes down tremendously."
"&gt; No one gets to hold last year against KAT. 7 family members died of Covid, then he got injured, then he got Covid which made it hard for him to breath even after he was clear of the virus and hampered his play when he came back.  This still applies.  But for the record:    1) Everyone was injured, we had no veterans to hold the fort down, and our coach sucked the first half.   2) KAT played half his games recovering from injury or Covid.   3) The Minnesota Timberwolves have a record of 13-12 with D'Angelo Russell and KAT playing all-time.  That’s how injured we’ve been the last 2 years.  D’Lo and KAT have played a total of 25 games together over 2 seasons and were both injured at the same time plenty as well.    In addition we’ve had other injuries plus Beasley’s suspension plus Ant and McDaniels were terrible the first half of the season coming in with no training camp as raw rookies.  They played at a very high level in the second half and McDaniels put on 10 lbs doing heavy work outs over the offseason.    Reality matters.  The Wolves gutted our team of Veterans and we basically started with 2 wins then a KAT injury then it went downhill from there."

"1. Domantas Sabonis is the most overrated player in the NBA 2. Ben Simmons isn't a DPOY contender, he isn't the best defender on his own team 3. Klay has never been close to the player that Draymond is 4. D'Angelo Russell is a below average starting point guard 5. CP3 isn't the Suns best player/the whole CP3 MVP narrative was absolutely ridiculous 6. Despite having 2 of the most iconic playoffs moments of the last decade, Dame Lillard has more disapointing playoffs series than good ones 7. Rudy Gobert's perimeter defense has never been a problem in the playoffs, his lack of offensive abilities is"
This is such a false equivalency. It's more like if D'angelo Russell had a really good all star season or two and then suffered a likely career ending injury in his next contract year and the Warriors decided to trade him instead of extending him.
i get that you're a warriors fan but did you really have to put d'angelo russell at 4
"Man what a trash ass offer for us. Why would any team give up two *elite* shooters *and* picks for Ben ""Everyone Else's Skills Have To Cater To Mine"" Simmons. All y'all uneducated, don't actually play basketball, haven't watched a Wolves game in your life /r/nba nephews come up with the most ass ideas. Y'all have these elaborate tiers of player value based on how you guys see other people discuss them rather than having actually watched these guys, making everyone agree simultaneously with Raptors fans that OG is untouchable, but DLO is a negative asset, and CJ McCollum is also ass compared to Ben Simmons (tag my post y'all wack ass 76er fans, y'all never getting Dame).   Nevermind the fact that D'Angelo Russell played good (not passable, good) defense after his return from surgery, nevermind that for some reason because KAT isn't a mistake eraser you supposedly have to surround him with all plus defenders despite Jokic playing the same position with guys like Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and MPJr surrounding him (successfully). Man, I just really hate y'all bum ass, can't hoop fools."
Happened with D'Angelo Russell when he was a rookie. Happened with Caruso during his time here. You're not wrong
At least D'Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley. Probably + picks or young players?
"Not sure who I'd even want from the Spurs. Dejounte Murray is a worse/shorter PG version of Simmons.  From the Timberwolves, not sure if D'Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley move the needle for their cost. I don't think Russell is a 16 game player."
lmao D'Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards died? Also I would claw my eyes out if I saw a KAT/Lauri starting frontcourt.  I want Lauri as a bench stretch 4 lol which is his talent level.
"It's like 3 years in a row I'm thinking KAT will take that leap into top 10 player status and with Anthony Edwards coming on strong, Malik Beasley playing more, D'Angelo Russell scoring the ball, and hopefully some development from other young players I think they'll be in the playoffs/play-in.  I will probably be wrong again, but I just love KAT and really do think he's a top 10 player surrounded by trash."
"Been a D'angelo Russell fan every since college. I feel that his career has had some bad luck.   You know like, the Nets being in a position to sign Kyrie and KD even after his all-star appearance and being traded to the Warriors which clearly didn't fit. Then now being traded to a Timberwolves team that had a pretty bad coach in Ryan Saunders. I'm glad things are looking up for the Timberwolves now though"
Paul george and D'angelo russell. They got smooth ass games
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
Drummond was good in 2016 and 2018. Dont let revisionist history or hate blind you from that.  That being said...  D'Angelo Russell was never really that good and gets overhyped due to that 1 underserved All Star selection which he basically got on behalf of the entire Nets and would have gone to Caris LeVert had he not got injured.
Sixers: one KAT one Edwards one D'angelo russell and 2 unprotected picks and MAYBE we will consider it.
simmons for d'angelo russell
It's weird that a fan base that actually thinks D'Angelo Russell is good want to trade for the absolute complete opposite of D'Angelo Russell
"I mean, this might explain why he's not getting another contract with the Lakers. But for every other team, Schroder is not as good as he thinks he is + his ego is huge + wants too much $$$. Does the lakers really want a player that outed Lebron James and his vaccination choice? That was Lebron's privacy. Lebron has the right to his medical privacy (even if we don't agree with his choices). This isn't a D'Angelo Russell and Nick Young fiasco. Now don't get me wrong. Schroder is a decent player, but he's not a guy you can count on when the times get tuff (pun intended)."
"Bill Russell, D'Angelo Russell, Campy Russell."
"Reminds me that the Lakers are as shitty as any other Team in drafting.  2015 #2 D'angelo Russell  2016 #2 Brandon Ingram  2017 #2 Lonzo Ball  Couldnt form a young competitive team around three successive #2 Picks.  Lebron bailed them out, so they got another timeline."
this was my biggest issue trying to separate players like D'Angelo Russell from players like Luka Doncic
If a team is still over the cap after letting a player walk for nothing it means losing flexibility because even though it reduces payroll it doesn't provide any cap space to replace the player who left.  This isn the same reason thr Warriors took back D'Angelo Russell when KD went to the Nets. Keeping that salary on the books let then make trades down the road.
"hey, lazy bum.  I decided to help you out and look for a trade myself.  I didn't even have to look that hard.  Nets signed and traded D'Angelo Russell to the Warriors for Kevin Durant.  The salaries didn't match so they attached Treveon Graham and Shabazz Napier's contracts to make the trade work.  All one transaction.    So I was wrong about the rules.  You could have proved it pretty easily with a little more effort.  Too bad you didn't even try."
"A lot of ex-Lakers have flourished the past few years beyond their Laker days.  Julius Randle Jordan Clarkson D'Angelo Russell Brandon Ingram Brook Lopez Ivica Zubac Lou Williams  This is just from memory, could be more."
"Signed and traded players can be part of the same multi team deal though, like the one that sent KD to Brooklyn in exchange for D'Angelo Russell (S&amp;T) along with a couple other players who went to Minnesota. So if the Nets were interested in Schroder and Washington wanted Dinwiddie then Schroder could go to Brooklyn and it wouldn't be an issue. Same if it was some other team that was involved.   And no, I don't think I'm projecting at all. You just seem hell bent on trying to figure out why this couldn't happen for some reason, and I'm guessing it's cause you're a Clipper fan who hates the Lakers."
You really are Juaniscool aren't you? Still pissed the Lakers traded D'Angelo Russell apparently.
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
The Nets legit did it with KD and D'Angelo Russell....
Wiggins + 1st for D'Angelo Russell. Warriors are bow using wiggins + 7th overall pick to trade for a star and Russell is overrated and the twolves still suck. I remember getting trashed hard on here for thinking that wasn't a robbery by the wolves
Funny to imagine D'Angelo Russell trying to set up a meeting with Tim Cook.
"To be fair, I don't think any CEO is taking time off to meet with D'Angelo Russell."
"They were 3rd in the West two of the 6 years in question. I think he should have made it probably both of those years in concept, just based on his performance and the team performance. But in practice those years you still had Westbrook/Harden/Lillard/Curry/Thompson in the West already. You can't really justify adding a 6th guard.  If he's in the East I think he's a 2 time All-Star right now. It's that simple. At the very least he makes it over D'Angelo Russell in 2018."
"&gt;Nance is another player who was making his way into a solid role player until injuries. Lakers seemed to have a hardon for guys with medical issues.  What the hell? Adam Morrison wasn't drafted by the Lakers, he just wound up as a bench warmer with them on two title teams after it was clear he was a bust. And Larry Nance Jr. was a phenomenal pick at #27, a guy who has had a great career for someone taken that late. The guy they drafted that year who has had a rash of medical issues throughout his career is D'Angelo Russell. I wonder what ever happened to that dude?"
Just grabbed this from basketball-reference and filtered in Excel. Asterisk is Hall of Fame:  Dino Radja*  Don Ray  Davon Reed  Don Rehfeldt  Don Reid  Dick Ricketts  David Rivers  Doc Rivers  David Robinson*  Devin Robinson  Duncan Robinson  Dave Robisch  Dennis Rodman*  Derrick Rose  Dick Rosenthal  Doug Roth  Dan Roundfield  Derrick Rowland  Donald Royal  Delaney Rudd  Damjan Rudez  D'Angelo Russell
"I mean what else were they gonna do? Draft Jahlil Okafor?  Same with the Edwards pick, they already had D'Angelo Russell, they were not gonna take Lamelo Ball.  Josh Okogie was a decent find at 20th though"
D'Angelo Russell is somehow only 25 years old
"works well since his number is 0 and he's clearly so cool...  Naturally D'Angelo Russell is Lord Nikon, my question is which NBA player is the Cereal Killer?"
Randle  Lonzo  BI  D'angelo Russell  &amp;#x200B;  At best a play in team.
I feel like this could be similar to when the Lakers traded D'Angelo Russell to the Nets to get them to take Mozgov off their hands. Russell's value was not that great at the time either (the Lakers reportedly first tried to trade him for a lottery pick and got no takers).
"Oh man, I can name a few from the 2013-2019 dark years:  - Larry Nance Jr. making his own basket against the Clippers on Christmas 2015  - Robert Sacre inbounding it to fucking Jae Crowder and then fouling him as he makes the layup in a game in Dallas.  - D'Angelo Russell with that blunder on the fastbreak with Jordan Clarkson. Kobe then rolls his eyes afterwards lmao.  - Marcelo Huertas (the GOAT) and his backwards shot against the Heat.  - Jeremy Lin not fouling Mike Conley in crunch time while Kobe is yelling at him to foul so Kobe has to run up and do it himself.  - Lonzo passing up a wide open layup he could have got on the fastbreak and instead tries to pass it back to Javale McGee (who was behind him) but turns it over instead.  - LeBron not dribbling the ball to start the clock against the Nuggets and instead the ball just rolls out of bounds."
"Define recent. Teague, Jrue, and Lopez have each only been selected once. Teague was the most recently selected of those 3 (2015, half a decade ago) and frankly he's by far the worst player in the Bucks rotation. Middleton did make it in 2019 and 2020, but didn't make it this year   The recent all-star thing doesn't make a ton of sense anyway. Is a team of Isaiah Thomas, Gordon Hayward, DeAndre Jordan, Julius Randle, and D'Angelo Russell a superteam?"
"Yeah, I forgot D'Angelo Russell. haha."
"I'm not debating the matter of relativity, I'm saying it's entitlement. Warriors fans bitching about not winning a championship the past couple years in r/nba is akin to Jeff Bezos telling a bunch of middle class Americans that he's had bad luck cause Richard Branson got to space first. Read the room.  GSW hit significant injury trouble for one stretch. If anything, that's good luck! Most teams face far worse injury troubles. Look what happened to Brooklyn and the Clippers this past year. Aside from Curry's nagging ankle injuries early on, The Warriors have been very fortunate to have not encountered significant injury issues prior to KD and Klay going down.  Outside of that, the Warriors had a 13.4 % chance of landing the second overall pick and you know what? They got it. That's good fortune!  KD, who was acquired as a found wallet (also good luck), could have walked for nothing, but he didn't. In another stroke of good luck, he agreed to a sign and trade and the Warriors netted D'Angelo Russell and a first rounder (good fortune) then flipped D'Angelo for Wiggins and another first round pick (good fortune).  They had the 7th and 14th OA picks this year and had two great players fall to them in the draft (good fortune).  Sure Warriors fans have their right to be entitled about not winning a championship the past two years just like a billionaire is completely within his right to bemoan and whine about not being the first one to space. But it's still corny, entitled, and tone-deaf."
What makes the wolves the worst? Glen Taylor? A-Rod incoming? Living in Minneapolis? having to watch D'Angelo Russell? I need to know more!!
"do not forget the wolves prevented sachin gupta from taking the gm job in houston, which is only proper if they intended to eventually promote him from within.  this is the eagles going with jalen hurts over carson wentz.  rosas (wentz) may be good but flawed in the leadership category.  whereas hurts (sanchin gupta) is highly regarded in the locker room and has talent that is respected by many front office executives around the league.  also consider, four years ago, the timberwolves ownership stepped in to trade jimmy butler away when their general manager was not making headway.  it was said mulltiple times this offseason, the minnesota timberwolves were going to improve at the powerforward position via trade, and they got nobody.  had they gotten larry nance, they would'nt be in a standoff with philadelphia over ben simmons.  may we also recall that not only did anthony edwards fall into minnesota's lap, because they surprisingly got the #1 pick, but also that edwards was not considered a great fit in minnesota because they already had d'angelo russell and malik beasley scoring off the dribble.  meanwhile, the fact that the wolves already have in d'angelo russell what the sixers wanted from markelle fultz in terms of a 4th qtr closer makes them the very best fit for ben simmons in the league.    the wolves desperately need what simmons does well (defense, rebounding, collapsing defenses in transition and facilitating), and they already have people who excel at what simmons does poorly (4th qtr shooting and scoring).   Simmons-Russell-Beasley-McDaniels-KarlAnthonyTowns"
That baby's name? D'Angelo Russell.
That approach got them d'angelo russell and got rid of Jimmy butler.
"Players and teams gotta come together for the good of the league. this simmons shit is madness, nobody wants it. The things that get fans watching are 1- dynasties and 2- homegrown teams. The player movement we see today means you get successive 1-3 year superteams, like the PG thunder, the PG clippers, the Kyrie Celtics, the Kawhi raptors, the Lebron lakers, etc. Means if you do get a nucleus like the old Celtics, Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, Lakers, Warriors, it's harder and harder to keep that dynasty going because fuck it, Giannis decides he'd much rather be mediocre in Miami (for three years, then off to the lakers) than a league icon in Milwaukee. I'd bet you a million dollars that if these stars stayed in their original markets league viewership would be higher than it is now. People want to see the players they cheered for on draft night. I care wayyyy more about Juan Toscano Anderson than I ever did D'Angelo Russell, probably more than Wiggins and maybe even KD. The NBA Carousel soap opera is giving us cheap highs but that's starting to get stale. When every offseason is LEAGUE ALTERING nothing is. Give the players more money, give rookies more money, raise vet minimums whatever, Joe Jumpshot is gonna have to keep playing in Saskatchewan if they keep paying him 10s of millions of dollars, maybe he'll develop a liking to the poutine."
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
For some reason the first thing that came to mind was D'Angelo Russell in the 2019 playoffs vs Philly. He plays such a smooth effortless style of basketball that I didn't even realise he shot just 36% for the series (19.4ppg from 20.6 FGA or 44.6% TS).
"D'Angelo Russell fits this perfectly, he simply needs decent health and when he buys into his role he plays like at his 2019 level."
"I think D'angelo Russell with a full season next to Towns and Edwards will really show out. There was very little time with him alongside Kat, but next to him his percentages skyrocketed."
"Last I heard, Sac wasn't moving De'Aaron Fox. They were trying to move Buddy Hield + assets.  Colin Sexton gets almost as many turnovers as assists (2.8 vs 4.4). He's a maybe, but he's not as good as Fox or CJ.  D'angelo Russell can't stay healthy. Not a good fit with Embiid, who also has iffy health.  I haven't heard Portland offer up CJ. If CJ were on the table today, Morey should (and probably would) take it."
Slight semantics but both Wikipedia and BBallRef are saying 5.9 which I slightly rounded up to 6.  That puts him an assist/turnover ratio of ~2.3 which is on par with like a D'Angelo Russell (can't find a league average for that anywhere).
Most trades I've seen include CJ McCollum or De'Aaron Fox or Colin Sexton or D'Angelo Russell. All players that are starting guards....
"Yeah, that dude is crazy, but I like how people act like Ben's not even worth D'Angelo Russell LOL"
"CJ, .Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, D'Angelo Russell  They could also get Sexton, but that means they will have to take on Love's contract as well."
"Sixers have practically no leverage at this point, and they lose more every week, if not day.   People on here act like the rumored trade packages are downright insulting and that Morey is playing some long con to get Lillard or whatever, and it's fucking hilarious.  ----------------------  Hell last week I remember there was a highly upvoted comment in another Simmons news post that said D'Angelo Russell and multiple picks/pick swaps is laughably insulting."
"From Hoops Hype:  &gt;Darren Wolfson: My understanding is Gersson (Rosas) communicated with Daryl (Morey), maybe some others in the Philadelphia front office... 'OK, KAT off the table. Anthony Edwards off the table, everybody else on the table.' But then like in the same breath, my understanding is D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons... They have a relationship. They played together in high school, that Gersson would love to have D'Angelo combined with Ben here."
"Well there's certified cheques, cashier's cheques that are available... even BTC. I bought two rolexes, two separate times, all cash and that was bothersome for ~7K.  At the end of the day, you don't buy the car, you buy the person.  But I'm still saying the story was suspect to begin with. $49,327 under four empty codeine bottles with zero evidence of him buying a car. Not a single text like ""Hey I'll be coming down to LA to see you"", not a browser of said car. Who in their right mind would travel from Cincinnati to LA with that much cash around with past history of drug trafficking that couldn't even come up with a make or model?   &gt;The drug agents took the money and the phones. The seizure was justified on several grounds, Nimeskern said, including Russell’s travel plans, his vague explanations on the source of the money, his deleted messages, prior drug arrests and ties to ongoing investigations.  &gt;The affidavit said Russell is associated with heroin and methamphetamine trafficking in Kentucky and Indiana, but provided no detail.  Maybe the details were falsified on the cops' end but him switching stories about where the money came from, what he was doing, and refused to show evidence on his fourth phone. If he had an honest story like it was his son's money and he called D'Angelo he would be on his merry way."
"LeBron and Wade spoke about it but nothing was [in fruition.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834128-dwyane-wade-lebron-james-prioritized-bulls-looked-at-knicks-in-summer-of-2010)  That is Wade's own words, he did not think they would play together and I'd say every single media fan and analyst thought the same. I acknowledge I should go back to the gym but hey, words are just words.  Do you honestly think LeBron would have went to the Lakers had they did not clean up front office? Kobe told Jeanie Buss well in advanced prior to LeBron's free agency to fix front office.  &gt;“I’ll tell you, when Jeanie Buss came to me and said, ‘I really want to go after [LeBron],’ I said, ‘Jeanie, he’s not coming here until you clean up this s— here.' The last thing LeBron wants to do is come to an organization that has a lot of infighting, a lot of the stuff going on. Jeanie, it’s time for you to take ownership of this franchise. He’s not going to come if you don’t.”  Let's recap what that meant. Long time GM Mitch Kupchak of 17 years was fired and replaced by Kobe's former agent, Rob Pelinka. A person that has never worked the lines but given full trust and chance at a lifetime strictly by Kobe's association.   Jeanie had to fire her own brother Jim Buss from VP of operations for Magic Johnson. Oh did I mention it was a family [court battle?](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/jeanie-jim-buss-rivalry-lakers-family-siblings-jerry-death-ownership-lawsuit) That's not even the bulk of what actually happened, it was a [complete Kardashian episode](https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-jim-jeanie-buss-trust-20170326-story.html) amongst the entire family including filing for restraining orders.  So yeah maybe having Magic Johnson instead of Jim Buss had a huge indirect or even direct influence on LeBron. Magic Johnson already wanted to clear house, he was already wary on Luke Walton but Jeanie wanted him to stay. Johnson also got rid of their second overall pick D'Angelo Russell, remember that noise with Iggy and Swaggy P?  &gt;A miniscule paycut for a guy making the max and who was already on pace to be a potential billionaire is really not a key point  Man ignorance is bliss. I have so many things I could add. Michael Jordan wasn't even a billionaire that time and it was still unheard of any professional athlete could make that. Michael Jordan paid 275M for 97% ownership of the Charlotte Hornets. He only hit that three comma club status because all the teams shot up in value after the Donald Sterling incident. Yes it was that long ago, Steve Ballmer paid record 2 billion dollars which all franchise including the Hornets made Jordan a billionaire for the first time in his career. Fact check it.  So stop that bullshit right now. Mike Tyson squandered 300M, at that time everyone fought for max deals scared of anything sudden that could be career ending. No one GM people for ""future risk/assessment"" like they do now. You think Wiggins, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, or Drummond is anywhere worth the contracts they signed for at the time? People intentionally went out of their way during the last year of the contracts to boast in value. Anyone and everyone at the time fought for each and every penny.  I'm not sure if you're referring to LeBron's decision about Miami or Lakers at this point. I'm sure you think that one All-star break where Kyrie and KD spoke to each other is when they decided to team up right? You do realize shit happens all the time and deals fall apart. You can bullshit your way to anything but at the end of the day, you're still wrong, but hey whatever makes you happy."
"I can understand that. You guys bringing in Simmons would of course be the first step towards building a team around him Edwards and Kat and other moves would of course happen over the next couple of years such as adding shooting specialists. Like you said I can't possibly imagine a trade happening unless they give something up of tangible worrh.   For Minnesota I don't see how a trade happens unless you include at least dlo and pics used to bring an additional value to send to Philly.(such as a first round pick used to entice a team like the Spurs to part with high end complimentary players such as Derek White / Thaddeus Young).   No matter how low his value is if Minnesota isn't at least willing to do something like that I'm sure there are half a dozen teams that can offer better role players staright up than you guys can if that becomes the high end of what they're willing to trade. I like what you guys are building out there and I'm really happy to see that it appears your management is turning the corner. I've always liked the Timberwolves and it's always been frustrating to me how many times your management has shot themselves in the foot And it would be exciting to see a good playoff quality team for the next decade plus for you guys.   I honestly think getting rid of dlo and picks for Simmons would be incredibly huge for you ( assuming you Philadelphia wants him in the first place) i think Edwards is going to be twice the guard that D'Angelo Russell is and can be, and will eventually become a nice to have, but not vital part of your team. As far as friends are concerned if your star player doesn't understand that he's part of a billion-dollar business and not a friend group then that's its own cup of tea. Chemistry is important but I like to believe that towns would be understanding if the front office comes to him with a vision on how they plan on putting him in position to eventually compete for a championship.  And shooting can always be added through the draft or free agency as needed. For the record I'm not a Simmons fan I just think you guys are one of the few teams where it's easy to imagine a very seamless fit without him having to improve his outside shooting.   Again I have no dog in this race I'm not a Simmons super fan. Just voicing my opinion in regards to the pros of you guys going all in for him."
"And D'Angelo Russell humping Kobe midway through the clip, instead of letting him catch his breath. 😂"
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Brandon Ingram got a max, D'Angelo Russell got a max, randle got a bag, Nance is a great player, Josh Hart is a great bench player, Kuz just got us Russell Westbrook lol  We drafted great players, even our second rounders like Jordan Clarkson hit , Thomas Bryant is starting for the wiz, this idea of disappointing players is garbage   &gt;I highly doubt magic was the dominant factor there, but ya never know I guess.   Literally gave an article with lebron saying why he went to la, and it had nothing to do with the movies or the night life, he could have stayed in Miami if he just wanted the nightlife   &gt;And no, nowhere was I talking about Pelinka specifically there.  That's why it's a garbage statement, lebron and AD were not products of the previous FO, so it's just you saying general statements that have no context   The Lakers were bad for a period of time , what does that have to do with the reason lebron is here now? We had the assets and the cap space and lebron saw that as well"
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."
D'Angelo Russell and a 1st round pick  I have a feeling ANT is gonna be able to do a lot of the things that Dlo does well
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
&gt; 26th D'Angelo Russell  😂
"What deal could have twolves offered? D'Angelo Russell and picks? Anthony edwards and Kat are untouchable, so...."
"his agent, D'Angelo Russell told @TheAthletic @Stadium"
"It is kinda tricky, the Kings are just not a good team to trade with for the 76ers. In that trade we desperately need someone who is capable of running the offense. Fox is that guy in Sacramento but I understand he's valuable for them.      THey are also high on Hali, who I think we would take, but he is not ideal for the Sixers, he is not a proven PG and he played a comboguard role. If they believe in Mitchell I guueeeess he could be on the table, but apparently it is not the case.     No way we would take a Hield/Barnes/Bagley based package - that would put sophomore Maxey, Shake Milton, a shoot first microwave guard who shouldn't really handle the ball for too long, and Seth Curry as our only point guards.      Dear Morey, please take the Wolves package and ask for D'Angelo Russell as its centerpiece. Both teams will be happy, D'Lo is a clutch shooter who can run the pick and roll - slow but steady."
"I wish two of these players were on my team, and one of them was not named D'Angelo Russell."
Getting rid of D'Angelo Russell ought to be one of the T-Wolves' goals.
"&gt;i srsly wonder, is he actually opposed to playing with his buddy in minnesota because of the location? do you think that would affect how much kat would want him there or no? or is ben worried about what playing together might do to that friendship?   [Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic confirms on Dan Barrerio that Ben Simmons is open to being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves to play with his friends Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell.

&gt;to play with his friends Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell. Along with fellow Klutch agent Anthony Edwards.    Ok so Simmons assumes Minnesota will trade no assets to Philly for him?

You will see exactly how much Ben is worth now that he has gone public about jot playing for the Seventy-Shitters any longer.       Bag of peanuts and D'Angelo Russell is my guess.
"Wow, D'Angelo Russell only had 4 points in his NBA debut last night against the Timberwolves. Dude is going to be a bust, probably the biggest point guard draft bust in NBA history. Should have taken Okafor!"
"Kawhi, DeRozan, CP3, D'Angelo Russell. All time? Probably Manu."
D'Angelo Russell
&gt; D'Angelo Russell   &gt; perimeter creator in the half court  Lol.
Because D'Angelo Russell isn't that good and is on horrible contract that would be untradeable for another star.

"I'm sorry if this gets thrown out a lot and you guys are sick of hearing it, but would trading Simmons for D'Angelo Russell be a good trade for you guys?  I feel like that'd be a win/win for both teams."
Two Words: *D'Angelo Russell*. He puts up stats but they never amount to shit in terms of impact.
"It's not a huge indictment on anyone. So funny /r/nba gets between 1 - 8 games into a season, and types grand statements about players   No d'angelo russell is not a WNBA player who snuck into the league. No westbrook is not your 7th best player on a championship team.  People are silly."
Ironically makes the top 75 NBA players then turns into D'Angelo Russell.
"Lol and by this logic, neither Joel Embiid, D'Angelo Russell, or CJ McCollum would be in the league"
"Now that is just an exaggeration. D'angelo Russell is just as smooth with everything he does, same with Zach Lavine and SGA."

Idk about KAT. It has been his team from day one but they also had Rubio and Wiggins who were Timbs-lifers at the time. Wiggins had that one season where it looked like he was putting it all together and he back tracked after his third year. They got Butler but we all know how that went. Then they added D'Angelo Russell who is like KAT's best friend. Idk what else they could have really done other than giving up on Wiggins sooner (which wouldn't make sense at the time).
"A return I could actually see if things dont improve rapidly would be an offer around Sexton, VanVleet or D'Angelo Russell. Idk how anyone could convince their fanbase trading for him is a good thing tho."

"I agree with you, but our team really had no picks or leverage whatsoever after the Pierce/Garnett trade, it was only a miracle that we got the misfit gems like D'Angelo Russell, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, then got late guys like LeVert and Allen  As much as it pains me to say, I don't see that team being serious contenders even at all of their peaks...the Nets may have sold their soul to the devil but were *historically* bad in the early-mid 2010s"
"I guess y'all didn't see the report about Embiid being fully on board with how they're handling the situation. Morey and Embiid are tight - you think Morey would risk alienating his MVP level star player? Nah man, they're on the same page which is trying to get a championship. You have a better chance of championship with Ben Simmons than with D'Angelo Russell or Buddy hield or whoever is on the table now. Simmons value isn't going any lower, so they're waiting it out on the chance it goes up"
"Really? Because in the last 5 years, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, D'Angelo Russell, and Goran Dragic have all been All-Stars. Point guard defense is greatly overrated. Westbrook and Harden have won MVP's while playing almost no defense. Dame is considered a top 10 player while being a bad defender."

Andre Drummond &amp; D'Angelo Russell
Brogdon is the obvious pick imo he's still a great defender and playmaker. Then between cj and sexton yea I'd take sexton over McCollum just because he's younger and has potential to develop into a better playmaker. D'Angelo Russell is pretty clearly the worst option here to me
"In a way it's weird : Ben Simmons and D'Angelo Russell are basically the exact opposites as player, like almost every weakness of one is a huge strenght for the other and vice versa :  \- does this mean that they are a perfect fit ?  \- can you do anything serious with 2 guys with such huge weaknesses ?  \- can a FO really value both of those players ?"
* Tingus though could make arguments about that at the time he was signed. * Simmons though again at the time * Westbrook is questionable * Tobias Harris * Wiggins * D'Angelo Russell  While not exactly mediocre players they are in comparison to other max guys.  Like Tobias Harris is a good player but not a max guy
D'Angelo Russell isn't exactly loved on here either.
"That's the logic for bigger market too, it's not small market vs big market hype that you people love to push  Miami Heat maxed Bam Adebayo too, he isn't a max player like that, he's obviously very good but no  Brooklyn had to max D'Angelo Russell, again nope and many other examples of overpaying   Overpaying happens to every team, it depends on context but most of the time you just overpay because that's how the cap works, it has nothing to do with big market small market literally every franchise has overpaid or has had some insanely bad contracts"
"**D'Angelo ""Don't trade my ass for Ben Simmons"" Russell looked dominate in that 1st half tonight, his 1-2 with KAT (If they are healthy) is going to be beautiful to observe this season**"
"&gt; People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   You're apparently one of those people, pretending like this argument existed. This is such over the top hyperbole that I again feel like you're just doing satire here.   What happens is Laker fans get excited about their young players, just like fans of any team do with their young players (like you're doing with this post after one preseason game 😂), but the Lakers have so many haters that the pushback is overwhelming. As a result every young Laker just ends up getting memed to death, and dumb shit like ""Kuzma is better than Tatum"" which one idiot probably said once years ago becomes the narrative that all the haters cling to and run with as their justification for saying ""he's *sooo* overrated!"" and constantly trashing him.   But then literally the second these players are no longer on the Lakers, people stop just blindly hating on them due to being a Laker and realize ""hey, this player is actually pretty good, I think they've been underrated!"" when in truth the only people who were underrating him were the people who've spent his whole tenure with the Lakers mocking him endlessly just cause he was on the Lakers.   This exact same thing happened with D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram and now Kuzma. The prevailing consensus among all non Laker fans was these guys were overrated trash when they were still on the Lakers. It's just funny for Laker fans to see this happen over and over, where as soon as they take off that Laker uniform then suddenly everyone else is like ""this guy is really good, the Lakers fucked up by letting them go."" This shit is like clockwork 😂"
Sounds like D'Angelo Russell
i feel like Brogdon would be the minimum viable player to get back in a trade. other useful if not amazing players could be Derrick White or D'Angelo Russell.
"I feel like they could only accomplish this from by giving up a lot which I doubt they will or by fleecing someone. Also doubt.  - I imagine if they traded Simmons for some of the offers they have now, I reckon that needs 2 first rounders as well along with it unless named D'Angelo Russell.  - So then assuming they wanted to flip that return for Lillard (please no, Dame &amp; CJ 4 life) or Beal type, that would require those picks and more Philly 1st round picks.   That's all before whatever the Thunder would ask for. Guessing a 1st rounder as well plus a starter caliber player. Thybulle or Seth Curry or something.   The fit would probably be fine if by some magic, they pull off a trade for both a primary ball handler and Dort. If they kept Seth Curry &amp; Tobias somehow through all this, that leaves a hole at the 3 in the closing lineup for one of Danny Green, Dort &amp; Thybulle.  Ultimately do they need to? I don't think so if they kept Thybulle. Defensively, I think there's enough there to cover what they would lose in a Simmons trade anyway for whatever they can get back offensively to be worthwhile."
"You are right that the Nets as currently constructed will never win a title, but it has nothing to do with distraction. The truth is that, the Nets FO doesnt believe in durability of players, they have assembled a team of injury-prone players. Its been this way even before the arrival of big three, Levert, Dinwiddie and D'Angelo Russell were quite injury-prone if you remember. Now you look at the team's rosters: Durant is injury-prone, Irving is injury-prone, Griffin is injury-prone, Aldridge is injury-prone, and even the rookie Claxton is injury-prone. Almost half of their rosters are players made of glass.   So we keep talking about what a healthy nets team can do in NBA, without realizing that so-called 'healthy nets' will never happen. Apparently the Nets have one of the best medical facility, training staff and they take very good cautions of the players health and recovery, but injury-prone players are going down anyway. The nets circus last season ended up with a humiliating defeat in 2nd round, they blamed it on injuries and they will surely blame it on injuries again this year.   I have a friend who knows very well about maintenance, repair and care for automobiles. He always bought lemon cars at cheaper prices, and he thought that with proper maintenance and protection he can do wonder. It never worked, cars with defected parts break down anyway, he end up paying more for the parts, as well as countless of time and energy wasted on repairing these cars. Same story here, and at some point we need to admit that you cant fix players with durability issues however well you protect them."
"Aaron Mintz (agent) and the Lakers don't have a good working relationship historically.   &gt;Traded away: D'Angelo Russell, Josh Hart  &gt;Left in FA: Julius Randle, Trevor Ariza  He also represents Paul George who blue balled the Lakers in the past by saying 'do not trade for me' then saying he was disappointed that the Lakers didn't trade for him.   &gt;https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1013910550974222337?s=21  &gt;Eric Pincus: The Lakers' relationship with Aaron Mintz of CAA was not a fruitful one - poor mutual experience with D'Angelo Russell, Lakers' prioritized cap room over an extension for Randle, benched him, etc. - George didn't give Lakers a meeting. It's all connected and apparently over  &gt;"

Is D'Angelo Russell Kyrie Irving?😳
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."
I got a lot of shit 2 years ago for saying philly would probably be better off as a team downgrading from Ben Simmons to d'angelo Russell and yet here we are lol.
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."

D'Angelo Russell for First Team All-D'Angelo

"You forgot Kyrie Irving. Maybe Van Vleet.  Figured they'd consider D'Angelo Russell but seeing what Morey's asking for, D'Angelo's probably not on that list."
D'angelo Russell is a strong candidate for the PG spot.
"I think it's pretty much already reversed. Oladipo made an all star game, as has D'Angelo Russell, and Brandon Ingram. Lonzo Ball is clearly not a bust, and if he keeps improving the way he has, all star games aren't out of the question. Bagley has been shit, but hes been the first truly bad, already out of the rotation player in a few years. Morant looks great, Wiseman hasn't played nearly enough to be judged, and even Jalen Green has shown flashes of great potential.    This is assuming the curse was due to the shit run after KD (Beasley, Thabeet, Evan Turner, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, etc)."

"can you imagine a player named d'angelo russell westbrook? holy shit, records set for high volume inefficiency that would never be broken."
"Easy to have a high TS% if you just dunk.  He's Timberwolves Andrew Wiggins, only instead of being an iron man who never misses games, he sits out for tantrums.  Which means he's less valuable than a player the Warriors got paid a first round pick to take in exchange for D'Angelo Russell, and people thought the Timberwolves won the trade."
"&gt; some of you guys treat him like he's John Wall.   John Wall has actually performed.  Ben Simmons isn't a good player. He's a good one-on-one defender, he's good running in transition, and he's a liability in the half-court.  He's always been evaluated on what he *could hypothetically* be, and not what he *actually is*.  And now that's fallen apart.  Simmons is a max contract player who has not lived up to expectations.  He's a worse Timberwolves Wiggins.  But Wiggins at least played. The Warriors could look at him like ""well worst case scenario this guy will be reliable to soak up minutes when we have injury issues or whatever and D'Lo is a really bad fit here"".  TWolves paid a first round pick to offload that contract for D'Angelo Russell and at the time everyone thought they won the trade."
"For a player on a max extension who's not living up to expectations?  Wiggins brought back D'Angelo Russell, and the Timberwolves were the ones paying a pick. People still thought the TWolves won the trade and Wiggins was actually playing. Brogdon and a first is an overpay."
"&gt;  Fair value for Ben is an AS  It's really not.  He's a good one-on-one defender, is good running in transition, and a liability in the half-court.  Who won't play if you hurt his widdle feelings.  He is literally less valuable than Andrew Wiggins was when he was traded to the Warriors, and the Timberwolves paid a first round pick to trade him for D'Angelo ""technically an All Star, as a sub, in a historically weak East"" Russell - and at the time people thought they *won the trade*.  Sixers are expending a big haul for a player they should be understanding they need to pay to offload."

Currently people have realised that he's worse than Wiggins was for the Timberwolves - since Wiggins at least *played* - and people thought the TWolves won the trade paying the Warriors a first round pick to take him in exchange for D'Angelo Russell.  Sixers don't get that Simmons is currently a ""pay someone to take him off your hands""-level asset."
"&gt; Which non-playoff teams have players that the 76ers would accept for Simmons that would be reasonable in the eyes of the 76ers?  Harrison Barnes, D'Angelo Russell, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"
"Yeah, I don't think they're bluffing per se but a multi-year sage is unlikely for all involved. Every year there's *some* team willing to blow it up around the trade deadline and it only takes one partner. It just depends on who's willing to bend a little more: does a team like the Blazers up their offer to include Lillard, or do the 6ers decide they're willing to settle for a D'Angelo Russell?"

Paid $150 on a Friday night to sit at half court in the 11th row. It's amazing as an NBA fan but I wouldn't want to play for the nets if I were a star with a choice.  I went Wade's last game which was at Barclay's. Game ended and they started interviewed Russell (this was the year they made the playoffs and he was an all-star). I shit you not that whole arena started booing D'Angelo in his own arena at the end of a really fun season for a team he helped lead.
Read this quickly and was like BRO YOU GOT WESTBROOK IN THAT STARTING FIVE?! FOHHHHH  Then I realized you meant D'Angelo Russell and I calmed down.
D'Angelo Russell for 80%KD + young Kwahi? I'd say it's pretty fair
D'Angelo Russell. I'd rather have D'Angelo though.
How the fuck did we get Wiggins AND KUMINGA for D'Angelo fucking Russell
Robert Williams over D'Angelo Russell... are you on drugs? That's the most bias Celtics take I've seen in a while lmao.
"&gt; His style is a product of his era.   BS argument. No it wasn't. There were plenty of guard then who didn't play like that.   &gt;  they traded Stackhouse  Mhh and why might that be.   &gt;  During his MVP/Finals season the next highest scorer was Theo Ratliff at 12.4 ppg.  Guess why they build the team like that around him?  &gt;  If he's able to cut out some of the bad shots  You need to actually want to take less bad shots.  &gt; He'd be right around or above league average in the modern era on any decent squad. He wouldn't have the gawdy scoring numbers he had in his prime, but he could score high 20's efficiently.   Yeah and that means he is a slightly above avg guard, All-Star level player. D'Angelo Russell scored 23 at league avg efficiency.   &gt;  If, like the modern NBA, there is simply better team passing and offense, he's more efficient.  I guess they didn't have passing before 2010. Apparently the NBA was all ISO for 60 straight years. Scoring 20 at avg efficiency is not good. Specially when you suck at passing and playing defense.    &gt; If you don't think he was that good, it's because you didn't watch him play.  He was a very good player, but his MVP was insane and comparing him to elite PG in history is insane.   You yourself just made an argument that he wasn't that good, you realize that right?"

"The Warriors had 4 all-stars. Draymond was an all-star in 2017 and 2018, and he was an all-defense player in 2019.  Cousins won't be remembered as part of that team by the history books. Just like ""all-star"" D'angelo Russell won't be remembered as part of the superteam Warriors of 2020."
In another timeline D'Angelo Russell is still the Lakers point guard
"Would Indiana consider a package built around DLo for Myles Turner? Could look something like:  **Minnesota trades:** D'Angelo Russell, Jaden McDaniels and 2024 FRP.  **Indiana trades:** Myles Turner, TJ McConnell and Jeremy Lamb.  It gives Minnesota their stretch 5 and a point guard who will simply *facilitate*, while allowing Indiana to move Brogdon to the 2 and have a pure PG in DLo. Also gives them a solid option at the 4 next to Sabonis in McDaniels.  **Minnesota:** McConnell/Beverley, Beasley, Edwards, KAT, Turner with Beverley/McConnell, Lamb, Okogie, Vando and Reid off the bench.  **Indiana:** DLo, Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis with Duarte, Holiday, Craig, McDaniels and Goga off the bench."
"Yep, he's always been bad at driving. In that respect he's the same as D'angelo Russell. You watch them and think ""huh, he's a great passer, good shooter, good ballhandler...what's missing here?"" then you realize they literally never shoot freethrows and have zero inside-out game."
"Man, remember when we Ws fans were trying to talk ourselves into D'Angelo Russell?"
"Man, remember when we Ws fans were trying to talk ourselves into D'Angelo Russell?"
what about Kenny Atkinson?  I loved the job he did on the nets with D'Angelo Russell and they always seemed to play hard for him.  he has a reputation as a player development coach so he may be good for a young team.  I still think new orleans should have gone after him instead of stan van gundy
I'd rather have Wiggins than:  John Wall  Russell Westbrook  Tobias Harris  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday  Kristaps Porzingis  D'Angelo Russell  Gordon Hayward  List goes on
"I calmed down about this sub a bit when someone posted ""D'Lo Russell used my school's bathroom!"" and the user had posted a pic of D'Angelo peeing and the user and his friends were all in the foreground looking 10 years old.  This sub is children.  90% of it is kids or people with a kids mind and emotional depth.  You should look at coming into this sub like walking into a full daycare center.  You wouldn't walk around a daycare all angry like ""Ugh you kids are so dumb!  You don't have any nuanced NBA takes!"" Just get into the mindet of entering a grade school and this sub becomes almost adorable."

"&gt; D'Angelo Russell, Kat, and Malik Beasley   These 3 guys are the furthest thing from the problem with the roster, but yeah, the roster sucks.   We're giving like 80 minutes a game to guys who have no business being on an NBA court."
"Wolves fans can't accept it's a roster issue.  It'd actually take great effort to put together a more one dimensional roster.  ""All they do is shoot threes!"" As if having D'Angelo Russell, Kat, and Malik Beasley slashing majestically to the rim was an option and only hasn't occurred yet due to a lack of coaching foresight by Chris Finch."
This is all because D'Angelo Russell thought he could do a Curry layup
Naz Reid catching strays and I won't stand for it! Thanks for having his back. D'angelo Russell is poop though. Jaden McDaniels is a project.
"There's been some speculation on the Lakers sub that agent Aaron Mintz hates our front office for how we treated D'Angelo Russell and Julius Randle and that was a factor in another one of his clients, Paul George, not even speaking with us during his free agency."
"Collin Sexton, Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, and Malcom Brogdon. I'm sure other discussions have occurred. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean no discussions have been taking place."
"I am not questioning Ayton's talent. He's great. However, I can't think of a single Restricted Free Agent that got a max offer sheet that got matched by their original team.  D'Angelo Russell got a sign and trade but other than that I can't recall an RFA that got a max offer sheet.  Now, maybe Ayton is good enough that it wont matter but I'd be surprised."
"Garland is D'Angelo Russell/Jeff Teague level of player.  They're good players you don't feel like you need to replace but also don't expect to be the #1 or #2 option on a championship team.  Sexton is more of a Booker/Beal/Lavine type of player where they can carry the load offensively and is necessary for any team that doesn't  multiple offensive threats like the old Spurs.  Give Sexton 5/100, give Garland the same, Okoro will get about 5/60 unless his offensive game develops and the Cavs just need an additional good depth combo guard and combo forward to be set."

"The shenanigans that the Warriors did around Durant's departure and D'Angelo Russell are some of the most impressive GMing I've seen.   They could have lost Durant for nothing. Somehow they turned a top-20 protected 2026 draft pick (sent to the Nets), a top-four protected 2024 draft pick (sent to Memphis) into Wiggins and Kuminga. (It also cost them Iguodala, but 2020 was the last year of his contract and he was of zero value to that team).   Wiggins is overpaid, but they couldn't have afforded him even on a reasonable, appropriate salary for him.   Yeah, they have Lacob's money to spend - but finding a way to actually spend that much of it and get players they like is actually very impressive. Without the D'Lo shenanigans the Warriors have the exact same roster right now minus Kuminga and Wiggins, and only the MLE and the minimum to try to replace them."
D'Angelo Russell. I feel like he has stagnated for a couple of years now.
It was Malik Beasley and pat bev? LMAO I DID NOT KNOW THAT  I thought one of D'Angelo Russell or Ant was included hahaha omfg lol wow
D'Angelo Russell.
Marcus Smart  D'Angelo Russell
