Yeah D.j Wilson
D.J. Wilson shooting form is hilarious.
"My original assessment of who we wouldn't be able to sign was actually more optimistic than reality.  Because instead of having both the larger non-taxpayer MLE (used to sign both Forbes and Augustine) and the Bi-annual Exception (used to sign Portis), we'd only have the smaller taxpayer MLE, and no bi-annual exception.  Meaning we'd likely only end up signing someone like Augustin, considering at that point we wouldn't really have a true PG on the roster, and no playmaker/ball-handler on the bench at all.  So you'd rather have Bogdan + Augustin, instead of Donte + Portis + Forbes + Augustine?  Rolling into the season with D.J. Wilson (or someone potentially even worse on a vet min) as our primary backup big to both Giannis and Brook?  (And with even less flexibility for the future than we have right now?)  Because that's the actual choice, not just Bogdan vs. Donte.  I'd say that would be pretty terrible."

Giannis and who?   Brogdon literally was favor to his agent. They had no intention of drafting him. They didn't care about the 46 pick so they just used if for a favor for an agent. One reason Brogdon was never really happy with the organization and wanted to leave.  Norman powell not our pick. kevin porter jr. also not our pick.  Thon Maker major miss. Rashad Vaughn miss. D.J. Wilson miss. Jabari Parker major miss.   Donte was a solid pick at 17.  Our contracts in the early Giannis area were more terrible however.
We needed to give up D.J. Wilson to get the nice freckles from P.J. though; had to be done. Definitely not behind Houston though; Houston is very middle-of-the-road imo.
"If they still had D.J. Wilson, no other team would even come close in looks. Unfortunately the Bucks are behind Houston now."
"A bunch of Michigan guys have been rocking the short shorts for a while, starting with D.J. Wilson I think. From a [2016 MLive.com story](https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2016/11/dj_wilson_and_his_short_shorts.html):    ‚ÄúDuring a recent meeting with the ‚ÄòMaize Rage,‚Äô Michigan basketball's student section, head coach John Beilein opened things up for questions.  The first response?  What's up with D.J. Wilson's shorts?  ‚ÄòThere were 100 of them there, and I said ‚Äúany questions?‚Äù And it was ‚Äúwhat about D.J.'s shorts, they're awfully short?‚Äù‚Äô Beilein said with a laugh. ‚ÄòA young co-ed asked me and I said I didn't have an answer. I'll have to get back to them.‚Äô‚Äù    I‚Äôm pretty sure Poole has been rocking the short-shorts since high school, so I‚Äôm not suggesting that he was following Wilson‚Äôs lead, but it‚Äôs been a bit of a trend at Michigan (the irony of this, given the Fab Five‚Äôs influence on the long-shorts trend, has not gone unnoticed)."
"lmao you couldn't even enjoy the championship before a month before getting all sour lmfao.  there was zero chance you would have been able to trade for jrue if you weren't seen as contenders. he picked his spot just like everyone else did.  &gt; D.J. Augustin, forward D.J. Wilson, and the Bucks first round pick in 2023  WOW THE FUCKING HOUSE"
"in what world are they useless? Donte DiVincenzo was the starting shooting guard for the championship Bucks for the entire season, NAW is probably about to start for the Pels and has been playing well, and Poku was intentionally taken as a low floor/high upside flyer.  D.J. Wilson isn't great but so what? You're not proving anything."
"Why even try then? Pelicans pick 17th in the 1st round this year. The last 4 guys picked 17th are:  Aleksej Pokusevski, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Donte DiVincenzo, D.J. Wilson  Most of those guys are worthless, and none of them move the needle much. So let's sell the 17th pick for no assets in return, too."
"This is irrelevant to your comment, but I looked Pj up to see his career tenure and all the teams he‚Äôs been on. For the trade to Milwaukee P.J. was traded for D.J. Augustin and D.J. Wilson.   PJ for DJ and DJ, heh‚Ä¶üòè"

"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough‚Ä¶ seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I‚Äôd say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he‚Äôs already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
