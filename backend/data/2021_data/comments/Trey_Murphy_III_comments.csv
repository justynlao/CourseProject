Trey Murphy III is going to eat this year off Zion and BI drives
"Trey Murphy III, I saw Pels fans referring to him that way."
"Trey Murphy III  The Pelicans have needed wing defense and 3 point shooting around BI/Zion and he seems to potentially be able to offer both in spades, so he could be a massive addition."
Right now Trey Murphy iii. He has really high ball iq. I think in a couple years he could be a khris middleton type
"Trey Murphy III is looking like the potential steal of the draft to me and has a real chance to develop into a more dominant player than anyone I’ve seen listed here given his height, length, shooting ability and overall IQ."
"I’m taking Trey Murphy III (ignore flair, irrelevant)"
"Trying to get some karma from the anti-Pelicans circle jerk? I won't be surprised if they sign Reggie Jackson or Schroeder, but even if not their offseason hasn't been terrible. They messed up with the Adams and Bledsoe moves last year but managed to unload them and bring back Valanciunas which was a pretty solid deal. Nickeil Alexander Walker and Kira Lewis are guards with potential who could play more minutes, and Graham is a solid bench scorer. Satoransky is a decent distributor and gives them some height on the perimeter. It's yet to be determined if Lonzo is worth 21 mil so we'll have to wait and see, but they have a pretty solid young core, and drafted Trey Murphy III who is a smart player with a lot of upside."
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"
Been calling Trey Murphy III trey-trey since he was drafted

"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"&gt;I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schröder and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.  So, the ""SnT Schoeder for Lonzo and fill out with good vets"" method, ala the 2020 run.  Do you think Pelicans accept that offer?"
"I don’t want Russ bc that means no depth. He isn’t bad, he’s just a bad fit for the Lakers since Lakers need 3PT shooting.   I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schröder and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.   Best possible scenario I can think of.  Lonzo KCP LeBron AD Dieng during regular season.   Lonzo KCP THT LeBron AD during playoffs if THT makes a huge leap."
The Best wings out of this draft will be Trey Murphy III and Jalen Johnson.
Grizz traded JV for Adams and effectively to move from 17 (Trey Murphy III) to 10 (Zaire Williams).   The Lakers first was the compensation for taking on Eric Bledsoe and allowing the Pelicans to take the trade exception for Adams salary.
"Except they also traded Trey Murphy III, their own 1st rounder. It was a trade to move up in the draft."
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
Yo shoutout to Trey Murphy III that guy is a legit shooter
Trey Murphy III for pelicans
Trey Murphy III?
"I’m down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric “The Actual Devil” Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn’t land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can’t fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn’t even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We’re also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we’re better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
At least the Pelicans have Trey Murphy III?
"Huh? Tr**e**y Murphy III is a rookie. The number 17 pick over the summer.    I also read Troy at first, but pretty sure it is Trey."
"If Trey Murphy III wins rookie of the year, things have gone wild. The Pelicans are good without Zion. Cade is terrible."

Trey Murphy III aka TM3 aka Swords Dance aka Steal of the Draft. Remember the name now fellas.
"Our team is a lot better now though. We added more scoring threats with Graham and rookie Trey Murphy III. NAW, Hayes, and Naji Marshall will take a big leap this year. Plus we have a coach players want to play hard for….not to mention Mike D’antoni as a offensive consultant. This whole squad will surprise the casuals."

"Trey Murphy III. Big, sweet-shooting wing with defensive upside. Played 3 years in college (older prospect).  Will likely take Jalen Johnson if he falls to 17.  Will trade up to get Kispert/ Moody if available at 10 or 14 if either the Pels are desperate to dump the Bledsoe contract or the Warriors are looking to reduce the luxury tax impact."
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."
