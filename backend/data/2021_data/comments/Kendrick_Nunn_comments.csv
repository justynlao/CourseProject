"Yes because the rockets only wanted Herro for mvp winner James Harden ü§°ü§° you're a casual  [The Rockets asking price from Miami for James Harden included Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, two first-round picks, and 4 pick swaps.](https://twitter.com/LegionHoops/status/1349806703513100292)"
Kendrick Nunn or Michael Beasley
"‚Äú The Heat also didn't play Kendrick Nunn on Saturday because he was awaiting a COVID-19 test result when the game started. Nunn was cleared by the second quarter and could have played, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra elected to not use him.  ""We were waiting for his test results,"" Spoelstra said, as quoted by the South Florida Sun Sentinel. ""At that point he wasn't available in the first quarter, so I went a different direction. ... It's just one of those unfortunate things. I guess if those type of things are going to happen, it'll happen to us."""
Kendrick Nunn was clutch last season too

"They were a playoff team 2 years ago led by D'Angelo Russel, Harris, Lavert, Dinwiddie, etc. Lavert and Jarret Allen were homegrown, Harris and Dinwiddie were good pickups/developments. Your organization sucks, that doesn't obligate other organizations to suck too. Where are the players the Kings have been developing for the last few years? Not Fox, I mean projects or mid-tier expectation type players that make significant strides. The Timberwolves too. That's what the garbage franchises really have in common, they only have one pipeline of talent, lottery picks. Garbage franchises are incapable of scouring the undrafted talent pool to find gems like Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn, or make smart prospect acquisitions that they can then mold, or draft a good project in the 2nd round that takes a couple of years to develop but then turns into a role-player-caliber starter like Josh Richardson. Don't worry about how amazing Miami is to live in, worry about why the Kings suck at drafting and scouting and developing players and choosing coaches. People like you cry about how the supermax shouldnt count against the cap and how the league should do all these things to help small market teams. No amount of CBA manipulation will ever help trash franchises because those teams will never overcome themselves."
"Kendrick Nunn , he‚Äôs proving he has starting capability in a town he‚Äôll never start in , is take him in Cleveland and split the 1 duty‚Äôs between him and Garland . Probably even start Nunn even tho the min split would be fairly even . Collin gets to stay roaming the 2 ."
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3.

Kendrick nunn. Fell out of the rotation but has been ballin since Covid hit their team.
Undrafted talent looks solid now. Kendrick Nunn seens Clean too
A vintage 2019 Kendrick Nunn
"Yea man, it‚Äôs been tough to watch. He‚Äôll get back to it tho. If fucking Kendrick Nunn can get his groove back literally anyone can. Also, tonight was a great start"
must be weird when the Raptors get Maple-Dicked  Also Kendrick Nunn had a great night
"12 of our 19 4th quarter points were scored in garbage time late in the quarter, Miami always defends us well but holy fucking shit our offence is horrid.   Also, I was told Kendrick Nunn was playing like shit this year, I demand an apology for being lied to."
GG Raps.  Witness the beginning of the Kendrick Nunn redemption arc
Kendrick Nunn resurgence?
Hope Kendrick Nunn plays the whole game
"&gt;‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs been effectively our point guard all year long,‚Äù Spoelstra said ahead of Saturday night‚Äôs Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics at Disney‚Äôs Wide World of Sports complex.  &gt;Although Kendrick Nunn had been cast as the Heat starting point guard during the regular season before giving way to Goran Dragic in the opening lineup in the playoffs, Spoelstra said Butler long has been a de facto floor leader.  [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-miami-heat-notebook-saturday-20200919-2lpyg53vg5cpjcx26bmuhnapwq-story.html%3foutputType=amp)  Rose was injured a lot, yes, but Jimmy Butler wanted control and felt the team was just waiting on Rose rather than moving forward. It was heavily reported about Jimmy butting heads with the older guys on the team due to their loyalty to Rose. Not soon after, Rose was traded.   He most definitely wanted to be the ball handler in Philly.  &gt;Butler admitted to asking Brown to handle the ball more often, but he said he felt it was a mistake to make such a drastic switch:  &gt;""To this day, I don't think that that was fair, to switch over like that. Even though I think we played great basketball like that, I don't think it was fair, because the entire year, Ben had the ball, the entire year, Ben had the ball, so you mean to tell me that in one playoff series you just switch it up like that?

He has said so multiple times."
What this doesn‚Äôt show is the tons of possessions we put Kendrick Nunn on Blake as the primary defender.  Blake had a Pg posted up under the rim and passed out every single time. Was pretty damn sad
"&gt;even without Hayward the C‚Äôs were a really good   Kemba was playing with an injured knee the entire playoffs. So no Hayward and Kemba producing well below his average is not the same as beating a ""healthy"" Celtics.   &gt;and the Bucks only didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like themselves‚Äù   I mean you can look at them play during the bubble and the 8 games before the playoffs started and compare that to how they were playing before the NBA stopped playing. Tell me its the same team.  &gt;And acting like falling short of beating the Lakers when you‚Äôre forced to give Kendrick fucking Nunn and Meyers Leonard minutes instead of Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo.  I really doubt they would have advanced against the Clippers or Nuggets either.   I'm not saying the Heat are a bad team but they overachieved and got the most benefit from the bubble situation."
"What the fuck is a ‚Äúreal‚Äù opponent? Get the fuck out with this trash, even without Hayward the C‚Äôs were a really good team, and the Bucks only didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like themselves‚Äù because the Heat outplayed them so badly without any major injuries for all of the games that mattered. And acting like falling short of beating the Lakers when you‚Äôre forced to give Kendrick fucking Nunn and Meyers Leonard minutes instead of Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo."
there was a moment in the first half of this game were kendrick nunn was the primary defender for 5 straight possessions and blake wasn't able to do jackshit about it. it's incredibly sad to watch just a steep decline man.
"Boucher, Kendrick Nunn and Danuel House were on the roster at one point in 2018.  Just a bad year for the front office."
"I would gladly offer them the ‚Äúmultiple rookie of the month winner‚Äù Kendrick Nunn, and the GOAT (at call of duty) Meyers Leonard"
Nice to see a good game from Kendrick Nunn. He‚Äôs been used sparingly so far this season
keeping kendrick nunn and terence davis on their teams
Lol Kendrick Nunn is currently on the team
Does Kendrick Nunn have enough potential to even qualify for this? If so then it‚Äôs him and it‚Äôs not really that close. Horrific defender who‚Äôs been out of his groove offensively for longer than he was ever in it to begin with.
Because he‚Äôs their best young asset outside of Bam. Unless you turn trade override on and give them Kendrick Nunn for Brad Beal.
"We can do a Sign and trade featuring Meyers Leonard, Andre Igoudala and Kendrick Nunn"
I think Miami would rather let Vic walk then pay him a max. As he's playing right now he's probably a 20M/year player. I don't think he has any leverage either.  If Miami does trade for Vic it'll probably be for pennies on the dollar; just dicking around in the trade machine it'd be Olynyk + Leonard for salary match (both have team options next year that can be declined - sheds more money than Vic's contract alone) and Kendrick Nunn.
"We thought Kendrick Nunn was the clear cut ROTY at this point last season, let's give it some time."
"Miami is losing by over 30 points per 100 with Kendrick Nunn out there.   This trade was basically Robinson/Precious(WHICH IS NOTHING COMPARED TO HARDEN), and trash plus a couple picks for harden.   This was such a no-brainer it‚Äôs insane.  Harden is a complete monster. Fuck all the nonsense this guy may as well be Kobe, Durant, Curry, Kawhi.  ANY wing the past 20 years other than LeBron, Harden is at least right there with. And they turn him down for... I genuinely DONT even know why. I don‚Äôt know if it was the Berro part, or they‚Äôre insanely high on Precious. Robinson and Nunn are 25 and 26 with limited talent. This is insane.   People are gonna look back on this for years to come baffled at how he was low-balled as a player. Despite his personal issues."
If you don‚Äôt think Miami could win a title with that roster then you are just wasting your time with the current roster because the current roster is nowhere near the title threat that roster would be   The depth concerns are foolish Bam/Butler/Harden/Dragic/Avery bradley/Harkless/Iguodala and someone you can get from the buyout market which would be possible for Miami if they did this trade is plenty when your big 3 is bam Butler and harden. Again this is a 2 for 1 swap basically guys like kelly olynyk and Kendrick Nunn don‚Äôt move the needle at all vs the top competition. It‚Äôs not actually hurting playoff depth a whole lot and all the ‚Äúspacing‚Äù concerns don‚Äôt matter nearly as much when you have generational talent like James harden that‚Äôs why you acquire generational talent in the first place. He himself demands double and even triple teams
Please no we‚Äôre so scarce on solid bigs already. I‚Äôm cool w one of kelly or precious going not both and maybe throw in Avery Bradley or Kendrick nunn
Heat be like: Best I can do is Kendrick Nunn.
Interesting that Kendrick Nunn is out for Covid contract tracing because he was late to the bubble because of a positive test.
"If it makes you feel better, when we play you tomorrow we are gonna be without Bam, Jimmy, Goran, Avery Bradley, Kendrick Nunn, KZ Okpala, Mo Harkless, and Haslem.  Battle of the decimated.  Our game on thursday with y‚Äôall is on TNT üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"Lol I‚Äôll root for you guys to lose still. But this is really fucked up, I think the nba needs to pause for a minute, redo the protocols, make this safer and that olympics deadline be damned, we gotta be able to postpone games more willingly. I love how they‚Äôre willing to put bad products on the floor instead of wait.  Like, would we rather watch the Celtics led by Carsen Edwards and Tacko Fall facing off against the Heat led by Kendrick Nunn? Postpone so we can see the players we want to see. This isn‚Äôt football, if a star player goes out, the team is fucking cooked 7/10 times."
"Kendrick Nunn, Mo Harkless, Meyers Leonard  I‚Äôll ship the three stooges overnight!"
"I‚Äôd say maybe someone like Kendrick Nunn who threw boiling water over his girlfriend, opposed to a guy who plays basketball in a controversial way"
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
talk about where Kendrick Nunn has been and it's been different with the off-season moves
"Oh it's the Pascal slander. He's been playing much better recently. I've definitely noticed. Losing all your center depth to the LA teams really crippled you guys, but at least Boucher is a monster rim protector. Idk why we sign these guys and then release them, same w/ Kendrick Nunn."
"They lost Gasol AND Ibaka. Meanwhile, those two have become the primary centers for both LA teams. Boucher has stepped up impressively (still mad we let him walk away from SeaDubs without a contract, along with Devonte Graham and Kendrick Nunn), but their only true center Aron Baynes understandably pails in comparison this far.  The reason Wiseman only played like 10 minutes is because the Raptors didn‚Äôt play an actual center the entire second half.  EDIT: they also gave Alex Len, both he and Baynes received a DNP-CD ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Ah, the Kendrick Nunn special."
"We've gotten rid of a *lot* of G League / 2-way talent that went on to have great careers. Boucher is just the most recent in that line. Morrow, Tolliver, Dedmon, Watson spring to mind. Hell, Seth Curry was a G League call-up with us originally. Also, Damion Lee was called up from our G League affiliate, but by the Hawks. Same with Kendrick Nunn to the Heat."
Kendrick Nunn has to be on the list.
We'll give you back Kendrick Nunn since you missed out on him. Throw in the Maple Dick too to match salaries.
"So nobody else in the bubble was tired? And Jimmy did all the work despite the fact that he wasn't the lead scorer leading up to the finals, Goran was. Not to mention Jae Crowder, Iggy, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn. Not what I would call hero ball"

Kendrick Nunn too
"Raptors v Warriors went to 6 games....Heat v Boston went to 6 games but series wasn't nearly as close....cause reasons? The games were closer yes but Boston didn't suffer any highly critical injuries either, certainly not at the level of Klay and KD.   Dragic was always that type of player...him starting off the bench is a combination of developing young players, his age and getting a scoring punch off the bench. It has no bearing on his skills as a player. Tyler Herro, is a rookie so yeah i'll give you that but they also lost Kendrick Nunn who dropped off of a cliff due to covid after being a runner up for ROY so it balances out.   Anyways we don't have much more to say, we're never going to agree so lets just leave it at that."
"The crazy thing is that they also have other valuable players like Kendrick nunn, who I expect to get there by the end of the season, precious achiuwa, who looks like a promising young defender, Andre iguodala, who provides veteran leadership, defense, and shooting, Myers Leonard, a strong center who can shoot threes, and mo harkless, who is a solid 3 and d player. This is after losing derick Jones jr, Jae crowder, and Solomon hill in free agency. If they were able to bring those guys back they would be 15 men deep."
Kendrick Nunn
Kendrick Nunn and filler
"Boy, Kendrick Nunn made those 6 minutes count in garbage time.   He‚Äôs been **buried** in the depth chart this year"
"Boy, Kendrick Nunn made those 6 minutes count in garbage time.   He‚Äôs been buried in the depth chart this year"
"Kendrick Nunn last season had similar issue, but he was a rookie so that might be less significant."
"Just anecdotal evidence here, but Kendrick Nunn has not remotely looked like himself on the floor since he got it."
You really think Toronto is giving up Lowry for Kendrick Nunn?
"In Miami‚Äôs situation, trade Kendrick Nunn for Kyle Lowry. No trading draft picks nor bigs for an expiring contract. Matching his contract would be less of a concern because it‚Äôs his final contractual season. Like Jae Crowder, he‚Äôll be used in the playoffs before becoming a free agent.  Regarding age, Iguodala was a beast at 36 in the ECF. The point in adding Lowry to the Heat roster would be to compensate for Dragic in case of injury, actually adding depth."
"*The Miami Heat are interested in acquiring 5x All Star and Pacers legend Reggie Miller. Willing to offer Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn and a 2026 2nd round pick.*"
Yeah I'd still for sure give all that up tbh. Not saying it's a small price but if Herro is the best thing you're giving up in a trade for James Harden you just gotta do it and figure out the fallout after. Besides if there's any coach who can turn some fringe rotation guy into the next Duncan Robinson or Kendrick Nunn it's Spo. Not to mention the guys you'd get on the buyout market looking to ringchase. I think you'd reload your depth a lot quicker than you think.
"Did you say what they were asking for harden though? Apparently they wanted:  Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson Precious Achiuwa Kendrick Nunn Salary Filler Two 1st-Round Picks 4 Pick Swaps  Bam-harden-butler would be awesome, but there‚Äôs no way they win a chip with just that and then literally scraps. so if we don‚Äôt win a chip, what‚Äôs the point of going all in?"
Where are Kendrick Nunn and Avery Bradley now? Hmmm. Where‚Äôs Jabari Bird?
Kendrick Nunn has been way better than Herro for us this year
Kendrick Nunn has been better than Herro
"It is a team option pretty much. He's a restricted free agent this offseason.   &gt;Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn are in the position Bam almost was. They, too, will be restricted free agents, but their situations are even more complex. As undrafted free agents, their cap holds could be as low as $2.1 million. However, if either reaches the ""starter criteria"" for a restricted free agent, that hold gets bumped up to around $4.7 million. To hit that criteria, a players needs to start at least 41 games or play at least 2,000 minutes next season, or average those totals over last season and next season combined. These figures will presumably be tweaked for the sake of back-to-back shortened seasons, but the basic idea remains the same: the Heat are technically incentivized to play Robinson and Nunn less for the sake of limiting their cap holds. Robinson appears a near-lock to hit the starter criteria, though, while Nunn's situation is less certain.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/why-bam-adebayos-extension-makes-it-harder-for-heat-to-sign-giannis-antetokoumpo-and-why-they-did-it-anyway/"
"By what metric? Points? Kendrick Nunn is playing similar minutes and scoring only slightly less on much higher efficiency while also being a 3rd option most of the time on a lot lower usage. Defensively he's better than Nunn, but other than that he's just a really inefficient scorer who wants the ball a lot."
"I wouldn't be surprised if Miami tries to trade for him for pennies on the dollar - throw some expirings/team options and Kendrick Nunn their way.  That being said - how about this trade idea?  Miami gets: Oladipo, PJ Tucker, Kurucs  Houston gets: Iggy, Leonard, some sort of asset (i.e. Precious or Nunn most likely)"
"Heat/Rockets trade idea:  Heat get: Victor Oladipo, PJ Tucker, Roddy Kurucs  Rockets get: Olynyk, Leonard, Precious, Avery Bradley  Heat have limited upside to improve their roster and I think one of the only ways they can make something happen is taking a gamble on Victor Oladipo (who has made it apparent that he wants to be in Miami).  So the Heat leverage that desire to get him for pennies on the dollar essentially - Olynyk is an expiring and Leonard has a team option for next season. On top of that, the Heat look to boost their depth at the 4 with PJ and taking another gamble on Roddy Kurucs.  Precious is the true asset that the Rockets get back. This trade may gut the center depth on the Heat too much and they may look to replace Precious with someone like Kendrick Nunn but I figured he has less value as a RFA. Thoughts?"
" A 2nd, Kendrick Nunn, and Meyers Leonard technically satisfies the condition  (Not saying the offer will be that low but proving a point that picks/young players/vets could mean literally anything)"
"Yeah their consistency is a bit off. Tyler's okay, but Duncan's just returned from a long slump. How bout Kendrick Nunn though, the dude is playing stellar defense all of a sudden."
Any sensible Heat fan will actually know how he is. Dude has high highs and low lows.  There is a reason Kendrick fucking Nunn was in the convo for ROTY more than him last year lmao.
"The Klay injury I don‚Äôt hold against them. But... 2 wasted roster spots on Jones and Evans, Jerebko turning out to be somebody Kerr won‚Äôt play in the Finals, choosing McKinnie over Kendrick Nunn and Danuel House when the only thing McKinnie did at an above average level was crash the offensive glass... just a total failure to not have even one playable wing outside of the starters and Andre. Livingston was pretty bad at the end of the run too and as a non-shooter had to be used as a quasi center in the triangle sets to mitigate his bad spacing."
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"

Kendrick Nunn playing well seems to be a good omen...
I wouldn‚Äôt even trade Kendrick Nunn for this Kembert
He's right up there with Kendrick Nunn and Marvin Bagley as the best players in the league
Kendrick ‚ÄúBack to Back to Back Rookie of the Month‚Äù Nunn
is LeBron Kendrick Nunn? üò§
"Kendrick ""Multiple Rookie of the Month Winner"" Nunn!"
wow! kendrick nunn sure is domestically abusing the lakers!
Fuck Kendrick Nunn
Kendrick Nunn literally stepped in Bam's foot. You could see it clearly in the replay.
Where has this Kendrick Nunn been in my life.
"Gary Trent, every player with a last name Jackson, Kendrick Williams, TLC and now add Kendrick nunn to the list of 100% shooters against the lakers"
Lmfao Kendrick Nunn is going to turn into a fucking all star against us then go back to being mediocre like he has all year.
My boy Kendrick Nunn coming through
damn this thing is like the woman beater superbowl. in the past we have  legends like lance stephenson and demarcus cousins and now carrying their torch is  avery bradley and kendrick nunn
Perhaps Kendrick Nunn can be one. Shane Larkin is a superstar for Euroleague's best Anadolu Efes
"You could also make an undrafted team from that draft of Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Kenrich Williams, Jae'Sean Tate and one of Yuta/McLaughlin/Gabriel."
Kendrick Nunn is not worth a lottery pick
" Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, Salary Filler, Two 1st-Round Picks, 4 Pick Swaps For Harden for two years."
I just realised they were playing Miami. Was this a reference to Kendrick Nunn that I totally missed?
No there was a report of Houstons asking price from the Heat  - Tyler Herro - Duncan Robinson - Precious Achiuwa - Kendrick Nunn - Salary Filler - Two 1st-Round Picks - 4 Pick Swaps
"Who knows. Goran Dragic has been hurt recently and Jimmy's coming off COVID but doesn't look that bad. I think the bigger issue is they're putting a ton of pressure on Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to produce on both ends and maybe they're just not ready to be so important to a competitive team's starting 5?  When you're depending on Kendrick Nunn, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to perform well, you gotta kinda accept the inconsistently that comes with it."
Kendrick Nunn blew a game-winner after Kent Bazemore went supernova.
Spoelstra said Kendrick Nunn is gonna guard Curry alone lmao
How you going to put Kendrick Nunn on the greatest shooter of all time
Kendrick Nunn is getting in his bag
Terance Mann Marcus Morris Sr.  Serge Ibaka Reggie Jackson Lou Williams  Jimmy Butler Kelly Olynyk Bam Adebayo Duncan Robinson Kendrick Nunn   Starting lineups   Lmao

Garbage time Kendrick Nunn is a top 10 player in the NBA
Kendrick Nunn is so frustrating to watch i wonder why Miami's fans likes him
Do you really get to protect 8 players? That seems crazy tough on an expansion team in a star driven sport like basketball. Who even is the best 9th best player in the league that they can get. Like fucking Kendrick Nunn or someone?
[Kendrick Nunn](https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/charles-dion-mcdowell.jpg)
"All,kinds of heart.  His high school team was ridiculous.  They had Javon Carter and Paris Lee (MVC player of the year a few years ago). They pressed after missed baskets.   Paris Lee averaged 6 steals a game.   Carter wasn‚Äôt far behind.   They played Jabari, Kendrick Nunn, kendall Pollard (dayton top 25 team best player) and Tate (illinois starting point guard), and some other D1 player that is slipping my mind.  Came down to the buzzer between to undefeated teams.   Proviso had beaten Fred vanVleets team in the semis by 10.   VanVleet was the tallest player on his team.  Probably my favorite two days of basketball as a spectator in my life."
Was it him or CWebb who called Kendrick Nunn In the first quarter Chris Dunn? Then he later said Nunn had three threes when it was actually Duncan Robinson.
Kendrick Nunn is a Gleague player in an Nba game
"&gt; giving guys  Kendrick Nunn, hes shoot like Russ lmao"
Kendrick Nunn alone losing this Heats 1st quarter bro
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They‚Äôll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn‚Äôt fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they‚Äôve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won‚Äôt be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"It depends on what Toronto is asking for. Even though Lowry's contract is expiring, the Heat are likely looking for his bird rights. So Toronto might leverage those rights for a young prospect: ~~Tyler Herro~~, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson, or Kendrick Nunn.  Also, the Heat likely include some combination of Iguodala ($15m), Olynyk ($12m), and Leonard ($9.7m) to match salaries for Lowry ($30)."
"Kendrick Nunn, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson, and a 2nd round pick."
"Michael Carter-Williams actually WON a ROY, maybe the Raps should trade for him?  I think the problem is that you hold an opinion of Kendrick Nunn that is not shared by the Miami Heat organization nor any other NBA team."
Kendrick Nunn will cheer you up
"&gt;  and the guy who brought you luminaries like Alen Smailagic.  Kirk Lacob also signed the following players to the Santa Cruz warriors: Seth Curry, Bazemore, Dewayne Dedmon, Kendrick Nunn, Danuel House  Kirk also pushed the league to adopt two way contracts."
"you mean kendrick ""woman beater"" nunn and duncan ""wanna get paid 20 mil to be a spot-up shooter"" robinson? yea, might as well keep lowry and/or try to do a sign and trade in the offseason."
Wow it‚Äôs almost like what Kendrick nunn did
It‚Äôs both fuck Kendrick nunn he‚Äôs a piece of shit
Kendrick nunn did shit like this too?
Kendrick Nunn. Ball stopping domestic abuser.
Kendrick nunn should be out of the league too then!
Kendrick Nunn type BEAT
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
"That one, and Kendrick Nunn both sting the most. Can you imagine what a world of difference that would make?   A rim protecting, floor-stretching big and a guard who can score &amp; facilitate off the bench are the two biggest needs that this Warriors team has right now, and they had the chance at Boucher and Nunn who could be filling both those roles right now.. sad. Very sad."
And he looked like a poor man Kendrick Nunn out there.
"Pat Riley was great at team building. Heat wasn‚Äôt that good until he arrived. Traded for zo, hardaway, thunder Dan. Had pj brown and mashburn. Good teams but they ran into the bulls and the knicks.   Zo got sick. So there was a down year or two. Drafted Caron butler in 2002. signed Lamar Odom, eddie Jones was already on the team, had a decent center in grant and then drafted wade. Wade turned into an all time player but took Miami to the eastern conference semi finals in rookie year while leading them in scoring losing to the number 1 seed Indiana Pacers in 6 games.   2004-2005 - traded for Shaq who was not in his prime but could still drop 22-23. Went to the conference finals but lost when wade got injured.   2006 - signed Gary Payton, brought back zo, signed Jason Williams, Antoine walker and won an improbable championship.   Signed Hassan Whiteside (he used to be good before the contract).  Found Duncan Robinson. Found Kendrick nunn. Drafted bam who is an all star.   Pat Riley has done a good job through it all.   6 finals appearances. 3 rings."
RJ isn‚Äôt even better than Kendrick Nunn I‚Äôm sorry
Herro has been struggling. Kendrick Nunn and Dragic regressing is the biggest thing though. Way too much pressure on Jimmy and Bam. The rest of the cast is mediocre or even bad
How didn‚Äôt they even swing Kendrick Nunn. At the very fucking least
Think that was Kendrick Nunn
"Precious, 2027 Miami pick, salary filler, and Kendrick Nunn.   But as Daryl Morey said, Masai was in La La Land."
This is the package yeah?  * Tyler Herro * Duncan Robinson * Precious Achiuwa * Kendrick Nunn * Salary Filler * Two 1st-Round Picks * 4 Pick Swaps  That's a huuuuge price to pay but it would have been workable.  Dragic Harden Butler Bam Olynyk.  Maybe you could have kept someone like Nunn out of the conversation too.
Lebron actually locked down guards especially Rose in that infamous Bulls series. Even now for the Lakers he will guard guys like De'Aaron Fox and Kendrick Nunn because no one else on the Lakers can.  Draymond and Lebron both can absolutely get around screens. They just don't usually guard those type of guys but when they've done it they've done it well.
I‚Äôd like to thank Kendrick Nunn for keeping us in this one
We already have a Kendrick Nunn on our bench smh
Kendrick Nunn makes that deal a no for me
"Yup, I will be pissed if we trade Lowry for a package highlighted by Kendrick freaking Nunn.  Achiuwa has the potential to be a great long term fit as a switchable modern center, but the Heat can afford to deal him because they already have Bam."
"yes he did. and kendrick nunn is just as shitty of a human being as KPJ is. people \*should\* care, that's my point."
Didnt Kendrick Nunn pour boiling hot water over his girlfriend ? People don‚Äôt really seem to care about these things
"I think that mostly has to do with the context in which the incidents came to light.  There was no 4k recorded livestream of avery bradley or kendrick nunn committing their crimes. The internet is a lot more entertained when they can visually see something.   It's not really a surprise that the Meyers Leonard thing garnered far more attention when it's a short digestible clip that can be shared on all social media platforms, in comparison to an article that happens far after the fact.  This is pretty much true for anything on the internet, it being a racial slur is not really relevant. Pretty sure it would've blown up even more if it were anything more reprimandable than the use of a slur."
"if you ask directly, yeah, but obviously the 2 situations mentioned never became a big deal, i never remember anyone talking about cancelling avery bradley or kendrick nunn. media usually doesn‚Äôt make it a big deal unless it fits their narrative. this is not a ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt say anything these days‚Äù comment at all as i don‚Äôt condone what leonard said and he deserves his criticism."
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."

Kendrick Nunn and Avery Bradley
"If he really wants to be in Miami I can see Miami trying to leverage that to get him for pennies on the dollar - I'm talking like Olynyk, Mengele Leonard and Kendrick Nunn for Oladipo and Roddy Kurucs. They could also look to put in additional players if they want to grab PJ Tucker as well.  He's been a chucker this season and I'll be kind of surprised if some dumbass team gives him the bag but it's already been pointed out in this thread that there's a lot of teams with cap space that can afford to give out some stupid contracts."
Kendrick Nunn annnnd I had someone else in mind but I'm looking at hte roster rn and can't figure out who I was thinking of.  Maybe someone that got traded
Kendrick Nunn
They already used that up for Kendrick Nunn.
Kendrick Nunn pushed and poured hot water on a girl years before he joined the Heat. He's also cool with the chick now fwiw.  No clue about the Avery Bradley thing.
Sucks to be an Illini fan when all our NBA players are such shitty people. Between him and Kendrick Nunn I can't root for any alumni.
"Olynyk wouldn't even be in the rotation. Anybody who says that the Heat are gonna miss him in the playoffs is a complete casual lol. Avery Bradley is easily the bigger loss. At least he provided something the Heat needed (point of attack guard defense). Now we just gotta hope Kendrick Nunn doesn't go on one of his cold streaks, because we're gonna need him."
"Currently? Probably Kendrick Nunn. As for all time I have no idea what the correct answer would be. I‚Äôve been watching the Heat since around 2005 so I can‚Äôt speak for the 90s era players like Steve Smith, Hardaway and Seikaly. From the teams I‚Äôve watched I‚Äôm going to say Mario Chalmers."
"It is but interesting enough. Bam without Jimmy 987 minutes 114 defensive rating, Jimmy without Bam 644 minutes 107 defensive rating. Jimmy and Bam 1154 minutes 109 defensive rating. So the stats say that Jimmy is consistently their best defensive player this season. He is also 1st in steals, tied for 3rd in defensive loose balls recovered, 3rd in deflections per game, 4th in defensive rating of 105.4. Dude has been a beast defensively. Not to mention the Heat are top 5 defence despite guys like Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn and Goran Dragic playing heavy minutes."
"&gt; TF they were thinking playing no name ass dudes heavy minutes like Gabe Vincent and Max Strauss. Where these dudes came from??!? You won't win in playoffs playing them boys 15 minutes a night.  To be fair, Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn came out from absolutely nowhere and have been great for us the past two seasons. Heat are great at finding undiscovered gems.  That said, Vincent and Strauss haven't shown themselves to be in that class. But the Heat are good at finding ""no name ass dudes"" to ball out."
Kendrick Nunn was bounced by the Warriors G League team I believe. Now he‚Äôs about to sign a massive contract.
Where‚Äôs Kendrick nunn and Duncan Robinson
"oh no, robinson and herro definitely did not step up at all especially herro after the celtics series. jimmy had to do everything but them boys were not playing to jimmy's level at all besides bam in his limited time and dragic in his two games. nunn was nonexistant and meyers leonard had that one first quarter i think and then did nothing all series. would've been a series if kendrick nunn indeed played like jimmy's second best teammate"
"or that bam adebayo is the second best player on the heat team lol, man said meyers leonard and kendrick nunn were jimmy's best teammates LOL"
"I will take his 3% decrease in shooting traded for his increased assists and rebounding.  Duncan is having a great season.  Agree with you on Hero, but Kendrick Nunn is outplaying himself this year now so who knows.  Not saying DD is ""the key"" either but at least when bam goes out now, someone bigger comes in his place. Before he would leave and like,  Derrick Jones jr would come in."

Kendrick Nunn is 25 and is going to do the same thing. I'd put money on him being a fringe All-Star once he gets a regular run.
"I kinda want Kendrick Nunn (nickname: K9) and Timelord team up, just for giggles."
"Butler and Adebayo are still playing like stars.  Pretty much everyone else has fallen off for various reasons, in large part due to injury and illness and lack of continuity.    Duncan Robinson in particular has struggled even as he's played the most minutes on the team, perhaps because almost everyone around him has missed time.  Even his free throw shooting percentage is down from last year.    Just as Robinson was playing better he left the Bulls game last night due to illness.  That leaves the Heat with little backcourt depth, with Victor Oladipo, Kendrick Nunn, and Tyler Herro all out.  They also miss Jae Crowder, who was an underrated veteran presence especially in the playoffs.  Crowder has been a valuable player for the Suns this season.  If everyone gets healthy they are still a threat in the East, but time is getting short, and they are going to have a rough road in the playoffs.    Last year they had the benefit of months off before the bubble.  That's not happening this year."

Kendrick Nunn do be ballin tho
"I‚Äôll give you 1 Kendrick Nunn for a Lonzo Ball, take it or leave it."
"Hmm, not sure if they are better than last year but they will be a tough matchup for anyone.  Jimmy and Bam is a great combo, and then you got shooters like Duncan Robinson, Herro, and Dragic.  Oladipo (if healthy), Ariza, and Iggy can all be thrown in to guard the other team's best scorers.  Dedmon has been a pretty solid addition and Kendrick Nunn is a wild card (not sure if he makes playoff rotation)."
"One of the things I'm proudest about is that I was a Looney-stan and a Jordan Poole-stan from the start.  I tend to always favor giving young players an extra year, rather than losing them a year too early.  It takes time.    The same people were calling for Jordan Poole's head last year, when he was ranked as about the worst player in the whole league for long stretches of it.    it takes time.  For the record: I've also been much higher on Alen Smailagic than other warriors fan have been, but I've also been wrong a lot.    I just think the cost to holding onto young players an extra year is so prohibitively small, that it's nearly always worth it to do so.  The 12 - 15th spot on an NBA roster don't really matter, they seldom player in the regular season, and never in the playoffs.  Stashing young players to develop there is a good use of those roster spots.  Contracts for young players tend to be cheap too, so I don't see the logic.    Remember, the same fans who were calling for Looney and Poole's head are the same fans who cheered when the warriors waived Kendrick Nunn to replace him with an Andrew Bogut who had nothing left in the tank.  That's what the trade-off looks like in reality: the odds that replacing that young player with a vet who moves the needle is very tiny."

Its the kendrick nunn heat
There is gonna be enough talk about Kendrick Nunn having 30. Yes it's the Rockets but it's cool that he's playing so well after such a rocky end to last season
&gt; Houston‚Äôs asking price from Miami in a James Harden trade: &gt;  .. &gt; &gt; Tyler Herro  &gt; Duncan Robinson  &gt; Precious Achiuwa  &gt; Kendrick Nunn  &gt; Salary Filler  &gt; Two 1st-Round Picks  &gt; 4 Pick Swaps &gt;  ..  &gt; Miami was not interested  That is so worth James Harden for 2 fucking years guaranteed lmao. You get to keep Bam and get an instant big 3.
Way [too ridiculous to have to include guys like Kendrick Nunn though](https://heatnation.com/rumors/heres-the-ridiculous-package-the-rockets-wanted-from-the-heat-for-james-harden/) so still no deal.
"I think a lot of it depends on the play of Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo and to an extent, Duncan Robinson.   We know Jimmy is going to get it done on both ends, we know bam is going to get it done on both ends (guarding one of the 3 superstars every possession), and we know Dragic can boost the offense.   But Herro, his offense is needed to help match the Nets offense. He can‚Äôt be streaky, he needs to be consistent. Same for VO. I‚Äôm sure his defense will be fine, but he needs to get buckets.   Another X factor could be a guy like Kendrick Nunn, but the Heat seem to lean towards Dragic and Herro when it matters.    So, with that being said; if Herro and VO play well; Heat in 7   If not; Nets in 6"
"Bruh, Heat fans who actually watched him last season know he is hella inconsistent. There was a reason Kendrick Nunn got more ROTY hype than him.  Its dudes who only watched Herro in the bubble overrating the shit out of him."
"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
Kendrick Nunn did the same thing. Inexplicably turned into a bum
"This mf was #2 of the 13 class. Behind wiggs and ahead of gordan and randle. Whats crazy is 5,6 wqs the harrison twins. Man how randle came out as the best player out them. Jabari lowkey just has shit mental. Saying dumbshit like you the best player on the team. Yikes. Man your auu pg and high school pg having a better 2021 season than you bruh. (Kendrick nunn)."
Kendrick Nunn :(
"THT is mot a better player than MPJ, Tyler Herro, Cam Johnson, RJ Barrett, De‚Äôandre Hunter, Brandon Clark, Kendrick Nunn, Terence Davis, PJ Washington, or Thybulle. And that‚Äôs just from the top of my head.    He‚Äôs a good player, but thinking that he‚Äôs top 3 in that draft class is absurd homerism."
I like the idea of Sexton in Miami.  He would be like a suped up Kendrick Nunn.
Sexton is criminally underrated. On the Heat sub someone was making a good faith argument that Kendrick Nunn is better than Sexton because he has better efficiency statistics. What that dudes managed to pull of in that wasteland is a miracle.
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"
"trade tyler herro for dame, sign and trade iguodala for kawhi, and i guess to keep it realistic , snag luka from the mavs for kendrick nunn"
Kendrick Nunn when hes hot
"Kostas took a draft spot away from a lot of guys way more talented &amp; proven than him solely off his last name.  To think Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Yuta Watanabe &amp; Jae'Sean Tate went Undrafted because of this dude.  Shows that scouts do not know as much as fans sometimes."

"Rodions Kurucs and Kendrick Nunn are two recent examples off the top of my head, both took plea deals and nothing else really came of it. Also not domestic violence but Schroder beat the shit out of that guy in Atlanta and nothing happened."
Kendrick Nunn.
Kendrick Nunn ngl
"Heat alone had tyler herro, kendrick nunn, derrick jones jr, and duncan robinson all make the finals in their first post season"
"Let's dispel the Herro for Harden was rejected. Harden was always going to the Nets, every other conversation was to pump up the price for the nets.  THE ACTUAL ROCKETS OFFER WAS:  Tyler Herro  Duncan Robinson  Precious Achiuwa  Kendrick Nunn  Salary Filler  Two 1st-Round Picks  4 Pick Swaps  Source https://www.google.com/amp/s/heatnation.com/rumors/heres-the-ridiculous-package-the-rockets-wanted-from-the-heat-for-james-harden/amp/"
Cuban bout to trade for Kendrick Nunn and Terrence Davis.
I hear Kendrick Nunn is there as well
Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn went undrafted this year too ^^. You mentioned all the names I would have too by the way!
"A few more solid players to add to that list: Okogie, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Melton, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn‚Ä¶ yeah that draft class was really solid all around."
More Like #18 Pick Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro
Kendrick Nunn S&amp;T and a second rounder.
"Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, and Duncan Robinson would help Philly I feel like. Duncan starts and have Tyler run the backcourt for the bench?"
Kendrick Nunn seeing a resurgence compared to the rotation in the playoffs left less ball to go around. Compound that with Bam seeing a larger role in the offense and there just wasnt a larger role for Herro to have. He also did have a sophomore slump
Kendrick Nunn

Kendrick Nunn better
"True, but what did the Raptors lost out on? Schroeder rental and a low pick, Duncan Robinson rental and Kendrick Nunn, or Danny Green and maybe Maxy.  Only halfway decent one is Maxy, but no one is sure he was even part of it.   Sometimes it‚Äôs worth sending the message that you won‚Äôt take a bad deal just because it‚Äôs the only deal."
"Ah, I see. He trusts in the guy that wouldn't trade Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn for James Harden. Makes perfect sense üòÇ"
"It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs holding him back. Is Luka held back by his emotions? Is Joel Embiid? Is Jokic? No. They‚Äôre all capable of displaying emotion and still being top-tier players. There‚Äôs like literally two guys in the league who don‚Äôt display emotion, and it‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard and Kendrick Nunn lmao."
"Obviously the Heat would have no issues with this  &gt;In 2016 Kendrick Nunn pled guilty to misdemeanor assault where he was charged with hitting a woman in the head, pushing her to the ground and pouring hot water on her."

"There‚Äôs a very upvoted post in their sub talking about every playoffs team has at least one better second option than THJ this playoffs and that‚Äôs why people should start considering Luka as the best player in the nba if he wins this series.  Some guys they named as better on the Celtics: Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier when only one of them was healthy   Some guys from other teams: Herro, maybe Kendrick Nunn, and ‚Äúarguably‚Äù Kuzma, Drummond, and Harrell"
What's Kendrick Nunn good at?
"From what I've heard recently (from Ian Begley), we seem to be targetting Kendrick Nunn then its Lonzo and Devontae Graham.   All year I've heard that Knicks were super interested in Myles Turner. I'd imagine we'd be swapping the younger and cheaper Mitchell Robinson+something else for Turner.  Lastly, Knicks seem to be just waiting for that 1 disgruntled star (like Harden this season).  Maybe Wizards decide to trade Beal and Westbrook next season b4 they lose them in free agency. Maybe Zach Lavine becomes disgruntled (doubt it). Heck, maybe Clippers move to Seattle and Kawhi asks out this offseason lol.  Honestly, i have only recently started thinking about the Knicks offseason so I'll probably change my mind a lot until August 3rd."

I'd rather have Kendrick Nunn tbh
"Yeah, I watched it, but don't start telling me you think guarding Harden, Kyrie, and Durant is the same as guardian Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn, and Goran Dragic."
"So much Jimmy slander in here, not all players can play on superteams. Kendrick Nunn was starting for them and their team was fucked from Covid for 70% of the season."
"On top of Tyler we lose Duncan, precious, Kendrick nunn, salary filler, 2 first rounds and 4 pick swaps.  Duncan was the backbone of our scoring and Kendrick was great off the bench. Tyler wasn‚Äôt the sole reason, we would literally lose 80% of our future. And victor had wanted to come to Miami. If the trade package wasn‚Äôt so demanding Pat Riley definitely gets rid of some people but. Let‚Äôs be real harden was keen to play with KD and Kyrie anyway"
Don‚Äôt forget the domestic abuser Kendrick Nunn. Great culture down there!
Kendrick Nunn scared me more
"Heat have a history of employing players with credible domestic violence accusations like Kendrick Nunn, Avery Bradley, and James Johnson, as well as notable dirty players like Olynyk and Dragic.  That is Heat Culture"
"After review, Kendrick Nunn was safe on that slide"
Lmao that‚Äôs a stretch. Fuck Kendrick Nunn. Only the bush league Heat would employ a confessed domestic abuser
Kendrick Nunn.
If the Heat are being kept alive by Kendrick Nunn they are fucked. Jimmy should get absolutely flamed for this series once they get swept.
Kendrick Nunn is the only Heat player who cares rn
Kendrick Nunn with 8 straight points
"You said ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about if Oladipo is better than KO...‚Äù but the post asked what is your favorite trade? Bud, my comment was *completely* about Oladipo being better than KO, otherwise why would that be my favorite trade?   What is funny to me, Neph, is that you didn‚Äôt answer the question (have you ever watched a full game of Oladipo on the pacers) even after I asked you three times üòÇüòÇ  What do you do in response? You look up all of Oladipo‚Äôs bad stats to try to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the argument. But you forgot what the argument was. As a young franchise with new players like Tyler Herro, Kendrick nunn, and bam adebayo, would you rather have KO or Oladipo?  The fact that you have yet to answer my original question completely defeats any argument you make because you keep dodging the question. I appreciate you trying, but I‚Äôm not gonna lie, after three comments, I am completely disregarding any basketball opinion you have.   It‚Äôs obvious you are a bit younger so all I will say is to keep your NBA opinions on Reddit, otherwise you will get made fun of when you spew dumb shit like this ü§£ü§£üòò"
"Because Jimmy Bubbler, Tyler Zerro, and Bubble Adebayo went on a fluke run to the finals,  and had people thinking that Tyler Zerro, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn and picks were too valuable for Harden"

"Off-topic, but I was watching the Heat/Bucks game the other night and the commentators were talking about Kendrick Nunn, he'd just hit a shot or something.

Secondly, why is he a sponsor of the NBA?"" Turns out it's the KIA logo. . . Wtf KIA?"
Kendrick Nunn was 25 when he was named to the team last year.
Don‚Äôt forget employing convicted domestic abusers! Fuck Kendrick Nunn

Doesn't make a lot of sense that Kendrick Nunn is leading the Heat in shots

Kendrick fucking Nunn really have the greenlight. Bruh
This Kendrick Nunn guy is shite
Never forget that Kendrick Nunn is a piece of shit
Kendrick Nunn thought he could punk jrue lmao
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there‚Äôs also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you‚Äôre never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami‚Äôs, Indy‚Äôs, or Boston‚Äôs (or even Brooklyn‚Äôs or Philly‚Äôs) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That‚Äôs a lot of important guys from the East‚Äôs playoff picture and that‚Äôs not even mentioning what‚Äôs gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that‚Äôs gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don‚Äôt tear it down (which they 100% shouldn‚Äôt they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he‚Äôs earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don‚Äôt wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying ‚Äúhey, we broke in to the 5 seed‚Äù because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it‚Äôs a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the ‚Äúcontending in the East‚Äù tier"
Kendrick nunn is going to be the X factor for the heat if they make a playoff run.
If Bucks lose a series against a team starting Kendrick Nunn... Lmfao

"You explained nothing.  I brought up collective bargaining and the fact that this was implemented for small markets and fan approval which translates to money.  In fact, I can guarantee you that the Gilbert Arenas rule (as it was originally named) went into effect with player approval almost certainly with the league quantifying the amount of value it will bring to the players and owners both.  Nothing just randomly gets thrown into the CBA that damages the league you animal.  This topic is probably something you're tone deaf to given your flair, but it's ironic considering Nunn just took less money to sign with your team.  And nice strawman about the league collapsing, and me warning them.  An aspect of the salary cap system can improve fan approval and league revenue without propping up the entire system.  Thankfully you are here on reddit to warn the masses of the evils of restricted free agency which is causing Kendrick Nunn to play on a bigger contract next season than what he signed to in Miami."
"His Instagram followers about to skyrocket, same with Kendrick Nunn"
"It's so ignorant to look at one aspect of collective bargaining and ignore the rest.  The restricted contract structure benefits the owners.  The owners get some stuff and the players get stuff as part of collective bargaining.  The players still get great contracts.  The fact Kendrick Nunn doesn't get OVERpaid is not reason to shed a tear for these ultra wealthy.  These guys always want players to get the most money because then when it's their turn they can say, ""Well, Kendrick Nunn got this much and I'm better than him."""
this is likely because of how bad the Heat were struck by COVID last year and how largely it jeopardized our eventual underwhelming record ‚Äî the entire team short of Precious and Duncan had it at least once (Kendrick Nunn i wanna say got it twice or somethin)   we shelled out practically a new starting 5 every night it was tough scenes
"Carmelo Anthont doesn't play defense. So doesn't Ariza, Ellington, and Malik Monk. Kendrick Nunn was such a defensive liability last year that the heat had to bench him for long periods of time."
"Tim Cranjis did an insanely deep analysis [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/p6exl3/film_review_letter_grades_for_las_new_perimeter/) on evaluating the defense of the new Lakers signing  the tl;dr is that I Russ/Monk/THT starting together is likely going to result in some pretty poor back end rotations on P&amp;R switches, and despite being arguably the best ""rotater,"" it's a big question of whether or not a 36 year old Trevor Ariza will even be able to play 30+ minutes/game. However, Ken Nunn seems to be competent enough to fill that role and it seems like THT is still the best off-ball chaser and best guy at getting over PNRs at the point of the screen, so I think he might be necessary to play with Russ.  Kendrick Nunn might be needed to start to be a ""fill in the gap guy"" between Russ/THT.  My thought process is its going to Russ/Nunn/THT/Lebron/AD with Monk/Ellington/Baze/Ariza/Gasol off the bench"
"5v5 style tourney   Team A: Rubio, Neto, McConnell, Caruso, and Kendrick Nunn  Team B: McGee, Ayton, Howard, D Jordan, and Robin Lopez  Who wins?"
It does. Kendrick Nunn could give you 30 points and have virtually zero impact on the game. There's a reason why the Heat wanted nothing to do with him
"&gt;None of my links stated that.  ""Toronto's asking price has been accordingly high: as ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported earlier Thursday, the Raptors have asked for multiple first-round picks and young players, including Philadelphia's Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey, in order to deal their franchise legend to his hometown.""  \-- [https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/)  Furthermore, the original point of the thread was that Lowry was not worth Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, and a first -- which you argued for a couple days.  &gt;Miami isn‚Äôt paying Lowry $5 million more a year if they don‚Äôt have to,  Well, yeah they are, since Lowry's ask was [$25 x 2.](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-eyeing-kyle-lowry-two-year-deal-nba-free-agency)  Even Lowry didn't think he was worth this contract, and it's not as though adding more AARP-eligible years adds value to the team.  In all likelihood, this contract will be among the league's worst by next season -- as we repeatedly see with expensive deals for players in their mid-to-late thirties.  &gt;especially considering how that deal essentially puts them at the salary cap, and especially because \~$5M of TPE rarely amounts to shit. Lowry‚Äôs asking price was always around $30 million a year with a 3rd-year.  Again, you don't pay more for adding years that late in a career.  &gt;I said Toronto was offered KCP/Wes/Trez at the deadline. Dragic/Achiuwa is not a far smaller return, it‚Äôs actually a better return because Dragic is better than KCP and Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.   35 year old Dragic is not better than Caldwell-Pope -- which is why Dragic has not been an NBA starter in four years -- and his play dropped off significantly last year, and his health is unknown.  If they were the same age, that would be true, but Caldwell-Pope is seven years younger.  Dragic also has a worse contract.  &gt;Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.  Achiuwa is an extremely raw 20th pick, which makes him unlikely to be anything but a replacement-level player.  There's obviously a chance he's more, but it's slight.  &gt; It is also better than no return.  If Dragic is healthy and can play.  &gt;They‚Äôve only had 1 true point guard (Dragic) since Jimmy Butler arrived.  Kendrick Nunn is a point guard, and played 30 minutes per game for the Heat in both the preceding two seasons.  They also had Vincent for both of those seasons, and he even played 13 minutes per last year.  So, no."
"Dion went on a rant on Twitter and to the media after a game ‚Äúcalling out‚Äù Pat Riley and Eric Spo.  Combine that with his inability to get into basketball shape that the Heat demanded at the time, the emergence of Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn on the squad, Dion was expendable and thus out of the rotation until he could get his act together. Post heat, Dion could not stay healthy and his conditioning was once again an issue with the Lakers. Idk if any team wants to take a chance on a guy who is a bonehead and hasn‚Äôt shown productive basketball in over 3 years"
But women beater Kendrick Nunn is cool?
Kendrick Nunn
Because that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs time for your star to take over  Like do I really want Kendrick nunn having the ball in his hands in clutch time or Lebron/AD
Kendrick Nunn was a good find but GS let him go too early. Chris Boucher as well.
"I agree.  I think there are more players drafted late first round who become solid role players who could put up 20+ on a bad team.  Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro types.  But also hard to say they'd be as good in any role without being drafted into a good culture, fit, coaching."
Kendrick Nunn?
&gt;Who is left that's worth a $7M-$9M DPE?  &gt;Kendrick Nunn or someone like that could have been signed   Pretty sure I do fam
Kendrick Nunn or someone like that could have been signed
I have a mental block that prevents me from reading Kris Dunn/Kendrick Nunn correctly on the first attempt.
"wayne ellington, kendrick nunn, malik monk"
I mean they lost iggy and ariza for Morris and tucker I really don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs an upgrade seems more like a lateral move to me. And they also lost Kendrick Nunn who was a solid player for them.
"Warriors revamped their whole development staff. They added Dejan Milojevic who used to coach Jokic and develop him. He‚Äôll help develop Wiseman‚Äôs foot work and court awareness for sure. They also signed Jama Mahlalela who was the assistant coach for the Toronto raptors and the raptors are known for having the best development staff in the league. Players like OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam are products of that. This will benefit both kuminga and moody but especially kuminga seeing the previous results. They also signed Kenny Atkinson who is known for being one of the best development coaches in the league. When he was the head coach for the nets he made them have a break out year and developed players like levert, Allen, and DLO. Also, the warriors had developed a lot of good players, it‚Äôs just bc they were in a dynasty for a while that they couldn‚Äôt use them. For example, both kendrick nunn and Chris Boucher developed under the warriors. Some examples on the current warriors include JTA and Jordan Poole. But they didn‚Äôt really have much to work with. Wiseman was their first lottery pick in years and you can‚Äôt really develop him much when there‚Äôs no summer league or training camp. But the fact is that they finally got good rookies and It‚Äôs a whole new coaching staff"
"There's plenty of social media coverage on domestic violence today and guys still go on like nothing happened, and their fans just look the other way. Look at all the Lakers fans celebrating the Kendrick Nunn signing"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Warriors have done a pretty good job with Danuel House, Kendrick Nunn, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson and those are just in the last 3-4 years"
"They have been aggressive. Look at their roster. Malik Monk, THT, and Kendrick Nunn can replace Caruso."
"FWIW, Kendrick Nunn is not a minimum. He got the Tax Payer Mid Level. I think it's roughly 5M/yr on a 2 year deal. 2nd year a player option too."
"We now know that even if they didn‚Äôt trade for Westbrook, they could have not re-signed Schroder anyway and just started Kendrick Nunn with Caruso or Monk as backup. Don‚Äôt forget Lakers minimum wage players are different than your average team‚Äôs."
Nah. Kendrick Nunn could easily start at point guard.
How the fuck do you get that assumption? There are thousands of people here with billions of different opinions. Don't fall for the mob mentality. And don't think that I support abusers because my team happened to have Kendrick Nunn for a couple of seasons.
"according to spotrac lakers didn't even give him the entire mini mle, just $5M.  can't have him out-earning luol deng!  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/kendrick-nunn-28041/"
"Dude was so early to the facility, that he was even with the PR team, welcoming the other lakers free agent signees like Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, and Kendrick Nunn  Reminded me of the kid who showed up so early to class, that he started helping the teacher out with things üòÇüòÇ"
Kendrick nunn is great value. Bulls most improved in my opinion
Kendrick Nunn was a nice pickup for the Lakeshow
Kendrick Nunn ü§ù Malcolm Brogdon  Old As Fuck Rookies
You guys used it on Kendrick Nunn .
I'm 99% sure they used it on Kendrick Nunn
"He was barely any better than Kendrick Nunn was this season who just signed for what, 2 years $10M? Lakers made out like bandits here."
That makes LeBron in this time line Albert if Kendrick Nunn is the X-Factor.
"Precious wasn't even in the discussions from what I remember, it was Dragic, Olynik, Duncan, and Nunn.   *‚ÄúMiami expressed interest in acquiring Raptors six-time All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry and Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk and Kendrick Nunn were discussed,‚Äù Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype reported recently.""*  https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/miami\_heat\_have\_made\_a\_kyle\_lowry\_trade\_offer\_to\_the\_toronto\_raptors/s1\_12680\_34352972"
"Bro no offense, I can tell you‚Äôre a Lakers fan, but Kendrick Nunn was getting body-bagged af last year and the year before. On our team anyone next to Herro actually looked good defending. Herro gotta be a top 5 worst defender in the league lol"
"i mean, no. i literally said fuck kendrick nunn as a free agent option two days ago because of that. i‚Äôve just watched grayson allen be a bitch multiple times with my own eyes so i absolutely hate him."
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
"LeBron benefited from having an extraordinary team both Olympics. Not FIBA rules. If FIBA rules were to apply today, he wouldn‚Äôt have the benefit of having prime KD, Kobe, CP3 all in the lineup with him. 90% of the players that participated in those Olympic shot better percentages than they did in the NBA that particular season. Now replace a 27 y/o CP3 with a 33 y/o Russ. A 33 y/o Kobe with Kendrick Nunn, and 25 y/o KD with a 38 y/o Melo and see if LeBron still keeps those numbers."
"Players who are better per 100 possessions than Evan Fournier out of the min players on the Lakers roster. Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kendrick Nunn, Dwight Howard (arguably), and Wayne Ellington. Like his raw stats are better, but he isn't actually more efficient with the possessions he gets than pretty much any of them. He just has a larger role than any of them."
"So a list of ring chasers compared to a solid young player (Fournier) who is leading his country (France) to the gold medal match in the Olympics.  What's your point? Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk are puzzling signings because they could've signed elsewhere for a lot more, but they decided to take the easy way out and ring chase."
"Ah yes, NBA vets Malik Monk, Kent Bazemore and Kendrick Nunn"
"Could always use a shot creator off the bench, and he‚Äôs been a consistent one throughout his career not a bad shooter and he‚Äôs clutch, however they wanted to add some youth I guess but I would rather give Lou the contract they gave Kendrick nunn"
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
Kendrick Nunn
"Yeah right, don‚Äôt really care about Melo at this point in his career, and Bazemore and Ellington have been on a ton of teams for a reason. Biggest gets was Kendrick Nunn imo. If im the lakers I wouldve rather got fournier tbh"
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  ‚Äú The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.‚Äù"
Kendrick Nunn and Carmelo Anthony.
He also thought he had a lot of leverage until players like Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk were taking the min or close to it to come to the Lakers.
"Your exact quote was that their moves were only enough to keep them competitive. That, to me, sounds like they are just middling contenders and not the most talented team in the league like I think they are. Ok, that is fine to compare those 4 players in a vacuum (Melo and Dwight vs KCP and Kuzma). But those two acquisitions are at the end of the list in terms of the Lakers most important (in my opinion). They added Malik Monk, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, and Ariza on top of that. That kind of bench depth with athleticism and versatility, on top of their new big 3, is what makes them the most talented team in the league. Again, imo"
"&gt; I would understand the Lakers, since they should be desperate for a PG  Should they be? They're starting Russ, so they only need like 10-12 minutes per night to back him up there and most of those 10-12 minutes are likely to feature LeBron, so you'd rather play two off-guards anyway. I'd imagine they're content with Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk for that role or at least certainly aren't ""desperate""."
I thought Kendrick Nunn got our MLE
Are Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk really the difference between a disaster and a sure fire team then? These dudes made their stances clear already and the receipts are there
"bro what? u guys have two top 10 players, added russell westbrook an all star level player. and got  dudes to sign cheap when they could‚Äôve gotten more money somewhere else like malik monk and kendrick nunn. then a bunch of useful vets. You and the nets are easily the favorites it‚Äôd be a disappointment for either team to not reach the finals. It‚Äôs just funny to make memes about the lakers but the expectation is for sure at least a finals appearance"
"Laker fans act like this but they hype up their guys more than anyone. Ive never seen as many pro-Carmelo Anthony comments in the last couple years as ive seen in the last 24 hours.  Seriously go back and look at last year‚Äôs Dennis Schroeder post and then compare it to the words on guys who either haven‚Äôt played in a year or were like the 8th man on a lottery team. Kendrick Nunn and Malik were solid gets for a bench backcourt esp at their cost, but no have no idea if they will perform to par in the playoffs, and I‚Äôm already seeing Pelinka won the offseason posts.  Also, I have no idea who is actually going to replace KCP as the 3&amp;D shooting guard for this time. All I know is, you have to be doing mental gymnastics to think Wayne Ellington or Kent Bazemore are upgrades there.   You think they‚Äôve been bad with the Bron stans + Laker fans together, now they got the Westbrook stans, and the Melo stans now. It‚Äôs gonna reach a zenith we haven‚Äôt seen yet"
"Malik Monk - So insanely talented that the team that drafted him and is trying to rebuild it good young talent didn't even extend a qualifying offer to him.   Kendrick Nunn - So insanely talented that the Heat stopped playing him in the playoffs when they made a run to the finals.   Kent Bazemore - So insanely talented as a 32 year old he average a whopping 7.2 ppg and averaged a single made 3 pointer per game. I mean, damn, where do you get that kind of production?!  Wayne Ellington - On his 10th team he's bound to find consistency and success. This insanely talented sniper who turns 34 this year has shot above 40% from 3 exactly one time since 2014 -- last year in a 40-something game sample. The previous year he shot 33% on open catch and shoot 3s. I'm on the edge of my seat to find out if this middle aged shooter will find consistency in his 11th stop of his career!"
Why? That's literally what's happening. A bunch of competent veterans (and Kendrick Nunn for some reason) signing minimum deals with a team among the likeliest to win a ring.
Schroder really fucked himself after the market was getting dry and before the Lakers signed Kendrick Nunn I was convinced he‚Äôd be back on a 1 year deal worth 15-20 million but nope they snatched that opportunity
Rob Pelinka did talk Kendrick Nunn and Monk into signing with the Lakers. He should get a lot of credit for that because they really needed it.
"The Lakers have traded Russel Westbrook, Malik Monk, and Kendrick Nunn for Bradley Beal"
"I guess i'm just crazy but I dont see anyone they added outside of Westbrook that's better than KCP, at least in terms of fit around stars. They got big names, but a lot of those names literally haven't done shit in years.  Kendrick Nunn is probably the biggest piece and even he got played off the floor in the playoffs the last 2 years.  This feels like last year's Schroeder + Harrell hype all over again, tbh."
"I actually think Nunn is more of a SG than a PG on a roster without a point forward, but I think Patty adds a presence when the Nets just drafted a Kendrick Nunn type player, so Nunn would have been redundant"
"to avoid something like that, I'd love to see the 4th-10th teams getting a variable ""mid tier exception"" type of contract. It would take a bunch of stipulations, but: 1 year deals, ranging from $6m to $15m with the amount increasing as you go back in the standings. Must sign a player who did not finish the season on the roster and has never received a max contract, no S&amp;T (nonwaivable trade clauses built in).  For example, the Lakers, finishing 6th could have signed Kendrick Nunn to a 1 year, $10 mill deal. Raptors could've floated Jarrett Allen a $15m contract for finishing 12th. May need to adjust amounts based on draft position and have something so these players can become part of the core later rather than just being one and done mercenaries.  IMO this would help players ring chase at an earlier age, especially if they underperformed on their rookie deals or were USDA/second rounders. Plus it would make free agency more exciting in small markets"
"I imagine Schroder felt really confident when he stated his asking price saying he's the best guard available, and thought he heard Pelinka say ""None Better""  Then the Lakers sign Kendrick Nunn and Schroder's all ""ohhh."""
"They signed both to exceptions that allow teams to exceed the salary cap  Malik Monk- veteran's minimum deal, you can sign an infinitely many number of these as long as you have not incurred a hard cap on yourself and you are willing to pay luxury tax if required  Kendrick Nunn- taxpayer (or ""mini"") MLE, 1 of these, usually a 2 year deal, I don't know much more about it. 5 mil-ish range. differs from the full MLE, which was about 9.5 mil this year, in that it does not incur a hard cap"
Kendrick Nunn
"Malik young and Kendrick Nunn are young. People saying too old reacting to the Melo and Westbrook signings, but this changes that. Try to keep up buddy"
Welp nvm I‚Äôm at work and caffeine deprived thought it was Kris Dunn that signed lmao not Kendrick Nunn. You right Nunn is good but not as good as Dunn I don‚Äôt think.
Kendrick nunn on the Lakers won‚Äôt be asked to do more than provide a scoring punch here and there. He won‚Äôt get significant run in the playoffs. Caruso is much more reliable for the postseason
Maybe they knew Kendrick Nunn was sitting there for $5M per.  That would explain the [earlier report that the Lakers would let Caruso go if he wanted more than $6M](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ovhabd/eric_pincus_i_think_a_reasonable_number_for/).
"Kendrick Nunn is 26, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs in the same position as Melo chasing a ring. I get why older guys want to join contenders, they have been around the league and haven‚Äôt gotten their ring and aren‚Äôt as concerned about the payday.  Nunn could easily get more than $5 mil and still be on a good team, perhaps even starting and getting valuable experience. The shit with all these talented players taking huge paycuts to play on LA and Brooklyn is just so lame to me, and I think it‚Äôs this championship or bust mentality that ruins parity in the league. I‚Äôm speaking as a fan though so maybe you feel some type of way as a former player."
"Westbrook, Ellington, Bron, Davis, Dwight.   Center could end up being situational, but Gasol is getting decrepit and injury prone so he can‚Äôt play too much.   Ellington makes the most sense to start at SG for me. Moves without the ball very well. Kendrick Nunn is a primary ball handler and that won‚Äôt fly too well with RW and Lebron together. Monk is a bench energy guy. Bazemore could start and play small minutes but he‚Äôs my last choice of the 4 and I think he‚Äôll be a benchwarmer most of the season."
"[In 2016 Kendrick Nunn pled guilty to a misdemeanour assault where he was charge with hitting a woman in the head, pushing her to the ground and pouring hot water on her.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/doslax/in_2016_kendrick_nunn_pled_guilty_to_a/)"
Lmao sign Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn and lakers fans acting like they got KD
Kendrick Lamar Nunn
"I thought Nunn has been a borderline great to elite perimeter defend though? And Monk is an underrated defender per Charlotte fans too.   Pains me to say this as a Suns fan but Monk, Ellington and Melo give them pretty damn good shooters to surround the big 3.  Edit: nvm I need caffeine at work..thought it was Kris Dunn who signed not Kendrick Nunn üòÇ"
Kendrick Nunn is not good.
Kendrick Nunn? Malik Monk?
"1.7 mil on a 1 year contract, and now they got kendrick nunn who's also a good shooter."
"This is all literally in front of your eyes. It's not a conspiracy; Kendrick Nunn is worth more than 5/year. Malik Monk is worth more than a minimum. If you're saying other teams enjoy the same luxuries, then I'm asking where the free agents, without history with Milwaukee, signing on heavy discounts are? If your best argument revolves around a loved existing player taking a discount to stay, another player who literally *left the Bucks to play for the Lakers for less money*, and the free agency dominance of signing Marvin Williams, then you need to take a step back and consider that maybe the Los Angeles Lakers have advantages in attracting free agents that other teams do not, due to reasons beside the GM."
"If you're a Kendrick Nunn or a Malik monk why the hell wouldn't you want a really good opportunity to become a world champion? If you ever get one, it's going to be on some other stars coattails so may as well do it on your own timeline rather than hope someone comes around to get you there."
"Bobby just signed for a deal because he came off the bench and had fans chanting his name, won a championship with the team, and reclaimed his reputation. If Kendrick Nunn or Malik Monk had that experience with the Lakers, people would get it.  &gt; you got Wes Matthews on a minimum two years ago  Oh shit, yeah, forgot about that. Didn't he leave the Bucks, though? Where'd he go again?  &gt; and you guys were at the front of the line in the buyout market for Marvin Williams  What a slam dunk. Bucks managed to sign 4/4/1, out of the league the year after, Marvin Williams. Truly, these franchises have enjoyed equal advantages on the free agency market.  &gt; But at the same time the Bucks don't have the brand of going all in the way the Lakers and Heat and some other teams do. You did when you thought you might lose Giannis, but now that he's locked up, what happened to bringing back PJ Tucker?  Yeah, the team based in Milwaukee valued at a third of the Lakers has been reluctant to accrue a 60-120 million luxury tax penalty; another mechanism that has benefitted ultra-wealthy teams that enjoy media dominance."
"The Lakers have their 2027 or 2028 1st round picks they can offer (only one though, not both). The Kings will obviously try to get the most they can fo Buddy, but it's entirely possible they mainly just want cap relief. The Lakers also will have a couple cheap young players they can throw in, in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn to go along with Schroder on an expiring (if he does indeed re-sign a one year deal with the Lakers)."
"That's true, I just think he has a fair more likely chance to get minutes here than there. I don't see a situation where Kendrick Nunn is a vital piece with everything you guys have there. LeBron, AD, and Westbrook are obviously making the headlines and highlight reels every night, Howard and others will also take some, but is Nunn even going to see the floor some nights?"
"Ok, LA is *more* of a title opportunity than we are. I can be a realist and a fan at the same time. Yeah, I get that the context of it all stings, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to sweat Kendrick Nunn all that much. Maybe Robinson, but not Nunn."
"I'm a Heat fan, I love Kendrick Nunn.   That said, why are people here acting like this is some big holy shit move? He's fine"
"i mean different people are entitled to their opinions but me personally i loved the Russ pickup, u guys need scoring and playmaking outside of ur top 2 and picked up another all star level player. Russ has a lot of haters bc of his statistical success but i thought that was a huge addition for the lakers. the only reason he‚Äôs been not valued much w trades is because he‚Äôs paid an insane amount. If he was just a FA and could be more reasonable deal 30-35 mil maybe then he‚Äôd have a ton of suitors.  I‚Äôm also very high on kendrick nunn and malik monk and u guys added a ton of shooters.  Not everyone hates russ, his haters are just very vocal. He‚Äôs a star level addition. Lakers in 2020 third piece was kuzma u can‚Äôt compare that to russell westbrook"
Has ANYONE ever clowned Kendrick Nunn or Malik Monk for that?
But I guess what separates him from someone like Kendrick Nunn? Besides age
"Then why did everyone laugh at the team when they traded for Russ‚Ä¶? Why did nobody else trade for him..? The last 2 players Russ was traded for where both at the time considered to be untradeable players on the two worst contracts in the NBA, Wall and CP3.   Russ has been getting nothing but hate for years. Every team he‚Äôs been on has dumped him for injured players on bad contracts.  I just want to make sure we get all the facts straight. I‚Äôm old enough to remember yesterday, and the day before that, when the Lakers where being mocked for the trade, and I‚Äôm old enough to remember after they signed Ariza, Dwight, Baze and Ellington everyone laughed at them again for being old as shit and for trying to bring back all the former Lakers.   But then all of that ended today because they signed Kendrick Nunn..? A guy who‚Äôs doing to be the 3rd ball handler behind two of the highest usage players of all time..?  Why‚Ä¶. Why are we doing this again lol. Do I need to post the receipts from 2020? There‚Äôs plenty of videos on YouTube that compile all the silly stuff people said about the 2020 Lakers roster."
Bro the Lakers trades all their assets for AD and then all their assets for Westbrook l- was signing Kendrick Nunn and Malik Whoever really the straw that broke the camels back ???

"R/nba 2 days ago: lol lakers are old, have no cap room and no spacing ü§£ü§£ü§£   Rob pelinka: we have signed Malik monk and Kendrick nunn.   R/nba: I don‚Äôt want to play anymore im going home to cry in mom‚Äôs room üò¢ mean laker man too good"
Kendrick Nunn &gt; KD
"&gt; This year they have a group of alpha guys who never played the second and third roles on a team.  Who are you talking about? Dwight and Rondo played roles on the '20 title team. Melo played a role last year with the Blazers. Bazemore, Ariza, and Ellington are journeyman role players. Malik Monk has started one game in his career. Kendrick Nunn is going into his third year and took less money for an opportunity to win.   Westbrook is an alpha for sure, but he also played point beside KD for five scoring titles, so I'm not that worried about him finding a way to amplify greatness."
"You ignore one thing, though: with one more roster spot left to fill, the Lakers are 13-players deep. This mean that they won't be forced to play anyone major minutes this season.   For instance, Westbrook is the starting PG obviously, but behind him is Kendrick Nunn, Rajon Rondo, and even THT (who plays SG too) who ran the point at times last season. For shooting guard, they have four or five guys that can play the spot. For center there is AD, D. Howard and DeAndre Jordan - all legit big men.  So yeah, health is always a concern and the average age of the Lakers isn't encouraging. However, by being so deep as a team (and they still have to get one more player which I hope is a SF/PF) a lot of this should be mitigated since no one has to play a ton of minutes."
Kyrie &lt; Kendrick Nunn
"If they have John Konchar on there who was undrafted, where is Kendrick Nunn, who was also an undrafted rookie in 2019? Nunn was NBA Rookie First Team.  Edit: Kendrick went undrafted in the previous NBA season so that's probably why."
"AD is great. The linchpin  Bron is great but is going to pick his spots and might laze on some plays.  [Bazemore](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/8/6/22613809/lakers-officially-sign-kent-bazemore-free-agency-contract-took-less-money-win) is good on defense.  Dwight is situational.  [Trevor Ariza](https://allucanheat.com/2021/03/17/miami-heat-rumors-trevor-ariza-great/2/) might still be good at defense, despite a decline.  Nunn has [potential](https://allucanheat.com/2021/01/26/miami-heat-3-reasons-keep-kendrick-nunn/2/) on defense  Monk has his pluses and minuses  THT is weak on defense, DeAndre weak on rim protection, Westbrook inattentive, Mello has typically not been great, Rondo old and weak on defense  However, Vogel has been a defensive focused coach, and everyone right now seems to be team focused, rather than self-focused, so the Lakers have a chance to be good on defense. There's likely going o be a lot of ""next man up"" as Vogel has a tendency to try different looks in the regular season and a lot of these guys are not 30 mpg players"
"Since pretty much the whole lakers team is slept on, ill mention a few.   Carmelo knows he has this is his last chance and is finally playing alongside ""the old also slept on LeBron"". Strictly for offense and you'd be surprised his defensive intensity pick up to as Vogel is good at instilling defense. I.e. Kuzma, KCP, THT, Trez.  Kendrick Nunn doesn't get enough attention. Solid player that damn near took the lakers to 6 in the finals. Perfect balance of shooting and his defensive prowess.   Malik Monk. We are forgetting he was hitting his stride last year after being in the league 4 years now. Hes only 24 years old and is a talent ready to explode this season.   THT had a very good rookie season and an okay 2nd season. He has shown flashes of being a downhill unorthodox finisher at the rim, especially with his reach. He will be mentally stronger and more assertive.   The list can go on but these are my picks from my teams."
kendrick nunn
"How the hell are places like Utah going to win a ring with shit like this happening?   Because, to be honest, they could probably contend for a title if they were able to pick up like Dwight, Blake Griffin, and Kendrick Nunn/Monk."
Kendrick Nunn &gt; Tyler herro
What is the trade value of these players:  Derick White  Kendrick Nunn  Delon Wright  Alec Burks  Eric Gordon
"&gt; trading allows you to maintain at least 150M talent.   You're forgetting that a sign and trade would hard cap you at the apron.   &gt;BTW, speaking of Klutch, Bulls better be fn good first half of this season, or Lavine is gone by the deadline to the destination of his choice for 50c on the dollar.  Well if LaVine told the Bulls to trade him to the Lakers mid-season and they were willing to do it he'd be pretty easy to get since his salary is only $19 million this year. Talent Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn along with draft picks would fit under the cap. But I'm far less sold than you are that Chicago would trade him for 50c on the dollar. We'll have to wait and see what happens."
Kendrick Nunn? Are you on crack?
"The deal was Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn, Herro, and Precious Achiuwa with 2 first round picks and 4 pick swaps right?  I don't see how that's everyone when you could have Harden, Bam, Butler, and Dragic (at the time). That would have done a whole lot better in this past playoffs and you ended up losing Nunn and trading Achiuwa anyway."
Coby White for Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn (two Chicago boys). Who says no?
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
https://heatnation.com/rumors/heres-the-ridiculous-package-the-rockets-wanted-from-the-heat-for-james-harden/   This is an article from Heat media right after the trade.   They called this ridiculous:   * Tyler Herro * Duncan Robinson * Precious Achiuwa * Kendrick Nunn * Salary Filler * Two 1st-Round Picks * 4 Pick Swaps
"I feel like we're neck and neck, but Duncan Robinson is one of the best 3 point shooters in the league and is breaking records while at it. Bam was a top DPOY candidate. Tyler Herro might be a cornerstone 6MOTY, Kendrick Nunn was ROTY runner up and if we wanna go back in time, we developed arguably the 3rd best shooting guard in NBA history."
"I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto-- Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn were both undrafted players. Bam Adebayo, way better than draft outlook. Herro better than draft outlook. Team frequently finds G league diamonds in the rough. A lot of your teams rotational players were at some point Heat development projects (Tyler Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr, Josh Richardson, etc etc.)"
Pfft this is easy. Kendrick Nunn and Ariza take it or leave it
lmao Bruce Brown is better than Kendrick Nunn.
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."
"If the starters are prime LeBron - young Westbrook - prime Melo - prime Marc Gasol - prime Dwight Howard (BPA line-up), that would still leave a bench of prime Rondo - prime Ellington - prime Ariza - rookie AD - young DeAndre Jordan. Very solid bench.  Throw in some minutes for a rookie Bazemore and make sure 12-year-old THT, 14-year-old Malik Monk don't touch the court, and maybe even 17-year-old Kendrick Nunn."
"The Lakers 2 meaningful gets were Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk, and even Monk wasn't that crazy. None of the other guys were worth getting upset about at all. Melo, Dwight, Jordan, Rondo? Melo's the only one of them that was even half decent last year, and even then he's super limited at this point.   People are just reacting off name brand at this point."
Kendrick Nunn
Kendrick Nunn
It was Kendrick Nunn but he decided to go to LA.
"They are not the best  choices I would choose but reality most like these guys will guard them   &amp;#x200B;  Trevor Ariza, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, BRON , RUSS"
no kendrick nunn love?
"Wtf, how did I miss that Kendrick Nunn went to the lakers"
Honestly I feel sorry for Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn - they're gonna finish a game and have about seven players trying to give them advice on how to improve their footwork.
"Kendrick Nunn averaged 15 the past two seasons, none of those players you listed have averaged that. None of those players have the shotcreating abilities of Melo. None of your role players can play make like Rondo. Offensively, we‚Äôre definitely right there with y‚Äôall. If anything your role players have the edge defensively. Altogether tho, there‚Äôs nothing definitive that‚Äôs blowing us out of the water"
"Could be depending on injuries etc.   I anticipate THT, Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn will play heavy minutes in the regular season."
Alright alright alright you drive a hard bargain. Kendrick nunn and Devontae Cacok for Sabonis
"I can't predict the future to tell you all the various moves that will be made between now and the first week of free agency next year. All I know is that the landscape is going to transform in drastic ways no one can imagine. People like you always make this same mistake every year where you guys say ""that will be impossible"" but then one or two things happen and in retrospect it looks obvious.   All I'm going to say is this: *if* Zach LaVine wants to get to the Lakers, he'll have absolutely zero problems making that happen. If there's one thing that should be readily apparent by now, it's that unrestricted free agents can get to the location they want to get to, one way or another. Hell, *signed players* can often get to where they want to go to if they're good enough! Stay in denial if you want to, but just think back on this exchange a year from now.   If LaVine makes it clear to the Bulls that he's not going to re-sign with them and puts it out there that he will only go to the Lakers, then Chicago might move him this year before the deadline. They could trade him straight up this year for THT, Kendrick Nunn and a first round pick. Acting like the cap mechanics to get it done is the stumbling block is silly. It's a question of what LaVine wants. For all we know he wants to stay in Chicago, who knows? But if his goal is to get to the Lakers, then that's where he's going to end up. Watch and see."
They do have Kendrick Nunn now. I‚Äôll miss him.
"Kendrick Nunn, Devonte Graham, Dame Lillard"
"It doesn‚Äôt make sense because it‚Äôs not all about Lebron. If so we would‚Äôve traded THT and gotten Lowry. And Kendrick Nunn makes less money than Caruso. If there was a choice, it was between Caruso and THT, and they chose THT even though Caruso is clearly a more ready now player and also Lebron‚Äôs like greatest statistical teammate"
"It's not 'Do you want Caruso or no Caruso?', why would anyone think that's what's being said? It's 'Do you want Caruso or Kendrick Nunn?'', 'Do you want Caruso or THT?'."
"&gt;...I think they're banking on Russ being a big factor here.   &gt;   &gt;Dude is LA born and raised and iirc  I agree. And that is what potentially is their fatal flaw. I hope not, but I think we will see Russ exude some undesirable ***entitlement attitude*** because of the L.A. roots and consensus expectation that the local area will make him the most popular Laker automatically now.  Nonetheless, that won't change how Russ is not known to be very friendly toward his teammates and Jared is very known for that. Russ is not known to be a winner, in the playoffs, since he cannot relate to what those demands entail. That is not the case for Jared. For example...Russ and Kendrick Nunn have the same experience, if the Lakers make it to the NBA Finals."
Kendrick Nunn is another young player
"Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn, not to mention Horton-Tucker  they got depth"
"This game was insane  Kendrick Nunn - 36 points  Jimmy Butler - 20/18/10  Bam Adebayo - 30/11/11  Duncan Robibson - 34 points, 10 threes"
"If he pulls that shit on this team, I can assure you he‚Äôll be benched for Kendrick Nunn or Monk or even THT."
"I have a feeling Kendrick Nunn will be an absolute steal on his current contract. Otherwise, Lavine and Nurkic come to mind. Clint Capella too.  Giannis' last contract was a bargain as well. MVP and DPOY for $25 million was an absolute bargain."
Kawhi Leonard - He's a Kawaii  Hassan Whiteside - He's a White Side  Derick Favors - He is a Favor  Lonzo Ball/Lamelo/Liangelo - They are balls  Buddy Hield - He's a Healer  Kendrick Nunn - He's a Nun  Malik Monk - He's a Monk  Harold Miner - He's a Miner  Dragan Bender - He can Bend a Dragon  Devonte Graham - He's a Graham  Dion Waiters - He's a Waiter
"The lakers were already thin last season, and then they traded their remaining depth for Russ and let Caruso walk. They had to fill out like 10 roster spots with minimum players, and while some of those guys were good for a minimum, they're still bench guys at best. The lakers need THT and Kendrick Nunn to come back and play great, because you cannot win a championship starting Kent Bazemore and Deandre Jordan."
"Your team just doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. They‚Äôre going to be chaotic and don‚Äôt have the shot makers. Lebron and AD will be enough to win games, Kendrick Nunn might make a difference, but you‚Äôre overly reliant on melo and monk to do more than they can."
"Second to none    None = Kendrick Nunn    Thus, second to Kendrick Nunn"
"I think we also miss talen horton tucker, kendrick nunn, and wayne ellington, but meh. Right now we are digging deep into our 10and 11th guys.   Im meh about the season, but optimistic about the playoffs"
"I‚Äôm so hyped for Kendrick Nunn to come back, imagine a lineup with him, Monk, and Lebron"
"This current construction of the Laker squad just looks like the 2004 version with Malone and Payton. Big names that don‚Äôt fit well together that are well-past their primes. Caruso had a ton of chemistry with the team and was willing to do the dirty work in a random #35/82 game season that not many players would.  Westbrook is a stat generating machine but clearly does so at the expense of efficiency and winning. ANYONE can see that he has zero place in the Laker lineup when LeBron is on the floor.   The chase for star power really hurt them. Should of just went with the Kuzma for Buddy Hield trade, resign Caruso, and kept KCP.  At this point I think Kendrick Nunn is a better starter than Westbrook would be."
Kendrick nunn will be starting over Russ when he gets healthy
Why put bazemore in for 23 mins just to go 1-5 when Kendrick Nunn could've got 15 for em easy if he got in the game
to be fair it would all be different if Kendrick Nunn was healthy.
"Losing Caruso (and KCP) and replacing them with the corpse of Trevor Ariza + Kendrick Nunn was uh... not a good move, to say the least. Nunn has never been close to the defender KCP or Caruso are. Ariza was literally unplayable in the playoffs (but the Heat had to play him because he was the only other wing they had). Ariza *is not a good player anymore.* This idea that the Lakers are favorites in the West just because they got Russ and a bunch of poor fitting pieces is lunacy to me. They might win a lot of games, if healthy. But I dont think I'd pick them over the Jazz, Suns, and certainly not over a healthy Nuggets team (with Jamal Murray at at least 85% operational ability)."
i said 20 but ok lets do 5  the LA team is getting all the signings and AD forcing out because lebron is there. simple as that.   lebron is there for his production company and businesses so yes its advantageous to signing the richest basketball player ever with a ton of outside ventures but thats literally 1 player and if the team wasn't in a position to be easily reformed to his liking he would've chosen another despite those outside reasons being a factor in picking the lakers. the truth is the team was just malleable enough for him to do what he's done every season since he returned to the cavs.   it was known kawhi and PG wanted to play in their hometowns basically their whole careers and never got the chance until then. nothing to do with it being ~LA~.   and now all of a sudden trading for russ is an advantage when this sub swears hes the worst piece of shit to ever hit the floor? lmfao ok   its funny how you had to immediately pivot to regular ass players like malik monk and kendrick nunn like every single team didn't sign players of their calibre for cheap contracts.  lets do 20 now though. gives you an even bigger timeline to find examples of what you claim.
"Let‚Äôs just go back to last 5 years. LeBron signs because LA. AD wants a trade to LA. Westbrook wants a trade to LA. Kawhi and PG want to play in LA. Players take pay cuts to play in LA. Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn, two young players just sign there for cheap because they can win in LA.   Their players get more national media attention hence higher chances to make all-star teams and media driven awards.   You give a team like Minnesota 2 stars and then LA the same 2 stars. The LA team is getting all the signings because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ LA."
"Why kendrick nunn, wayne ellington and trevor specifically though? They didnt even play ü§£. Feel like Russ would have been more appropriate if we're shitting on Lakers front office decisions"
"Yeah for real. Especially because they got Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn.  Nunn was a great fit at PG when paired with a ball dominant wing in Jimmy Butler. Nunn helped give Butler a rest in running the offense which is what Lebron wanted. Didn't need to boil the ocean by selling the farm for Westbrook.  Monk is a solid secondary ball-handler, and then you have Rondo off the bench. Lakers then get to keep their shooting depth.  Instead they've got Sekou Doumbaya, a looks-to-be-washed Avery Bradley, and whatever that other dude is on the bench."
Kendrick Nunn will look great when he comes back
"By way of being one of the only young (and currently healthy) players on the roster, I'd impartially advocate for the Lakers playing him as much as possible (while still winning) to see if more playing time can help him be a rotation-level asset to LeBron in the playoffs.  He's one of 5 guys younger than 30 on the main roster: Anthony Davis, Kendrick Nunn, Monk, Austin Reaves, and THT. Nunn was questionable coming into this game, THT is injured, and Reaves is an undrafted rookie."
Tyler Johnson/Kendrick Nunn/Duncan Robinson/Tyler Herro/Bam Adebayo/Hassan Whiteside/Max Struss/Wayne Ellington. All these guys are good or had career years with the Heat. Raptor fans are either bitter or ignorant. Either way I don‚Äôt care. Super excited for next season.
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."

For a month or so this summer I was convinced he had signed with the Lakers; then I learnt it was actually Kendrick Nunn who went to LA.
Kenny Anderson  Kenny Smith  Kenneth Faried  Kentavious Caldwell Pope  Kendall Marshall  Kenyon Martin  Kent Bazemore  Kendrick Nunn  Kendrick Perkins
Didn't Kendrick Nunn drop a shit ton of points in the preseason two seasons ago?   I'm gonna go no.
No they can't lol. Russ has the point guard position locked up. That means there is only the shooting guard position open. Even the Lakers aren't dumb enough to put Kendrick Nunn or Malik Monk at small forward.
"Well once again, they brought in Kendrick nunn who is quite comparable and also Malik monk who is young but still experienced, and can produce offensively much better than anyone they had in 2019"
nah. malik monk (23) might start for them. and kendrick nunn it looking like the 6man
"Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker, and Kendrick Nunn really bout to go through it this season lmfao"
The Lakers will be better off playing Kendrick Nunn or Monk in the playoffs. Westbrick does nothing to help you win In the playoffs
Kendrick Nunn had a 40 point preseason game vs the Rockets in 2019 despite going on to average 15.
Cause it‚Äôs not like the dumbass said it to a Rabbi. Kendrick Nunn plead guilty to domestic abuse yet that is more forgivable than saying a slur once in a non-serious context
But Lakers twitter tried to tell me that Kendrick Nunn is a solid defender
"Yeah. You've got people like Kendrick Nunn in the league, but dudes in r/nba be calling Kyrie a bad person cuz he doesn't want to get vaccinated.      I know, vaccs are a blessing and I got vacced as quickly as possible, but it does not mean that Kyrie magically became a BAD person lol"
nah AD is on a max contract while Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn could easily get at least $5M/yr somewhere else but decided to take the vet min to join the Lakers
Kendrick nunn has had some good looks over the past year as well. Could totally break out
hey we have ring chasers in their 20's too like malik monk and kendrick nunn
"He's been scoring about 15 points to go with that, on ~30 mpg. But even the scouting report says he isn't a true point guard.  https://www.nbascoutinglive.com/kendrick-nunn-scouting-report/  Lakers do need some balhandling skills behind LBJ/WB, (one shouldn't count on Rondo for this), but ""shooting guard"" Malik Monk has more apg in lesser minutes   So they may use THT and a by committee approach, but that doesn't fit the joke."
How about kendrick  Nunn ?
"There was a thread yesterday about who has better potential going forward, Kendrick Nunn(26) or Tyler Herro(21). Easy to say, some people have no idea those two have this big of an age difference."
6'3  Kendrick Nunn was fated to play point guard. They expect that he will get more than his career 1.4 apg  Coz  NUNN SHALL PASS
"The Lakers are 1 ) in Los Angeles , 2 ) title contenders and 3 ) had a lot of roster spots open for guys looking to prove themselves.   Thats why Kendrick Nunn and Malik monk signed there"
"Kendrick Nunn is a better finisher and slightly better defender (just by a grain of sand), but Herro is the better scorer and I think he'll go on to have the better career. You can't go wrong with either one tbh"
"Tyler Herros ceiling is an elite 6th man like a Jordan Clarkson. As for Kendrick Nunn he was a starter for most of the 20-21 season and would of won roty if he didn‚Äôt get covid (he finished 2nd in voting) I can see him being the better player potentially, he was also more consistent and more aggressive then Herro,and I think he‚Äôd have the better career starting with winning a chip (or 2) with Lebron in LA"
"He‚Äôs definitely still better than THT and fuckin Kendrick Nunn lmao. Heat are my team in the East, I had to watch that man eat sweaty ass weekly"
"KD vs Malik Monk, Kyrie vs Kendrick Nunn, Harden vs THT. One for the books no doubt"
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
"well look at it this way, he also didn't fight kendrick nunn for 12 either so thats good right?"
Gonna blame Kendrick Nunn for not offering 12 to D Howard and taking 14 for himself
Kendrick Nunn? Against the Rockets?
"I know if I were running a company and looking for a Laker to endorse my product and/or service, my mind immediately goes to Kendrick Nunn.  Seriously how much do people think the second or third guy off the bench pulls in from Japanese ramen endorsements?"
"Lmao I guess that means Kendrick Nunn the sentient human being has now ceased to exist, and he is now a powerless, inanimate object mind controlled by Rich Paul.   Poor Nunn.   (Am I doing this right?)"
Reddit nephews gotta find a new slant now. Maybe they‚Äôll say he forced Kendrick Nunn to sign with Klutch.
"remember that Dragic was in a botched trade to the Mavs. had to come back to Miami, play through injuries, put up with losing his starting gig to Kendrick Nunn, and was still an absolute fucking warrior for his team and was maybe their second most important player when it mattered. I used to think he was sorta a hot-head idiot but I can't think of a more mature one-time all-star."
"Just something to keep in mind; Dragic is pretty injury prone, even at the height of his powers here in Miami.  Even if he‚Äôs the better player over GTJ, you can still have Goran come off the bench while also finishing games in crunch time. That‚Äôs pretty much what Miami did with Kendrick Nunn and him the past few years."
Well we are missing multiple players due to injury. Kendrick Nunn and ariza haven't played a minute yet
Not when you rely on 36 year old Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn to fix that defense lmao.
"It‚Äôs almost like building a basketball team around three maximum contracts, one 2nd round pick who‚Äôs so young he can‚Äôt even drink legally, and 10 minimum contract players isn‚Äôt a bright idea.   Oh yeah, and the injured guy on the MLE, Kendrick Nunn. A backup point guard, who‚Äôs skillset can‚Äôt be utilized to it‚Äôs full potential on a team that already has two superstar ball-dominant playmakers. He‚Äôs not gonna save the team, unless they trade him for someone who can defend really well."
"I'm guessing by the username: LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Carmelo, THT, Austin Reaves, Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn (when they come back), Wayne Ellington, and LeBron again."
Really their best course of action is to move AD to the 5 when Kendrick Nunn and Ariza come back   Defense is still an issue but without DJ it might be salvageable. Limit Melo‚Äôs minutes to 20 or so unless he‚Äôs hot   And try to hope Monk and/or Nunn can be consistent sharpshooters for them. Also hope Ariza can handle all tough wing assignments   It‚Äôs a stretch that all of this will happen though
How‚Äôs Kendrick nunn for y‚Äôall?
Oh boy! I can‚Äôt wait till 80 year old Trevor Ariza and Kendrick ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù Nunn come to save the day. Lol
"I saw a kid who couldn‚Äôt have been anymore than 7-8 years old in Newcastle, Australia wearing an all red Heat Kendrick Nunn"
"Yeah man, 28th ranked defense gonna be helped by Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Lakers are a borderline play-in team at this point."
"‚ÄúMalik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, THT and Dwight Howard combined for 28 points tonight against the Knicks. Evan Fournier scored 26 points tonight against the Lakers.‚Äù"
Oh boy I can‚Äôt wait until *checks notes*  Old ass Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn bring the Lakers a Championship lol
I am very here for Lakers fans convincing themselves that Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza are the answer
I heard Kendrick Nunn and 90-year-old Trevor Ariza are the keys that will turn this into a championship squad.
I‚Äôm cautiously excited for Kendrick Nunn.
"Kuzma was not seen as a top role player when he was on the Lakers, but now he's an important piece. Literally shot 29% last playoffs  Caruso will be greatly missed, and is an amazing player.  Also they added some good role players to help fill the void. Kendrick Nunn still hasn't played yet, Taken tucker is much better compared to 2 years ago, Malik Monk,  and Carmelo.   Also I wouldn't say lebron is unable to stay healthy q"
"dont expect the lakers big three to play more than four games together , the will ""fake"" and injury to westbrook and then activate kendrick nunn , its all part of the big master plan the lakers and nets are doing to save their star players until the playoffs. I gaurantee you once kyrie comes back harden or durant are going to take some time off, the nba doesnt want to show the big threes untill playoff time or limit the time they play in the regular season."
Ariza isn't the Ariza of 2009. Ariza is 36. Barely played the last few years because of injuries I believe.. was ok on offense in Miami but defense isnt his calling card anymore. And who do everyone think Kendrick Nunn is? Did they not watch him in Miami?
"The other guy being Kendrick Nunn, btw. Who's also hurt."
He stunk. If you‚Äôre playing him significant minutes in the playoffs You ain‚Äôt winning shit. There‚Äôs a reason miami didn‚Äôt keep him. You think contenders or pat Reilly give up on impactful players when they‚Äôre trying to contend?  Like I said if you‚Äôre waiting on a Kendrick Nunn you‚Äôre in trouble. You better figure this shit out with Westbrook.
Kendrick Nunn started almost every game for a team that went to the NBA Finals just two years ago lol
Kendrick Nunn was starting for Miami the year they went to the finals and was right up there with Herro for most impactful rookie until he caught Covid‚Ä¶.  And Malik Monk was a spot starter in Charlotte.  You don‚Äôt watch basketball (1) or are too eager to get your Laker hate out (2) to be taken seriously after that.
"Isn't he tied for 5th with Kendrick Nunn? Only THT, AD, Lebron and Russ earn more this season [(source)](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/)"
"&gt;guess you probably didn‚Äôt know nunn played for the warriors  Nunn as in Kendrick Nunn? He was briefly on your G League team but you never gave him an NBA contract. So no, he never played for the Warriors"
Yeah Kendrick Nunn will save the Lakers
"Interesting how you change your narrative when you know you're wrong  ""Lol why do people keep acting like THT and Kendrick nunn are coming back to save these guys"".  Nice strawman btw. Nobody said they're saving the Lakers season. My point is those guys, plus Bron coming back, and developing chemistry will put the Lakers back at contender status."
Lol you really relying on Kendrick nunn to come turn the ship around? Idk what to tell you bud. He‚Äôs a guy that should play maybe ten minutes per game on an actual contender.
Kendrick Nunn is an end of the bench player? what the fuck are you even talking about
"Lol why do people keep acting like THT and Kendrick nunn are coming back to save these guys. These guys are end of the bench type players. Be like the warriors saying hey don‚Äôt worry, JTA is coming back so we can figure this all out."
"No they didn't. There are rules to trading picks. You can't trade 1 rounders in consecutive years. The 2020 pick went to OKC in the Schr√∂der trade. The 2022 pick will probably belong to the Lakers  unless the Pelicans somehow end up with a better record. THT at 9.5 million is absolutely a tradeable asset, as is Kendrick Nunn at 5."
As a Lakers fan it's pretty disappointing to see the home town fans boo their team. We literally have the most titles and won a chip just 2 years ago. We have a new team trying to figure out how to play together plus our best player is injured right now. Kendrick Nunn and THT are also out so there is definitely players coming to help out soon. Sometimes Lakers fans act like we are the hornets who have never won. When our squad is healthy we are gonna be one of the top title contenders. Like relax people
"If the current position is ""Kendrick Nunn will save us"" the Lakers are power-fucked.  Also, shit, he's 28?  How is he still so fucking soft when he's supposed to be in his prime?"
"I‚Äôm just going to push back a little here.  He was not a good spot up shooter for us and his playmaking was below average.  It‚Äôs true we have no one that can defend like him, that he was a crowd favorite and that the Lakers were somewhat cheap.  But it was going to effectively cost a lot more than the 10M per year to keep him due to luxury tax reasons.    The Lakers replaced him (and KCP) with Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn - who together cost less in salary than what Caruso is getting.  They don‚Äôt have the defense but are both much better options on offense.  Time will tell to see if they really screwed up keeping THT instead."
Is Kendrick Nunn considered a good playmaker?
"Except this is largely affecting the youngest players on the team.   Talent Horton-Tucker: 20 years old (hasn't yet played)  Austin Reaves: 23 years old   Kendrick Nunn: 26 years old (hasn't yet played)  Ariza's injury you can chalk up to age, but it sounds like LeBron and Rondo will probably be back soon. Old guys missing a game here or there with minor injuries is to be expected. What hasn't been expected was all the young guys (except for Monk) missing significant time as well."
Yup you can include Kendrick Nunn as well. I wonder how he differs from Jokic's brothers..
"And Max Strus, Tyler Johnson, Kendrick Nunn, etc etc, and even Haslem himself"
"Sure, but he had a skillset that translated and there was an opportunity for him because of that skillset. I was using him as an example that it's not just defense first guys. It's guys that fill a role as a specialist for a team.   Kendrick Nunn got called up as a score first guard that can attack off the dribble and finish well. Jakarr Sampson got the call up as a 3/4 energy and hustle guy scoring almost exclusively at the rim. Yogi Ferrell got called up as a high energy bench scorer who could also playmake in the PnR and shot it from behind the arc. There's a decent amount of g league players that called up for energy and scoring instead of defense.    Also, Kilpatrick played mostly SG for the Nets, so it wasn't to fill a role at PG because DLo was out but to add perimeter scoring.They still had some Lin and Dinwiddie. Also, Whitehead.   Kilpatrick was/is a bad defender and he's also 32 now. His scoring and shooting, which was his main NBA skill, fell off and those are the main reasons why he's not in the league. Also, he could have a bigger role and make more overseas than fighting for a spot here."
Apparently Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza will save this team
Kendrick Nunn has yet to even play a game with the Lakers because Noone on the entire sub realizes the Lakers have had 3+ rotational players hurt the entirety of the season so far.
"Ah yes who can forget the ""old as shit"" players like 20 year old THT or 26 year old Kendrick Nunn who are the most significant players they have who are missing time"
"The Lakers look like this because they have so many people out right now. I feel like most people forget that Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza are actually part of this team, because they all got hurt in training camp and haven't yet played, but those three will all be major parts of the rotation once they're healthy. They'll be replacing many of the guys who were playing tonight. When you then add AD and LeBron to those guys on the sidelines, the Lakers roster tonight was Westbrook and everyone else is on a vet minimum. Guys who normally won't play at all were getting a lot of minutes tonight.   While all those guys are out injured, people should expect the Lakers to be this bad. They will still be bad even if AD comes back next game. I don't think there's any team in the league who can handle both their best player being out *and* a significant portion of their regular rotation being out. They either need THT and Nunn to come back or LeBron to come back, and until one of those things happens, I fully expect the Lakers to just be really bad. Those three all should be back in a couple weeks though, but the Lakers just need to try to weather the storm as best they can till that happens."
"It's not just LeBron and AD who are out though. The Lakers are also missing their other non-minimum players in Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn, along with Trevor Ariza. People might think those guys aren't great, but without them Melo was the only forward available tonight and Rondo was the only non-Westbrook ball handler for the Lakers. The Lakers desperately need their depth to get healthy along with their stars. With all the guys that are out right now, it really shouldn't be surprising that they're this bad."
"To be fair to the Lakers, Avery Bradley and DeAndre Jordan might very well be out of the rotation entirely when the Lakers get all their injured players back. Bradley was grabbed as a stop gap to tide the Lakers over until Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn are healthy (Bradley's contract isn't guaranteed, so he can just be released if needed). And the Lakers have said they want to play AD more at center, but currently the only forward they had available tonight was Melo, so they kinda have to play Jordan and Dwight.   If you look at the guys the Lakers have who can play forward it's LeBron, AD, Melo, Ariza and THT, and tonight only Melo was available. If you look at who the Lakers have who can handle the ball it's LeBron, Westbrook, Nunn, THT and Rondo, and only Russ and Rondo were available. But they're pretty well set with  bench level shooting guards and centers, so there's that. The Lakers are absolutely decimated in really specific ways and are just scrambling to field even remotely workable lineups. They're gonna be bad until they get some of these players back healthy, there's really no way around that."
"You need to look at who else is out hurt right now, as this is not even close to the Lakers full roster that's playing. Tonight other than Westbrook, every other player who played is on a vet min (except for the 7 minutes AD played with stomach flu). Out of the guys who played, two were two-way players, one is an undrafted rookie, two have non-guaranteed deals, and two were signed to the minimum after being bought out.   The Lakers are scraping the bottom of the barrel right now looking for anyone who can play because 5 of their 7-8 best players are out. So it's not just that the Lakers are missing LeBron and AD, they're also missing Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. There's not many teams that can survive without their best player or two *and* a big chunk of their core rotation. It shouldn't be surprising at all that the Lakers are this bad right now, given all their absences."
"I honestly don't know how anyone can say that for sure yet considering how much of it hasn't even played yet this year. The guys that were playing tonight, sure, that roster is bad, but most of those guys won't be getting minutes once the Lakers are healthy again.   There are 240 available minutes in an NBA game for each team, and right now the Lakers are missing 35 from LeBron, 35 from AD, 25 from Talen Horton-Tucker, 25 from Kendrick Nunn and 20 from Trevor Ariza. That's 140 of 240 total minutes which are out right now (or rather, they got 7 total from those guys tonight because that's all AD played). That's a lot of minutes going to two-way players, undrafted rookies, guys on non-guaranteed contracts, and people on the vet min instead.   So yeah, this lineup we saw tonight that was surrounding Westbrook was definitely bad. No doubt about it. But this isn't the roster the Lakers put in place this summer. This is just all that's left because everyone else is hurt."
"The Lakers definitely don't look good right now, but they have a ton of their core rotation out and have for the entire season. They need to get LeBron and AD back, of course, but they also need Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza to get healthy and finally suit up (none of them have played yet). As a Laker fan I can tell you that the losses or even the way they're playing doesn't bother me, it's the fact that we haven't seen even a close facsimile of what the team will look like once those guys are finally healthy. It's just sucked that they've missed 4-5 core rotation players for literally every game this season."
"Bradley was only picked up because Kendrick Nunn and Talen Horton-Tucker got injured in training camp (along with Trevor Ariza), and because his minimum contract is not guaranteed, so they can release him once the other guys are healthy (if they want to). And I imagine that Jordan will probably fall out of the rotation once the Lakers have Ariza and THT to play forward minutes (in addition to LeBron and Melo, of course), so the Lakers can slide AD back over to center most of the time.   The Lakers are just playing a ton of 9th-15th men on the roster right now because so much of the top 8 are all hurt. That team tonight was Westbrook and all guys on vet minimums. Nobody should expect a roster like that to be any good."
"If someone in the off-season had said ""let me put together a lineup made up exclusively of players on vet minimum contracts and Russell Westbrook"" how good would anyone have expected that team to be? Because other than the 7 minutes AD played tonight, that's exactly what the lineup was.   The Lakers have five players who are making more than the minimum this year, and four of them combined to play 7 minutes tonight. The other one was Russell Westbrook. Everyone else is hurt or had a stomach flu. The Lakers are absolutely decimated by injuries right now, but for whatever reason nobody seems to be aware of it or willing to acknowledge it.   Tonight both of the Lakers two-way players played. They also played their undrafted rookie, Austin Reaves (who only has $100k of his salary guaranteed) 25 minutes tonight. They started a guy on a non-guaranteed minimum contract (Avery Bradley), a guy they claimed off waivers the day before the season started, and he played 23 minutes. Their starting center was salary dumped and bought out this summer, as was their backup point guard (Jordan and Rondo).  They combined to play 33 minutes tonight. Everyone else who played was signed for the vet minimum this summer.   This is not even close to what the Lakers rotation will look like when they are fully healthy, but right now they are missing LeBron, AD, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Ariza will probably only play about 15-20 mpg, but the other guys will probably play 25-40 mpg, and they were all out tonight. If people want to know what is going on with the Lakers, it's quite simple: it's injuries and illness."
You really think Kendrick Nunn is a game changer?
"Kendrick Nunn can actually start. He‚Äôs averaged 15ppg on 37% from 3 his first 2 years, 49% FG last year   Only solution to this"
lakers need to discover some sort of offensive scheme that isn't totally reliant on james doing everything for them. they really need kendrick nunn back because rondo and westbrook just can't run an offense
and start who? Kendrick Nunn? Austin Reeves? Freaking Rondo?
Lakers fans really have all their hopes and dreams riding on THT and fucking Kendrick Nunn LOL
"I'm liking what Austin Reaves is giving us. Unfortunately, when Kendrick Nunn and THT come back, he may not be getting minutes anymore"
"You do need shooting. But you also don‚Äôt need more defensive liabilities. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs redundant.   You‚Äôre comparing Kendrick Nunn a guy who had some scoring in Miami but fell outta the rotation for defense, THT who hasn‚Äôt proven to be reliable as a shooter on a team playing Westbrook and Ariza who‚Äôs the best of the bunch but is for sure not his rockets form , to a former FMVP back where he won it , a guy who was a max contract player like 3 years ago and isn‚Äôt old (just not as healthy recently) , and the 3rd leading bench scorer in the league. Ok.  Also , it sounds like you‚Äôre implying Bazemore who‚Äôs one of the more veteran guards and only hopes on defense and Rondo essentially one of the captains on the team will be outta the rotation. Cause where else is a SG and PG getting time if Nunn and THT play ? Like what‚Äôs the 9 man rotation in a must win game ?"
"What will really help the Lakers is if (when) they get Kendrick Nunn and Talen Horton-Tucker back. LeBron too, of course, but it's just brutal for the Lakers to be missing their other two non-Rondo or Westbrook ball handlers when LeBron gets hurt. They also desperately need Ariza to get healthy, but he'll probably be out another month or more. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the only wing the Lakers have left right now is Melo. The Lakers are just really hurting with all these injuries right now. We haven't yet seen at all a close facsimile of what this team is supposed to look like yet, not even in preseason."
"The thing most people are missing is that much of what they replaced those guys with has yet to play a minute this season. The Lakers have yet to see even one second of play from Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn or Trevor Ariza this season, and two of those guys are likely starters with the third being the 6th or 7th man. They replaced KCP, Kuzma and Caruso largely with those guys and Melo and Westbrook, and since most of them haven't yet played, it's not surprising it looks like the Lakers are missing out."
Yes Kendrick Nunn &amp; Talen Horton Tucker are so old
"Kendrick Nunn, Trevor Ariza, and Wayne Ellington."
Kendrick Nunn ü§îü§îü§î
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
Is 6‚Äô2 Kendrick nunn a good defender ?
"The heat being good now does not disprove they were ""bubble frauds"". They added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker and Victor Oladipo. While also taking away Goran Dragic, Precious Achiuwa and Kendrick Nunn. They aren't the same team anymore."
I‚Äôm far from a THT stan but he should be decent and he hasn‚Äôt played yet. Neither has a Kendrick Nunn. Both guys should be good for this team.
"- Tyler Herro (currently averaging 22.4/6/4.4, leading bench scorer in the NBA)  - Duncan Robinson (extended, enables extensive spacing for two stars who can't shoot even if he's in a slump)  - Precious Achiuwa (used in trade to acquire Kyle Lowry)  - Kendrick Nunn (let go for nothing)  - Salary Filler (would've likely been Goran Dragic &amp; Andre Iguodala, one of which was used in the Lowry trade)  - Two 1st-Round Picks (likely 2022/2024)  - 4 Pick Swaps   this is the king's ransom they asked for Harden."
"Lakers still are not healthy   Still missing Kendrick Nunn, THT and Ariza.   Nunn and THT are great rotation players and ariza might still provide some good Defense here and there."
"i don't think anyone enjoyed last season. not players, not fans, not coaches. there was  - viceversa jerseys were used something like 40% of the season  - couldn't stay away from .500 which is ironic considering our jerseys were half/half themed  - bounced in the first round after game 1 was incredibly promising and gave everyone hope  - everyone gets COVID. except you, kendrick nunn, you get it twice  - Meyers Leonard immediately injures himself after 3 games and then gets on Twitch and goes Full Dickhead   - Bjelica, Ariza and Harkless come here and, to no one's surprise, are NOT changing the landscape of the team in any way  - tangible Goran Dragic regression  - you trade Olynyk and Bradley away for Oladipo and he is immediately injured after he provides the only hope your season's had  - nearly **all** of our young projects (Achiuwa/Okpala/Gabe) decide it's time to Not Pan Out At All In Any Way (not you, Strus, you're great)  and then, after **72** games of this endless nightmare, everyone on every platform calls your team the Bubble Guppies"
Kendrick Nunn was the problem
"Yes you can?  Rookie Luka was worse than Khris Middleton that year, but nobody would have argued if you said Luka's ceiling was higher than Middleton's.  Kendrick Nunn was on an All-Rookie that RJ Barrett wasn't on, but you'd be crazy saying he had a higher ceiling."
Kendrick Nunn and Chris Boucher came through SC as well
But it's mostly their young players who are hurt. THT is 20 and Kendrick Nunn is 26 and neither guy has played yet this year.
THT is 20 and Kendrick Nunn is 26 and neither one has played a second for the Lakers this year. Both would be incredibly valuable for the Lakers right now.
"dragic and nunn were 100% the heat's 2 worst defenders last season.  I believe they got rid of kendrick nunn not because they didnt like him, but because they were addicted him and needed him outta there to improve the defense."
yeah but if you need kendrick nunn and trevor ariza to come save your team that doesn't seem optimal
"Also, the main nuance people are missing in all this piling on with the Lakers is that a huge portion of their lineup is out injured, and has been all year. Maybe that's just people willingly ignoring that fact because it's fun to pile on the Lakers, or maybe they're not even aware of it, I don't know. But the last two games the Lakers have had half their rotation out injured, which obviously puts a huge burden on the guys who are still there, which isn't ideal in a back to back on the road following an overtime game for an older team.   Someone like Melo playing 31 minutes on the second night of a b2b on the road at 37 years of age is definitely not what the Lakers were envisioning this year, but they've been forced into stuff like that (and playing Westbrook and Rondo together, or big minutes for Avery Bradley or unsigned rookie Austin Reaves, etc) simply because they're so thin on bodies right now. Missing LeBron obviously has an impact, but so does missing Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the Lakers only have one wing who's playing (Melo).   It's just a lot for a team that right now is exclusively minimum players outside of AD and Russ. And of course they're also trying to figure out playing together as they don't have any experience doing that. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Lakers are off to a rough start."
Bad example cause FVV is pretty well known even among casuals I would say like Kendrick Nunn
"The most asinine part of it for me is that it's not like anyone needs help figuring out what kind of players to put around LeBron at this point; the formula of shooters + LeBron has been established for over a decade.  Instead the Lakers are relying on Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, and when healthy Wayne Ellington, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor ariza to space the floor because they brought in two non-shooting guards in Russ and Rondo."
Kendrick Nunn was a rotation piece on a Finals team. We know what his value is lol
"Nobody is killing Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn or not having a ring come on now lets be fucking real, that standard is only for super stars."
How can they afford both Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk?
"Thats just flat out absurd.  First off, Knicks haven't even extended a player that they've drafted since 1994. They also just paid a New York premium to lure a player in Evan Fournier for $18m/yr and keep Nerlens for $10.7/yr  Second, Miami just signed Duncan Robinson to $90m and lost Kendrick Nunn for nothing.  Finally, Hawks just drafted Jalen Johnson. I hope the highest of hopes that we re-sign JC to $125m/5 and think its beyond fair, especially if we structure it well. But if there were a single guy that I would choose to replace JC someday? Its Jalen Johnson.  Hawks also landed several of the hottest FAs last season in Gallinari, Bogi, and Rondo  Your comment has little to no basis and is grounded entirely in the faulty perception of media's ""big market"" clickfarm bs"
"Decent player, [bad person](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2625652-kendrick-nunn-charged-with-domestic-battery-latest-details-and-comments)"
"I mean Steve Nash, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone are pretty big names. Artest certainly a better player than Kendrick Nunn. Not to mention, the league seemingly has gotten more ring chasy in the last 5 or so years it seems.   The Knicks point is just not relevant at all, they don't have lebron james or Anthony Davis. The nets on the other hand just got Blake on the cheap and would have had Lamarcus last year if not for his condition. Plus, I've never lived in LA but I have lived in BK, some of those winter days arent too pleasant, I imagine its a bit nicer in LA then on Atlantic ave when its 15 degrees out. The clippers are the clippers, there's an obvious allure to being on the Lakers over them, plus players very likely perceive the lakers as the better team (as do I)"
Kendrick nunn
I don't understand the salt. Who did we sign that is changing things?   Is Carmelo 27 again? Is Dwight 26? Is Marc Gasol going to decide to show up before the playoffs this year? Carmelo Anthony is like 40.   Kendrick Nunn? Malik Monk? Kent Bazemore?   I'm confused.
Why wouldn‚Äôt the same players go to LA (or whoever) still to win? They would just get 10M instead of 2M from the Lakers. It‚Äôs not like Kendrick Nunn or Carmelo are gonna get 30 somewhere.
Add Kendrick Nunn -- he turns 26 years old today. Happy Birthday!
"How do we feel about this two+ hours later and Lakers have added Melo, Malik Monk, and Kendrick Nunn?  Lakers could still retain Schroeder as well considering how much the market has cratered."
yup. I guarantee yall will be talking about kendrick nunn an exponential amount more than if he gone to any other team. Including the nets or knicks
Fuck Kendrick Nunn
Lol Kendrick Nunn is like the only decent 22 year old who is gonna opt to take a pay cut instead of getting as much money as possible. Quit your crying lmao.
"Who actually took a paycut? Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn could have been *restricted free agents*. Who was paying Bazemore, Dwight, Ellington, or Melo more than the minimum? If it was more than the minimum it wasn't going to be much more."
Here comes Kendrick Nunn with his magnum dong
Wow lakers landed Kendrick nunn? Awesome
"We really got Westbrook and Kendrick Nunn, bye bye Dennis lol"
Yeah it‚Äôs personal y‚Äôall bash on the Lakers every fucking season calling them old or washed or garbage but because your team can‚Äôt attract Kendrick Nunn of all players we‚Äôre ruining basketball somehow according to OP
Kendrick Nunn is Dr Mantis Tobaggon. Just coming in for the scraps
How is it fair that the Lakers get a bunch of vets nut-hugging LeBron to chase a ring but now they've gotten good young players in  Malik Monk &amp; Kendrick Nunn taking less money to ring-chase in LA as well? How does this not piss off most fans &amp; front offices in the league? They are stacking the friggin deck.
"definitely, first boogie and lance stephenson, now avery bradley and kendrick nunn. they‚Äôve got a nice little roster of alleged women beaters going. there‚Äôs that mamba mentality for you"
Kendrick Lamar Nunn with Kent Chanc3 Bazemore
Well they just gave the MLE to Kendrick Nunn so that‚Äôs no longer an option unless Danny wants the minimum
Am i missing anyone?  lebron james  anthony davis  russell westbrook  talen horton tucker  kendrick nunn  malik monk  kent bazemore  carmelo anthony  trevor ariza  dwight howard  marc gasol  wayne ellington jr  alfonzo mckinnie (non-guaranteed)
Lets not forget the Kendrick Nunn beat the shit out of his girlfriend
This is what I mean when I say the Knicks are not as big of a free agent destination as their market size indicates. They're the biggest market in the league and get rejected by Kendrick Nunn lmao
Kendrick Nunn ring chasing in his 3rd year. Imma start watching Euro League
**Minimums**  ___  * Trevor Ariza  * Kent Bazemore  * Wayne Ellington  * Dwight Howard  * Carmelo Anthony  * Malik Monk  **MLE**  * Kendrick Nunn  **RE-SIGNED**  * Talen Horton-Tucker

Kendrick Nunn   Carmelo Anthony   Malik Monk  Dwight Howard   Trevor Ariza  Wayne Ellington  Kent Bazemore  My Guys ring chasing hard
Kendrick Nunn holy shit
Kendrick Nunn can get paid elsewhere tbh. Green is the most likely scenario in my eyes
"DeRozan, Schroeder, Kawhi, John Collins, Oubre, Reggie Jackson, Markkanen, Kendrick Nunn"
Kendrick Nunn   Dennis Schroder
Yea he definitely deserves more than the mid level. Maybe Kendrick nunn?
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
"I would love to have Reggie Jackson come to Miami in a sign-and-trade for Kendrick Nunn and be a backup PG for Lowry, but he deserves a starter role."
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left

"The only way the Heat can get DeRozan now is a S&amp;T involving Kendrick Nunn or Andre Iguodala.   Regardless even with DeMar, I wouldn't even say we are top 3 Title favorites."
Why would the Spurs do that though? With the Raptors possibly wanting more than Dragic and Precious why would the Spurs have any interest in Iggy and KZ? Also I don‚Äôt think Iggy is gonna get a deal that matches his 15 mil this season so that doesn‚Äôt match salaries. Spurs would probably do it for Duncan or maybe Kendrick Nunn. But there‚Äôs no incentive to do a S&amp;T for Iggy
If I‚Äôm the Raps I‚Äôd rather have Kendrick Nunn???
"Kendrick Nunn too, technically. BP3 was on the spurs for a hot second."
"The regular season doesn‚Äôt matter, playoffs do. kendrick nunn hasn‚Äôt even had a playoffs close to reggies"
