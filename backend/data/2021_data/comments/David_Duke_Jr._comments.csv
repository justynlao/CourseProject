"i wonder how they'll manage to move DJ's contract.  they do need the roster spot, although they can still cut 3 non-gauranteed guys (sorry david duke jr!)  but unless they attach some promising cheap year player to the trade, I'd assume they'd need to give up draft compensation to move off him.  and they have no FRPs for a very long time, and barely any SRPs either.  and the SrPs they have may be some of the crappiest ones available if all goes well."
because there probably aren't teams that want him at $10M/yr for 2 more years.  they might need the roster slot if david duke jr works out for them and they don't put him on a two-way.
wait until you find out about David Duke Jr
David Duke Jr. in shambles

"That was nice n all... but this dude David Duke Jr, is actually pretty nice."
"&gt;Also I promise you there are more Theodore Kaczynskis in the world and more Charles Mansons as well. Maybe even some Jeffrey Dahmers.  In all these cases, if they were named after their respective assholes became famous, the parents were moronic to chose that name. Ignorance is no excuse because there are many methods of checking (the internet, library, or a friend who doesn't live under a rock) that are all remarkably easy. Plus if he's a David Duke Jr, pretty hard to imagine they didn't know.   &gt;But even if they did, there’s something to be said for reclaiming the name from this racist asshole. Why should the name David Duke forever be forbidden because of one piece of shit who wasn’t even that important? He’s evil, but It’s elevating his profile to a degree that he doesn’t deserve to say his name is forever off limits a la adolf hitler.  To me, that's a selfish mentality to have. You might have some vision about taking back the name, but you're choosing a baby to own that fight forever. Maybe they'll become an NBA player with a chance to take it back, but most likely they'll be a normal person who gets really sick of the stupid name you gave them."

"You don’t know anything about this kid’s parents. There are a ton of people in this country who have never heard of David Duke the klansman, and the kid’s name is David Duke Jr. for God’s sake, so clearly there was a reason for it."
"Yeah, let's be honest, someone who wears the title of ""Grand Wizard"" cannot possibly have a claim on a name for the collective memory.  David Duke Jr., a cool black dude from here on out."
"His parents are from war-torn Liberia. Not to mention, he's David Duke Jr., so really you should blame his grandparents for not being able to see the future when they named their son (his dad) David"
David Duke Jr looked nice. Very scrappy player. Shame he didn’t get the ball much with Brandon Knight ball hogging. Cam and Duke Jr should be the starting back court next game.
"Looks like his dad's name is also David, and he's actually David Duke Jr. Which explains why they would give him that name and why he wouldn't want to change it."
"Worst part is he's David Duke Jr, meaning his dad passed the name down to his own son. Brutal."
"Yo, somebody really named their kid David Duke Jr?"
