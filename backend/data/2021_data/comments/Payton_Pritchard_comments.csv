"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."

[Yuta Watanabe vs. Payton Pritchard](https://youtu.be/RwzEa0D3PEo)
"Payton Pritchard pleasant, Jeff Teague unpleasant. The bench would be Semi Ojeleye pleasant, Tristan Thompson unpleasant.  I expected a leap (still, not this big) from Jaylen so I don‚Äôt really think he fits this, tho he is close. I had no expectations for Payton and I expected Semi to be getting 0 minutes. I expected Teague to be a solid backup and Tristan to be a solid starter. All four of no where close to accurate so far."
"2020 was the supposed ""quiet"" draft but it's really produced a ton of great rookies  the top 3 all look solid Tyrese Maxey  Immanuel Quickly  Tyrese Haliburton  Payton Pritchard  That's at least 7 solid NBA players with some of them showing star potential. Then there are still dudes like Cole Anthony, Deni Avidja, Desmond Bane. Like 10 players that might make a career is a pretty good draft. It's definitely no 2018 but the potential still has yet to fully reveal itself."
Plus no Payton Pritchard
Payton Pritchard is arguably better than old Kemba Walker or at least close.
Payton Pritchard type pass

Payton Pritchard about to come back on a revenge tour.
"This is like the third or fourth time this season I have been absolutely infuriated with the coaching and I feel like it would be fair to blame the loss on that. The lineup management is terrible. Theis playing 12 minutes is ridiculous. Last year we always kept two of our guys out there (the Jays, Kemba, and Gordon). Replace a Gordon with Smart. But no, we never want to do what works instead we want to outsmart the other team and we end up outsmarting ourselves. Terrible man. The Nets game we were close in, but we kept Payton Pritchard in for like 10/12 minutes when he was getting scored on every other possession. The Knicks score can explain itself. And not even the first Pistons game when we lost, that was more so our players just not playing well, but the second one. We won by 2 but we should have won by 20. I‚Äôm sorry but if this isn‚Äôt fixed I wouldn‚Äôt be sad if Brad was fired."
Payton Pritchard
Payton Pritchard in shambles
"Giannis needs a confident playmaker PG. Too much pressure on him now to be the man. That boy is meant to flow and fly. I‚Äôd like to see a Payton Pritchard type player as his sidekick running pick and rolls all day. Fast, creative, efficient. Please basketball gods give it to me."
Payton Pritchard looks like a kid that would ask you if have any games on your phone
**Payton Pritchard** (26th pick) has been awesome. Absolute 3pt sniper as promised (42% on 3 attempts per game) and is surprisingly good on defense. Has already earned himself big minutes on this roster.    **Aaron Nesmith** (14th pick) on the other hand has been uh...pretty bad. He's a turnstile on defense and is bricking everything. He was drafted to be a 3pt sniper but is currently 3/16 from 3 in his career and is not part of the rotation. He was a healthy DNP in tonights game vs Philly.    Overall i'm pretty whelmed. Wish we used the 14th pick on someone else. I was screaming for Maxey or Bey pre draft and they've both thoroughly outplayed Nesmith so far.
No I meant Payton pritchard lol it seemed like he and shake has a good battle for a few minutes
Payton Pritchard fucking smoked the Raptors in his one game against us this season. Makes sense he's an ex teammate of Boucher's.
"Also it's not like his college career was shabby by any means. That U of O Ducks team that made it to the Final Four and lost to eventual champs North Carolina by a point had a helluva squad. If Boucher wasn't injured I'm pretty confident they would've made it to the championship game at least. That team also had Jordan Bell (who sadly flamed out after that 1st chip got to his head), Dillon Brooks, and the Celtic's favorite rookie Payton Pritchard.  They weren't bad the previous year either, losing to Oklahoma in the Elite Eight when Buddy Hield looked like the second coming of Steph Curry.  Those were the best Ducks basketball squads in recent history."
"Are we talking about the Payton Pritchard that‚Äôs averaging 8-3-3 and has scored 20 points one time? I mean sure he looks better than anyone expected, but he‚Äôs not in the same group as Tatum and Brown yet lol"
Never insult Payton Pritchard
"He did that this year with Payton Pritchard and the return (at least so far) has been promising, idk why he was so opposed to it in the past - given that picks in the 20s rarely pan out so why not go with a higher floor player."
"Payton Pritchard: Awesome! He‚Äôs very aggressive on offense and a great playmaker for our bench, which we‚Äôve really been lacking the last few seasons. He shows a lot of intensity on the court  Aaron Nesmith: Definitely has been struggling. It‚Äôs much too early to give up on him yet obviously. His shot just hasn‚Äôt been falling, but he has a really nice stroke and I think he‚Äôll get used to the NBA eventually. He seems like a really smart guy and I‚Äôm wondering if he‚Äôs overthinking things a bit on the court"

"They are now meant to do all the official heights and weights at the start of the season but I don‚Äôt think that happened in the short off season.   A bunch of these rookie heights are all off. Payton Pritchard has been listed as 6‚Äô1‚Äù, 6‚Äô2‚Äù, and 6‚Äô3‚Äù.   I wanna know what he really is. Also a bunch of players don‚Äôt seem to have wingspan measurements."
"Do we need Kemba if we have Payton ""Kemba Walker"" Pritchard?"
celtics rookie payton pritchard is older than jayson tatum.
What till they hear about Payton Pritchard
Payton Pritchard is the rich man‚Äôs Shabazz Napier and poor man‚Äôs Malcolm Brogdon
"Theis is your starting C, my dude. Teague is at best a league average backup PG, normally that would be dinwiddie for us but he tore his ACL. With kyrie/harden/kd, we don‚Äôt really need a backup 1 guard because they can all handle the ball. Brown, shamet, and green are all viable players off the bench, and we have 3 spots that we can fill with buyout players/vets.   I‚Äôm not gonna even bother talking about ‚ÄúHUGE‚Äù leaps from ... *checks notes* semi ojeleye through 10 games this year, or payton pritchard. If your team actually has either of those guys getting big minutes in playoff rotations, it says enough about your team."
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"this season's heroes, Payton Pritchard and semi ojeleye. just like we all expected"
Payton Pritchard
"&gt; **9 Payton Pritchard has a nose for the ball**  &gt; Where would the Celtics be without Pritchard? They are plus-45 in his 229 minutes, and minus-27 in the remaining 251 minutes. All but nearly 50 of Pritchard's minutes have come with one of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, but not both, meaning Pritchard has been crucial in Boston's offense staying afloat in minutes that are precarious without Kemba Walker.  &gt; The Celtics have gutted out a 7-3 record despite outsourcing opponents by just 18 points total. They have four wins by five or fewer points. Scrounging games you maybe shouldn't pays off in playoff seeding.  &gt; Pritchard is active on defense, with a knack for anticipating when it is safe to gamble for steals. Turn your back on him in some location Pritchard deems non-threatening, and beware a Pritchard sneak.  &gt; There are guys who read the game at such a high level -- and move fast enough -- that for them, gambling isn't really gambling. They have an edge. They count cards, basically. Manu Ginobili was a card-counter. What was reckless for most was not so for him because he operated one step ahead.  &gt; Pritchard might be a card-counter. He's averaging two steals per 36 minutes -- an elite number."
"The last four first-rounders you guys selected with those ""valuable"" draft picks are Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard. Come on, dude."
Payton Pritchard is older than Jayson Tatum
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
His name is Payton Pritchard and he can't help that he looks that way.
"I mean, this Payton Pritchard guy is pretty good. A good amount of them players come directly from their draft picks (Tatum, Brown, Williams, Theis, Ojeleye, Edwards, Smart). Basically a 70% of their players were drafted by them"
Good for him.  Harden(in this case) is a top 40 player of all time the very least.  Payton Pritchard shouldn't be untouchable in a potential Harden trade.  That is laughable.
Payton Pritchard as an untouchable asset is a joke.
"&gt; It would've had to start with Marcus Smart, and most likely Payton Pritchard who are both untouchable.  Okay so it probably would have had to start with Brown and to suggesat both Smart and Payton Prichard (what the fuck?) are untouchable is laughable."
"It would've had to start with Marcus Smart, and most likely Payton Pritchard who are both untouchable. Smart move by Ainge"
"I wonder what players got enough playing time to be on this list? Deni, Maxey, and Payton Pritchard have been impressive too just haven't got the playing time."
Payton Pritchard
"Boston. Jayson, Jaylen, Kemba, Timelord, a random player on a 28 million contract, marcus smart, and Payton Pritchard"
Time for Danny to swoop in with Payton Pritchard and a second for Harden. Might be an overpay though.
"Sixers fans can complain all they want, the real conspiracy is Adam Silver delaying games to stop the Payton Pritchard hype."
Let me introduce you to Payton Pritchard.
"i know this is a payton pritchard post, but as a UNC alum, fuck Jalek Felton. He knowingly gave herpes to multiple girls while he was there. It wasn‚Äôt really a secret either. I can‚Äôt really provide any concrete evidence obviously but i know it was more than just a rumor because it was MULTIPLE allegations and then he mysteriously stopped playing for us. That was the reason he left, and he also was just so mediocre. Fuck em."
I think my upstairs apartment neighbor is Celtics Rookie Payton Pritchard.
is this fr payton pritchard
"Curry, Lillard, Payton Pritchard, FastPP, and P Rabbit are all streets ahead of Kyrie"
Don‚Äôt disrespect my boy Payton Pritchard.
"Horford to Toronto is pretty interesting. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in the running for Hill. Payton Pritchard has turned out to be a really good bench PG, especially for a rookie and Brad Stevens trusts Jeff Teague with reckless abandon. Plus, we still have our tiny toons guards.  We need another wing to be honest. Semi Ojeleye has actually been very good this season so far but after him and the Jays, it‚Äôs pretty barren. Javonte Green is an exciting deep bench guy but he shouldn‚Äôt be getting many minutes, we don‚Äôt know if Romeo Langford will be able to stay healthy and Nesmith just isn‚Äôt ready to contribute yet (he looks fine, just needs to be in the nba system to catch up to the game).  Plus, Danny ainge almost NEVER makes roster adjustments mid-season outside of 10-day contracts."
"Imagine if Payton Pritchard was a Laker,"
"Payton Pritchard, right?"

"Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard have both really impressed defensively. Jaylen has made big improvements and Payton is one of the better defending rookies I‚Äôve seen in recent memory.  The rest of the team hasn‚Äôt looked as hot, though that‚Äôs partly because we‚Äôre still experimenting with some weird lineups."
Payton Pritchard has actually been a solid defender thus far.
PAYTON PRITCHARD FOR ROOKIE OF THE YEAR GET HYPE
Watch out for my boy Payton Pritchard.
Payton Pritchard
"Well you can look at the Celtics, if Brown, Ojeleye and Green are out due to safety protocols related to Tatum's positive case.   They'd be looking at Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Jeff Teague, Marcus Smart, Tremont Waters, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall.  That's 6 guards 6'4 and under (4 under 6'1), Theis and Fall.  0-7 waiting to happen in the next two weeks if they're forced to play and Brown, Ojeleye and Green are held out."
The Payton Pritchard disrespect
Payton pritchard ks definiteyl exceeding expectations
"Surprising: Payton Pritchard. Dude is a legit NBA player. Maybe not a starter yet, but I would be perfectly happy with him as my 6th man   Disappointing: Theis. His shooting has been awful and that was the benefit of having him over other centers. The only reason he should be playing right now is our depth sucks"
"MS- Payton Pritchard, MVP in Hustle  MD- Kemba, cause he‚Äôs not playing"
"Surprising: Payton Pritchard, looks like a contributor right off the bat, and has so many quality parts to his game that shows he can be a rotational piece for years to come   Disappointing: Jeff Teague, he had 1 great game but I expect more of an offensive spark off the bench. I know he has a left ankle injury at the moment but I expect him to average 15 a game this season, he‚Äôs only averaging 7 at the moment."
"Clearly it's Payton Pritchard, and I am in no way, shape, or form biased at all"
Is Payton Pritchard better than Lebron? Hot takes here
"Brad Stevens should start Payton Pritchard. Until Smart learns to make smart passes, shoot rational shots, and reduce turnovers, Pritchard should start. Pritchard is way better at drawing off defenders and creating an open shot for others. He also makes consistently good passes and knocks down his shots at a high field goal percentage, better than Marcus. And Teague has as little seniority as Pritchard and can‚Äôt finish at the rim."
Payton Pritchard has really been putting in great shifts as back up pg.
Get Payton Pritchard the damn ball more!
"Payton Pritchard is the greatest player in NBA history, maybe ever"
"eh i wouldnt call Payton pritchard a steal, he can be a decent backup at best"
"Ah come on, not even a brief mention of Payton Pritchard"
Payton Pritchard disrespect is unforgivable.
"Payton Pritchard will win ROY... I just say this about every Celtics rookie, Tacko almost had it last year"
Payton Pritchard isn‚Äôt anywhere near as good as Haliburton.
Similar to how the Payton Pritchard pick was so criticized and now he‚Äôs been a super valuable role player for them.

"Well duh...  Payton Pritchard was the 26th pick in the 2020 draft.  He was a 2X All Pac-12 selection, a Cousy Award winner for top PG in the country, and was a concensus All-American in his last season.    Alex Caruso was not only undrafted, he didn't even make ESPN's top 100 NBA prospects list for 2017.  His only award was his selection to the All SEC Defensive team in 2015-2016.  Nobody ever expected him to become an NBA player.      It's pretty damn based on Pritchard's college career that he should be a superior player than Caruso.  but that's no slight on Caruso who has proven to be a solid player for the Lakers, especially defensively in closing out games."
Didn't Payton Pritchard also do the same thing to Siakam only a few day ago? Is there a reason he's so vulnerable to this move?

Welcome to the All-Star squad Payton Pritchard üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Payton Pritchard.  He's not as good as Haliburton but holy shit does he play like a polished vet.
"Idk man anything that‚Äôs not the two star wings of course, Kemba and hopefully Smart (although I think whoever we did a deal with would want him)   Seems like after that the most remaining value is Rob Williams And Payton Pritchard. I love both of those guys very much, but for Vuc I might have to drive em to the airport"
Payton Pritchard already a star
Isn‚Äôt Payton Pritchard close to that?
"Ish Smith, Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams and Daniel Theis."
Payton Pritchard the rookie is older than Jayson Tatum.
The Celtics will win If Payton Pritchard and Semi Ojeleye have anything to say about it
I can‚Äôt explain how hateful my message was going to be about Payton Pritchard not being on this list if I didn‚Äôt double check.
Sure made Payton Pritchard and Semi Ojeleye better against us  I‚Äôd like to see Semi get 20+ points without them
It's more than Ainge always drafts the same players and never goes for high upside.  He either takes the undersized big man or the gritty wing. Payton Pritchard has been a real anomaly.
What about my man Payton Pritchard currently shooting 93.8% from the line? The disrespect smh
im saying saying alex caruso could start is like saying payton pritchard could. yall just love the scrappy ones
Payton Pritchard does kind of resemble Lisa Ann
"I mean, Tatum had COVID and several other players missed time due to health &amp; safety protocols as well.  Plus Kemba missed the beginning of the season and is still working his way back.  Payton Pritchard had an MCL injury.  Also Marcus Smart tore his calf and has missed a huge chunk of the season.  Dallas might've gotten more wrecked by COVID, but not like the Celtics have had perfect health either."
Payton Pritchard.
"I don't buy that roleplayers are garbage excuse.   If the Celtics roleplayers are garbage, why do they ALWAYS seem to go off against us? Different players every game too.  Aaron Baynes shat on us randomly one game, and then proceeded to almost lose his game once joined our team.   Last year it was Timelord and Brad Wannamaker.   This year it's been Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard. Their rookie has already given us the business while our rookie has been forced to slowly go about his business.  Truthfully, the Celtics are still figuring it out this season, just like a bunch of other top East teams have had to. This season is no different for them than it is for us, Miami, Milwaukee etc."
"Langford actually showed a ton of promise on the defensive end. He just needs to stay healthy and he should be a rotational player which at pick 14 is great. Nesmith too, he's played really good since he's been in the lineup. Also he hit on Payton Pritchard at 26."
"First of all, Wiseman didn‚Äôt get a decreased role as he is playing the same amount of minutes as he always had. You keep bringing up he‚Äôs getting benched but in reality his role is still the same bc he still is playing more min than Looney who is the starting center. 2nd, his numbers are as good as they appear and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an anomaly to me that he‚Äôs playing so few minutes. I understand that in bad games, he should play little min but why is he playing so few min in good games as well? My main point is that Wiseman playing so few min is not his fault. You act like it‚Äôs his fault he‚Äôs not playing so few min when I disagree heavily. I think he‚Äôs performing better than rookies that are averaging more minutes than him like payton pritchard, Saddiq Bey, Cole Anthony, killian hayes, Isaac okoro, etc. I really think that the only rookies performing better than him that are averaging more minutes are Lamelo and Haliburton. I don‚Äôt see how Wiseman is playing so bad to the point where he deserves less minutes than those other guys."
"That's true, although we do have the advantage of being a bigger market team who has notable free agency signings the last few years, as well as a pretty open cap sheet once kemba's contract is up. Additionally due to our youth, we have guys like rob williams and payton pritchard who have potential to be very good pieces around our two stars, as well as all of our own picks to make a deal with. I certainly like our position in comparison to the blazers, although we I wish the results we be a bit quicker."
This sub should be ignored when it comes to basketball analysis. r/nba prioritizes the same beaten dead horse over anything about the game.   What was Ainge supposed to do? Lose Kyrie and Rozier in the same offseason for nothing to play who exactly? Look at their bench. You want Teague to be a starting PG (puke)? Payton Pritchard clearly isn‚Äôt ready to run an offense. Kemba was the smart move at the time. People were jerking that move off anyways when it happened. Now they‚Äôre all acting like Captain Hindsight himself.   Check out the Gordon Hayward threads.   (Fuck the Celtics forever and always)
"Immanuel Quickley was a steal. I think Payton Pritchard was too, or will definitely prove to be."
"Expectations were too high, I'm honestly not at all surprised with the struggles so far. We knew Kemba would take a while to return (and he has been worse than expected for sure but he was a question mark heading into the season), our bench offense was horrific last season and only got worse without Hayward, who would often lead 2nd units. Add in the Smart injury and 15-15 sounds about right.  There are a lot of positives to the season: Jaylen took a huge step, Payton Pritchard looks like a future rotation piece, Robert Williams looks amazing at times, Semi Ojeleye sometimes looks like an actual NBA player on the court, Theis is still Mr. Underappreciated and his three ball has been terrific.  I'm not ""worried"" in the sense that I didn't expect this team to compete for a championship this season; my preseason prediction was the 5th seed and we are a half game behind that. Losing Hayward was huge, it would be foolish for people to expect us to just carry on like we did last season without him.  I think Danny Ainge is going to re-evaluate the roster and use the trade exception in the offseason, not at the trade deadline this year. Kemba is the key to the future -- he has to either start playing better and quickly, or we *have* to find a way to unload his contract."
"In a season where both Jays are averaging career highs in points &amp; assists and still improving on the already high level they were each at and where Marcus Smart was playing the best ball of his career pre-injury I am not that disappointed even if their W/L record isn't where I'd like it to be.  Not to mention the progress from Time Lord and the fact that Payton Pritchard looks like a solid rotational player that the Celtics have under contract at a lower annual number than Jeff Teague makes this year for the next 4 seasons.  There's still tons of time left in this year, too."
"It's complicated because to be honest, we're not a bad team on paper when healthy. The reason we always seem to get off to a hot start and then suddenly cool off is because all of a sudden our rotation gets decimated. We've just had shit luck in regards to freak injuries for like 4 years now, but I genuinely believe that we're one elite scorer from being a team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs when healthy sort of like the Bubble Heat. Assuming Fournier leaves this year via trade or free agency, a healthy Magic team has (guaranteed) Fultz, Isaac, Gordon, and Vucevic as starters, with Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Chuma Okeke, and Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. That's a pretty good core, but obviously right now we're running MCW, Gary Clark, Dwayne Bacon and James Ennis. If we could get that elite scorer, we would be idiots to trade players like Vucevic and Gordon to tank.  You also have to remember that Orlando isn't gonna pull many big names through trades or free agency any time soon, as we haven't had any real success in a decade. Pretty much any offer we get for Vucevic would be a bad trade on our part for us. Unfortunately for Celtics fans, we're not trading Vuc for Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and a couple seconds.  Finally, right now the East is too wide open to tank. While Fultz and Isaac are gone, Gordon and Anthony should return, and Steve Clifford and our FO wouldn't commit to tanking unless we had no shot at the playoffs, and we're only a couple games out."
"When I think of Chris Boucher, I cry.  A team with Payton Pritchard, Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, Tyler Dorsey and him would have won the national championship."
"Even more annoying when you remember that we neutralized the J‚Äôs in the second game, only to get dummied by Payton Pritchard and Semi fucking Ojeleye."
"Romeo Langford is a great prospect. Sixers were patient with Embiid and it paid off, and I think Ainge will take that approach with Langford and his talent will eventually shine through.  Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith are good prospects.  Brown, Tatum, and Smart have great contracts. Only Tatum is getting the max and that was a no-brainer.  Celtics still own all of their own draft picks and have the biggest TPE in league history, a major asset.  This year isn't make-or-break for the Celtics necessarily. They may not be a true title contender with Hayward gone and Kemba in decline (although he might still have something in the tank), but they are still extremely well-positioned for the future. It's doubtful whether Ainge has any moves that could instantly vault them to contender status without also compromising the future. The most sensible move is probably to hold their cards and make use of the full TPE in the offseason, hopefully making a strong push for contention in 2022."
Payton ‚ÄòThe Tualatin Trebuchet‚Äô Pritchard
Jeremy Lamb and Ish Smith. Payton Pritchard is gonna join the list pretty soon.
"There is 0 way the Celtics give up a Jay for Beal so this is the best package I could think of. You get Timelord who is a promising young player, Langford who‚Äôs already an Elite defender and one of the greatest finishers in college basketball history, and Nesmith who over the past 3 games (he‚Äôs been getting real minutes lately) has been playing very very well with infinite energy and the highest plus minus on the team in those games. Kemba is for Salary matching purposes and it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a terrible player. He‚Äôs been averaging 22 on 50 40 90 over the past few games. The picks will definitely be late 1st rounders but it‚Äôs not like those picks won‚Äôt convey into good players. As an example look at Payton Pritchard, Timelord, Keldon Johnson, White, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and more. The real question is if another team would put forth a better offer to beat this one. They‚Äôd need to give big salary pieces that are still young and those big salaries are the Fox‚Äôs, Tatum‚Äôs, and Brown‚Äôs of the world and I don‚Äôt think the teams will be willing to give them up."

In terms of value:  1. Payton Pritchard  2. Picks after 2024  3. Picks before 2024  4. Romeo Langford  5. Rob Williams  6. Aaron Nesmith  7. Basically the rest of the bench  8. Danny Ainge‚Äôs celebrity chipotle card   We ended up using most of the picks we had after the mass exodus from 2019-2020
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren‚Äôt NBA players I guess"
Drafts Payton Pritchard at 26  *Ainge had been making dumbass decisions
"In the past four drafts, the Celtics have had 10 first round picks. Two were Jaylen and Jason, great picks in the top 5.  The remaining 8 picks turned into Yabu, Romeo Langford, Ante Zizic, Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. And some future picks.   You're saying they couldn't have done any better with EIGHT first round picks than that collection of bench players I listed above??"
But the Magic aren't making the playoffs this season and are almost certainly not making it next season with two integral players coming off significant injuries and Vuc another year longer.  I am not a Celtics fan but think Payton Pritchard probably has more value than you credit him for. I think it's a reach to assume you can get a first round pick and a solid prospect and salary relief for Vuc in two years when he'll be 32 and not look nearly as good.  But the real value for the Magic is in getting worse and lowering their worst possible outcome for the draft. Vuc dragging them to the 12th seed does nothing for them.
"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
"Payton Pritchard saw Jurassic Park and hated the Raptors, so he always makes sure to get his revenge against the Raptors.   Jayson Tatum loved Harry Potter as a boy, so he goes easy on the Wizards in order to show his appreciation."
Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard go off for career highs against us to beat us and then they go and lose to the Pistons and the Wizards?   What???
don‚Äôt make me send Payton Pritchard to teach you another lesson
"DA has had a bunch of misses but this is a total shitpost. No details, names, or recognition of DA having been there for a lot longer than 4 years.   This idea has been covered fuckload of times. You can make cases that DA as OP has tried to do, or you can say he has a better success rate than most GMs given how often players fall out of the league.   DA in recent memory drafted Smart, Terry Roizer, Tatum, Brown, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Rondo, Grant Williams..."
The odds of getting an impact player aren‚Äôt very good in that range.  The odds of never hitting a starter level player out of that many selections is also low.  Payton Pritchard might be starting in two years.

Payton Pritchard disrespect is insane. He‚Äôs making a serious rookie of the year case and has the highest net rating among all rookies. Not to shabby for the 26th pick.
Are you really about to disrespect Rookie of The Year candidate and Rookie net rating leader Payton Pritchard like that?
When you study for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown but you get Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard on the test.

If you think there have only been two Payton Pritchard posts you haven't been on /r/NBA. Go search Payton Pritchard right now.
"Yeah, instead we can get more Payton Pritchard posts from the Celts fans!"
"We talk about the war chest of assets like he didn‚Äôt do anything with it but that‚Äôs blatantly false. With that war chest he drafted 3 cornerstones in Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart. One high end rotation player in Payton Pritchard. Two high potential young guys in Nesmith and Langford. 3 solid 20 min a night guys in Timelord, Ojeleye, and Williams. To go with that he also traded some of the chest for Kyrie which sadly didn‚Äôt go well."
"Yeah the celtics definitely would have had to trade brown or tatum to get a star, it's not like they have wasted 7 first round picks on Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Matisse Thybulle (traded), Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Desmond Bane (traded) in the past 3 years üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

Where the fuck is Payton Pritchard
Javonte green and Payton Pritchard
"I think that this team is better than last years ECF team because Kemba is the same, Tatum has improved, Jaylen has improved greatly, having Fournier is better than not having Hayward, Robert Williams is now a top center, we added Payton Pritchard (who is better than Wanamaker), and we added Thompson who is better than Kanter. We also have clear improvements from guys like Semi Ojeleye compared to last year. On paper we are definitely a better team than the ECF one last year."
"Damn, so it really is you, Payton Pritchard"
So Payton Pritchard?
"I know, right? He should have said Gordon Hayward and Payton Pritchard"
"Harden sees the defensive focus on him and not on his teammates and he can just string the defense along and pass to the right person/make the right play. Furthermore, Brad Stevens knows Nurse's style and actually goes along with it. He knows that there'll be extended defensive focus on Tatum and Kemba and maybe Brown, so he'll just run the plays using the other players.   Here's the kicker: usually it's not really bad if Harden passes to his teammates or the Celtics role players pop off. Nurse knows what passes the opposing team are gonna make and can live with role players popping off. However, it can get really bad with the Raptors because they can't reliably score. Who gives a shit if Harden makes the correct pass or Payton Pritchard scores like 20 points if the Raptors can score? But the Raptors can't reliably score. So Harden makes his teammates rack up points and Payton Pritchard dicks the Raptors. This problem goes away with a superstar, which is what the team is built around on. With a superstar, the Raptors team can reliably score and the defensive plan now works to its fullest potential: stop the stars from scoring and let the role players shoot."
"Really?  Brad Stevens, ""a top 5 coach in the league"".  Tatum, Brown, two ""All-Stars"".  Marcus ""heart and soul of the team"" Smart.  Kemba Walker, who has been averaging 20/3.5/5 after his first ten games.  Payton Pritchard and Rob Williams, two promising young players.  Evan Fournier, a 19/3/4 guy replaced Daniel Theis, another solid player.  That's seven average to ""elite"" players with an ""elite"" head coach.  Maybe not a contending roster but that's more than enough to get to the Playoffs.  When will people finally wake up and start questioning Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens?"
"since the nets trade I'd say the only definite hit so far (only counting first rounders) was rozier, but rob williams III and payton pritchard look really promising. for grant williams it's probably too early to see but it looks bad so far. desmond bane and matisse thybulle look like steals but we traded them. and then james young, rj hunter, and yabu were misses. if i haven't missed any picks thats a 5-4 record of solid-to-good picks outside the lottery in round 1. as an extremely biased fan I'd say thats not too bad. would've loved if more than 2 of those 5 were actually on our team tho, thanks mr. daniel ray ainge"

Break the tie with the Lakers. Beat the Lakers in the Finals"
"I see what people are saying, but in the other hand it would be a good way for a confident young player to get their name out there. I could see young players going for it like they do for the dunk contest. Thing is with smaller names you don‚Äôt get as big of a draw. Do people want to tune in to watch Cole Anthony play Payton Pritchard 1 on 1? I do but the casual fan probably doesn‚Äôt care.   Or maybe they do    I don‚Äôt fuckin know"
Zach lavine is from bothell too and Payton Pritchard is hopefully going to be the next best player out of Oregon.
"Hm. I think Gordon Hayward, Goran Dragic, Payton Pritchard, ~~Tyler Herro~~, Duncan Robinson, Cody Zeller, and Doug McDermott are more similar to Larry Bird than Kevin Durant is."

Payton Pritchard
Does payton pritchard have a sunburn?
"payton pritchard got some ugly ass shoes on, honestly i cant stand his face either, first team no swag"
I think Payton Pritchard fits this mold pretty well honestly. I also wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if he exceeds my expectations though.
"After 2017 Draft where Tatum was drafted     2018 - Robert Williams III (A developing young player capable of being a Starting Caliber Center in the league)   2019 - Romeo Langford (We just have to wait and see but he has potential), Grant Williams (I know some of you have given up on him but I still believe he is just given the wrong role and position. He was nice in the playoffs against the Heats last year and showed flashes that he can be a poor man's PJ Tucker (The Poorman's Draymond Green)   2020 - Payton Pritchard (Impact Role Player), Aaron Neismith (Still young but is already good defensively, a good college shooter and showed flashes of that in the NBA)      Now you can't expect young player to be as good as the top picks immediately. Brown didn't become who he is today from day 1. Rozier is not that good the first few years here in Boston. Case in point, you got to have patience and not jump to conclusions immediately regarding these young players."
"Smart, rozier, brown, and Tatum went 6, 16, 3, 3. Since the Tatum draft, their first round picks have been:  2018: Robert Williams, 26th  2019: Romeo Langford, 14th. Matisse Thybulle, 20th (traded to philly). Grant Williams, 22nd.   2020: Aaron Nesmith, 14th. Payton Pritchard, 26th. Desmond Bane, 30th (traded to Memphis)  So basically your whole point was just trying to say that when you draft in the lottery, it‚Äôs easier to have good picks than when you draft in the teens and twenties lol. Hard hitting analysis buddy, thank you."
"&gt; intricacies of defence  Thank you for putting that as politely as you could, lol. Yes, as talented as Time lord is - his defensive decisions or misreads are quite perplexing. Dropping back in PnR on players you absolutely cannot drop off of, showing too hard and not rotating back quick enough, compromising good defensive position on non-shooters pump fakes, etc.   On the other hand, his court vision and awareness on offense is much better than most people would expect. He still lacks some of the actual passing to put that to use, but the fact that he at least has the right idea and read is a promising sign.  Also love the two man game he's started to develop with Payton Pritchard lately."
"Okoro, Jaden McDaniels, Payton Pritchard, Xavier Tillman have all also been better defensively in my opinion. That also doesn't include players I think are more arguable but are there is also Desmond Bane, James Wiseman, Patrick Williams, and Saddiq Bey."

"The Celtics problems are Kemba.  There has not been a title contender in the modern era that wastes a max contract slot on a player of Kemba's caliber.  The fact is, in the NBA it is essentially impossible to build a true contender if you waste a max contract.  The Celtics are in year 4 of this (3 years of Hayward).  So unless they can first get rid of Kemba's $36M cap hit, nothing else matters because they're not gonna be able to contend with that contract anyway.  I also would not say most of their young players have disappointed?  Payton Pritchard has been a surprise and could develop into a decent scoring option off the bench, and Robert Williams seems like a promising young center.  And Aaron Nesmith has shot like 45% from three over the past couple months.  The Celtics just have way more young guys than most teams due to hoarding a lot of draft picks, but I don't think their ""hit rate"" is any different from what most teams would've had drafting in the same positions."
Payton Pritchard vs Mike James is a good matchup
"Health is the most important thing. Our best starting lineup has played only 7 games together and won 6 of them, beating the Blazers, Bucks, and Timberwolves and. blowing out the nuggets and hornets by 30. Only loss was to to the 76ers by ten. Also Tatum‚Äôs stats post all star break combined with before he got covid are crazy good and knock on wood but I don‚Äôt expect him to deal with that again.   Development from our rookies and hopefully Romeo. Payton Pritchard has been one of our best players off the bench and the game seems to have slowed down for Nesmith post all star break so I‚Äôm excited to see what they can do with an offseason and training camp. Romeos been so injured and this will be his first healthy offseason. If any of these guys take a step forward, that‚Äôll help."

"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
"The point that you're missing there is that the team trading away the star player then gets saddled with a bunch of low value picks that they then stockpile to trade for the next wantaway star and so on and so on the cycle continues.   It's like a Ponzi scheme, and eventually those picks have to be selected, and can't be traded as hypothetical future assets anymore, and you end up like Boston - a supposed contender scrapping for 6th place in the East after being stuck with 3 relatively worthless first round picks and drafting Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard and Desmond Bane, none of whom move the needle towards winning a title in the short term.  So I'll repeat, why does anybody want to trade their star for these worthless picks?"
"Payton Pritchard, Thad Young"
"The problem is our starting 5 is really all we have going for us.  Kemba/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Timelord is a arguably a top 5 starting 5 in the NBA, but our supporting cast stops and ends with Tristan Thompson and Evan Fournier. It's not completely awful, especially with the addition of Fournier, but the rest of our bench players are young and not ready to carry the load off the bench. Pritchard is maybe the closest, but he's still learning.  I'm not a doomer by any means, I think we have one of, if not the, brightest future of any team in the NBA, certainly in the eastern conference, but the fact of the matter is out role-players are a lot weaker than other contenders this year, and it would take all of our best 7 guys staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs, as well as an 8th/9th guy off the bench (one of Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, and Aaron Nesmith) making a big leap *in a playoff push* for us to really and truly contend."
I probably wouldn‚Äôt have Wiseman there but I can understand people who do and I like the rest of your list. If you want other ideas Payton Pritchard is a candidate though I don‚Äôt know if he beats out the other guys.
Payton Pritchard? averaging 45/42/90 on low attempts which means if he has a few big games he can get that FG% up
"It‚Äôs just kind of fallen that way lol. On top of that I have Darius Garland and Payton Pritchard at point. Grayson Allen as my backup 2 and my weakest point is Center where I have a cast of Mo Wagner, Jarred Vanderbuilt and Jalen Smith"
Payton Pritchard been hooping this season
"Because everyone around Jaylen and Tatum have been injured. It‚Äôs literally the same team that sweeped you guys last year +Evan Fournier, +Payton Pritchard, +Aaron Nesmith, with vast improvements from Jaylen. We have not played 100 minutes this season with our 5 best players healthy."
I dont think he's caught payton pritchard yet /s
"They‚Äôve had some hits outside of the Jays in recent years. Guys like Rozier, Rob Williams, Payton Pritchard. Also had some horrible misses too, like Yabu, Zizic, Hunter, and several others. They‚Äôre mediocre in drafting, imo"
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
he wishes he could be Payton Pritchard
Payton Pritchard
well he did the last thing you said with Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard... so one hit and one iffy in that sense
"Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard: 67 points, 22/41 shooting, 8/20 from 3, 5 turnovers  Rest of the Celtics: 48 points, 19/55 shooting, 3/29 from 3, 9 turnovers"
The only players that should be shooting are Payton Pritchard and Jaylen Brown.
"We have 2 players in double digits, Payton Pritchard and Jaylen Brown. sad"
"Fitz is the worst.  Every single game some role player on the other team hits a 3 and Fitz will act like he's personally offended that Payton Pritchard hit a couple open 3s.  God forbid Steph come down and miss a 3 shortly after. You'll get a guaranteed ""Ok well if Pritchard is hitting 3s and Steph is missing his you might as well end the game""."
Payton Pritchard bout to pop off
"Guy is a beast. Was one of my favourite college players throughout his Villanova stint and I honestly think he should have been drafted higher. Undersized scrappy points guard like Jalen Brunson and Payton Pritchard stay being underrated, despite the age"
Payton Pritchard game 7 conference finals buzzer beater 3. Mark the words and check back in with me after in a few months.
"As far as I can recall, I thought the only criteria for being a part of a young core was being young?  By that logic, Tatum and Brown don't count in Boston's young core as they both signed huge contracts. How do you have them as number 2? Robert Williams and Payton Pritchard are the second-best ""young core"" in the league? Over the team with Zion???"
What is Payton Pritchard for 5 dollars.
"Danny had way too many draft picks to use and didn't find a trade he liked so ended up using all of them. Every year we seem to replace productivr established talent with rookie contracts. It all came to a head this year where we lost Gordon Hayward, Brad Wanamaker, and Enes Kanter with Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. This season was always going to be hard with so much of the roster being made up of rookie contracts.    Look at all the other high seeds above above Boston and you see teams that added veterans. Milwaukee went out and got Holiday, Philly got Curry, Green and Dwight, Brooklyn sold the farm for Harden and filled out the roster with cheap veterans like Jeff Green.  The young players needed to get on the court and either show they're NBA level players or not so Ainge can finally make a decision on some of these guys. Pritchard broke out early and Timelord came on strong late."
Payton Pritchard apparently. Dude hit fucking everything tonight
Is it really Payton Pritchard out there or John Stockton?
Payton Pritchard is one of those players that‚Äôs gonna end up playing 10+ years on contenders
"yeah cuz jayson tatum, jaylen brown, marcus smart, terry rozier, payton pritchard, and robert williams were wasted draft picks! good point guy! got me there!"
payton pritchard has decided this game features him. Having as many FGA as Brown is something
The league doesn‚Äôt care if James Ennis or Payton Pritchard load manage. The issue is limited access to the league‚Äôs cashcows
What do you mean. Mega sized Payton Pritchard just got MVP
Everyone knows because opponent coaching staffs made the officials aware of it then the media took off with it. If it was someone like Bruce Brown or Payton Pritchard then no one would have any idea it‚Äôs even happening. He‚Äôs been doing it for 3-4 months now and it‚Äôs only been a story for *maybe* half that time.
"I don't think anyone is saying Wiseman has a zero percent chance of being a superstar.   But I think it's reasonable to think he has a roughly similar chance to someone like Kira Lewis, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, etc"
"I'm not sure KP would mesh particularly well. One of Kemba's biggest issues is availability and Porzingis is just as big, if not more, of an injury concern. He left pretty unceremoniously with the Knicks and even on the Mavs there have been the rumors about him being unhappy in his role alongside Luka. If Luka, a far far better passer than Tatum, can't figure it out with KP, there's reason to be concerned about KP being unhappy being behind the Jays. If it's true he's upset being second fiddle on the Mavs, he probably wouldn't be too happy being third fiddle on the Celtics.       It's also a big risk for the Celtics because if he doesn't pan out basically immediately, they've locked themselves into an *even worse* cap situation than they're in now with Kemba. That would make it very, very difficult for them to put a competitive roster around the Jays for pretty much the rest of their current contracts. The Celtics would also be completely capped out with Payton Pritchard and sort of Smart being their only two PGs. That would likely result in a lot of bad basketball"
"I‚Äôm not sure you can make them a contender. I would say trade CJ for some scoring wing (Brandon Ingram?)or interior presence but even then that doesn‚Äôt make them drastically better. They are pretty much what they are going to be middling western conference playoff team. Trade dame for Ben Simmons, Maxey, pick(s) and or Jaylen brown pick(s) and Payton Pritchard. That would be real of them to do for dame, they would still be competitive too"
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** ‚Äì got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** ‚Äì I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** ‚Äì got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** ‚Äì got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh ‚Äì got Marcus Smart instead"
Ant Edwards and Payton Pritchard
"I wanted Portland to take him in the draft, but we traded away our second rounder to the Rockets - who then used that pick to take Brooks. Then they immediately traded him to Memphis. Unbelievable.   I also want the Blazers to somehow get Jordan Bell that year. And of course I though Payton Pritchard would have made a great backup PG, but he didn't fall far enough to get him in the second round."
So Payton Pritchard.
"Without Gary Harris and PJ Dozier, we'd let Payton Pritchard average 40 on us. Mitchell was doing the same last year until Gary came back."
once tatum leaves do you think you guys are gonna build around romeo langford or payton pritchard?
Payton Pritchard
"you gotta give us payton pritchard with regards to draft picks, but yeah, lots haven‚Äôt really panned out well. we got super unlucky with our non nets firsts having their teams over perform too lol"
"It's ridiculous how 4-year prospects fall late into the draft and then they surprise everyone when they're ready to contribute immediately. You're right that late picks are a crapshoot and if that's the case, going for the higher-floor, low-ceiling guys is a solid train of thought. Look at Payton Pritchard for example. Hell, Memphis has filled out their bench pretty nicely with that philosophy."
"At least he had 08 championship to fall back on, but he had a roster to go to finals with Brad Stevens as the coach. It was combination of injuries, personalities, and free agency which hinder those roster to reach the finals.  They have Brown and Tatum, but rarely anything else unless Celtic fans believe Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Grant Williams will get better. Is Kemba Walker knee going to hold up to his shifty moves he will put stress on his knees?"
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
"I mean he basically traded Markell fultz for jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.   Picked robin Williams with a late first round pick  Picked Payton Pritchard with a late first round pick   Assembled great teams of multiple all stars that have been ravaged by injuries.   Made big free agent signings of kemba walker, al Hortford , Gordon Hayward.   Traded for Kyrie with a hurt IT4 and a pick that ended up being Colin sexton.   Not all of these worked out but they were definitely the right move at the time"
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
It‚Äôs really not.  What‚Äôs unbearable is watching Jabari and Payton Pritchard be the only guys on the floor who know how to play basketball.

Need Payton Pritchard to save this game

OREGON LEGEND PAYTON PRITCHARD
"Payton Pritchard just successfully defended KD, wtf did I just see LMAO"
PAYTON PRITCHARD LOCKED DOWN KD IN THE POST LOL
I wonder if Payton Pritchard wears #11 in honor of Celtics legend Kyrie Irving.
Payton Pritchard gonna put the clamps on Kyrie!  Let‚Äôs go Ducks!
"Known playoff performer Payton Pritchard  They‚Äôll take their chances  Come back to me after the game, happy to eat crow if I‚Äôm wrong"
Right they‚Äôre just gonna leave Payton pritchard without a defender then
It's time for the Payton Pritchard game
"Lmao celtics started Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford that game. Their second highest scorer was Rookie Payton Pritchard. They were missing Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, AND Robert Williams as well"
We have one in Payton Pritchard. Just give it time.
Put Payton Pritchard in please. The other players make me uncomfortable
"&gt; Ok scratch that game from the record. 17-15 when their 3 best players play is still not good  Lol... and you're still counting a bunch of games where we've been massively injured?  For example the game before that:  * Kemba had only just come back from his knee procedure and was still on minute restrictions * Tatum had just come back from covid * Brown was starting to miss time due to tendonitis * Payton Pritchard was also out with an MCL  You're looking at games without any understanding of what was happening in those games.   Instead of blindly throwing numbers around, if you actually looked at those ~30 games you'd see there's a lot more going on than you realise.  &gt;Small sample size + seemingly cherrypicked   Why do you think the sample size is small?   We played 72 games and had our core 4 together for less than we did during the 17 games of playoffs last year.    Period| Games Played| Minutes Played ---|---|---- 2020 playoffs (17 games)| 17| 349 2020-21 Season (72 games)| 17| 292   You're using these stats terms without any understanding of how/why they're relevant.  ""small sample size"" - Yeah exactly my point.  &gt; every team dealt with injuries this season.   All you're doing here is showing you don't understand scale.   Injuries aren't binary.  Phoenix having their top played lineup for 52 games and 706 minutes is very different to Boston having their top played lineup for 11 games and 131 minutes.  Just to put it into perspective, your top-played lineup this year had 22 games played. Twice our top played lineup. So no, your situation isn't comparable to ours.    &gt;To players like Robert Williams (one of the most injury prone players in the league), Romeo Langford (injury prone &amp; is not good), Nesmith (not good yet), and Tristan Thompson   I wasn't even counting the injuries to Langford and Nesmith (who didn't miss much time at all).  As I said, I'm talking purely:  1. Our top 4 players  2. Our playoff rotation  Langford and Nesmith aren't part of either."
"Tl;dr: No I‚Äôm not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team‚Äôs health that didn‚Äôt end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami‚Äôs probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There‚Äôs actually a ton more reasons I‚Äôm very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I‚Äôm happy to share if you‚Äôre interested though."
The uptight nba fans would be criticizing them for not giving a shit about Payton Pritchard or something.
"I expected Lamelo to have some problems with his game (shooting percentages, defense). I am pleasantly surprised   Did not expect Edwards to be this good. Thought that the T-wolves were going to be the T-wolves and handle him like they did Wiggins. Thank God that I‚Äôm wrong.  I expected wiseman to be a net-positive for the warriors this season, as I thought he would be a ‚Äúperfect fit‚Äù. He shows flashes of incredible talent, but I am a little disappointed that he isn‚Äôt impactful for the warriors.   I love Payton Pritchard. 10/10 pick for the C‚Äôs, played his role really well and showed great maturity for a rookie.   COMPAZZOOOOOOO IS THE GOAT. love his playmaking and intensity for the Nuggets."
Payton Pritchard was known all around Oregon by his senior year and everybody was excited for him to go to the university here too.
Right:      Saddiq Bey: didn‚Äôt expect him to be this good of a shooter so fast but knew he would eventually be a plus shooter and solid defender      Halliburton: again didn‚Äôt know it would be this soon but felt like he had the highest floor of the draft. Looks like his ceiling is much higher too.      Wrong:       Payton Pritchard: knew he was a good shooter but didn‚Äôt think he was going to make it in the league.       Tyrell Terry: thought he would be a sniper. Barely played but results weren‚Äôt promising.
"Pritchard at 27 isn‚Äôt anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that‚Äôs solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn‚Äôt like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it‚Äôs concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn‚Äôt pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
"Does anyone else remember that Oregon team with Brooks, Jordan Bell, Chris Boucher, Tyler Dorsey, and Payton Pritchard?  Might‚Äôve been my fave college basketball team I‚Äôve ever followed (I just pick and choose college teams depending on the year)."
Payton Pritchard lol
For the Celtics I‚Äôll say Payton Pritchard maybe? He‚Äôs a solid shooter so if he gets hot for a game I could see it
"Oh yeah? Well, neither will Payton Pritchard...so get ready."
"The average value of a double-digit pick just isn't that high, is the thing. Most players picked later in the draft just aren't going to be stars. Sure, we don't have the track record of, like, the Raptors wrt late firsts, but since 2015 we've had 9 first-round picks outside the top 10 (not including the ones we immediately traded), of which:  ‚Äî 2 (Terry Rozier, Rob Williams) are already starting-caliber players  ‚Äî 2 (Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard) project to be very solid NBA players going forward  ‚Äî 2 (Romeo Langford, Grant Williams) are fringe NBA-caliber players, although we've seen so little of Langford that he could end up either a tier down or up  ‚Äî 3 (RJ Hunter, Guerschon Yabusele, Ante Zizic) were complete misses  For late firsts, I don't think that's a bad track record at all. He hasn't *completely* missed on a first-rounder since 2016 (though we'll see about Langford)."
" Kyle Anderson, Mo Wagner, and Payton Pritchard ain‚Äôt playing rn"
"Rob Williams, Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith have earned their minutes and a chance for an expanded role next season, all the other young guys can go tbh"
"What is this parallel universe you're living in where Stevens didn't help develop Smart, Brown, and Tatum? Or perhaps Robert Williams, who was taken 27th and has become the team's best center in 3 years despite constantly dealing with injuries? Payton Pritchard is already playing very well, Aaron Nesmith started out poorly but has already improved a ton over the course of the season and has been balling lately. I guess Grant Williams is pretty ass. Do we blame Brad for Romeo Langford being perpetually injured? The rest of our ""young core"" is second rounders and two-way guys so I really fail to see what else he could have done here."
"TJ McConnell gives me hope for Payton Pritchard to be a real player one day.  Also, seeing Hayward not be available for this game really takes the sting of losing him away."
"Robert Williams and Payton Pritchard are absolutely NBA players. Like what? And who were you referring to when you said ‚Äú/garbage‚Äù Smart and Rozier?? Lol  He hasn‚Äôt missed in a draft for 7 years besides one year. I know you dodged the question, but if that‚Äôs poor drafting, there should be *at least* 10 other teams drafting better than that over the last 7 years. Please show me. I feel like you‚Äôre just regurgitating a narrative you heard and don‚Äôt really know how to rationalize it because it isn‚Äôt your thought. Like I said, I‚Äôm a huge Ainge skeptic, but this is objectively wrong."

Knicks-Celtics was a freebie though.  Didn't check but that game alone must have been like -800 or more.  Celtics didn't play their top 7 and their best players were rookies Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith.  No one else who played would be in their playoff rotation if there were no injuries.

I hope Payton Pritchard gets on 2nd Team but I doubt it
"Tremont Waters. I cringe every time Brad decides to start him *over* Payton Pritchard when Kemba and Smart are out. It just doesn't make any fucking sense to me, he barely gets minutes otherwise."
"He, Payton Pritchard, and Kenny Wooten were a nasty trio that year at Oregon."
"That Oregon team wasn't even projected to make the NIT (forget the NCAA tournament) but ripped off a 10 game winning streak, won the Pac-12 championship and made the Sweet 16 before finally losing to eventual champ Virginia.   Louis King and Payton Pritchard went the fuck off like every game, I watched every game of that run. Bol didn't do anything tho, he was hurt."
He was on the 2019 Oregon squad with Payton Pritchard and Bol Bol. Pretty nasty in college surprised he wasn‚Äôt drafted.
"But I think the ultimate point of the discussion is what Tatum and Zion did with the talent on their team. And for that, you have to look at what talent actually played. Which I feel is very much in the Pelicans‚Äô favorit but it‚Äôs at least comparable.  You wouldn‚Äôt say well actually the Warriors have more talent this season than (insert team here) because they have Klay on the roster. And when the Nets lost to a Memphis team without JJJ and with Ja playing only 12 minutes earlier this year, it would be fair to say that a lack of talent was a factor since they might have had Kyrie and Durant on their roster (this was before the Harden trade) but both guys were irrelevant in the outcome of the game.   And similarly, a lot of talent was unavailable to Tatum through the season as only he, Grant Williams, and Payton Pritchard played over sixty games compared to Zion, Ingram, Bledsoe. And you lower it a bit to 55 games and get only Jaylen beating the benchmark vs Lonzo, Adams, Hayes."
"I know Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard both always stressed that they just wanted to contribute to winning basketball and will perform or adapt to whatever role the coach thinks they can contribute in.   But those are 22 year old college player of the year candidates, and not 19 year old one-and-done lottery picks."
Payton Pritchard is going to be great I promise
"&gt;#26 Payton Pritchard 6‚Äô1‚Äô‚Äô PG  &gt;7.7rpg, 2.4rpg, 1.8apg on 44/41/89 shooting over 1 season  &gt;We once again reach that deep point in the first and Ainge took a guy who man considered a reach in Payton Pritchard. For much of the season Pritchard was one of the best rookies in his class in both volume and efficiency. He fell off after an unfortunate injury, but he for sure outperformed his draft position. He projects to be a solid backup guard and to contribute immediately. A-  He's worse than the guy they drafted at 30 and traded away."
"PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Payton Pritchard  SF: Terrence Ross  C: Domantas Sabonis  PF: Jerami Grant  Bench: Mike James, Isaiah Hartenstein, Nigel Williams-Goss, Terrence Jones  Btw we counting guys like Kevin Love?"
They all just want to coach Oregon legend Payton Pritchard
"Yeah I think it‚Äôs much easier to build around and win with Brown and Tatum than it is with Trae and Collins. With another true star besides Trae I‚Äôll look at them in a different light.   And I don‚Äôt really know about The Celtics but them being frauds was never really something people said. We didn‚Äôt have Jaylen in the playoffs and he‚Äôs crucial to the teams success. Assuming that Brown is back next year and him and Tatum both take another leap I see the Celtics being an extremely talented team. Replacing Kemba with Horford is a great decision as well and the Celtics have the 5th youngest roster in the league. With more development to key players like Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and hopefully the addition of last year‚Äôs draft and stash Yam Madar the team should take a big step forward."
Payton Pritchard now that Kemba is gone
"Dude has the worst trade suggestion I might have every seen, and that‚Äôs not even me being bias lmao   Mf said Derrick White AND Dejounte Murray for   Marcus Smart, Tristian Thompson,  Aaron Nesmtih and Payton Pritchard. I gotta get off this app lmao"
"Marcus smart , tristan Thompson , payton pritchard  , aaron nesmith   For both of them"
"I love me some Payton Pritchard, but Celtic fans need to *temper* expectations with this guy.  Some of our sub genuinely believes this guy should be a starting PG, although I highly disagree with that. I do agree that he's deceptively athletic and sports some impressive ball handling skills, but that's a testament to his work ethic. At 6'2, he's going to be limited on what he can do on defense on switches. Some people compare him to Fred VanVleet, and I think his numbers are very eerily similar as well.  At 23 -  &gt;**Pritchard's** 7.7 points per game, 2.4 rebounds per game, 1.8 assists per game on **44/41/88**   &gt;   &gt;**Fred VanVleet's** 8.6 points per game, 2.4 rebounds per game, 3.2 assists per game on **42/41/83**  I don't think Payton Pritchard has the defensive chops as FVV's, who's actually an underrated shot blocking guard for his size. But PP has a very high range, I've seen dude light it up from 32+ feet. He's also known for taking long deep bombs during his time with Oregon.  I liked FastPP, but I definitely clowned Ainge for pick, this is what I get for listening to Kevin O'Connor hype up prospects lol."
Shout out to my man Payton Pritchard who did it over and over this year for the Celtics.
There's pictures on the Celtics sub of him bowling with Payton Pritchard so we know he's a big bowling fan.
"Careful, Aaron Nesmith's about to win your heart next year, then you might find yourself taking a shine to Payton Pritchard too, and now, you have to  purifying yourself in the waters of lake Minnetonka.  Enjoy the pancakes though."
"Both born and raised in Portland too. Along with Payton Pritchard, Celtics have like 85% of all the players and coaches from Portland."
Teague was behind Payton Pritchard in the rotation now he's hitting Finals 3s what is this
Is it too much to hope for Payton Pritchard to make some sort of leap next season?
"I agree on Nesmith, and barring any big moves he should be in line to get a lot of playing time, permanently jumping Romeo on the depth chart.   I love Payton Pritchard too, but not sure he will have a huge jump as his rookie season was good.   What about that rookie, Terry in Dallas? There was huge buzz about him pre draft."
Speaking of small pps lol  PP: Payton Pritchard on the Celtics   Brad really threw PP into the mix fast in his rookie year and he really showed some promise as a legit ball handler and PG
Payton Pritchard
"Even if he doesn't improve, consider what you get with Ben:  Half court set: stands in the dunker's spot. That's okay, you've got Horford back who would stretch the floor. TT is shipped off. Only issue is synergy with Timelord, who I do believe will take a leap in development next year.  Fast break: The Lebron setup, with a scary freight train with perfect passing vision running down the court and shooters spread out.  Defense: Defense.  Marcus Smart is the only valuable piece in that theoretical trade. Tristain Thompson has some value, but the rest of the package is negligible at best, and Seth Curry is better than Payton Pritchard by all measurable accounts."
p rabbit Payton Pritchard was great &amp; Neismith didn‚Äôt find his footing until like the last month of the season so he was fine ig
Just behind Payton Pritchard
"The problem is that all the high usage players were terrible passers. Brown is a bottom tier playmaker for others, Kemba is bad for a PG, Tatum is a bad, but improving passer. The rest of the roster is incapable of self-creation outside of Payton Pritchard. Marcus Smart was the best passer on the roster and he's not a real threat in the half court because he can't finish inside and his outside shot is terrible.  Rob Williams is a tremendous passer, but he plays like 15 minutes a game between injuries.   So basically it's just a dribble handoff offense without anyone who can create for others in the half court. Just give it to Brown or Tatum and hope they can hit a midrange garbage shot. And sometimes it worked because those guys are so skilled. But it was always ugly, and usually not effective."
Loved that Payton Pritchard game against the Raptors. Dude went off.
"I would want both of them, Payton Pritchard, Kevin Huerter, Alex Caruso, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Gordon Hayward, Porzingis, and Nico Mannion for no particular reason."
"Luka, but also replace KD with Luka, and replace the other players on the team with Luka or Payton Pritchard."
"Yeah he‚Äôs a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
Payton Pritchard
Eventually you need an endgame though. What is he going to turn all these picks from the late teens-twenties into? A team full of Payton Pritchard level players? He has to trade up or trade for a star or something with them.
Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith are two on the current roster that are turning out quite nicely.
Ben Simmons and Doc for Kem‚Ä¶ Payton Pritchard and Al Horford and 2018 Nets Pick.   Make it happen Silver!
"Payton Pritchard, I think."
"The fuck? Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard  and Jaylen brown were all first round picks. And they were all seen as reaches when we selected them lmao"
"This season, Payton Pritchard."
"Mike Bibby, Gerald Henderson, Drew Gooden are in the Hall of Fame.           For active players there's Jeremy Lamb, Payton Pritchard may also be on his way."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"&gt; Because it shows he's a good evaluator of talent? &gt;  &gt;   Sure, I think he's done a good job of identifying talent, but to be successful you need to identify talent and accrue benefits from that talent.    Take for instance someone like Romeo Lanford vs Payton Pritchard. It's possible that Romeo ends up a better player at the end than Romeo Langford (I personally don't think it's overly likely, but for the hypothetical lets imagine it). If Romeo finally takes that leap in year 4, but then requires a large contract that then either puts his salary at par or above the caliber of his play, the Celtics never really accrue much value over what it cost them for that player. Compared to someone like Pritchard who likely will give them 4 years of play above his salary level.    That's where the disconnect is on someone like Rozier. He wasn't a good player for us for most of his tenure here, and then we balked at paying him $19M APY on his next contract. That window for us to accrue value from Rozier never really opened outside of a very small window his 3rd year. We also invested a lot of time in him before he was a replacement level player.    Danny was able to identify a talented player, but it didn't serve the Celtics all that well because it took him too long for the team to be able to utilize that talent. That's an important factor in evaluating drafting."
&gt;Ties in voting totals between Davion Mitchell and Payton Pritchard  lmao nice voting
"This is not true at all. See Payton Pritchard and IT dominating Pro-Am games recently. Or Scalabrine dominating former D1 players when they shit talked him at the gym. Without NBA level defenders, these guys dominate and can score at will. It just shows the massive skill disparity between NBA players and normal people.   The worst big man on every NBA team has better handles than any non-professional basketball player. The worst guard on any NBA team could outshoot anybody not in the NBA.   Athleticism is important but there are a lot of NBA level athletes overseas, in the G-League, etc. who just can‚Äôt make it in the league (Rayjon Tucker for example, is a stellar athlete and probably would be in the top half of NBA players athletically speaking but just isn‚Äôt skilled enough to play in the NBA). It takes a stupid amount of work and practice to get good enough skills to be at a bottom tier NBA level, let alone at an elite level."
I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre starting to acknowledge that Payton Pritchard exists. at the beginning of the offseason I was starting to become convinced that I didn‚Äôt actually see him have a very solid rookie year and that no one was going to be playing guard minutes for the Celtics
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."

"Wait, Payton Pritchard is the one that dropped 90+ pts on a pro-am game, right? Why do these guys are playing in the summer league?"

Are you referring to Payton Pritchard as a top tier prospect?
"&gt;Why are people hating on Payton Pritchard?   In case you hadn't noticed, he plays for the Celtics."

Why are people hating on Payton Pritchard? Wtf this is such a weird ass post
"Davion Mitchell played him well 2 times and people think he 'locked up' payton pritchard. The funniest part of this game is when Pritchard got past Mitchell and misfired on the pass to the big man, the commentators said Mitchell 'sped him up' lol"
whats with the payton pritchard hate  dude came back when he didnt have to after dropping 150pts over the weekend
"Davion Mitchell's nickname; today he was guarding Payton Prichard, hence Pritchard had an ""off night""."
"Two things I've learned from watching nothing but Celtics games this summer league:  * Payton Pritchard is too good for Summer League * Davion Mitchell is too good for Payton Pritchard  I'm really happy with what I saw from our young guys, but y'all have a hell of a player."
Remember the other thread when he was ‚Äútoo good for the summer league‚Äù dude it‚Äôs Payton Pritchard
"Is Payton Pritchard playing in summer league today? Yes... like I said... so u are wrong.... I thought you told me these games don‚Äôt matter also? Then why would payton Pritchard push so hard to play like u just said said if it the game today doesn‚Äôt have any meaning? There is obviously a reason why Pritchard wants to play... because it‚Äôll give him game reps and help him get better.... like I said.... so all In all just accept ur wrong bruh payton Pritchard is playing in summer league like I said he should be, also to good for summer league? that‚Äôs why his team is getting blown out and he only has 6 points but ok buddy... just accept that u were wrong üíØ"

I wanted the Celtics to draft him 3rd in his draft"
Payton Pritchard &gt; Dennis Schroeder

Payton Pritchard.
"You might be right. Celtics will be without Payton Pritchard after he was shut down after the 3rd game. Pritchard was a big part of the Celtics wins, averaging 20/4/8/2 on 51% from the field and 57% from deep."

Payton Pritchard.  He has curry like shooting ability potential if he improves which is hard to imagine because he's already so good from deep.
"Payton Pritchard is [reported as 6‚Äô2‚Äù](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2020/11/19/payton-pritchard-celtics-nba-draft-oregon/%3famp=1) in shoes, likely 6‚Äô1‚Äù barefoot.   IT is listed at 5‚Äô9‚Äù in shoes, but [he has admitted that he is more like 5‚Äô8‚Äù](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2016/04/15/isaiah-thomas-height-5-8/%3famp=1).   If Pritchard is 6‚Äô2‚Äù and IT is 5‚Äô9‚Äù than that is 5 inches (5‚Äô10, 5‚Äô11, 6‚Äô0, 6‚Äô1, 6‚Äô2 = 5 inches)  If you want to drop them both an inch, then it is still 5 inches difference. Lol."
"should be 20 games... Payton ""Wilt Chamberlain"" Pritchard just dropped 92 points in a ^^^pro-am game.  Just cancel the season &amp; give the Celtics the trophy, it'll save everyone some time &amp; trouble"

Payton ‚ÄúSm√©agol‚Äù Pritchard
I am willing to bet that Payton Pritchard scores no more than 90 points in a game this year. 92 is a bridge too far.

"Lmfao how are you downvoted? Payton Pritchard averaged 7.7 points a game (19 min) last year. If Payton's an NBA level scorer then Dennis Smith Jr. should be considered a scorer 7.3 pts (19 min). Also Draymond is a scorer at 7.0 per game. Delon Wright averaged 10.0 a game, he must be scorer too? TJ McConnell dropped 8.6 a game, he can score the basketball.  Yeah right, this sub man."
"I woke up to 15 people in my mentions, you guys are spamming me because I said Payton Pritchard like immanuel quickley should still be in summer leagueüòÇ... Oh so Pritchard is to good to play in summer league and the Celtics want him to sit so they can see the younger guards, but the Knicks who have young guards like miles McBride are OK with quickely who is still playing dropping like 30 points each game obviously to good for summer league also, so why is quickley playing and Pritchard isn‚Äôt? There extremely similar"
Today I learned that Payton Pritchard is too good for summer league ball. Surely he‚Äôs an up and coming young guard ready to take over the league.
IT: Scores 81 points   Payton Pritchard: Hold my beer.
"Boston - Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Terry Rozier  76ers - Maxey, Thybulle, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, Milton  LOL, you're in a fucking cult"
"**MVP**: **Kevin Durant**. Best player on the best team, now with chemistry. I think he will eclipse his GSW stats considerably because Brooklyn isn't afraid to play iso. Don't buy the stars cancel out theory. Steph up there as well.  **DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo.** I think Gobert (unfairly)  will get docked for being somewhat exposed on the perimeter. I don't think anyone else will genuinely be in the running. I think Jonathan Isaac will be a conversation, but no chance of winning.  **6MOY: Dennis Schroder**, I think Payton Pritchard will start at PG.  **ROTY: Jalen Green**, with Suggs close behind. Cade will get Dwane Casey'd for at least first half of the season.  **MIP: Jonathan Isaac**. Maybe a homer pick, but could be Orlando's leading scorer. He has a lot of offensive game he hasn't really unleashed because he plays like a pastor, and was starting to turn around his mentality before the injury.  **COTY: Billy Donovan**, I think the Bulls are being underrated because none of the names are splashy individually, but when you break it down each player is going into the best fit of his career offensively. Billy Donovan has historically gotten good team defences out of bad individual defenders. IMO they will be a top 3 seed in the East, behind the Bucks and Nets.  **Exec of the Year: Arturas Karnisovas** - see above.  **Champions: Nets (KD)** - Talent."
Payton Pritchard just dropped 92 on Mike James in the semifinals of the Portland Pro Am league
Payton Pritchard. Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt ready for PP to light up the league.
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De‚Äôaron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I‚Äôm pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos

Payton Pritchard
"Not that easy to just put teams together. When the FIBA 3x3 was just starting out, USA sent a 3x3 team in the 2015 FIBA U18 tournament of Payton Pritchard, PJ Washington, and Zach Collins (4 and 5 star recruits who all eventually made the NBA).   They were clearly the 3 best U18 players in the tournament (no other team had a future NBA player as of this moment). Lost multiple times and was eliminated in the QF. People underestimate the impact of team chemistry."
"Agreed completely. If he couldn't demonstrate to other teams this summer that he was worth big money after being the Lakers starter this year then how is he going to convince teams to throw money at him next year coming off the bench behind Marcus Smart (another guy who is looking for a big payday next summer)? Also, when the Celtics are hoping to groom Payton Pritchard for some bigger role in the years to come, are they really going to just give all his minutes to Schroder so he can showcase himself for a contract with another team next year?  This was Schroder's big chance and he blew it. The Lakers had his Bird rights and a need at point guard. He didn't need to worry if other team's had cap space cause the Lakers could exceed the cap to bring him back. If he goes to Boston as the 2nd or 3rd string PG, he won't get to showcase himself much, and he'll be back out there next year hoping someone uses cap space to sign him, or else it'll be just another MLE deal again. He had a golden opportunity to get paid and he threw it away. That's never coming back."
If he's willing to sign a 1 year MLE then he might prefer a team that can offer him a bigger role than he'd get splitting PG minutes with Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard. I wonder if the Pelicans might offer him a starting spot for the year.
"Cooper sure as shit isn't 6'1'' I'd be shocked if he was 5'11"". He liked small guarding Carsen Edwards and Payton Pritchard today."
"33 min a game is not what I'd consider ""letting him coast through the regular season and keeping him healthy""  They spent very little money on him and have guard depth, they can afford to keep him on a restriction of like 20-24 minutes if they have to. It's different when a team has Derrick Rose and Immanuel Quickley behind him instead of just Payton Pritchard and Jeff Teague or whatever Boston had."
"Big deal. The Celtics will do that too when they play the Yam Mader, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Robert Williams lineup."
"I'm not sure about that either. Schroder's goal this year if he signs with Boston will be to showcase himself as much as possible, because he's gonna feel like millions of dollars are on the line. If he's getting limited minutes behind Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard, he's probably gonna be pretty upset. He may also really force things when he's in there.   For all his faults with the Lakers, he wasn't really playing like that, probably because the Lakers seemed eager to offer him whatever he wanted already (that's the only reason he turned down that $84 million extension, after all). If he's suddenly taking a $10 million discount from what he made last year on what essentially would be a year long audition for free agency, who knows what kind of basketball he might play. It might be incredibly selfish and detrimental to what a rebuilding team is looking for. We'll have to wait and see."
Payton Pritchard is not Fred VanVleet
Payton Pritchard would like a word
"Bruh what?? I‚Äôm thinking a Payton Pritchard jersey, bag of potato chips, and a 2nd round pick"
"Come to Boston for the MLE, grind it out with Payton Pritchard for minutes.  ^/s"
"He's wrong about that though, but this is what I've seen a bunch of Celtics fans telling themselves to try to justify why the front office has made the moves they have. To get Beal in free agency, the Celtics would have to find a way to salary dump Horford with no money coming back, they'd have to let Marcus Smart and Robert Williams simply walk in free agency, and they'd have to renounce basically everyone except for Tatum and Brown and maybe Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith. That's about the only way they could get $50 million under the cap, which is what they'd need to create the necessary cap space to make Beal a max offer next summer, and that all seems incredibly unrealistic.   They could try to figure out a trade for Beal this season, but that would probably involve Jaylen Brown, and I don't think Boston wants to do that. I think if Washington gets any sense that Beal may actually leave next summer then they'll probably trade him this summer or upcoming season rather than let it go to free agency, but I could be wrong.   What Boston is actually doing is just trying to get under the luxury tax. Tatum's extension kicked in this off-season and that made it so Boston either needed to make some cuts or go into the tax. So they gave up a 1st to swap Kemba for Horford and save some money there, and then they let Fournier walk, replacing him with Josh Richardson for about $8 million less than Fournier would have cost. And now apparently the sides are very far apart on a Marcus Smart extension because what Smart wants will put Boston in the tax a year from now, especially since they're gonna have to pay Robert Williams as well.   The big indicator that this ""max cap space in 2022"" thing is bogus will be if they trade Marcus Smart once extension talks truly break down. If this ""no contracts beyond 2022"" thing is true, then Smart being an expiring would be just what they're looking for. But instead my guess is if they can't extend him, they'll trade him rather than just have him walk in free agency like Horford, Hayward, Kyrie and Fournier did. I just don't think it's realistic that Boston would risk the total decimation of their team in the hopes that Beal signs with them. If he didn't they'd be absolutely fucked, and there's simply no way they can count on him doing that. It's just not a realistic plan for any team to have."
Someone compared Payton Pritchard to TJ McConnell on the Celtics sub recently. Their similarities end at white point guard
"And it would be **REALLLLLY** funny if he was traded for Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, and picks to the **BOSTON CELTICS**!!!  I‚Äôm laughing just thinking about it  #HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  fucking kill me"
Would be really great for sentimental and marketing purposes. Basketball wise? He's not better than Payton Pritchard in 2021.
"It‚Äôs like the Celtics when they play the Raptors, every single player turns into god. Payton Pritchard is literally prime CP3 mixed with Lowry against the Raptors. Timelord turns into David Robinson."
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now
"Deni Avdija, Payton Pritchard, and Isaiah Stewart could also be borderline Allstars down the line"
Don't sleep on the Payton Pritchard Celtics
"If I‚Äôm the Pistons, I‚Äôm trading my pick for a proven, gritty talent like Payton Pritchard"
"Goes to Celtics for Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard and some pieces/picks"
How tf did Tatum get a roster spot over guys like Payton Pritchard and Romeo Langford???
This team needs a leader. A hero.  That man‚Äôs name? Payton Pritchard.
"Ours is more recent though Dillon Brooks is looking nice in Memphis. We got Payton Pritchard, Bol Bol, Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell...so pretty meh generally. Aaron Brooks I guess had a few years he looked nice in Houston but that's getting into old head territory/outside the 10 year window...."
Payton Pritchard
"Uh, excuse me have you heard of Payton Pritchard? He‚Äôs the type of guy I‚Äôd want my daughter to date, straight class"
"I'm not understanding your comment. What do Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard have to do with the Brooklyn/Houston trade? Houston got 4 FRP, 4 swaps and was able to match salary by taking guys on lucrative 1 year deals which frees up cap in FA. They were also working on a lottery pick of their own. What mid-level team in the NBA is giving 4 FRP? Brooklyn doesn't need those assets as bad as a team like, say, the Kings or Cavs do. No one is matching that for a rental for a guy who's made it clear he only wants to play for one team. Harden was disgruntled with a team that's made the post-season every year he's played there, and has been to the WCF.   They definitely don't deserve shit for not offering more if they feel the risk is not worth the reward. And many teams that were even in the running didn't have the draft capital to match (which is what Houston wanted, not players)."
I would literally rather get a package equivalent to that 1 year rental than a package centered around Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard lmfao. That is so easy to beat even for a 1 year rental  I would literally rather take a lottery pick in this draft than both those players
here‚Äôs my predictions for 5 years from now 1. Thon Maker 2. Matur Maker 3. Makur Maker 4. Bol Bol 5. Payton Pritchard
Nurse's schemes are heavy on team defense and helpers coming in at the last second.  This keeps the unit much more compact and is vulnerable to pick and pops and swing passes for open 3's.  The system is great against bad shooting teams but everyone in the NBA including centers are shooting 3's at a decent rate now.    That's why you get nights where Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard can run them off the court.    Simmons doesn't really fix this issue.
And Payton Pritchard is older than Jayson Tatum
Put Payton Pritchard right now in the 1940‚Äôs we‚Äôd be questioning if he‚Äôs the goat
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"I always find this hard to say with current players. I know Larry Bird and KG are two of my favourites ever to watch. 2016-17 IT was spectacular to watch.   Now, it‚Äôs probably Smart but he is super flawed but I still love him. I think I like JB over JT but I know Tatum is the better player.   I also sneaky love watching Payton Pritchard play. He is mesmerising to watch."
Payton Pritchard going out there in full sicko mode would be something to behold.  Just [imagine this guy coming down the ramp](https://youtu.be/Rqba2qx32wg) ready to get messy in the ring.
1. Payton Pritchard 2. Garrison Mathews  ...that's it?
"Payton was more consistent from start to finish, but once Toronto started tanking it out and Flynn received starter minutes he showed me play that was better than anything I‚Äôd seen from Pritchard, especially defensively. I expect Malachi to be the better player this season."
Payton Pritchard
Payton Pritchard would like a word with you
"I think his issue was more his mentality.   Jimmer didn‚Äôt want to be Payton Pritchard, he wanted to be a ball dominant guard taking a lot of shots.  Not all players accept bench roles and focus on changing their game play to accommodate for the team. Jimmer wanted the team to accommodate to how he wanted to play, but he wasn‚Äôt good enough to do that.  Now he is too old and too far removed from the NBA for a team to really invest time into him."
I think people think Jimmer could carve out a bench role/6th man type option (almost like a Payton Pritchard).   Most people have accepted Jimmer wouldn‚Äôt be able to be a major impact player in the NBA.
Payton Pritchard üêê
Payton Pritchard lol I doubt he‚Äôs playing major minutes by the end of the playoff race despite all the summer league hype

Payton Pritchard. From my hood to yours
Wasn't that Payton Pritchard?
"Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith with both end up starting for the Celtics down the line and they will be heavily compared to Derek Fisher on Kobe's Lakers and Ray Allen on the Celtics, respectively"
Payton Pritchard is gonna get a fifteen year supergigafuckyoumax extension
Agreed based on the fact Payton Pritchard scored 92 in a YMCA game
"Payton Pritchard, I shoot from deep af so I don't get blocked and I dribble really loudly like in his YouTube videos lol"
"Jayson Tatum JB Smart  Rob Williams Payton Pritchard  Just cause everyone besides Pritchard we resigned, and Pritchard is probably our best prospect."
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
&gt;Boston Celtics- Payton Pritchard  I would say Nesmith for us.   Pritchard was already pretty decent last year and there's less room for a dramatic improvement in general.   Nesmith has shown flashes of being a really really high-impact player. The potential for a breakout is there.   It's sort of like a floor vs ceiling debate between the two.
Nuggets and hawks have the most potential. Also the Celtics if pro-am Payton Pritchard makes a full long season appearance.
"No, those guys are salary filler    The actual assets would be Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, and unprotected first round picks"
Payton Pritchard
Give Payton Pritchard the supermax you coward
Payton Pritchard
"Ah so Payton Prichard. That would give Pritchard a lot of cover too, because he‚Äôs a smaller guy and loves to shoot and isn‚Äôt the best on d (he tries, but people can overpower him)."
Yeah and you also got lit up by Payton Pritchard so what‚Äôs your point?
Payton Pritchard
"Portland could sure use him! And Payton Pritchard. And Dillon Brooks. Maybe some Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell as well.  If I'm gonna watch us get blown out by 30 points, I can at least watch my Ducks get minutes!"
Payton Pritchard was a menace to society.
Not a star(yet) but Payton Pritchard will likely take a step back or atleast not progress since Schroeder is there
Payton ‚ÄòThe Tualatin Trebuchet‚Äô Pritchard

Payton Pritchard isn't bad against other teams or anything but he went fucking nuts against you guys last year

Payton Pritchard has a broken nose is all I am saying
I think you're thinking of the other young Celtic: Payton Pritchard
"All my theory‚Äôs are stupid as fuck but they make watching games I don‚Äôt care about more fun. Especially watching with friends. So here they are. -Robin Lopez never played for the bucks, it was Brook in a wig the whole time.   -Payton Pritchard actually wanted to be the leprechaun mascot for the Celtics but signed the wrong contract, and he‚Äôs Irish and is fueled by beer and potatoes. (I know these are dumb stereotypes but that‚Äôs what makes it funny)  -Aaron Nesmith is James Nesmiths son, frozen in time and given the instructions to the commissioner on when to be awakened. This means he‚Äôs Adams son as well  -lastly ( that I can think of right now) Brad Stevens is a mutant clone of Frank Vogel that was supposed to sabotage the Celtics but went rouge.  Btw I‚Äôm not really a Celtics fan I have no clue why I have so many theories about them. Anyways that‚Äôs my Ted talk, thanks for listening."
This is coming from a Lakers fan. Bruh that‚Äôs the funniest shit I seen all day and I‚Äôve already been called a casual for saying Payton Pritchard is great value for where he was picked in the draft
Payton Pritchard.   I think he gets a lot more run than people are expecting because Schroeder is just a 12 month rental.
Payton Pritchard is older that Jayson Tatum
"Payton Pritchard is about a month older than Jayson Tatum, which is surprising because Tatum is only thirteen years old."
Payton Pritchard is older than Jayson Tatum by a month and change.
You guys forgot Payton Pritchard!
"To be fair, there's probably a heap of players with that mentality  But they don't have the talent with it. Jordan was one of the NBAs greatest athletes and Kobe was not joke  Payton Pritchard is on the edge of a rotation NBA player but he's famously an unbelievably hard worker. He turned it over in an important college game and apparently showed up to the next season with wraps on his hands because he'd been dribbling so much his hands bled. That's a competitive mentality like anyone else's, he just doesn't necessarily have the talent to match"
looks like you forgot to list payton pritchard
Call me crazy. Payton Pritchard
"Don‚Äôt worry Wood won‚Äôt be a Rocket much longer, and soon Payton Pritchard will be joining the fine ensemble cast in Houston"
"Alex Caruso is the biggest thief in the NBA and it isn‚Äôt even close. Caruso is averaging 2.2 steals per game, and Jimmy Butler is averaging 2.1 steals per game.  If you‚Äôre wondering who the worst thief is. It‚Äôs Payton Pritchard, who has yet to get a single steal in 159 minutes of play."
"Some things people don‚Äôt realize is that you have to have a certain level of ability to do the foul baiting like Trae and Harden. There‚Äôs a reason why, say, Payton Pritchard can‚Äôt go and score 14ppg on 10fta a game."
Defensively I believe so. Guys like Payton Pritchard wouldn't be hunted on defense as much if he was just a little taller.
"Schroder was a Brad Stevens move, but Danny also drafted people like Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, and Payton Pritchard to fill in the holes. Pritchard has looked promising at least, but seems to have a short leash with Ime."
"The celtics did have some solid draft picks, they just hsed them on guys like payton pritchard"
"It's not that they choose to play hero ball it's that they don't have the ability to play anything else. Tatum is not good enough to be the main ball handler yet, but they have no other options. Smart is the best passer on the team, but he is so inconsistent at scoring that having him be the main ball handler would just give you bad shots from Smart instead. Brown is a terrible ball handler. His handles while improving aren't anything to write home about, his court vision is worse than Tatum's and his passing ability is also worse. Dennis is decent at it, but not a long term solution. Their best catch and shoot player from 3 is also their best ball handler.   It's why losing Kemba and Hayward were so devastating for the team. Hayward especially was a good ball handler that just filled in the holes for the Celtics. Kemba's knees turned to jelly towards the end, but his first season with the Celtics showed what the team should look like. Danny Ainge tried to fill this hole with a ton of picks like Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, and Payton Pritchard. Pritchard shows promise, but he's 2 years away from being 2 years away. They really need a passing pg who can keep defenses honest or get downhill like Lonzo or DJ Murray."
"Here's what he's said on vaccines:  &gt;‚ÄúThe WNBA is 99% vaccinated and I think the NBA is over 90%,‚Äù Brown said in September. ‚ÄúI think the NBA and the [players] union have done a great job. In certain states and certain entities, they‚Äôre not at that percentage level.‚Äù   &gt;‚ÄúEverybody has their own thoughts about it,‚Äù Brown added on the vaccine. ‚ÄúPersonally, my closest family members are vaccinated. I have family members who are vaccinated that are concerned about getting a booster shot or multiple booster shots. And I have some people in my family who aren‚Äôt vaccinated at all.‚Äù  And when he caught covid it was labelled a breakthrough case:  &gt;[Jaylen Brown is expected to be cleared in time to play next Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19 last Friday.

Brogdon/Smart/Tatum/Horford/Sabonis is really great and solves their ball movement issue.   Pacers retool to get younger and acquire a young star in Brown. Duarte/Brown/Levert/Turner/Williams is pretty great. Maybe move Turner for a PF that fits better. Could probably get KP and a couple picks from the Mavericks for him, for example."
"To some degree is maybe correct but it is a rather poorly constructed 3 point shooting team. Outside of Brown and Tatum, 6 of their next 8 guys are career 35% or below shooters. The two who aren‚Äôt are Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard who are rather low volume."
"Smart. And that's just objectively fucking false. Schroder and Richardson may be inconsistent, but who was our best player off the bench last year? Payton Pritchard, who's still on the squad and a year older? *Tristan Thompson?* We had damn near the worst bench in the league last year."
It‚Äôs mentioned kind of off hand in the middle of this article: https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2021/10/payton-pritchard-likely-broke-his-nose-celtics-guard-will-travel-back-to-boston-for-evaluation.html  And I think there are a variety of possible reasons for him not saying anything. It could be related to the fact that he has some extended family who are antivax for example.

"That‚Äôs okay, Bontemps also had this to say about us in the same article.  &gt; Young center Robert Williams III is shooting 75% from the field, which also happens to be the same percentage of his 28 shots that have come at the rim. Rookie Payton Pritchard has proved his draft report to be correct as a quality long-range shooter, but his inexperience as a creator has led to him being used most frequently alongside Teague, playing off the ball."

The man can‚Äôt even post Payton Pritchard it‚Äôs hard to watch
"I feel like that's only really true of Grant Williams and now Payton Pritchard. Stock isn't really high at all for anyone else (other than Tacko but nobody really pretends to want to keep Tacko for his game). If we could package Ojeleye, Langford, Waters, and Edwards for and even halfway decent proven 3&amp;D guy I'd do it in an instant."
Payton Pritchard
"Tatum, brown, smart, kemba, Rob williams, payton Pritchard, Tristan thompson/theis"
"3 stud team, don't forget Payton Pritchard"
"Cool, Herro was better his rookie year.   If you thought it was a fine take then why are we even talking because I said that Pritchard will be better because of his ability to shoot like 45 mins ago. If you watched each guy in college you could see it. Pritchard didn't magically become a better shooter than Maxey when he got to the league we've known this for much longer than 7 games (although we've played 8)   I know what you said, but this wouldn't have even been a discussion if I called Maxey better than Payton"
Payton Pritchard thinks Curry is the goat confirmed?
"Oh we love him and I love him....now. But, at the time of the draft 99% hated it.   Most of us wanted Tyrell Terry. I wanted the pick to be traded and was fuming when we got Payton Pritchard instead of Terry or a veteran, as the 28th pick got the Lakers Schroder"
"His stats were artificial though. He got them mostly when Nurse put him out against the Celtics bench. It was like Payton Pritchard, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, and Rob Williams against the Raptors starting unit. I think his first half stats are more relevant to his play."

"For every 1 Payton Pritchard, there are 9 Jiri Welschs lmao"
"This is part of why payton pritchard is having success for the celtics. He keeps dribbles alive like his life depends on it and snakes around until he finds his way into the paint. He's able to generate inside-out basketball better than a lot of point guards do, which isn't necessary or indicative of success, but its working great for him rn."
Payton Pritchard new gem?
Yeah because adding Ben Simmons turns around a Series that ended in a sweep üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Btw Payton Pritchard is better than Maxey
"Payton Pritchard/Siakam, who ya got?"
"When he starts him over Payton Pritchard, who‚Äôs been one of the 5 best rookies this year yeah imma pissed at that motherfucker."
"Payton Pritchard is exceeding expectations so far this season, should be a solid contributor off the bench when Kemba comes back"
Payton Pritchard
We should‚Äôve picked Payton Pritchard with the 14th pick. My guy is killing it
Is ~~Jayson Tatum~~ ~~Jaylen Brown~~ Payton Pritchard better than Siakam?
Everytime Tremont Waters came off for Payton Pritchard the whole team looked revitalized
"When you prepare for Jayson Tatum, but  get Payton Pritchard on the test and still get fucked by Tatum's section"
Payton Pritchard
Hey that‚Äôs Toronto mayor Payton Pritchard to you
Remember all those 20 year old draft twitter dweebs saying Payton Pritchard had no NBA skills? Good times.
I am once again asking that you start Payton Pritchard
Vote Payton Pritchard for Boston Celtics Starting Point Guard
Payton Pritchard will be the better playoff p
"Dude, Payton Pritchard is incredible. Holy shit. This dude is gonna be a baller"
Payton Pritchard is really poised. He's the best non-lottery pick I've seen from the C's in a while.   Why did Waters start?
"We don‚Äôt have a lot of issues but the ones we have are glaring. Namely our bench, because with Kemba out and Smart starting our best bench player might be Payton Pritchard which is far from ideal."
"I wanted Tyrell Terry for backup PG and we got Payton Pritchard instead. Terry can't get minutes on Dallas, and Pritchard has been an excellent backup so far and is 3rd among rookies in minutes played. I liked Pritchard immediately as soon as the season started."
"PP is Payton Pritchard, our rookie out of Oregon"
Payton Pritchard
"6 with Kemba out   Payton Pritchard and Timelord are moving their way up from ""fringe player"" status to ""rotation backup"" status in recent games though üëÄ"
PP is probably Paul Pierce but as a duck fan I like to imagine it‚Äôs Payton Pritchard
Oooo so close you got 3 of them. Smart and OG and Nader.   The others are Payton Pritchard and Aron Baynes
"Well he stated Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, Payton Pritchard who looks good so far, grant Williams has been a solid bench piece, Robert Williams is promising, Romeo shows promise when he's on the court there hasn't been alot of misses imo"
"That's a weird way of spelling Payton ""fast pp"" Pritchard."
