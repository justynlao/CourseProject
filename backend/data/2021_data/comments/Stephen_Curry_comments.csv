I want you to watch one Golden State Warriors game if there’s one thing I can tell you almost no one in this league gets more contact without driving as much is Stephen Curry he is constantly grabbed pushed and manhandled while trying to maneuver around the court to get the ball back in his hands it’s actually insane even watching him before the game starts you’ll see countless cuts on his shoulders it’s insane
"I mean, have you seen how blind the refs are when Stephen Curry is on the court?"
Watched my team and my favorite player in a game. My team won. My favorite player won. Feels great. Stephen Curry is a gift.
The Boston Celtics defeat Stephen Curry 111-107
Yeah so Stephen Curry is still really fucking good

"[Shaq vs Steph occurred once.](https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=300111009)  [Found only one photo of the two together.](https://www.basket4us.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stephen-Curry5.jpg)  Shaq scored 13 that game, Curry 21. Between them they managed one 3pt make."
chef stephen makin me hungry for some of his curry mmmhhmmmmm
STEPHEN CURRY
"I’m taking about shooting. Hence why I said “in general” lol.  It’s weird that anyone refers to deep 3’s as “Lillard Range” when playing against Stephen Curry himself, the greatest shooter of all time.  Statistically Khris Middleton is a better midrange shooter than Kobe and Jordan but no one thinks of him over those 2 when thinking of the best midrange scorers.  Obviously it’s not the same gap between Dame and Curry but for me the concepts the same.  Curry is more known for it and when thinking “deep 3’s” i’ll always think him over Dame and i’m willing to bet the majority thinks that too"

Best point guard in the NBA. Wardell Stephen Curry II is close. Casuals really going to bring up Damian Lillard and Luka Dončić though? Stop embarrassing yourselves.

No Curry. No JJB. No Stephen Silas.
"If I was a blazer's fan I probably wouldn't be the biggest Stephen Curry fan either lol but arguing that Draymond Green and Oubre (this season so far, his last few games have been approaching okay) provided better spacing is just laughable. Teams straight up only guarded Steph on the perimeter and he gets triple teamed."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Stephen “benefit of the doubt” Curry, I just dont see the argument for being the best Guard or even Point Guard in the league."
"&gt; The narrative has always been “if you’re a pg not name Magic Johnson or Stephen Curry, you’re not winning the championship as the first option.”  Has it? Billups almost repeated as a first option  For this I would go Curry, partly because he fits fantastically with Odom, who's far and away the best player on that roster. Curry is also probably better in most cases, but not all"
"&gt; The narrative has always been “if you’re a pg not name Magic Johnson or Stephen Curry, you’re not winning the championship as the first option.”  Isiah Thomas?"
"&gt;Bro has anybody in league history ever fallen off harder than the Warriors dynasty?  Yes wtf. Dear god, yes. This question is shocking to me honestly lmao. Do people around here not know basketball history?   Like, you've heard of the Chicago Bulls yeah? Led by MJ? After he left, they were last in their division for four years, averaging a win rate of .227.  The fact the Warriors lost a top 5 player in the league and managed to snag a very solid key player in Wiggins along with a solid bench and keep performing middle of the pack is pretty impressive all things considered. And this is without Klay Thompson. Not to mention a number two overall pick up and potential for lottery pick next year if not then year after. The Warriors are not in some awful place, even though they aren't currently contenting.   Sure, the fall from 2019 to 2020 was massive. But we all know what happened, the two superstars of the team were injured. It's not like the Warriors have entered into some lottery build with no reason to watch. They still have Stephen Curry, who's averaging 28 5 and 6, and who's shooting % are rising each game. They've made huge comebacks against two of the top teams in the league. They're not bottom of barrel trash despite inconsistencies.   Surprisingly, we could be in much worse of a position after KD's departure. This is not a bad place to be at the end of a dynasty."
"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
You’re tripping if you don’t think he has huge risk of continuing all those nagging injuries as he gets older. Players fall off from grace fast as hell and I question how long some of you have been NBA fans from reading this thread   Stephen Curry is still a top 3 player in the NBA but he is turning 33 this year with an injury history and he is a small guard who is already questionable sometimes on the defensive end.  I’ve seen countless stars and superstars go from all nba player to completely washed within the matter of 18-24 months before    Don’t expect Curry to be the best guard in basketball for that much longer. I’d be surprised if he is still a top 10 player in the 2022-23 season and at many times this season Curry has had GARBAGE games followed up by great games. He didn’t have this level of inconsistency in the regular seasons between 15-19
"Is Dwyane Wade better than any of the following players (list not in order)?  Jordan, Kareem, LeBron, Bird, Magic, Duncan, Dirk, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Shaq, Hakeem, David Robinson, Julius Erving, Wilt, Bill Russell, Charles Barkley, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robinson, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Garnett, Chris Paul, Havlicek, Bob Pettit, Kawhi.    There are others I'd put ahead too but my point is that he isn't a top 25 player ever imo. For the 2000s he didn't even play the whole decade. He is clearly behind Shaq (who ended decade badly but was amazing for most of it), Dirk, Duncan, Kobe, LeBron, Nash, and Garnett. He is borderline top 10 along with  Dwight and Chris Paul in there too."
"That literally isn't true  He has missed small time with ankle injuries since. dude missed like a month in 17-18 and since then he has constantly had little problems with his ankles since even as recently as 3 weeks ago where curry didn't finish a game cause of his ankle. luckily it was only a tweak but still      https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stephen-curry-player-injuries  Even if he isn't missing time ankle pains, tweaks and small day to day injuries add up over time"
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don’t care if he’s struggling in the regular season. He’s a playoff monster.   Top 10 players in order:  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić."
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."

"Even so, it's Stephen Curry. It's a cardinal sin to go under the screen against him rofl."
"He's a below average to bad shooter. It also doesn't help that he has the worst 3-Point shot selection I've ever seen, minus Stephen Curry."
"Why are you comparing the best player on the planet to LeBron James, Wardell Stephen Curry II, etc?   Kevin Durant tried to spoon feed Wardell Stephen Curry II the FMVP in 2018, but Wardell Stephen Curry II choked. You’re worried about Kevin Durant’s ego? Funny.  The Los Angeles Lakers aren’t locks to make the NBA Finals. The Brooklyn Nets will sweep the Los Angeles Clippers or Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals."
"Stephen “Human Torch” Curry I loved but never stuck w the public sadly.   And ppl don’t remember, but Kevin Durant used to be called “kid clutch” in 2010  b4 switching to Durantula or something."
"Saying it's  ""one of the BIGGEST things he needs to work on"" when he's the fucking best and most efficient at it in the NBA at 20 years old having played 40 games?!?!?! Yea, dude that's shit insight on your part. You know, I think one of the biggest things Stephen Curry needs to work on is shooting the 3. See??? I sound like an idiot just saying words...I didn't say he shouldn't get better. Clearly he will, great players do. Do better."
They lost Seth curry one of the best shooters in the league and Stephen Silas who's the apparent mastermind behind their historically great offense.  Covid and injuries is definitely a big factor but this is also why they look worse offensively from last year.
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"Luka Dončić, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the overrated trio. I’m going to keep saying it. I don’t care if it hurts your feelings.  Giannis Antetokounmpo isn’t a top 5 player in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Anthony Davis are better.  Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn’t the 2nd best player of the 2010s. Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.   Luka Dončić isn’t a top 10 player in the NBA. Luka Dončić doesn’t have GOAT potential."
"Warriors have a better net rating by 1.8 pp100 with Stephen Curry off the floor  (Obviously this doesn’t mean Currys bad or anything, just food for thought)"

Wardell Stephen Curry II doesn’t have an argument that he was better than Kevin Durant in 2017 or 2018. You don’t take a backseat to a player that isn’t better than you.   Considering Wardell Stephen Curry II as the second best player of the 2010s and Wardell Stephen Curry II being better than Kevin Durant when they were both on the Golden State Warriors are the most embarrassing takes on r/NBA.

What kind of douchebag thinks to himself, “you know what my calling card will be? Something besides my weird fucking voice to separate me from all other announcers..... Stephen Curry”"

"Skimmed it but mostly it seems like he's saying LeBron dominates against the Sixera about as much as he dominates against every team. Weird way to title the article, especially for a Philadelphia paper.  Also a gem from the end of the article mailbag section: ""I came up with this trade proposal, what do you think?

This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
It's time to be genuinely concerned about Stephen Curry
"Wardell Stephen Curry II, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Dončić are the overrated trio."
"Carrying a team gets you MVP votes but that doesn’t mean that you’re a better player than another guy. Russell Westbrook is not better than Stephen Curry even though he can carry an average team farther than Steph. Giannis is just too limited man. Forget the numbers, they can’t win big games because Giannis can’t do anything in the final minutes of a game. I want AD over Giannis because AD can do everything on the court, Giannis can’t. Giannis has lost his confidence too man. He’s just not what he should be right now."
"And that, my dear fellow, is why Stephen curry is the single most influential player in the games history."
Robert Horry is not Stephen Curry.
"I would be surprised if we don't retire Kyrie Irving. He hit possibly the most important shot in franchise history over Stephen Curry. I get we ended on a bad note, but I think he did more than enough when he was here to deserve it."

"If he can be a little more efficient and score more considering the fact he is the offensive engine, and the dubs capture the 4th or 5th seed he gets his 3rd mvp i guess. I mean the current numbers are good but not the STEPHEN CURRY standard. He has set his bar so high that we all keep wanting for more.  Also look at Curry man!"
Golden State Warriors should just send Stephen Curry to Milwakee Bucks or Denver Nuggets
Well Ernuh I just dont think Stephen Curry has what it takes
"Statistically it's Curry, and it's not particularly close. He has better stats in the regular season, playoffs, and finals. Accolades wise it probably goes to Kobe, although Steph does have one more MVP.  The counter to the stats argument would be Kobe was a better defender, but there's not much of an edge for Kobe in the stats, with Kobe having a career 105.5 defensive rating, and Steph having a 106.7 career defensive rating.   **Regular Season**  * Stephen Curry - 23.6 pts on 62.3 TS%, 6.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds, 1.7 steals, 0.2 blocks, .205 WS/48, +11.7 on-off rating in 34.3 mpg. * Kobe Bryant - 25.0 pts on 55.0 TS%, 4.7 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 0.5 blocks, .170 WS/48, +4.6 on-off rating in 36.1 mpg.  **Playoffs**  * Stephen Curry - 26.5 points on 60.9 TS%, 6.3 assists, 5.4 rebounds, 1.6 steals, 0.3 blocks, .194 WS/48, +12.6 on-off rating in 37.8 mpg. * Kobe Bryant - 25.6 points on 54.1 TS%, 4.7 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 0.7 blocks, .157 WS/48, +7.6 on-off rating in   **NBA Finals**  * Stephen Curry - 26.46 points on 58.9 TS%, 6.2 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 steals, 0.4 blocks. * Kobe Bryant -  25.32 points on 50.9 TS%, 5.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 1.7 steals, 0.9 blocks."

"So Wardell Curry I was called Dell Curry back in the day, and his son, Wardell Stephen Curry II, is called Stephen.  I guess it's official: the Currys are anti War."
"Stephen Curry comes from a long line of basketball demon slayers; Curry is the family name of a lineage of humans that cooked basketball offerings for the basketball Gods, cast down by the basketball gods for flying too close to the stars.  In response, the lineage turned to demon slaying as a way to redeem themselves before the Basketball Gods, training to shoot the ball far enough away from demons so as not to be slain by their infernal pressure.     Each member of the Curry Clan is tasked at birth with slaying a specific demon.  Steph, a particular promising Curry, was tasked with defeating the basketball demon Dribbadon, Demon-god of Handles.  It is believed that Kyrie Irving, upon activating his third eye, will summon Dribbadon into this world to kill beautiful, team first basketball and replace it with ballhogging Demon-iso play.     Curry tried to summon Dribbadon early, as a way to save Kyrie and possibly all of basketball, by defeating him in the NBA tournament of champions and keep him from activating his 3rd eye.  When Kyrie came into the league, he seemed to have no chance of getting to the Championship -- the expectation for activating his 3rd sight and summoning Dribbadon -- due to being on a terrible team with no change in sight.  Curry was taught diligence at a young age though and, despite seemingly not needing to worry about Kyrie, he still trained and prepared for needing to beat Kyrie if the time arose...and almost out of nowhere it did.    Suddenly LeBron James, Chosen champion of the Gods of Basketball, decided to return to his home -- coincidentally being where Kyrie Irving resided.  Over night the team transformed into a championship level team that rivaled anything in the NBA at the time, and -- it seemed -- Curry was not ready yet.  Except he was, by the  grace of the Gods of Basketball -- injuries to key Cleveland players -- he was.     For a year he was.  Right when it was believed the Warriors would be able to defeat the Cavs a second time and keep Kyrie's eye from activating at all -- and possibly leading to the fickle LeBron leaving his hometown yet again -- the warriors inexplicably lost a 3-1 lead for the first time in championship history.  But this was on purpose.  Curry, the clever skyfucker that he is, had reasoned that it wasn't *just* about winning.  No, Kyrie needed to win *because* of him and his demonic handles, not just as a secondary factor.  Almost in unison Curry knew that he needed to prepare and Kyrie, whether by his own design or that of Dribbadon leaking into the real world, knew that he needed to leave the good thing in Cleveland and find a way to win while being ""the man""... as only then could his 3rd eye activate.  Seeing that his power alone would not be enough, Curry set up to lose the championship game as a way to bring in Kevin Durant, a fledgling Basketball Reaper (basketball champions tasked with helping demon slayers in their tasks, often without even knowing their role in the otherworldly battle).     This lead to Kyrie ultimately leaving for the Celtics and Curry bringing KD onto his team, both sides preparing for an ultimate, final battle.  But... somehow Kyrie getting back to the championship never happened.  Not for trying -- being on stacked teams again and again -- but it just never happened.  In the meantime, Curry has been keeping his power level low, conserving energy until the day Kyrie finally reaches the championship again and possibly activates his 3rd eye, summoning Dribbadon to our world.     There have been small stirrings, people wondering if Kyrie has somehow been slowly activating his 3rd eye in other ways.  While World B. Flat seems to be the going crazy, those with links to the HoF Pantheon of basketball wonder if perhaps he is seeing the world beyond our world -- a flat endless world of black and white...Gods and demons... makes and misses.  There is a worry that perhaps there is another way to activate the demon's eye...and so Curry waits for the coming of Kyrie's 3rd eye.  Of Dribbadon.  Of his purpose.

"Wardell Stephen ""Rock Lee"" Curry II"
"Why are you being so condescending hahaha  Let’s look at James Hard and Stephen Curry. Both are the system and are superstars. Kawhi Leonard— superstar and trancends a system that revolves around him.   Damian Lillard— superstar? I think so. Plays within a system that allows him to go off. I can see why people would argue against it.   Donovan Mitchell is a star and not a superstar. Rudy Gobert being the focus of their system has produced him individual awards and no real post season success. Good defensive player, not a superstar."

"I don't really understand the point of this thread... if by comparing their stats, Rose would be inflated if he was in his prime right now with no injury and at Brogdon age. Time has changed, offense is a lot more fast paced now, while Bulls offense back then was literally Derrick Rose. So for him to be able to average that while being the main focus of the defense is actually insane, it's literally how Stephen Curry is being guarded now, but Curry is the best shooter of all time, defense doesn't collapse on Curry like Rose when he gets to the rim, but defense would literally clobber Curry no matter where he go with 2-3 people guarding him."
i hate to be nit picky but technically he’s not. for whatever reason his name is Wardell Stephen Curry II instead of Jr.

"&gt;	 He's objectively the most efficient volume scorer in finals history, as well as one of the most efficient over all, above both Jordan &amp; LeBron.  Ya did jordan or lebron play with Stepehn Curry next to them: doing ball handling, shot creation, dealing with double teams, traps, etc. ?  Really makes you wonder why Durant somehow got so much better at shooting once he went to GS. Nah it’s because he didn’t have to create and being the focal point of the defense: that would be stephen Curry"
"[Elgin Baylor](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/elgin-baylor-stephen-curry-never-seen-anybody-shoot-like/) and Reggie Miller have also had high praise for Steph, the latter this year especially since Steph surpassed him on the all-time 3PM ladder. For as corny as Reggie is as a commentator, it's really fun and wholesome seeing him be Steph's biggest fan whenever he has the chance"
That’s exactly what I think. He had harden/WB in OKC. He had *stephen fucking curry* in his prime creating and doing all the heavy offensive lifting. And now he has james harden.   Ive said it before but this was his year to prove he can be a primary ball handler and elevate his teammates but now he has harden.
Curry is more recognizable than Stephen though
"no player except griffin over 6'7 has failed to try at least one dunk this season let that sink in  shooting 37%, free throw rate down to 3.1 per game, 0.1 bpg, damian lillard is averaging more, and he's listed generously at 6'2 trea young averages more too, listed at 6'1 Chris Paul, aged 35 and listed at 6'1, is averaging more. all 6'3 and 120 pounds of stephen curry is outrebounding blake   advanced stats indicate that he's below replacement level this year. safely below meaning that a random G league guy would be better than griffin atm"

"The franchise that drafted two point guards in the same draft ahead of Stephen Curry?  Nah, I imagine they'll have a rational, well thought out plan to maximise any trade haul."
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust.

But it’s silly to think Warriors should regret picking Wiseman when he has shown flashes of raw talent and athletic ability. Not everyone figures it all out in their first two years."

"From Germany. I was never into basketball until in 2013 i saw stephen curry playoff highlights against denver (the 23? point 3rd quarter). When i saw this video, all i thought was DAMN that looks rly fun. 2014 i watched every regular season game since then. (airs live 4:30 in the morning but thats fine cause im up at 4 already)."
"Wait, can we say three names? I will go Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic and Adam Sandler. I mean, if we get the other four guys, we can just have Sandler making funny stuff while the others destroy the rivals..."
"Ridder: When I think back to that day, that's what I continuously see over and over in my mind: Kobe backing Coop down for those turnaround fadeaway 16-foot jumpers, tongue out, from the baseline, the free throw line, the elbow, all around. Kobe hitting those from everywhere.  Carbone: Kobe was about the 10,000-hour rule even as a teenager. In high school, on Saturdays he'd lift at St. Joseph's and then I'd rebound for him when he'd shoot. He had just started when the lady who ran the gym yelled, ""We're closing!"" and then, boom, with no warning she shut off all the lights. I'm holding the ball in the dark, thinking, OK, I guess we're done, and Kobe yells, ""Give me the ball!"" I was actually afraid for a little bit because he yelled it so loud. But I gave him the ball and he kept shooting in the dark for another half-hour. Swish. Swish. Swish.  Black: I don't remember if it was 10 shots in a row that he made or more. I knew Michael Cooper pretty well and he was very proud, and he definitely took that request from Jerry as a challenge. He wanted to shut Kobe down. I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think Michael was embarrassed by what Kobe did to him that day.  Kupchak: The ease with which at 17 he was able to compete with one of the all-time great defenders in the game, that's what really stood out.  Cooper: When I did force him to take a bad shot, he'd just smile and shoot me that eye of the tiger.  Ridder: I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Then Jerry stands up after what felt like only 20 minutes and, I'll never forget this, he says: ""Let's get out of here. I've seen enough. This kid's better than anybody we have on our team right now.""  Jerry West: He was incredibly gifted in terms of skill at that point. It was a very impressive workout and, frankly, a lot more than expected. And all of a sudden your antenna goes up and you think, Oh my gosh, this kid's really good. With our position in the draft, at No. 24, I was just thinking: There's no way, we have no chance of getting this guy.  Ryan West: Larry Drew was a Lakers assistant at the time. Someone asked him what he thought that day and his line always stuck with me. He said, ""That man is the truth.""      ""This guy's the next Jordan. I gotta get him.""     New Jersey Nets coach John Calipari, after Kobe worked out for the team in the spring on 1996  As they were leaving the gym, Jerry West turned to an exhausted Cooper and joked: ""I thought you were going to guard him?""  Jerry West: Coop was a good one. I gave him a hard time about it. It was just Father Time. I told him, ""You're just too damn old and this guy, he's just too damn good."" Regardless of who Kobe worked out against, he was going to be the best player on the floor.  Kupchak: He was just obsessed with competition to a level you don't see in young players very often. You don't get that maniacal competitiveness very often, and here we were seeing it with someone who was 17.  Cooper: When I finished that workout, and my part in it was probably only 20-30 minutes, it felt like I had played a seven-game series with the Celtics again. Like I had just finished facing Larry Bird and Dennis Johnson. My body was aching something bad. Early in the pre-draft process, Kobe worked out against Celtics icon and coach Dennis Johnson, who had been named NBA All-Defense nine times in his career. Johnson learned a lesson Cooper would also learn just weeks later: Kobe was no ordinary teenager. Tom Landers/The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Coincidentally, a few weeks earlier, when Kobe worked out for Boston, he was matched up against Johnson, Cooper's nemesis, who was then an assistant coach with the Celtics. The results were very similar, and timeless: Age yields to youth. In his Boston workout and especially in his interview with team execs, Kobe wowed the entire Celtics organization, all the way up to team president Red Auerbach himself. The hardest part of the entire ordeal for Kobe, who had grown up a die-hard Lakers fan, was having to put on the Celtic Green workout gear. Kobe and West were kindred spirits in that regard: After losing to the Celtics six times in the NBA Finals as a player, West had forbidden that particular shade of green in his house.  Cooper: Afterward, I'm sweating like a b---- over there and Jerry leans in and asks me, ""Coop, what do you think?"" And I was like, ""Jerry, he's f---ing good, man."" Right after that, Jerry says: ""This is our guy."" I'll never forget that: ""This is the kid."" And then everyone said it: This is our pick, this is our guy. And you know what? Thank God.  Jerry West: You watch a workout like that -- there isn't much of a choice to think of anything else. I remember saying to Jerry Buss, our owner, I said, ""Jerry, he's the best player in the draft."" I meant it. I would have taken Kobe as the first player in the draft. It was a no-brainer. He had this -- forget desire -- he just didn't want to stop playing. Ever.  Ryan West: After the workout, it was so funny, driving back to Santa Monica he wanted to go find an empty gym to go play in and he was trying, the whole time, to convince me to take him somewhere to find a pickup game. I finally said, ""Kobe, you're in the pre-draft process for the NBA. I don't know if you want to risk getting injured."" Knowing him, when I dropped him off at the hotel he probably found a way to go somewhere and play or at least work on his game.  Ridder: We all hopped back into Jerry's car and sat there in sheer amazement at what we had just seen.  Black: I think Jerry was a Mercedes guy, and in his car he was raving the whole time: ""That's the best workout I've ever seen.""  More stories from David Fleming      Breaking down the 'organized chaos' that fuels Stephen Curry      DK Metcalf is closing in fast (like, 22.6 mph fast) on football glory      'I'm gonna beat up Brutus:' An epic mascot melee years in the making      The six words of trash talk that made ""The Last Dance"" possible  But not for long. A few days later, with Kobe still in town shooting his commercial, the Lakers brought him back for one more workout, this time with Dontae' Jones, the 6-8 220-pound senior power forward who had just carried Mississippi State to the Final Four and was a projected first-rounder.  Heisler: This was a big, strong guy. He was a load. Before that workout started, the Lakers probably thought there was a very good chance that Dontae' Jones was gonna kick Kobe's ass.  Ryan West: They were so impressed by what Kobe had done to Cooper, the idea with the second workout was, let's validate, let's see if he can do this against somebody who is ready to play in the NBA right now. Dontae' Jones was a physical specimen and Kobe just had his way with him. The first thing Dontae' did was try to use his strength and bully him by taking him down into the post and shooting a jump hook. Kobe blocked it. The second workout was even much more impressive than the first and, with my dad, it started a borderline obsession with Kobe.  Kupchak: Afterward we went to a Subway and sat down and had lunch with Arn. Kobe and Ryan West were at another table. They were either talking about, or playing, video games. This Subway had an outdoor seating area that was a little more private because Jerry couldn't really go many places in L.A. Kobe was fine. Nobody knew who he was. ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen  Ridder: Jerry's a notoriously fast eater. He's the fastest eater in the world. A sandwich or a burrito, he'd scarf that thing down in four minutes and we'd be back in the car. Knowing Jerry he scarfed his lunch down even faster that day because he was in a hurry to get back to the Forum and start figuring out a way to swing a trade to get this kid.  Ryan West: Taking Kobe back to his hotel the second time it all just seemed like the perfect marriage. Everyone at the Lakers was so enamored with him. And him being in Los Angeles and being a Laker, it all made too much sense. They were going to find a way to get him no matter what. The draft was only a couple weeks away. When I dropped him off, he said, ""I don't know when I'll see you again."" And I kinda winked at him and said, ""I have a feeling I'm gonna see you again pretty soon.""  Heisler: Kobe was pretty OK going to the Nets, until he came out west for his Lakers workouts. Now Kobe's hanging out with Ryan West and eating dinner at the Wests' house and he's part of the family. This was the most important part of this whole thing: Every team that brought in Kobe -- the Clippers, the Suns and others -- they all said it was the greatest workout they had ever seen and immediately started trying to make moves to get him. But at that point Kobe decided he wanted to be a Laker, and he didn't want to be anything else. The big thing they had to do was shake New Jersey.  After wolfing down his footlong sub, Jerry West hatched a plan. Because the Lakers weren't picking until 24th in the draft, his priority to that point had been trying to lure free agent Shaquille O'Neal from Orlando to Los Angeles. First, though, West had to move Lakers center Vlade Divac and his $4.7 million salary to clear roster and cap space for Shaq's seven-year, $120 million offer. Now, also needing to move up in order to grab Kobe, the deal took on even more significance -- almost too much. West later wrote that the stress sent him ""spiraling downward and into the hospital for exhaustion for a few days."""
&gt;	Crazy that Harden could realistically have been a 2-4 time MVP if it wasn't for narratives consistently changing against his case lol  Say that to lebron james or stephen Curry as well

Hmm.  He's lucky he doesn't play against Curry in the West very often.  [https://www.landofbasketball.com/games\_between/stephen\_curry\_vs\_ben\_simmons.htm](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/stephen_curry_vs_ben_simmons.htm)
"The weirdest thing about comments like this is the fact that people pretend like because Curry is on the court, KD couldn’t or didn’t receive double teams.   As if the Warriors didn’t have at least two non shooters on the court at all times.   He is unstoppable and he is harder to double team cause of where he picks his spots. And we are seeing that literally this year.   Kerr did a great job of not making him create on the perimeter. That was his issue on OKC. That isn’t exclusively possible with Stephen curry.   “Doubles effected his shooting percentages like anyone else in OKC”   Nobody else had OKC horrible spacing and coaching. That’s what affected his percentages. GSW spacing is special, but OKCs spacing was just as if not more special on the opposite spectrum."
"You are joking right? If anything Stephen Curry is overrated, guys are constantly calling him the best point guard ever"
Stephen Curry with 40 inch vertical
Bro even Stephen Curry usually goes for a layup on a fast break you ain't Stephen Curry
&gt;MPJ is following the correct lane in a 2-on-1 situation. He's staring at Murray to see what is going on.  I don't get this. It would be 'correct lane' if game score is tied and there is plenty of time left. But your team is down by 2 and only 5 seconds left. Attack the rim is right play unless you are Stephen Curry.
Besides that one guy who actually had won championships as PG. What's your favorite curry? Red? Yellow? Green? Stephen?

Those lean post-Shaq years weren't great, but it actually looks like his last 3 seasons sunk him the most. Same story for Pierce, although for him it actually looks more like his early Celtics years sunk him."

"To be fair that's what a lot of people (including me) thought in this past draft. The Warriors FO doesn't often get the chance to draft a top fifteen pick, and they really crave it. The last top 15 picks they used since 2009 netted them James Wiseman, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, Epke Udoh (hard miss), and Stephen Curry. They haven't missed much in the last eleven years when given a good chance."

"Who does he thinks he is, Stephen Curry?"
"It's insane to think about how the league has changed the way they score. When MJ entered the league, only 2% of total points were 3-pointers. 5% of his total points came from 3-pointers. If MJ had tried to adjust his game to the likes of Ray Allen, then he could've prolonged his career.   Whereas today, 34% of total points are 3-pointers. It's a Ray Allen league where 36% of his total points were 3's.   With Stephen Curry, 46% of his total points are 3's. You have to wonder if this trend will continue."

"I know Curry fans have been pushing this narrative that Steph is already a Top 10 all time great and is on Magic's level, but he's not; Magic is clearly better  Just look at this for starters, in Magic's 13 short seasons to Curry's 12  [https://www.landofbasketball.com/player\_comparison/stephen\_curry\_vs\_magic\_johnson.htm](https://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/stephen_curry_vs_magic_johnson.htm)  Biggest difference being Magic was an all time great from the very start, Curry was not. Curry's peak in 2016 was insane, but it took a while for him to even become a superstar. Magic also, despite his Tragic Johnson moment in the 84 Finals vs an all time great team, always elevated his game at high moments, including in the Finals by winning FMVP as a rookie at like age 20.  It's Magic and it's not even close. It's not an insult to Curry, it's just a testament to Magic's greatness"
There’s a stat somewhere that this season Curry is shorting 43+% from three when playing with Draymond and 32% from three without. You could argue some spacing issues with him but this team is about maximizing Stephen Fucking Curry .

"I seriously just don't think KD's better than Curry or Harden.  I don't think it's blasphemous/disrespectful for people to rate him over them, I understand arguments for it ofc, I just disagree and am interested in seeing new arguments in favor of or against it.  In fact, this is a recent development, last year I would've said KD's definitely the 2nd best player in the league, but since then I've had my opinions changed and I evaluate players differently.  But on the flip side, when you say things like ""You must be a massive warrior Stan if you in any universe think Stephen Curry holds a candle to Durant in a best player discussion.""  it's hard for me to take you serious.   Acting like I'm arguing that Thon Maker better than KD or some shit lol."

"Stephen ""Tuco"" Curry"
"Steph also has the all-time regular season wins record, the only all-time unanimous MVP. Multiple All-Time Three-point shooting records, advanced stats that are far beyond Kobe’s, and shifted the NBA to another era. Multiple players now and in. The future are imitating Stephen Curry. Kobe was himself an imitation of someone else.   And remember, all-time means beyond literally any other player in history. If you choose to weight a couple more rings as second banana over that, you do it for the exact reason I told you. Emotional attachment."

"Stephen Curry is the best offensive player of all time. The way he makes defenses react at basically all times whether he has the ball or not... combined with his shooting, ball-handling, range.. he gets his teammates so many opportunities every game. It’s unmatched"
"From [Kevin O'Connor:](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1379666802456850433?s=20)  Stephen Curry ran 36 pick-and-rolls tonight, tied for his second-most in a game this season, per  @SecondSpectrum. The Warriors scored an elite 1.03 points per chance on those Curry pick-and-rolls. As a team, Golden State tied a season-high with 71 pick-and-rolls."
I love watching Stephen Curry play basketball.
Someone made a post early this season when Steph was struggling asking if a discussion needs to be had about whether or not Stephen Curry is washed up.

"&gt;Did I say they were okay? No. But how severe the offending player is punished and viewed depends on the outcome.  Schroder very rarely gets hurt -- he's missed \~30 games in his career -- so it's okay for large players to target him, and throw him around during dead ball situations?  Just because he's less injury-prone than, say, Stephen Curry who missed a handful of games after falling on his ass, Anunoby gets a pass for trying to injure him?  Per the official box score, Scott did not even call a flagrant foul on Anunoby.  Just a technical.  Per the rulebook, that means he decided that Anunoby's actions were ""unsportsmanlike"" but somehow ""necessary"" and ""not excessive"".  Neither was Trent called for a flagrant foul for lining up Caruso and jumping his elbow into his face.  Caruso was in concussion protocol two weeks ago, and probably should be again after that, for safety's sake.  &gt;OG deserved the ejection, nothing more. Had he injured Schroder a suspension would have been warranted.   Apparently it is open season on Lakers, and I have a problem with that, even if neither player was unlucky enough to appear seriously injured immediately afterward.  &gt; The world isn't black and white.   No, it isn't.  But if the Lakers ran around trying to injure Raptors like that, without repercussions, you would be livid."

Is that your argument? That you couldn't stop Wardell Stephen Curry when he wanted to win so bad he played early despite being injured? When he was so hot he made logo shots? Jrue played excellent defense on multiple possessions but you physically cannot stop Steph.

Stephen Curry has fired his agent and will be signing with Klutch Sports  *Tampering intensifies*

"Right, so it comparisons like this come down to whether or not you grade on a “curve” or not.    I do.  So I’d choose the one who performs best relative to his peers at the time he played.    Which I still think is Stephen curry though.  Reggie Miller was also ray Allen level...as were a few others like Steve Kerr."

"&gt; If the Warriors want to compete for a championship with Stephen Curry in his prime, they will trade James Wiseman this offseason.

"&gt;Semantics are quite literally the only reason Lebron didn't win that award. He averaged 36-13-9 with his two best teammates out due to injury and took them to 6 games on his back.  Semantics? What semantics? Its an unwritten rule dude. He lost so he doesn't get the award. Those aint semantics lmao.     &gt;If you wanna argue about who should win it from the winning team, it's Iggy, and no amount of revisionist history will change that.   &gt;   &gt; ""Listed at 125-1 odds before the series, Iguodala became the Warriors' most important two-way player, making it not even a question that he'd receive the award over regular-season MVP Stephen Curry""  It's pretty much universally agreed upon that Iggy didn't deserve it, Curry did. Even Iggy probably agrees. Take Curry off of the 2015 team and they lose in 4. Take Iggy off of the 2015 team and it goes to game 7, 50/50 odds. Lebron still averaged 36 or something ridiculous. Sure, he was inefficient but he was inefficient because he took so many shots. Why did he take so many shots? Because there was nobody else to take them. Andre did as good a job as one can on Lebron but he barely dented him. He made smart rotations, good plays, made smart gambles and occasionally clamped him up. Lebron still nearly averaged a 36 point triple double in a loss. It feels like you're just hating on Steph for whatever reason."
"&gt; LBJ was the best player on that court. Thats common sense.    &amp;#x200B;  Okay. I'm not going to argue with you about rather or not somebody from a losing team should be able to win a Finals MVP. There is precedence.

"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.

"If the Warriors want to compete for a championship with Stephen Curry in his prime, they will trade James Wiseman this offseason.   You can't compete for a championship and build for the future at the same time, it cannot be done.  You have to commit one way or the other, and it would be negligence of the highest order if they waste the prime years of one of the 10-15 greatest players of all-time just because they don't want to admit they made a bad pick and they want to wait on Wiseman to become a good player."
I wonder when this sub will realize that Steph is almost as dependent on Draymond as Draymond is on him. Dray anchors the D and is the perfect 4 on 3 guy for when Curry gets trapped like Dame does. He also can handle and playmake which frees Curry to be at his most devastating as he can be elusive on the move.

&gt;many people believe that Curry is the GOAT PG   That's BS and you know it. Magic is a universal top 10 player ever and popular top 5 all time pick. I have literally never seen an all time top 10 list with Stephen Curry in it lmao. Stephs career doesn't compare to Magics .
"Kawhi was the best player : Stephen curry had the best player efficiency rating in the league. Kawhi was 6th behind KD, Russ, LeBron and CP3  Green, Klay and Iggy were better :"
I will agree with everything you said.  I’ll also just point out that Wiseman was drafted to a situation better than just about everyone you listed. He was drafted to a top class organization and coach and he gets to play with Stephen fucking Curry.
Thunderstruck is also [a film from 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstruck_\(2004_film\)) starring the one and only [Stephen Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry_\(comedian\)).
"Friendly reminder that of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry.  And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall."
"&gt;	It’s also very clear you cannot have a conversation without resorting to personal attacks.   Cry harder lmao   &gt;	Joining the league MVP has nothing to do with basketball ability. You really got me on the MVPs and more rings.  You still don’t get it do you. We have 3 years of data that shows Kevin Durant shoots below league average effiency when asked to initiate the offense *on the warriors*. Durant with a stacked warriors roster without Curry are a fringe playoff team. Add Curry to the mix and take out Durant? Curry keeps the offense firing in all cylinders.    &gt;	. Yet, Kevin Durant has had a better individual season, playoff performance, and consistent success than Stephen curry.  Curry beat Durant not sure how what you’re thinking here. Head to head Curry destroyed Durant with an inferior cast.   &gt;	Isn’t a better player than Kevin Durant. It’s also fucking stupid how you make it seem like kd&gt;steph is such a casual argument.   Yes you’re a casual fan we have already discussed this. Curry has the better peak. Curry’s playmaking and volume hold up against -10 defenses where Durant cratered in OKC when asked to do the same.   If Durant is the better player why couldn’t Kerr trust him to initiate the offense deep into the post season? Why according to touches, time spent with ball, passes completed, does it show that Curry is first in all these categories while Durant is third behind Draymond?  Why did Ty Lue and lebron and the rockets all try and trap Curry from half court and leave Kevin Durant wide open? These guys are obviously just stat nerds too, huh?"
"Less than a year ESPN put Steph higher than KD.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11%3Fplatform%3Damp  So if anyone is align with clown takes it’s you. It’s also very clear you cannot have a conversation without resorting to personal attacks. Joining the league MVP has nothing to do with basketball ability. You really got me on the MVPs and more rings. Steph curry revolutionized basketball with his three shooting. Broke the league and for two years they had no way to answer. Yet, Kevin Durant has had a better individual season, playoff performance, and consistent success than Stephen curry. You seem to convieniently ignore every single thing besides rings and MVPS, which rings in of itself are extremely circumstantial (draymond green&gt;Steve Nash, amirite?).   Steph curry is a phenomenal player, a once in a lifetime talent. Literally changed the game. Isn’t a better player than Kevin Durant. It’s also fucking stupid how you make it seem like kd&gt;steph is such a casual argument. No. Only people on this website who religiously use advanced stats (especially notoriously faulty ones for defensive metrics) and tie up everything before golden state and after and ignore it because you get butthurt about his team choices."
"Top 10 in order. By the way, I don’t overreact to 30 regular season games like some do. A 3 month stretch isn’t going to undermine years of someone else’s work.   1. LeBron James   2.

"Steve Nash is a fantastic NBA player, although MVP's don't make you a better player. Shaq has 1 MVP and he's better than Nash. This is why Steph having more MVP's than KD does not make him the better player  Steph too underperforms in the Playoffs, In 2016 Stephen Curry went from 30/5/7 with a 67 TS% to 25/5/5 with a 60 TS%. In the Finals alone he averaged 22.5 points to go alongside an Abysmal Game 7. Steph on multiple occasions dropped from 67 TS% to 60 TS% in the Playoffs.   KD is better than Steph, its not that controversial."
"&gt;They were much better with only Curry on the court while KD rested instead of other way around  This is because GSW is structured around Stephen Curry. KD is a player that can fit into any teams system without his game changing all to much, that's what he did on GSW. The team was better because their plays and style of play were much better suited to Steph play than KD."
"Watch some nuggets basketball before dropping these trash takes.   I think you meant leads the league* in every game  ""If advanced numbers and analytics are more your speed, you probably don’t even need to be talked into Jokić for MVP. He owns 10.7 win shares, 3.4 more than Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert, who are tied for second in the NBA. It’s the widest win-share margin the league NBA has seen since 2015–16—the year that Warriors star Stephen Curry, who finished the season ahead by 3.4 win shares, became the league’s first unanimous MVP. (Just in case you’re wondering if that’s due solely to the time Embiid and James have missed, it’s not. He holds the edge over Embiid and James—and the rest of the NBA—in win shares per 48 minutes, too.)  More historical context: Jokić’s season [currently ranks as one of the six best of all-time](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/bpm_season.html)—trailing only LeBron’s 2008–09 season, a trio of Michael Jordan campaigns and Curry’s unanimous MVP year—in box plus-minus, which measures a player’s box-score contributions to his team while on the court. While that might seem preposterous on its face, it may not be as far off as you think when looking at everything Jokić excels at within the context of his team, which … [he leads in nearly every conceivable statistic](https://twitter.com/Herring_NBA/status/1374889838298693638?s=20)."""
"Embiid third year contract coming off a near career ending foot injury and hardly playing competitive basketball for 2 years. He was playing on a minute restriction on a trash team.  Did anybody really think Embiid was gonna dominate his competition? No. He proved everybody wrong.  People were calling Wiseman Chris Bosh and AD off of workout videos and now that he isn't Chris Bosh or AD, it's unfair?  Wiseman just needed to put up Bagley numbers and that would've made him look like a budding star. But now he's ass, we got excuses.  Mitchell Robinson was killing it his rookie year. Zion came off an injury and was 300 plus pounds.  Wiseman is playing with Stephen Curry, in a good organization, all he has to do is finish plays and box out."

Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant come to mind
Stephen Curry had this team above .500 before his injury. Keep that in mind.
It was 4 plates IIRC.  He also does them with the hex bar elevated on a box so it's significantly easier than off the ground.    It's a decent amouont of weight but nothing crazy.

"The most-recently-drafted Top 10 draft pick to even play in the Finals is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- drafted #8 overall by the Pistons in 2013.

&gt;but Harden ended up being the best player from that draft  Is this an alternate universe where Wardell Stephen Curry II doesn't exist?
"Just looked at all the 7th overall picks, and these are the players close to or better than Murray for me. Harrison Barnes (close), Stephen Curry, Eric Gordon (had solid years, and won a 6th man of the year), Rip Hamilton, Kevin Johnson, Chris Mullin, Alvin Robertson, Bernard King, and John Havlicek.

I can't think of one from the last 5 years but when the Bucks and Warriors were trading the Bucks had a choice between Stephen Curry or Monta Ellis and they chose Monta because their training staff didn't trust Steph to stay healthy. Which is especially wild when you consider the trade was only 15 games after Steph's season ending ankle injury and in total he had only missed 25 out of 205 games.
"Don't forget Steph got 11 rebounds as well, the smallest guy lead both team in rebounds, Stephen Curry GSW's starting center"
"Infamous Jokic haters, the “media” lol they cover him plenty. He’s just obviously not Lebron James or Stephen Curry."
"No, that specific user is a Stephen curry stan/troll"
It’s hilarious because you’re a Stephen curry dick rider
"Do you realize how many people briefly reach the level steph Wakes up at every day? Damn near every three point specialist will taste it for a brief time. Steph is always like that. So no, this little hot streak Luka has going is just that, a hot streak. It's not worth any media, or even us talking about it cause these things happen all the time and the players can't sustain it. Steph has ""been on a hot streak"" like this for seven  years. So no we won't compare Lukas two months to Stephen curry cause that's ridiculous"

I don't think the Nets have the personnel to effectively wall off Giannis nor do I think that's an effective situation when you have Stephen fucking Curry on your team.
We have this one guy who is good at shooting his name is Stephen Curry. And then this other super tall guy who just turned 20 and is gonna be a beast in a year or 2. But the real star of the show is we have a guy naked Andrew Wiggins who is basically a better KD who can play defense
"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."
"That's fair, but don't compare them to Stephen Curry who's been doing the same his entire career and having 43% career average from 3.   Every time I hear Trae is the next Curry I cringe a bit. Curry has never had a season below 40% 3P excluding last season."
"I see everyone saying he was a superstar. He was a box office star like Stephen A likes to say, like kyrie. Both were never superstars tho. OP’s edit is correct, his duration of regular season stardom or playoff dominance was never long to be considered a superstar like Lebron curry Durant harden cp3 kawhi Westbrook(barely makes the superstar cut). It’s revisionist history if we saying griffin was a superstar."

"Draymond ""Stephen Curry"" Green"
The Golden State Warriors have a 54-113 record without Stephen Curry since 2011-12.   Is that a big enough sample size for you?
"I mean its not the worst take. Most people have kd ranked higher tho. been elite for longer. More accomplishments- and was considered the go to guy when both were together. Its hard for curry to be as good just because of his size. Late playoff games are decided by iso ball. the game slows down plays break down and the only place to create space is the midrange. last 4 championships have been decided by midrange iso players. kawhi kd kd and lbj/davis. its harder to create space when you are small as you cant shoot over players. Also lebron stated that kd was his nemesis. Kerr stated that lbj kd and kawhi were better than curry in those years too. A two way wing is always gonna have more impact than a small pg. here are his words. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr isn't playing favorites, but he also isn't shy about naming the best player on his stacked title squad. Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""

"I know you aren't asking this.    But IMO LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are heavily underpaid.  Their talent draws other players at discounted rates.  They talent draws other players that won't otherwise consider the franchise.  The championships they have won for their franchises has greatly increased the value of those franchises.    In terms of adequately paid that is a very hard thing to factor."

"The only difficulty seems to be the mental fit. In any team KD is basically your best player but can't be your leader. So you got to have a guy as good as him or nearly, AND who can assume the leadership and the locker room balance without making him uncomfortable.  Well... Yes, I kinda described Stephen Curry."

"While I truly think Stephen Curry has a legit case for MVP (I know, I know, the record) if I had a vote I'd vote for Jokic. He's one of my favorite players in the league, he's such a unique big man, and a fun personality as well.   Can't wait for the playoffs, I think we will see some greatness from many players."
Jokic is the better player on the floor than Steph???? Stephen Curry. Dude you’re out of your goddamn mind if you honestly think this.
"i wish i could rewatch the game where stephen curry had 0 points in the first half and 33 in the second half, it was awesome to see the stunned commentators walking back all the trash they talked at halftime"

"I mean I shouldn’t have expected more from nba reddit/twitter but the fans really upset me lol. These players undergo scrutiny from no name fans and media personalities and get criticized (unfairly) by their peers at times and they can’t react? One tweet is enough? Fans blow up and argue about the littlest of things for way less. I don’t understand how fans can be so out of touch. Have some perspective will ya lol. Just bec they’re famous doesn’t mean they have to keep on taking it. I can’t fathom sometimes the level of discipline some of the other players have just to take the high road (Curry and Lebron being the best examples). Westbrook blew up about it a few months ago on Stephen A as well. It’s all normal people, get a grip."

"That’s not what I’m saying though,  Think of John Stockton as Kyle Korver, and think of Magic Johnson as Stephen Curry   Now Kyle Korver is an incredible shooter, you can’t leave him open, he’s consistent and is going to get the job done    Stephen Curry is also efficient but is a better shooter because of his versatility he can knock it down on ball of ball, if you need a shot to go in no matter the circumstances, Stephen Curry is your guy.    John Stockton is the efficient, skilled get the job done guy, like Korver with his shooting   Magic Johnson has the wider range of passing ability wether it be in a system, flashy passes, lobs fast break he’s the guy that is going to be able to make that pass, like Curry with his shooting"
"Times have changed this sub is for worshiping the Knicks, Nuggets, and Stephen curry."
"In my opinion, Steph Curry earned his rings. He was drafted by the Warriors, developed into a superstar and won League MVP in 2015 while leading his team to the NBA Finals. Although the Cavaliers were mostly Lebron and a string of role players, it definitely wasn't Steph's fault. Of course, you always play to win, what else would you rather he had done?. Injuries and asterisks are always part of the game. Now the Warriors acquiring one of the best players in the world also wasn't his fault, a team coming off a championship run is expected to retool and get better. In the subsequent dynastic years, I believe that, while KD was the best player on the team, they would not have enjoyed a similar degree of success without Stephen Curry on the floor.  Kevin Durant, already regarded as one of the greatest scorers in the game and a former MVP, chose to join a team who had beaten him the prior year , coming back from a 3-1 deficit, had already been to the Finals for two straight years, won the NBA Championship in 2015, the best Regular season record in nearly 70 years of NBA History, had the best shooting backcourt in history, a soon-to-be Defensive Player of the Year , and a cast of solid and functional role players like Igoudala and Livingston. He could have gone anywhere he wanted, yet he chose the path of least resistance. It's not that his rings don't count or anything, but in in the historical  context of what it took to get to the title, his rings are greatly diminished in value.  Steph Curry is greatest shooter of all time, one of the greatest and most transcendent offensive weapon ever deployed at the PG position, a 2x League MVP and a 3x NBA Champion. I truly believe that he was the most important piece in the Warriors Dynasty.  Kevin Durant is arguably the greatest scorer in NBA history and a certified superstar. It's just that KD's championships will never receive the appropriate appreciation because of how convenient it was for him as compared to Dirk Nowitzki in 2011 or Hakeem Olajuwon in 1995."
Skill boost Curry would just be Stephen Curry

"&gt;Stephen Curry only ring came in the most injury riddled playoff of All time, beating Lebron and a bunch of scrubs.  You're so full of fucking shit. In 2015 playoffs Steph faced and beat every first team All NBA player, something no one else has ever done. LeBron has never faced a tougher road to the Finals in his career yet you're claiming it's somehow an easy path????"
"I don’t think it’s that crazy actually. Hakeem had a better peak, but short lived. I’d say Bird had a better peak too. MJ as well. Shaq had an insane peak, Magic has an argument. So yeah that is several.  In fact I found this article from 2016 that had Lebron at #5:  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2016/02/08/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest"
"Eh. I’ll explain why I’m going smart. From the various warriors games I’ve watched, Drays playmaking is unquestionably some of, if not the best we’ve seen from a big (besides jokic), however his best playmaking trait is unequivocally his ability penalize teams for over commuting and doubling a teams star. As we’ve seen this year in games where Steph doesn’t play, Dray struggles to get going because the majority of his offense is predicated around exploiting the defense for overreacting to various action initiated by Steph, whether Steph is on or off ball (ex: warriors run their inverted floppy action where Steph sets a back screen for a player, defense overreacts and both jump to Steph so Dray hits a now open Wiggins or whoever Steph screens for). In the halfcourt with no star, drays playmaking is a bit more comparable to like prime Blake griffin, which is still good and far above league average for the position, but it isn’t really worth running the offense through aside from some designed spots here and there.   Smart suffers from the same issue. His playmaking is decent for a guard, but it isn’t anything of note.   Then it goes to shooting where smart is clearly the better asset than Dray currently is. While smart doesn’t shoot a great percentage, he isn’t afraid to take them in the flow of the offense and on occasion will get hot and shoot like 7/10 form deep. This means the defense has to stay honest when defending him whereas they openly disregard Dray (where again, his flaws are hidden a bit by having Stephen Curry to pass to, who can make extraordinarily tough shots).   And then defense. I don’t think this should shock anyone who watches games but Dray just isn’t the defender he once was. He’ll still get a ton of work done on that end because his defensive iq is off the charts, and he can even predict where the ball will end up on a good number of positions, allowing him to pre-rotate and get steals/blocks. Now I think Dray is currently a more valuable defender than smart is, due to his advantage in size and versatility, but atm I don’t see the gap as large enough over smart that it would change the outcome of playoff series from a pure defensive standpoint alone.   So if I have an abstract team, where I have no clue what the roster construction is, I feel like smart is the smarter choice simply because he can provide you with offense whereas Dray is gonna struggle a bit more if he doesn’t have a real star that defenses have to key in on and the gap in their defense currently isn’t large enough to win or lose a playoff series (which is the end goal)."
Yeah because the absence of noted staunch defender Stephen Curry is why Lillard went off. Lol
"&gt; ~~Stephen Curry's~~ Kawhi Leonard's only postseason run of any note/significance is his ~~2015~~ 2019 run, in which the ~~Warriors~~ Raptors won the championship, it was in the most injury riddled ~~playoff~~ finals, his team got pushed to 6 games by ~~Lebron~~ Curry and a bunch of scrubs   Ftfy"
All it takes is Stephen Curry to go ballistic which he absolutely can in 1 or 2 games which is why I don't like the Lakers chances against them in the Play-In tournament
"Curry had ankle issues well into 2011-2012 so he signed a 4/44 contract because he didn't know what would happen with his health. Clearly he left money on the table, but he was averaging like 17ppg over his career when he signed and wasn't considered a max level player at that time. The brilliant minds of [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1391383-stephen-curry-contract-extension-is-risky-business-for-golden-state-warriors) even wrote a piece about how the Warriors maybe overpaid him lol."
"These the weirdos who make post like this to make a good player seem worse  ""Ay who's better Kyle Lowry or Stephen Curry"""
"It's going to come down to the wire to crown the scoring champion this season. Scary how close Beal and Curry are.

lol no it is not fair to assume that Trae Young would be better than stephen fucking curry stop it
Both are top 12 all time. You can't name 12 players better than Stephen Curry.
Jokic is a deserved MVP. At the same time four of the top5 on this list have IMO been better players this season when healthy. Harden too. Nobody played better basketball than the beard. Maybe Stephen Curry since his return from his bruised tailbone comes close.

"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."

"Nah, klay got 14... In three quarters LOL Steph is tied with Zach lavine for second most 3s at 13.  Hes also tied with Kobe and someone else I don't remember at 3rd with 12 threes, and then has tied with himself like a bajillion times at 4th place with 11 threes cuz he's Stephen fucking curry."
Stephen Curry
Just tell them it’s Curry vs. LeBron. Even then they might not know what the heck a play in is but there’s a good chance they’ll check out a game with LeBron James and Stephen Curry facing off.
"It would only ever work in the playoffs when the refs turn a blind eye to fouling people off the ball.   [The Cavs strategy for stopping Curry for years was hacking him off the ball and hand checking him whenever he did have the ball, all of which probably would have been called fouls in the regular season.](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/16/14229548/stephen-curry-stats-cavaliers-defense-analysis)"
I would be scared to play any series Stephen Curry is in.
WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY
"why doesn’t Stephen curry have a legit title? 1988-2009: too scared to play in the NBA  2010-2014: couldn’t make the finals  2015: beat an injured cavs team doesn’t count  2016: 3-1  2017-2018: Superteam, doesn’t count  2019: couldn’t beat a literal robot and some mf named Fred  2020: worst team in the league"
"Stephen Curry  and then Morey-D'Antoni-Harden changed the NBA, that is a fact."
"If it was that easy who does Wade clearly push out of this top 20 list I hastily assembled in two minutes?Nash, Chris Paul, Harden, Barkley, Robinson and others didn't even make the cut...   * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaq * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Kawhi Leonard * Karl Malone"
"&gt;you just look at their accolades?  LeBron, four MVPs, four rings, finals mvp all four times, I think about five or six all-defensive teams, all the all-nba teams and All Star appearances  &gt;you just look at their stats?  Probably James Harden, when you take his time over the past five or six years I'd say he's been the best regular-season player overall during that stretch  &gt;you just look at how they play on the court?  Either Kevin Durant or Steph Curry , Kevin Durand because it's just so effortless , he's 7 ft tall with a 7-6 wingspan and all that other stuff Stephen A Smith says, nobody can block his shot and sometimes when you're just not paying attention the motherfuker got you 33 points on 12 shots or some crazy efficiency like that, Steph Curry because of the distance and how effortless he makes that look, the handle, the arrogance in which he plays with and I can't think of another guard his size that's had to be guarded the way he has"

"First of all, guys like Joakim Noah should not be making first team over Stephen Curry"
1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Kevin Durant  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Joel Embiid  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard  this is the objective list. you cannot disagree with me
"Stephen A is dumb for that comment. Wiggins is averaging 18-19ppg on efficient field shooting with above average defense. Yeah he didn’t really develop on the twolves but he looks great this year. He is a just a touch under all-star and ppl acting like he sucks.   This is also why I don’t listen to all the bs saying Curry is alone. In addition to all of the young talent, they have Curry, Draymond, and Wiggins. Wiggins is averaging 18-19ppg and Draymond is the defensive anchor of the team averaging 9assists per game and is 3rd in the league in steals"
Stephen Curry is the MVP.
"you right. following tweet from Marc Stein  &gt;The same thing applies to statistics: Play-in games will NOT, for example, impact the Stephen Curry vs. Bradley Beal scoring race because they are considered a separate entity ... they are not regular-season games and not playoff games.  [Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1390713902623645698)"
" Nikola Jokic is #1 in VoRP with 8.0, the 2nd place is Stephen Curry with 5.2.  Chris paul is #13 in Value over replacement player with 3.3  The difference between #1 and #2 is as much as #2 and number #30.   Nikola Jokic is #1 in Box +/- , Chris Paul is #16.  Nikola Jokic is #1 in WS/48, Chris Paul is #17  Nikola Jokic is #1 in PER, Chris Paul is #30   There should be no way CP3 gets a vote for MVP over Jokic."

Stephen Curry accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago.
Anthony “Stephen Curry” Edwards
I’m not. You said KD ruined basketball for two seasons. The reason he retuned basketball is because he joined an all time great team Put any superstar on that team and basketball is ruined...   But why was that team an all time great team? Stephen Curry.
It’s a stupid thing that started bc people can’t bear to admit Steph is better. Being more important is being better.    Stephen Curry was and is better than Kevin Durant. You putting a qualifier on it and saying KD is a better player but less important makes no sense. Curry is just simply better
"Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid"
"&gt;And as I told you already, youre taking things too literally.  And as I told you already, you were just flat wrong.  &gt; I was pointing out that all those guys shot the VAST majority of their shots at the rim.   No, they didn't.  Only 1 in 5 O'Neal shots was a dunk, and he dunked just about everything he could.  The percentages for the other two would be much lower.  &gt;Shaq shot from beyond 10 feet at a frequency of 7%. Of those attempts, he made roughly 30% of them.   O'Neal also has a higher FG% from 3 to 10 feet than Stephen Curry does.  I note, by the way, how you completely bailed on defending your claim with respect to McHale and Abdul-Jabbar.  In future, don't talk out of your asshole, and you won't get called on your nonsense."

"coach, Stephen Curry is hogging the ball 😡"
Stephen/curry
"Zeke had two fellow HoFers + All Stars Laimbeer and Aguirre or Dantley. Let's not act like Zeke was running around with Stephen Adams as his second (or third) best player. I mean, Rick Mahorn is was probably pretty similar to the level of Adams, and he was their 7th best player? Maybe 6th? Come on.  Personally, I've got Magic one. Oscar two. Then Curry/CP3/Zeke/Nash/Stockton/Russ all in roughly the same tier. (I think Curry is a step above the rest overall, but it's hard for me to say he's a better PG. If the Warriors had had a PG on their team in 2009 rather than Monta Ellis, Curry may be on the list of best SGs of all time. The same is not true of anyone else on my top PG list.)"
&gt; Who else would even be the number two?  Because Stephen Curry is the best player in the league this year.
Stephen Curry and it's been for the past 5 years
"Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler,  Giannis Antetekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, and Nikola Jokic.  Didn’t overthink it. These are just the 5 most productive players of the season statistically on playoff teams, so this takes out Zion for missing the playoffs, and then Embiid misses out because of the position rules and being ranked behind Jokic."

Did you heard about the guy called Stephen Curry?  I mean you want to erase Jokic for some reason and lets say we agreed about that. But what about Curry?
"""It's time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry"" and all related posts"
Because he had Klay thompson Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant on his team?
"An athletic Draymond Green just not as strong mentally as Draymond Green in the playoffs. Draymond Green was  in perfect situation with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson with their shooting to provide space for Draymond to set screens over and over (at their peak some said moving screens), rebound, pass the ball, and maybe score to yell ""AND 1"". The scoring is provided by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and later Kevin Durant on offense. In playoffs most of teams are good at finding other team weaknesses and exploiting them until the team can make adjustments. Draymond Green isn't a good scorer, and Warriors were able hide that weakness most of the time where it wouldn't be detrimental."
in front of Stephen Curry
"cool tidbit:    Bridges is one of the league’s most versatile defenders, with the physical tools to match up with players at all four perimeter positions. He was the highest vote getter not to make an All-Defensive Team and is the tip of the spear of a top-10 defense. There were no off nights for him this season. [His top five most frequent assignments](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628969/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) were Brandon Ingram, Damian Lillard, Jamal Murray, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry. "
"The only reasonable thing is Harden looked beyond awful and who knows if this will change in game 6 and 7, Jeff Green won't be Stephen curry every game and Durant probably can't go the full game dropping 50 each night. So the Bucks still have a good chance to win despite complete other incompetence"

Depends on the Context.  For mere mortals yes.  For Stephen Curry no.
Stephen Curry is probably better but in the current playoffs Harden might be the best player offensively.
Yes.  Wardell Stephen Curry  Also a Grizzlies fan / Grayson Allen stan
"1. Stephen Curry  That’s the only guy I can confidently rank for me. The other 9 are KD, Harden, Giannis, Jokic, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Embiid, Dame"
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
Imagine Stephen Curry averaging 60 ppg because he just chucking the ball up to that top hoop. Bet he still shoots 40% from three too.
"&gt; I'm a pseudo-Sixer fan now,” Stephen said, predicting a Philadelphia-Utah Finals, with Philadelphia winning and Seth Curry named Finals MVP.  I too predict Utah to make the Finals."
"In no particular order over Malone I at least have: Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kareem, Tim Duncan, Shaq, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlain, Stephen Curry, Hakeem, Kobe, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robinson, David Robinson and Jerry West. So I don't feel he is a lock for top 15."
"&gt;And he may have been a net negative on a non contending team that is asking him to be their primary play maker.  Toronto was a contending team for several of those seasons.  And why do you want a player who was a negative on a bad team?  &gt; would be a 2x better fit that Schroder, who can’t shoot or pass.  Schroder was 23rd in the league in assists, and averaged more per-game than any secondary ballhandlers except: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and 2 of \[ Sabonis, Brogdon, and McConnell \].  So, no.  Furthermore, Lowry cannot hound quick opponents like Schroder did, which was essential to the Lakers' defense -- which was the only reason they even made the playoffs."
Based Stephen Curry would never
"You'd think Curry, Klay, and Draymond are scrubs the way some ""experts"" talk about Durant. Stephen A. Smith in particular should know better."
KD playing this shit just goes to show how great Stephen Curry really is.
"&gt;They traded for him because the Laker really needed a secondary playmaker when Bron was on the bench and he was coming off as a top 6moy candidate.  Which is precisely what Schroder gave them.  The only secondary ballhandlers who averaged more than his 5.8 assists per game: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Sabonis, McConnell, Brogdon \].  Schroder was also 23rd in the league in assists.  &gt;so yeah starting caruso  Did you see what happened when Caruso did start?  It was brutal.  Caruso was -7.2/100 as a starter, and +6.6/100 as a reserve.  I like Caruso a ton, but he is not, and probably never will be, a starter-caliber NBA point guard.  &gt;but demanding a starting role isn't the best thing for team chemistry.  Neither is refusing to play center.  At least in Schroder's case his demand was clearly the best option for the team -- and really not in any sort of doubt, anyway.  There was practically no other option but to start to Schroder.  His demand was about as meaningful as if Davis had demanded to start.  That said, ""demand"" is strong for his [actual quotes on the matter.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)"
"Just going to throw out this datapoint.  Secondary ball-handlers in the NBA who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists per game this season: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Domantas Sabonis, TJ McConnell, Malcolm Brogdon \].  That's it.  He was also 23rd in assists, in the entire league.  And he did that playing for a coach with basically no offensive ideas beyond ""Give James the ball and watch"", ""Give Davis the ball and watch"", and ""Give Schroder the ball and watch"".  Actually, a few other stats, while I'm here.  Schroder led the Lakers in assist/turnover ratio.  He also had the 3rd-highest offensive rating, behind only James and Davis.  Sure, it'd be nice if he could shoot better, but the skills he has are not cheaply-obtained in the NBA.  &gt;I think Schroder could end up getting a 4 year, 65 million dollar contract  I will be shocked if he signs for less than $20M/year.  &gt;Do you think he will re-sign with the Lakers, or join some other team and take on a bigger role?  The Lakers cannot replace him, so it makes no sense for them not to match any offer."
Can the mods flair me? \[GSW\] Stephen Curry    flair please!!
"KD and Stephen Curry.  When Kerr blessed it, it was unstoppable."
stephen curry has rotted the brains of this new gen ngl
"Reggie has become Stephen Curry. He’s been shooting over 40% from deep all regular season, last playoffs, and this playoffs.  Idk when he suddenly became a sniper but this is no fluke"
You wanna know why nobody trades their Young potential superstars? Because of what happens when they turn out like Stephen Curry and they win your franchise 2 to 3 rings?   Ring chasing superstars are worth nothing compared to someone like luka. This isn’t 2k
“Curry didn’t recruit Durant”  The way people lie for Stephen Curry is ridiculous

"Bro Steph Curry hard as fuck. He literally killed my child in cold blood in the summer of 2015 and dared me to report it to the police.   I was staying at a nice beachside resort in Oakland, CA with my beautiful wife (F 24) and my immaculate daughter (F 73 months). We had been spending the days lounging on pool chairs and drinking bottomless mimosas. The television above the bar had been playing highlights of the local Warriors team (I'm not sure if you've heard of them but every TV in Oakland is actually required by law to play highlights at all times. Kinda crazy for such a small team). I've never been a big fan of the Warriors, and remarked so to my wife in passing. Little did I know that would be the moment my life changed forever.   The man behind the bar laughed at me after this comment and smirked to himself. ""The warriors are actually pretty good,"" he said, ""the kind of team that would never need super stars to join.""  I told him this was an outrageous claim and that their best player, Andre Iguodala, would never be enough to carry the team, especially with the worse of the Curry Brothers riding his coattails. My wife agreed and said that even our 73 month old daughter could see that.  The man laughed again and stepped out from behind the bar, drawing a gun. Point blank he shot three times into my darling daughter. I couldn't hear anything over my wife's screams. My blood was rushing in my ears and I felt like the world had fallen apart. The man stood over us and pushed back his hat to reveal that he was actually Stephen Curry (M 27) himself!   ""Listen chump, I'm gonna have to disagree with that assessment,"" he sneered, ""I'm definitely better than my brother Seth. And to prove that, I'm gonna go on to win 73 games this season in honor of your dumb daughter. And just when you think that nobody can stop me, I'm going to throw the finals to let you know that you lost the light of your life to a coattail riding loser. And one day, I'll come back for your wife's feet...""  Ever since that day, I've lived in constant fear of Steph Curry. I've moved out of California to Cleveland, but Lebron's move to LA, I'm not sure where I'm safe anymore and I don't know where to go. I fear for the day that Steph follows through on his promise to steal my wife's feet from under my nose.  So for those that think Steph Curry is soft or a loser, let this be a warning."

" Ben not taking jumpshots is an issue of its own, it shows he lacks confidence in his ability to make shots. It's not a huge problem or anything, but it does worry me a little bit.   Meanwhile, Giannis is shooting 3s like he's Stephen fucking Curry. He's a terrible perimeter shooter and it's astounding that Bud gives that dude the green light lol.   But I'm a little worried about Ben, I figured he would be taking more jumpshots by now, but he's actually taking less. He's still a very valuable player because of his defense and playmaking abilities, the team is better when he's on the floor.   Btw, the sixers have been my 2nd team since the Iverson days so I'm not just an outsider who doesn't know what's going on. I watch every sixers and Hawks game."

"&gt;	i mean, the timberwolves could probably screw that up, but imagine.  I mean, they literally did screw it up. They chose Johnny Flynn over Stephen Curry even though Steph was consensus ranked ahead of him at the time. There’s a Bill Simmons draft diary from that year where he’s going ballistic when they do it, it’s  actually a fun read"
"That’s it. KD is challenging ChapoDestroyer to bad mouth Stephen Curry on social media. If you see people giving Kyrie or Harden too much credit for the Nets’ success, bad mouth them too."
Its not what he said its what he did.  Like a few months ago the dude decided to like a post that said curry was trash.  Which was odd cuz the their was no way it was a PR move or just him randoming liking it as the tweet was fairly well hidden in twitter.  He had to actively look for that tweet and manually like it.  Which is just soooooo petty.    https://www.sportscasting.com/kevin-durant-got-caught-destroying-stephen-curry-liking-tweet-dissed/.
"https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/stephen-curry-offered-to-take-less-than-max/385629  Stephen Curry, who recently signed a record five-year, $201 million deal, told Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic that he informed Warriors general manager Bob Meyers he would have taken less to help the team.  “I actually asked Bob, if I were to take a discount — at any number, I don’t know what it would be — how much of a difference would that make for us to be able to sign other guys,” Curry said. “It wasn’t like (Durant’s) situation. His had a direct impact on us being able to sign Andre (Iguodala) and Shaun (Livingston). And it was just an unbelievable sacrifice by KD. But mine didn’t matter.”"
"People who didn't live through that era will look at his low PPG, zero Finals appearances, and poor defense and call him overrated or a flash in the pan or something.  Dude was one of the most intense, badass competitors of all-time, one of the greatest teammates, and is a forefather of the modern NBA guard. Pistol Pete, Mark Price, Steve Nash, Stephen Curry."
Is it normal for him to tell steph he’s great and secretly be a bit jealous of steph? Yes. Is it human to express that jealousy in confidence to people you know? Yes. Is it acceptable or normal to make fake Twitter accounts to shit on Stephen curry? No
Stephen Curry didn’t make the playoffs***
&gt;Stephen Curry   Ha! Good joke.
"&gt;KD never disrespectful of other baller.  When asked to list the top 5 players he's ever played with he picked Serge Ibaka over Russell Westbrook.  Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Serge Ibaka  Serge was on the team when he roasted it with the burner account saying him and Russ were the only good players and ""he couldn't win with those cats.""   KD has absolutely disrespected other ballers."
"Yeah I guess you have a point actually. 55/40/90 is a lot more exclusive than I would have thought. Literally the only members of that club is Kyrie Irving x1 and Stephen Curry x3.  On the flip side, setting it to just 50/40/90, but instead using 2P%, gives us the following:  Larry Bird x2  Mark Price x2  Reggie Miller x1  Chris Mullin x1  Peja Stojakovic x1  Steve Nash x4  Jose Calderon x1  Ray Allen x1 (I forgot to check minimums before saying he'd get like 4, my bad)  Kevin Durant x1  J.J. Redick x1  Stephen Curry x4  CJ McCollum x1  Kyrie Irving x2  Malcolm Brogdon x1  Khris Middleton x1  In retrospect and after remembering what the minimum makes are, I actually agree with you. I think this list covers it pretty well, with it being largely the same except for a couple newcomers, as well as Steph, Price, and Kyrie getting more of these seasons."

In Jackson's case, it's more of a coincidence, he got his trade request fulfilled and left 9 games into Curry's rookie season.

Especially since it sounds like he liked playing with Curry and the Warriors, his concerns are more about money and a starting spot."

"Quick rundown of every team in the league:  Boston Celtics: a corp of young players, exciting to watch, however aren’t quite good enough to make noise in the playoffs yet. In the past they have been one of the most dominant teams in sports history winning 17 titles, tied with the Lakers for first. Very storied franchise with a passionate fanbase.  New York Knicks: one of the wealthiest franchises but are a joke as they tend to have a history of disappointment and missing out on big free agent signings. They make it into the playoffs every 5-10 years and are always fun to watch when they’re good. Large and passionate fanbase.  Brooklyn Nets: went from being a joke and a backwater in New Jersey to being one of the wealthiest and most renowned franchises in a matter of a decade. They have a super team built around three all stars and are heavy favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference and possibly win the title. Tends to have a lot of fair weather fans.  Philadelphia 76ers: another storied franchise with some of the NBA’s greatest players ever. After a fairly successful rebuild they are a playoff staple and are currently the highest seeded team in the Eastern Conference.  Washington Wizards: a fairly mediocre team that’s pretty fun to watch. They are going to have to start rebuilding soon I’d say.  Charlotte Hornets: an up and coming team that had previously been an absolute dumpster fire of a franchise. They have young talent galore and are on pace to becoming the NBA’s next big thing.  Atlanta Hawks: formerly a fairly mediocre team that made the playoffs but never actually did much. The Hawks get better every year and are in a position to make a deep playoff push and maybe even contend with the other big East teams.  Orlando Magic: a franchise tht always lands good players in the draft, but always loses them to bigger markets. Entering a total rebuild at the moment.  Miami Heat: a solid franchise that was infamous for its super team in the early 2010s. They made a surprise run to the finals last year but this is mostly due to the conditions of that season. Young and old talent alike and a decently fun team to watch.   Cleveland Cavaliers: a miserable franchise that has only ever been relevant because of LeBron James. Right now they are amongst the worst teams in the league as per usual.   Detroit Pistons: feared in the late ‘80s for their physical play and again in the early 2000s for their finals run, the Pistons, just like Detroit, are a far cry from their glory days. In the middle of a big rebuild.  Indiana Pacers: best summary of this franchise, bad luck. The pacers always put up decent teams for the most part and have a solid history but always are good in a time where the Eastern Conference is fierce with competition.  Chicago Bulls: internationally one of the NBA’s most famous teams. Michael Jordan, the best player of all time played here. Watching the last dance must have given you a decent amount of information about the Bulls. Since that 1997-98 season however, the Bulls have never even touched any semblance of their former glory (except maybe with Derrick Rose in the early 2010s, which was a basketball tragedy). A decent roster that just doesn’t perform how they should on paper.  Milwaukee Bucks: overall a fairly good franchise and in the modern day one of the East’s top teams. They are a favorite to take the Eastern Conference, I highly recommend keeping up with their series versus the Nets it’s shaping up to be a good one.  Toronto Raptors: The only NBA team not located in the U.S. A fairly new but good franchise that recently just won its first title. They are at a crossroads and are most likely looking to rebuild.  Memphis Grizzlies: have always been kind of irrelevant, but have put together solid teams. They have a young corp of players that can be built upon. They may be a Western Conference playoffs staple in the near future.  New Orleans Pelicans: similar to the Grizzlies and Hornets, with the exception of an arguably even better roster than either of those teams, but with less postseason success. They’re still trying to find their rhythm but it is quite possible that they could be contending for a title in the future.  Minnesota Timberwolves: the t-wolves in my opinion might be the most frustratingly disappointing franchise in North American sports. High draft picks seemingly all the time, but are just terrible year in and year out. They’ve had like five rebuilds in the last decade. Wasting premium talent is Minnesota’s specialty. However they might change this narrative soon, maybe.  Houston Rockets: formerly (as in literally two years ago) were a formidable team and the second best in the Western Conference (after my team, the hated Warriors). They had a solid run that was exciting to watch. It all came crashing down at the beginning of this season when their superstar James Harden demanded a trade. Houston is one of the better franchises in the NBA but they are about to enter a dark age.  Oklahoma City Thunder: the Thunder for the past decade have been a playoff staple and filled with young talent. This reputation is looking to continue. They’ve hit a rough patch but they own the most draft picks in the next 5 years than any team in the league. This team is very soon going to be overflowing with the nation’s top young talent.  Dallas Mavericks: a well-operated and storied franchise with a young superstar in Slovenia’s Luka Doncic, who may be a future MVP. With some small improvements to the roster or the addition of a second option, I could see this team making a finals run very soon.  San Antonio Spurs: a great franchise that built a 20 year long dynasty. Very well-liked by most other fanbases in the league. Currently in a rebuild right now but it may not be that far away until they see the playoffs again.  Denver Nuggets: one of the Western Conference’s top teams. They are consistent and have been a solid team for the past 5ish years. They are a dark horse finals candidate this year.  Utah Jazz: The top seeded team in the Western Conference and owners of the NBA’s best record this season. They have a solid franchise and a loyal fanbase for such a small market team. Talked about a lot in the Last Dance as they were the team the Bulls beat in their championship.   Phoenix Suns: Another one of the NBA’s top seeded teams. For a long time the Suns were a backwater in the NBA that rarely made the playoffs. Many of the NBA’s best players have spent time in Phoenix. Have a legitimate chance for the first time since the 90s to make the finals and win.   Portland Trail Blazers: a small market team with a die hard fanbase and solid history. A playoff competitor for most of the decade. Kind of hard to hate this team. However they’re just never good enough to seriously contend for a title.  Sacramento Kings: a small market team that has been the definition of pain and suffering for the past 15 years. Haven’t built a good team since the mid-2000s. Always have to compete for attention in a crowded California market but despite all this have a good fanbase.  Los Angeles Clippers: the second rate Los Angeles team that everyone likes to make fun of. They’ve had some good teams recently but they never get it done in the playoffs and always lose to a team they should’ve beat. History is looking to repeat itself this season.  Los Angeles Lakers: perhaps the NBA’s most storied and well known franchise. The largest fanbase of any basketball team in the world. Their also extremely shallow, arguably one of the worst fanbases in the league out of California. They most recently won the finals but their on thin ice and probably won’t repeat. Tied with the Celtics for most championships with 17, however I would argue the Lakers have a better overall history. I will not apologize to Boston fans for that.  Golden State Warriors: my favorite team and one of the more hated teams in the league. A great history with some of the NBA’s top players. A large fanbase in Northern California and plenty of bandwagons outside of that area. Stephen Curry, basketball’s greatest shooter is the focal point of the team. Injuries have hampered this team recently as the dynasty begins to dismantle after a 5 year era of unrivaled  dominance.  That’s basically a small rundown of every team in the league that will undoubtedly piss everyone  off."
Minuscule?? You have prime Stephen Curry.
"Of course when people say 'bad' they're speaking in relative terms: when people say stephen curry isn't athletic or jimmy butler can't shoot no one is comparing them to average non-athletes, they're comparing them to average nba players. As a master's student, I'm better than almost everyone in the world at biochemistry -that doesn't make me a good scientist. The question I'm asking is what does he do well on offense at an NBA LEVEL, not at a highschool level or compared to the average American. I don't watch Gobert enough to say definitively, but it seems like there isnt anything. This is part of why people don't like him. Also its objectively waaaay easier to get into the nba at 7ft + compared to 6'5ft. There is a lot less competition and many of the things you need to do to have some value at that height are just based on pphysical attributes i.e being able to grab rebounds and contest shots."

"They're solidly behind (with regards to the All-Star game, voted on by fans and then coaches) Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard.

"Stephen Curry was a #7 pick. Bam Adebayo was a #14 pick. The draft is a crapshoot, and with a bit of luck you can get a marquee, franchise-changing player. What's far more certain is that Siakam will not be a core part of anymore Raptors championships."

"Isn’t a super team 3+ star players? Like the Nets, or when KD was on the Warriors.  Kevin Durant + Kyrie Irving + James Harden  Stephen Curry + Klay Thompson + Kevin Durant.  I’m not referring to the Clippers here, but some 2 star player teams do give the definition a run for its money though."

"Kobe was one of the most clutch players of all time!  Kobe, on the otherhand, was a player who showed up really well with these playoff clutch numbers. His +141 plus/minus in 366 minutes ranks as the 2nd best career playoff mark since '97 (LeBron is #1 at +181 over 452 minutes).

"He definitely has a thing for KG and Bird if you're wondering old player biases. Currently, he has 3 players he absolutely ADORES: Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and Nikola Jokic."
No tons of other players get doubled teamed basically every star in the league but while KD was on the warriors Stephen Curry was the only one that really got doubled on that team.   The amount of defensive attention KD got on that team is an absolute joke. Put any all nba guard or wing from the last 30 years on those teams instead of Durant and they still go back to back

"\&gt;He broke Kyrie's Cavs records for most 3pters made by a rookie.   \&gt;He broke LeBron's Cavs record of most 20 + point games as a rookie, and most consecutive 20 + point games to open a season this year.   \&gt;This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others).  \&gt;Are those all tradeable mediocre players too?  &amp;#x200B;  This isn't ""statistical refutation"" as much as it's post-editing in data-picked factoids that I don't give a fuck about. You still completely refuse to cope with the reasoning as to why the franchises that owned the 22 year old versions of those players wouldn't have dreamed on not extending them, which is so much more telling about what you deep-down know to be true about Sexton's value as a player.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;It's almost as if they need additional pieces to help flesh out their scoring, and like they need a tandem of JAllen, Okoro, and Mobley to provide a solid defensive wall to back up their height disadvantage (and provide some great pick n roll targets).  &amp;#x200B;  If Mobley falls to them, there's probably a slight chance they extend Sexton. I still think they'd much rather re-sign Allen who can fit next to Mobley, and keep that cap space free while rolling with a Garland-Mobley facilitated offense.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;And you're right when have members of the sports media ever been wrong ! /  &amp;#x200B;  What does this even mean? In instances where there is this much consensus smoke, they are right very often.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;Cavs aint the ones trying to shoot loads of cum to hype Sexton for a trade. We just recognize what we have and can provide the stats to prove it. Which is what Ive done consistently and only gotten random opinions in response where no one has yet to explain how we replace our #1 scorer and the 25 ppg and spacing, and gritty infectious attitude, he brings w mid-level draft picks and Obi. No one.  &amp;#x200B;  You can only provide the same singular stat, PPG, and his eFG% and TS% which at least have trended towards league average for a SG that only averages about 4 3PAs a game. You ignore his tendency to ball-stop and really bad defensive fit which help contribute to a bad Net Rating and awful team relative on/off numbers. You also ignore a bad Ast/TO ratio and mediocre Ast% which is discouraging for someone who can reliably break down the defense as much as he can.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;But please give me more opinions I can refute with stats.  You've refuted literally none of my opinions with stats, because my collective feelings towards Sexton already acknowledge that he is developing into a nice three-level scorer capable of being a sole offensive option on a really bad team. It is his holistic package as a player that I am not very interested in.  \&gt;I got karma to burn so prove me wrong w stats or gtfo  &amp;#x200B;  ""muh downarrows"" is cringe enough without ignoring the fact that I'm the one displaying unpopular dislike for a young player that I think has been erroneously labeled as someone that meaningfully moves a team towards championship contention.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't even know why you're taking such offense to this. I'm trying to argue that your team is smart for, rumors have it, choosing not to extend Donovan Mitchell money to a potentially worse version of Donovan Mitchell and for seeing the limited value in that type of player."

"All of those stats / accolades are pretty cherrypicked and none of them contradict the comment above you since they're all related to scoring. Maybe you should've looked for something that suggests he's not a terrible defender/passer  &gt; This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played.

"Warriors always ranked high in attendance and tv ratings out of the Bay Area, and that’s regardless of the roster they put out on the floor.  So they should take a chance if given an opportunity to.  Maximize Stephen Curry cause that’s who everyone wants to see succeed right now"
"...I think you're asking us to compare Seth Curry to Wardell Stephen ""Dell"" Curry Sr? Because I think the answer is Dell, but Seth's been building himself an argument the last few seasons."

"lol 3 months?! he missed 41 days my friend with an injury that takes well over that for it to heal properly. He also reaggravated it right before the playoffs. He also only played like 2 games before the playoffs as well. Point is, he wasn’t anywhere near 100% which is why he played poorly.   ‘slacking on D’  lol bro the lakers were the 1st in defensive rating before lebron went down, this was also without AD. Lebron’s advanced numbers on the defensive end also showed how valuable he was to their defense. At the point where 24-6, Lebron had a defensive rating of 101.7 and offensive rating of 114.5, the biggest net rating in the league. Lebron was an elite defender before injury. Even the on/off numbers support that conclusion considering that the lakers were significantly worse in defensive rating (4.4) when lebron was off the court.   ‘best 2nd option ever’  KD and stephen curry played on the same team  i’m using stats my guy. when healthy and in playoff mode NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A YEAR AGO lebron put up 28/11/9 on 65% TS with great on/off stats. Then he came in and coasted the lakers to a great record before getting injured. It’s pretty easy to conclude that lebron could still be the the same player that he was not even a year ago. Why is that so hard for you to understand? He was the best player in the league not even a year ago (28/11/9 65% TS). Why is it unreasonable to assume that he could once again play at that level?   It’s funny because i’m not even saying he is or isn’t the best player. I’m only saying that it’s possible that he comes back as the best. You’re arguing that it’s not possible, which is ridiculous considering what lebron has done in recent time. It’s even more ridiculous because it’s obvious you don’t watch Lebron play much if you think he had “3 FULL months” of recovery and that he was slacking on defense. Despite being injured and out of shape, he had a net on off of 38 over 6 games in the playoffs. AD had a net rating of about 2 and the lakers defensive rating was actually better with him off the court. Literally just watch the games or pay attention before talking on the subject."

I mean if I showed you a source that says Stephen Curry isn’t 100 percent locked to HoF would that make you think Curry is not a lock?
"It’s not even just that.  Our stars played like Kentucky Fried Ass.    Kevin Durant, who is hailed as the most unstoppable scorer on the planet, shot 30% from the field against guys who wouldn’t be dominant in the NCAA.  Bradley Beal, the man who until the last game of the season was giving Stephen Curry a run for his money for the scoring title, shot **14%** from the field.   I didn’t even know that was possible.  I assumed that if you shot that bad they just stopped counting like Warriors fans do with Draymond, who incidentally was one of the only players who didn’t play like they wanna be waived next season.    Jerami Grant, 6 points on 6 shots, but I don’t count him because who the fuck even is this guy and why did he play the same amount of minutes as Bam Adebayo?  If they don’t put on some Dream Team level shit in the olympics, they along with Popovich should be walking home.  From Tokyo.  Through the ocean."
Made for Fit and in the Modern NBA? I'm assuming everyone is Healthy and In their Primes.  PG: Stephen Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Kevin Durant C: Tim Duncan  Coach By Pop.  If the Opposition goes big to body them up they run their shooters off screens and play the pick and roll with Steph and Timmy (who's a fantastic passer off the short roll as well); If they try to go small to keep up Tim gets fed in the post all game surrounded by shooters he'll makes the right play out of doubles and then they can swing like the Spurs from 2014. Everybody's Clutch and they can all shoot and score from all 3 levels (4/5 can post up too on mismatches).  Defensively they'd be great with two elite wings on ball and Tim Duncan giving orders from the backline. There isn't anyone they opponents could pick on except maybe Steph but then they'd have to hit a tough shot over Duncan or KD or pass out with Klay and Kawhi ball hawking.  These are all guys who are proven to like each other and play well together we've seen it work already for 8 Chips in this century. Pop can manage egos and The Big Fundamental will lead them on court.

"Thank god America isn't Philly or Denver. The ratings still point to Stephen Curry being the biggest draw in the NBA, regardless of what local fans think of their local sports team lol. Why are you so mad about that? People want to tune in to the best player in the nba night in night out because it's straight entertainment. He even won an espy for it. Again, the numbers prove it, even though i know this sub hates to use proof.   Curry was defended the hardest and put up the best numbers on the highest efficiency on the hardest shots. that's literally the best basketball player.  on the worst team in the league from the previous season, he averaged a league high ppg on league high efficiency against the hardest defensive attention across the league without debate and the data shows he took the hardest shots. What other criteria does the man need to hit to be the best. The numbers are there. the eye test was there."

"Sage of 6 Shots, Stephen Curry"
Stephen Curry  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Shaquille O'Neal
"Agreed, I also think when Steph was a teenager Dell made him change the mechanics of [his shot during a summer](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/04/02/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-three-point-shooting)- I guess another trainer could have taught him that but having that expertise under your own roof must help lol"
"Actually other sports have done it.  But this guy explains why Lebron deserved the Finals MVP way better than I could:  *LeBron James is fighting an army by himself. He's probably going to lose, but he's not dying easily.*  James' average line in these NBA Finals is 36.6 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game.  **Only Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and James Worthy** have managed to do that **in a single NBA Finals game** since 1986. **James is doing it every game.** *James is the only person to have 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in that time frame ... and he's done it three times in this series.*  *His 40-point triple-double in Game 5 was the first in decades. James had 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists by halftime, something nobody has done in any game -- finals, postseason or regular season -- since James entered the league.*  James is the Cavaliers' offense. He scored or assisted 16 of their 17 first half baskets, including every one in the second quarter. He ended up scoring or assisting 26 of their 32 field goals.  **He's doing this out of necessity. When James is on the court, the Cavaliers score 97.2 points per 100 possessions. When he is off the court, they score 54.6 points per 100 possessions. THAT IS VERY BAD.**  With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, the Cavs are down their second- and third-best players. None of LeBron's remaining teammates can create his own shots.  J.R. Smith loves trying, but he is woefully inefficient in doing so. Tristan Thompson can score on offensive rebounds, but isn't a great post-up player. Timofey Mozgov works best in the pick-and-roll, which needs James to act as ball-handler. There was one possession in Game 5 where Matthew Dellavedova tried going one-on-one with his defender. It looked like an escaped zoo animal trying to break out of a lasso after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.  There is no course of action for the Cavaliers besides just giving the ball to LeBron over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Against the NBA's best defense, this should end disastrously. But it hasn't been a complete disaster. It's been kind of close.  The Warriors are winning because they're a great team with several great players. Sometimes Stephen Curry is great! Sometimes Klay Thompson is great! Sometimes Andre Iguodala is great! Everybody's great! The Cavaliers have won two games and made two others close solely because LeBron James is playing like a demigod.   By the literal definition of the term, James has been the most valuable player in the NBA Finals.  But if the Cavaliers lose, don't bet on James receiving the award that goes to the most valuable player.  Once upon a time, it was reasonably common for players who put up astounding performances for losing teams to receive championship event MVP trophies, but sometime in the past 40 years or so, that trend fell out of style.  In the NBA, a losing player has only received the MVP once, when Jerry West won the award in 1969, the very first year an award was given. His was as preposterous as LeBron's. He averaged 38 points per game in a seven-game defeat to the Celtics and had a 42-point triple-double in Game 7, the only triple-double with a higher point total in finals history than James' Game 5.  The MLB and NFL have also given out MVP's to losing players just once, and both were a long time ago. The only losing World Series MVP was Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson in 1960. If that series were played now, the trophy would almost certainly go to Bill Mazeroski, who hit a walkoff home run in Game 7. The only losing Super Bowl MVP was Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley way back in Super Bowl V, in 1971.  Hockey players who lose the Stanley Cup are still kind of in the running for the Conn Smythe Trophy, but that's a bit more understandable because it's meant to reward the player with the best overall postseason performance, not merely the best performance in the decisive series. It's been given to losing players five times, with four being goaltenders. But this too is becoming increasingly rare. After two defeated players received the trophy in the first four years it was awarded, only one has gotten it in the past 25 years: Jean-Sebastian Giguere in 2003.  Whether the move away from rewarding losing players is a conscious effort on the part of leagues, a change in the voting procedures or thought processes for participating media or merely a coincidence is unclear. But it is clear that nobody is particularly interested in making an incredibly awkward moment happen.  Picture the scenario of the Warriors winning and James winning the MVP. The confetti-covered Warriors are celebrating their team's first championship in 40 years. It's the photo opportunity of a lifetime, a moment Warriors fans will cherish for decades to come.  And now Adam Silver has to speak into a microphone and tell everybody that none of them was good enough to win MVP. They have to stand aside as somebody goes searching for LeBron. Is he in the locker room? Does he come out, despite being devastated by defeat, to receive the trophy on stage? Does somebody go quietly bring it to him backstage? Does he even want the dang thing? Everybody involved hates it. The LeBron-hating contingent would go apoplectic, convinced once and for all that people will go to great lengths to praise James in spite of his consistent failures.  For these reasons, James will almost certainly need to will the Cavaliers to a win in Game 7 in order to be the NBA Finals MVP. If he doesn't, somebody on the Warriors -- probably Curry, perhaps Iguodala or somebody else depending on what happens in the future -- will get the award.  But let's not forget what James is doing against incredible odds.*"
Here’s the thing about being on a team with Stephen Curry. If you knock down the open threes you are gifted from his gravity in the finals you are immediately hoisted to the front runner for finals MVP.  See Andre Iguodala in 2015. And Draymond in 2016 if they had won that series.    Yet somehow no one ever mentions that their man is literally guarding Stephen Curry and there is not a defender within 10 feet of them as they shoot open threes.
ITT: People being tricked by Wiggins having the most efficient year of his career playing next to Stephen Wardell Curry and now claiming him and Siakam are now pretty close in value. Wiggins is has been a very bad scorer with zero playmaking for 4.5 years when put into a primary ball handling roll.   If Toronto trades for him there is no Steph Curry to take all the attention away so guess which version of Wiggins we get?  Wiseman had one of the worst rookie seasons statistically in years and the injury he’s currently recovering from prevents him from making any real skill development this off season. So who ever trades for him is getting the same guy just coming off an injury so he might actually look worse.   People are overrating the fuck out of this package. Davion Mitchell and what Kispert at 14? That plus those two other guys isn’t worth any all nba players in their prime. At least not if I was the GM of the other team. You’re literally just hoping and praying Wiseman doesn’t turn out to be a bust because the chance of pick 7 being an allstar is like 5% and like almost no chance for pick 14 and lol at hoping Wiggins will be the saviour of your team
Wardell Stephen Curry to the Warriors?

"Stop this, i said that as someone who has been said dame was the second coming of kobe since his second year in the league. Dame is my favorite player, but there are levels to this and it’s alright that there’s a much better shooter and ballhandler in stephen curry than dame. I aint insecure about that. You just gotta stop being a hater"
The only generational talent in the last 10+ years I can think of and that’s still in the league is Lebron James  Would Stephen Curry be considered generational talent?
If your point is that Stephen Curry would somehow scare the 95-96 Bulls.......LMAOOOOOOOOOO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So what you're saying is that Stephen Curry can't create his own shots?
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
This is why NBA needs to remove the salary cap for the Warriors just for them to pay Stephen Curry more. His $54m per year super max extension he’s going to get is still underpaid
"Stephen curry is the modern day goat. He literally is the only player in history that's gets triple teamed every time he touches the ball. People say dame is more clutch, although true is because they always let him play 1 on 1. curry ALWAYS gets at least DOUBLED in the clutch. true goat right there."
Stephen Curry might regress to Steven British food
Celtics never had a Stephen Curry
I did rebut it. You can't just say someone with a similar style but absurdly better the same and think you've got a real argument.   Saying Ben Simmons and Giannid are the same is damn near as stupid as saying Steph and Seth Curry are the same. Giannis is FAR more dominating than Simmons and to pretend otherwise makes Stephen A look smart.
Well my friend thinks Larry bird is a better shooter than Stephen Curry
"i don’t get how people said this, stephen curry and warriors w no durant is still a major draw for people. factor in the tear kawhi was on to get to the finals too"

Who is Stephen Curry?
"&gt;I believe that it is between magic Johnson, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry.  Well if you're asking who the second most famous player ever is in general then it's Kobe, zero debate.  But if you're just asking specifically at the time, then yeah it was probably Magic."
 &gt; The Warriors were down 3-1 in the NBA finals with both a healthy Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry  I don’t really care anymore but Klay didn’t play the fourth quarter of game two or game three at all -_-
"Top lists are always super biased and where the argument for an earlier player is super highly valued usually it is ignored as a blight on later candidates due to their high stats in other areas. That being said my personal top 10 is Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Stephen Curry, Larry Bird. There's always a million nuances here and exceptions there when talking about so many great players entire legacies and careers. I just thought it was interesting you emphatically said steph wasn't making your cut."
"You know who lead the league in scoring?!! Stephen “The Baby-Faced Assassin!” Have you seen the GSW? Steph, Klay, Green (2nd rd), Poole, Paschal (also 2nd rd),Looney, Wiseman all draft picks! That’s 4/5 starters, our #1 bench option (JP) not to mention EP, Nico (who’s tearing it up for Italy) maybe Jessup, all home grown picks! Plus JTA and Damion Lee who we sifted through the G league dirt to find those diamonds in the rough! I would hard pressed to see a team with that much draft capital and that much success! We used to be bottom, bottom shelf! Easily avg 50 losses a year, until we drafted a special lil scrawny light skinned green eyed killer! So here’s the first point I think you missed! You need a corner stone to build your foundation on. Booker could be that guy, but right now it’s CP3. Without him the suns are avg at best. Same with the W’s and no Curry. With Steph, and maybe fortunately unfortunately, we had Nelly at helm and his run and gun offense helped develop Steph’s confidence, but also a lot of losses! After that we moved Monta for Bougut, drafted Klay, Dray and young Harrison Barnes and the rest as they say, is history. And since we are here how many careers have the GSW resurrected? We got David Lee a chip, D. West, Livingston, Iggy, Cousins’, Barbosa, and made KD a god! We take others left over and turn them into a delectable 5 star meal! And while I’m here where’s the love for Kerr? All this Ty Lue talk about his adjustments?!! Really PG13 and Kawaii, last time LBJ and Co. it’s not like his rosters ain’t stacked! Anyways not sure what leading your team in scoring has to do with staying with one team but yeah no one has done it like the Warriors! Next year with a healthy Klay we will be dominant, and reign supreme once again! 😈 muuuhahahajahahhh that’s all carry the hell on!"
"Well ESPN let’s take a look at some of the top tier star players involved in each of the series:  2016: Lebron James, Stephen Curry  2011: Lebron James (though his production would ay otherwise), Dwayne Wade, Dirk Nowitzki  2006: Dwayne Wade, Dirk Nowitzki  2001: Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Allen Iverson (what exactly was “incredible” about this finals besides game 1?)  1996: micheal Jordan  You get the point. The only guy in this finals close to their lvl is Giannis and he isn’t even gonna play the whole series."
"Not a Serb,who is Klemen Prepelic and why is he Stephen Curry?"
"You said I hate him for his cornrows, implying I'm racist.     Michael Jordan   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   LeBron James   Magic Johnson   Hakeem Olajuwan   Bill Russell   Kobe Bryant   Larry Bird   Tim Duncan   Shaquille O'Neal   Wilt Chamberlain   David Robinson   Charles Barkley   Moses Malone   Karl Malone   Isiah Thomas   Patrick Ewing   Oscar Robertson   Dirk Nowitzki   Dwyane Wade   John Stockton   Kevin Garnett   Jerry West   Julius Erving   Kevin Durant   Steve Nash   Chris Paul   Scottie Pippen   Stephen Curry\[  Elgin   Hondo    Who is he better than?"

"&gt; If anything I think teams try to copy the Warriors style of play as a team   .... built around one ""Stephen Curry"""
Yes. Stephen curry should have one
"I’m not buying into Trae. Poor shot selection at times, and the inefficiency gets to me. If he’s supposed to be the next Curry, he needs to shoot better. 50/40/90 level. Steph in his early years was above 45 from Fg and 40 from 3pt fg. Trae hits a one or two lucky shots and people think he can be the sky king. Stephen hits 5 a game. Trae is another Harden with the baiting of foul calls. While he has a good floater and moves, I’d like more efficiency from him."
[Here's some stats on how Curry improves his teammates.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)
Trae Young is very inefficient from behind the arc. He doesn’t scare me like say a Stephen Curry.

"If we're doing this correctly, the answer is Stephen Curry, Chris Mullin, Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, and Wilt Chamberlain."
"[There’s also this link that says that Curry would rather win championships over playing iso ball](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/19/stephen-curry-responds-to-kevin-durant-we-all-want-to-iso-but-id-rather-win-titles/amp/)  They totally changed the offense when KD got there. There’s video evidence of this. I won’t dispute something that evidence. Just go watch games from before KD joined and after KD joined. The offense changed. That’s a fact.   The game slows down in the playoffs and defenses play better. KD wanted to iso more and they let him iso a lot more then they ever did with Curry. It’s not because Curry can’t do it but because Curry is selfless. He would rather win championships than iso.   The Thunder had a 3-1 lead in the WCF. Their regular season record means absolutely nothing at that point. You’re judging them on their past instead of their current situation. Their current situation was having a 3-1 lead in the WCF against the best regular season of all time.   Everything you said about Steph is true, and somehow that’s who KD ended up joining because Steph had won already. Steph Curry and the warriors didn’t need KD. They just needed an upgrade at SF. Any upgrade would have lead to them still being the favorites. KD made the biggest bitch move in NBA history. Name one other top 20 player of all time that left his team to go join the reigning MVP while both were in their prime."
"Also here's the comparison as teammates(and I only used playoffs because I get the sense the Warriors didn't give a damn about the regular season in those years):  Stephen Curry: 27.4/6.1/5.9, 46/39/93 shooting(62.3% TS), 1.6 STL, 3.1 TOV  Kevin Durant: 29.6/7.1/4.5, 51/40/90 shooting(64.2% TS), 1 STL, 1.2 BLK, 2.7 TOV  Actually one thing that's interesting to me is that in Durant's first year there they seemed to play their ""normal"" style and until the Finals Durant took a backseat to Curry in terms of FGA in many playoff games  But by the time of Durant's injury in 2019 they were starting to play like Durant was flat out the first option and Curry was the second option  I remember games where Curry had like 12 FGA"
"Was curious so I looked up Curry and Durant:  **Regular season:**  Stephen Curry(2014-2021): 27.3/5.0/6.4, 48.4% FG, 43.0% 3P, 91.3% FT, 1.7 STL, 3.1 TO  Kevin Durant(2011-2021): 27.6/7.5/5.0, 51.3% FG, 39.4% 3P, 88.3% FT, 1.1 STL, 1.2 BLK, 3.2 TO   **Playoffs:**  Stephen Curry(2014-2021): 26.8/5.9/5.8, 45.2% FG, 39.7% 3P, 92.8% FT, 1.5 STL, 3.4 TO  Kevin Durant(2011-2021): 29.8/7.8/4.3, 48.8% FG, 36.2% 3P, 86.9% FT, 1.1 STL, 1.2 BLK, 3.3 TO  **Accolades:**  Curry: 2x MVP, 6X All-Star, 3 rings, 4 ALL-NBA 1st team, 1 second team, 1 third team, two scoring titles, top 5 in MVP 4 times  Durant: 1x MVP, 9X all Star, 2 rings, 2 FMVP, 4 All-NBA 1st team, 3 All NBA second team, two regular season scoring titles, 5X postseason scoring titles, top 5 in MVP 4 times  It's up to you who is better because they are kind of close but honestly they don't stack up all that badly with the players looked at here  All they need is more rings"

""But I didn't feel anything else, because you're just sort of amped up.   &gt;   &gt;""It all sort of hits you after the game and then today. When you fall like that, it's scary. But this \[the elbow injury\] is something you're going to deal with throughout your career, whether you run into a screen or get hit. You might take a charge or something and get bruised up. I can deal with that. So all is good.""   &gt;   &gt;Curry said he hasn't played with a sleeve before but does not think it will affect his shooting."

You know! I'm changing it. Stephen Curry for me. Sleeper stays.
Stephen Curry
Wow the Warriors are really good now. Is Stephen Curry the best player in the NBA?
"The Warriors organization used to suck. Between Latrell Sprewell in 1992 and Stephen Curry in 2009, they didn’t pick a single player who became an All-Star   Just look at their first round picks since 1992:  1993- Penny Hardaway- Traded along with 3 1st round picks for Chris Webber who forced his way out after 1 season   1994- Clifford Rozier  1995- Joe Smith  1996- Todd Fuller  1997- Adonal Foyle  1998- Vince Carter- Traded for Antawn Jamison   1999- Jeff Foster  2001- Jason Richardson, Troy Murphy   2002- Mike Dunleavy Jr.   2003- Mickael Pietrus  2004- Andris Biedrins   2005- Ike Diogu   2006- Patrick O’Bryant  2007- Marco Belinelli   2008- Anthony Randolph   2009- *Stephen Curry*  2010- Ekpe Udoh   Outside of Curry, it was pretty much all bad. When they did pick a star, they managed to trade him away."
Stephen curry didn’t change basketball he is a product of basketball changing.
"Stephen Curry carried the NBA silently since 2009. I became a fan of him back in 2010, yet never ever believed that he would become the face of the association."
"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."

IIRC only Joe Harris and Stephen Curry shot a better percentage on catch and shoot 3s amongst 40 odd players that attempted at least 5 catch and shoot 3s per game last season.        His offball game is fantastic and a real asset.

"Points team wrecks shop.  Steph, Giannis, and Dame are all top flight playmakers, and everyone other than Giannis can space the floor well.    On the other team, Westbrook and Draymond both offer negative spacing with Luka’s shooting known to be inconsistent as well.    Not to mention from a pure talent standpoint, the points team are all just straight up better than their counterparts with the possible exception of Jokic vs. Embiid.    Then matchup wise, there’s just a massive mismatch going on defensively.    The biggest defensive mismatch in the favor of the Assist team is at the shooting guard position, with Trae Young being a legit threat matching up against Dame’s spotty defense.    But that’s not much when you consider that the Points team is going to have Giannis going straight at Westbrook/Doncic/Jokic all night surrounded by shooters including Stephen fucking Curry.  The Assist team’s starters just arent prepared to deal with that.  They’d have to keep Draymond in to keep Giannis from running over the game.  However, that means on the other end you’re allowing either Embiid or Giannis free reign to camp the paint, which would basically make Westbrook useless in terms of scoring.  So now you have 2 guys on the floor who can’t score at all and a pass first point guard in CP3, leaving Trae Young and Jokic to try and keep up with 6 of the best scorers in the NBA.    It just wouldn’t work out on any level for the Assist team unless the entire Points team just miraculously goes on a 2018 Rockets level cold streak."

""Stephen Curry vs. Jerry West Comparison"" https://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/stephen_curry_vs_jerry_west.htm  dude was unstoppable, only problem for him was the Celtics existed. he was probably the best overall offensive player in the NBA and arguably the best defending guard. would have been all defense team every year if it existed. same height and wingspan as Dwyane Wade. shot a shitload of 3s that counted as 2s. just an incredible player that gets super underrated."

"It's in like every Curry draft report.  &gt; Because of the incredibly high difficulty of shots he's capable of converting, Curry has a tendency to settle for a couple of truly awful attempts every game, showing absolutely no conscious. It's difficult to gauge whether this has more to do with his role on the team, or if he just really overestimates his shooting ability at times - Source: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/stephen-curry-1170/ ©DraftExpress"
"I'll start by saying that watching a high powered offensive performance can be magical. Stephen Curry has been a blessing to watch for years.  *That said*, low scoring grinds can be really entertaining in their own way, too. There's something to be said about the tension that builds with each subsequent stop in a game like that. I think we actually had a stretch that played out that way in this year's finals, if I'm not mistaken, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.   A shootout is crazy because you're trying to keep up the whole time, wondering who's going to be the first team to blink and miss a makeable three.   But a lockdown's crazy too, because suddenly a single basket is worth its weight in gold and when Rip would finally break through for a tough mid-range leaner, it'd almost feel like scoring a goal in hockey. A two or three-point lead late in that Pacers series almost felt insurmountable."

Among volume scorers, only Artis Gilmore, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Stephen Curry are higher -- two of whom are obviously active, and may not stay ahead of Dantley.  Seasons of 30+ points per game while shooting 55%+ from the field:   Dantley, 4  Abdul-Jabbar, 3  Karl Malone, 1  No one else.

Who knew this guy would leave the Warriors to become the golf legend Stephen Curry???
A one Stephen Curry went 7 too 👀
"Team 1:  Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis  Team 2:  Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, LeBron James, Nikola Jokic"
Stephen Curry also has the highest TS% amongst the top 100 leading point scorers.
"You are both neglecting the Lakers' depth, and shorting them by 2 titles.  They won 5 in 9 years.  They also had several players better than AC Green.  From '78 through '85 they had Hall of Famer Jamaal Wilkes.  From '82 though '85 they also had Hall of Famer and former MVP Bob McAdoo coming off the bench.  For the entire decade, they had DPOY Michael Cooper, who was about as well-eqipped as any human to guard Stephen Curry.  From '84 to '93 they also had Byron Scott -- a very solid perimeter defender who himself shot 42+% from the arc on 3 occasions.  The problem for the Warriors is that they played no one remotely capable of slowing Abdul-Jabbar -- who was still shooting near 60% from the field in the mid-Eighties, against actual interior defense, something Golden State did not possess.  Golden State would have to send all manner of help on Abdul-Jabbar, resulting in a layup line for other Lakers.  The Warriors could shoot 40% from three and still lose, because the Lakers would get as many layups as they wanted, and you can't beat layups with threes.  Or they'd have to play Javale McGee 35 minutes, which takes away a huge chunk of their offense.  And he'd still need help.  For reference, at 39 years-old, Abdul-Jabbar put up 27 a game in a series against prime Olajuwon and Sampson, with almost no healthy frontcourt teammates.  There's a reason he scored more points than anyone -- he was damn near unstoppable by any single player, even in his mid to late thirties, despite playing ~100 games nearly every season.  Meanwhile, the Lakers had an array of defenders to run at the Warriors on the perimeter, making that 40% an unsure bet anyway.  The Lakers were just too deep, too big, too talented, and too balanced.  If it were a 3-on-3 game, the Warriors would have a very good chance, but not with full rosters in a real game -- and not surprisingly, since Golden State sort-of had a salary cap, and Los Angeles had none."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"Tbf, he really was Curry before Curry... in a way. If you boil down Stephen Curry to ""3 point sniper that lives for offball movement"" that is Reggie in a nutshell."
Stephen Curry and Kur are the most overrated coach and player in my lifetime
"1. LeBron James - I’m not quite ready to move LeBron down yet. I want to see what he does this season and how his health looks. He’s just been so dominant for so long.   2. Kevin Durant - He is just unstoppable. He can score from anywhere and nearly beat the Bucks by himself. He’s just as good as he was before his injury and doesn’t seem to be slowing down.   3. Stephen Curry - He just had an amazing season, maybe the best of his career. It will be interesting to see him this year with Klay back. Obviously a worse defender than Giannis, but he’s just so dominant on offense.   4. Giannis Antetokounmpo - It’s hard having him at 4 after how dominant he was in the Finals, but he’s in the top tier. Just a monster on both ends.   5. Nikola Jokic - There’s a clear drop at this point, in my opinion, but Jokic just had an incredible season and is still young enough to continue improving. He’s also much healthier than guys like Kawhi, Harden, and Embiid."
"1. LeBron‘s championship window is closed.  2. Harden, Luka, and Trae will be completely fine with the new rule changes, but Embiid and Butler will have worse seasons than they did in 2021 as a result of them.  3. Jayson Tatum is not a fringe top-10 player. He’s not clearly ahead of any of Booker, Beal, Trae, and Mitchell. Those 5 are close to interchangeable. His defensive edge is not great enough to clear him from the other 4, who are significantly better playmakers.  4. The Blazers organization has failed to surround Damian Lillard with sufficient talent, but he should also be held accountable for their postseason woes. He is one of the worst defenders in the NBA, and his playmaking is a significant notch below that of other elite point guards (Steph, Luka, Harden, Trae, CP3). He can be an excellent second option, but can’t be the centerpiece of a championship team.  5. Julius Randle’s 2021 season was an anomaly, and it will have been his peak.  6. Michael Porter Jr. is not a max-extension worthy player yet. He is a lights-out shooter, but his IQ lapses and inability to become an elite defender (injury limitations) will be a problem for him and the Nuggets in the future.  7. Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson are the two most overrated players in NBA history.  8. Kevin Garnett at his peak was better than Tim Duncan at his peak.  9. Stephen Curry is the best offensive player ever.  10. The Suns will win the 2022 NBA Championship."
"I don't think Stephen Curry entering a debate about the greatest point guard of all time says much about Magic's status, historically speaking, and more about Curry's spectacular career.  I'd say Magic is all in all fairly well-rated. His impact on popularising the league is well accounted for, his tremendous skillset is appreciated and his, if you forgive the pun, magic style of play influences guards to this day. If you really wanted to pinpoint it, you could argue that he is overrated in that the few weaknesses of his game are less prounounced than they should be (such as his tendency to only rely on his size advantage on D as well as his, compared to other all-time great PGs, high amount of turnovers), but that would be nitpicking. He's considered one of the greatest point guards of all time (*the* greatest by many) and has a fringe GOAT following, which I'd say is fair."
He was getting hate after his first championship for hoping the Cavs locker room still smells like champagne which people thought was kind of disrespectful to a city that had never won a championship in around 50 years and insensitive considering Curry is actually a Cleveland native leading a big city against their own kind of thing   [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2608729-stephen-curry-hopes-cavaliers-visiting-locker-room-still-smells-like-champagne](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2608729-stephen-curry-hopes-cavaliers-visiting-locker-room-still-smells-like-champagne)

"Truly. He's an anomaly. He has good shooting technique, but also very uniquely his. I wonder if it's even a good thing that so many players are trying to emulate his shot. It's such a good shot because it's his and he's Stephen Curry."
"Top 3 player just led the league in scoring, with MVP consideration, how could anyone pay him *less* than the max. smfh. These execs obviously haven't won anything if they are worrying about how much Stephen fucking Curry gets paid."
"To dislike Steph for being cocky… how dense of a person do you have to be?  You don’t think Stephen Curry deserves to be a little cocky? It’s when someone is either overly cocky or can’t back it up, that you should have disdain for cockiness."
Whoever those executives are should be fired on the spot for questioning paying Stephen fucking Curry

"Of course Kyrie was a red flag, not denying that. He's still one of the most talented players in the entire league and I'd be hard pressed Boston was getting a similar player of Kyrie's talent level for Isaiah Thomas. The ONLY reason they were even able to get him to begin with was cuz he wanted out of Cleveland so bad. IT wanted 5 years 200 mil. Stephen fucking Curry had just gotten 5 years 201 mil. Who in their right mind was trading for that and gonna pay that the next year?  Seriously, think about it, it was either take that risk and trade for a consensus top 5 point guard in the league, trade an injured, undersized, defensive liability of a player to a team and get almost nothing in return for him, or pay IT. They chose the best option. It was a gamble and didn't work out, but that's sports. But still objectively the best option of the three.  And yeah, it's a ""what if"" but literally no one could ever predict that happening to Hayward."

"They were an up and coming team. Stephen Curry was on pace to be one of the greatest shooter in NBA history, but nobody saw him took that quantum leap he took when Steve Kerr took over as head coach. The Spurs were known at the time for playing ""the beautiful game"" when they dominated the Heat in the NBA Finals, and they were considered title favorites around this time, with Kawhi emerging into the team's best player.  Andre Igoudala was a huge pick-up for the Warriors, and Barnes, Draymond, and Klay all took huge steps forward especially when Steve Kerr decided to bring Draymond Green into the starting lineup."
"&gt; but you could make a very convincing case that Elena Delle Donne's 2019 season was the greatest shooting season in basketball history.  Stephen Curry 2016: 56.6% on 2s, 45.4% on 3s (11.2 attempts at 23'9""), 90.8% on 2s   Elena Delle Donne 2019: 54.9% on 2s, 43% on 3s (3.9 attempts at 22'2""), 97.4% on 2s    you gotta be a pretty big fan of free throws to argue this, in which case you may as well argue that Jose Calderon's 2009 season is the GOAT shooting season, which no one has ever seriously done."
Yea...and all those players also hated Karl because Karl used to rip them too. Dude flamed his own players and rarely took responsibility.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/23/8830539/george-karl-snake-demarcus-cousins-history  https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/columnists/gary-damato/2018/04/17/damato-ray-allen-havent-talked-george-karl-15-years/522477002/  https://nypost.com/2016/03/28/stephen-curry-joins-demarcus-cousins-in-george-karl-hate-fest/  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/gary-payton-george-karl
"Curry.  You're about to downvote me, but lemme ask you: what would be more demoralizing than getting yammed on by Stephen Curry?    Giannis is gonna dunk all day, and Zion's gonna get his too, but if Curry dunks on you, your spirit is broken.  /s for those who may not get it."
"It was .625 the season OP is referencing. Yeah, technically your right but .625 is still damn impressive. That season he averaged more points than Stephen Curry on a better TS%."
"If there's 6 Michael Jordan who can shoot like Stephen Curry in the NBA right now with the same skillset and talent, and he still dominate everyone else like a mile, then he still can't be called Generational Talent. That is because Generational Talent isn't about whose the best, it's about how different is your talent compared to the rest of the league. Hope that explanation would somehow make you knowledgeable at the very least.  Or are you still gonna call it Generational Talent even if there are 6 players with the same skillset of him? Lmaoooo. And you even call yourself smart?"
"&gt; Instead he looked off Steph, didn't relocate for Steph, lost all confidence in his 3 ball and is one of a super tiny list of players to be a net negative playing next to Stephen Curry.  Bro you got this shit copy/pasted on your clipboard? Lmao same comment from you every single time.   Oubre didn't struggle that much with the Warriors schemes after the 1st month. I can break down every footage of him running it successfully off the ball, here's an entire video that shows it even though it's dedicated to Curry's defense: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtzZqNlKZLA  There's also no stat that shows he's a net negative playing next to Curry. Care to back this up? I've looked at the on/off stats. Every lineup without Wiseman was a huge net positive. He shot 47% on wide open 3s since February, after one of the worst starts in NBA history."
"But im not a BronStan   I actually despise Lebron for his playing style.   In the video I posted Ben Taylor simply says that when you adjust for possession inflation during the stretches that Wade sat on the bench Lebron has the highest point per possession we've ever seen   Stephen ups his scoring to the exact same levels when Klay is on the bench .   Jordan just didnt do that. He is a different type of scorer that LBJ, he isactually more like Curry and Miller. He is an off-ball type of guy.  Scorers tend to score more when a sidekick like Pippen or Wade sit on the bench."
"I havent seen any explanation on the quickness, but the most probable case is that he, in fact, trained his shot to be quicker   People often confuse Curry's shot to be one-motion, when in fact it is not   Here we have a prime example of perfectly executed 2-motion [Ray Allen](https://tenor.com/view/basketball-dodge-block-gif-14752287)  And here's Steph, doing the actual 2-motion but so god-damn quick you cant even realize [LINK1](https://tenor.com/view/shooting-threes-gif-5021012), [LINK2](https://giphy.com/gifs/nba-stephen-curry-steph-2vmjteykdT9RAKqbDM)  You can try this at home - use your regular shooting motion, but for some reason act as if the ball is hot potatoes, and you have to make a shot, the result would be that you are shooting it as you are supposed to, but the release time is much quicker. Just like there's a super good defender on your ass and you need to shoot, but quicker   Knowing how dedicated he is to training his stamina, it wouldnt surprise me that he actually made his mission to perfect nost just the accuracy of his shot, but also the quickness of it"
i’m taking kyrie. he went toe to toe w stephen curry in the finals and outplayed him and then dropped like 30 a game against the warriors in the finals the next year
"With respect, Richard was 100 percent still in play back then and even to this day. That was his first name and that's what he went by. News articles, NBA releases, awards, [in-game graphics](https://youtu.be/Q1a2whlxqGs?t=485), all still went by Richard.   Rip was easy shorthand for him and you'd hear that swapped out pretty regularly but it was never, ever, close to what Stephen is for Steph Curry. Curry's never been known as Wardell whereas Hamilton is [*still* to this day](https://youtu.be/d49Vstzp76w?t=280) often referenced by his true first name.   Rip was commonly used but never replaced Richard the way Magic did Earvin."
I don’t think skill set overlaps matter between 2 superstars. And I also don’t think anyone is gonna hesitate pairing Nikola Jokic with Stephen fucking Curry because of “defensive concerns”
Imagine being one of the best shooters in the league (which MPJ is) and then ending up in a shooting contest with Stephen Curry.
"I would call this ""close"".  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22124345/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-tops-jersey-sales-china  ""LeBron James reclaimed his kingdom in China from Stephen Curry -- arguably the most popular current NBA star in China -- in terms of jersey sales, according to the latest NBA China jersey and merchandise sales for the 2017-18 season.

"Because of gravity. It’s the same reason as to why Kevin Durant can get a wide open path to dunk the ball in the NBA finals when the defense collapses on Stephen Curry.  NFL defenses collapse around the ball handler which leaves the rest of the field vulnerable to attack.   Now it’s hard to even imagine what a lateral based offense would look like because NFL players at the current moment are massively unskilled and untrained in this skill. We only ever see the laterals in desperation moments at the end of games by guys that have never practiced it.   If NBA players can pass to each other without constantly turning it over, it stands to reason that football players can figure it out too.   The only thing that would be a slight hinderance to this strategy is the face mask obstructing vision somewhat.   The big problem with this strategy is that it’s so against orthodoxy that it will be hard for any coach who even wants to try it to get the opportunity to do it with skilled football players as they will be prevented from even trying to do it from then hive mind. It’s hard to even compare something that doesn’t even get practiced versus the orthodox method that is continuously practiced."
I was OK with it until you included SquimJim. You can’t just add a superstar like that to an otherwise good-but-not-great lineup like this and expect all the other teams to be ok with it. Should have used Stephen Curry instead. Much more balanced.
"My guess is Yes, if they really put the effort into being a good General Manager + President of Basketball Operations. Also, having bad ownership might hold them back.  I'll give you an example. In 2009, the Timberwolves drafted Ricky Rubio #5 and Jonny Flynn at #6. The GSW take Steph Curry at #7. Blake Griffin, Hasheem Thabeet, James Harden, and Tyreke Evans were also taken ahead of Curry. I think the average hardcore NBA fan goes with Curry, a super good shooter and son of an NBA player over Flynn.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-scouting-report-davidson-2009-nba-draft-warriors/odgsfr1n0zs517flvxfb3lg5m"
"Right now? Probably not. What you see is decency bias in which the game is going towards and favours shooting and just chucking. Harden is great offensively, doing things that no one has ever done, but he is doing it in modern era, the era that Stephen Curry defined. Harden has taken advantage of that and makes it part of his own. The game back then was played a lot different, sure Harden has done things nobody has ever done, but Wade has done things only 1 or 2 other guy on his position has ever done, we don’t even need to name them, you know them. Peak-Prime Wade was short because he came into the league without knees, you can say that he won in 06 because of free throws. Go back and watch, no one could stop Wade in 06. There are videos showing that some of the calls were phantom, most of them were legit. This has happened for literally all the other superstars, but eh, easy to blame the guy to bring him down right? It’s similar to how Harden gets all the calls in regular season and stopped getting them in the playoffs. Calls are called differently in the playoffs.   Harden while may be better than Wade offensively, but let’s not put Wade far away in terms of offensively, he was one of the most unguardable player in his time. Only reason Harden had an argument was because Harden prime is a lot longer than Wade, and he is still in it. If Wade came into the league with working knees, then it will be a different story, but fuck ifs. If Harden had won against GSW, he would be rated a lot differently. Harden could very well be better than Wade all time when his career is done, it just feels so stupid to be rating him now because he’s not even done playing. If you say Wade vs West, then yeah it would be interesting, Wade vs Harden is unfair for both party."
"Fultz conspiracy theorists and tinfoil hatters would  whine either way. If he touched down in Orlando and started shooting like Stephen Curry right away you'd be typing ""The diagnosis is fake. He didn't want to try in Philly. He was holding back and holding out the whole time. He's soft.""   His shooting numbers improved in Orlando after he was given the correct diagnosis and treatment but his issue clearly didn't disappear the moment he landed in Florida. Yet salty Sixer fans still want to whine about whether or not he has TOS when he shows almost every symptom."

"I'll start from least to most controversial:  \- Giannis's peak is already the second best for a PF of all time, Garnett was even better defensively but wasn't as good as a scorer  \- Heliocentric ball dominant guards, no matter how much assists they may rack up, make their teammates worse and unless they are a truly elite scorer(example: LeBron) they cannot be the best player on a championship team, as they are only floor and not ceiling raisers(example: Westbrook.) Controversially, I also believe this to apply to current Luka and think the Porzingis situation is partly caused by Luka's extreme ball dominance and refusal to pass early in the shot clock. Players like Curry who can play off ball well will always be better than players who can't, with the SOLE exception of LeBron James.   \- Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are just as good skillwise as Magic and Bird, the only difference is that Magic and Bird didn't have their prime overlap with Jordan the way Curry and Durant did with LeBron. For example, Durant would have threepeated MVP just like Bird did if LeBron wasn't in the league. Also, as I mentioned before, neither one of them needs to hold the ball constantly, which makes them much more ""plug and play"" than other stars."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."

"Since Lebron's career has been so long, you could say he's had a few rivalries.  Stephen Curry for sure.  Kevin Durant as well (on OKC and the Warriors).  But you could also say Boston's Big 3 were a rivalry, too. He battled them in Cleveland and it forced Lebron to take his tallents to South Beach so he could actually fight fire with fire.   Maybe even Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginnobli, too. Lebron's first Finals appearance was against the Spurs. You also had those epic back to back Finals fights between the Heat and the Spurs."
It’s tough here honestly because when we look at Jordan’s biggest Rival most think of the Bad boy pistons even though they weren’t in the league for half of his championships and then a first round exit in 1992 and not even a playoff team In 1993. Jordan lost to that pistons team 3 times I believe. Lebron lost to the Celtics twice before joining Miami and while they are the reason the heat was formed I think it’s hard to say Curry isn’t his biggest rival as of now (and I don’t think their story is over yet) though KD and LeBron might meet in another finals I think a Warriors Lakers series is inevitable right now. Tim Duncan and the Spurs did beat up on Lebron a good bit throughout his career (Duncan has a 21 and 15 record vs Lebron) but when I think of Lebron I think he is a warriors team away from having 5-6 maybe even more rings and that warriors team guy will always be Stephen Curry the story will continue this season we will see who gets the better of who in the 2022 playoffs. The reason I brought up the pistons for jordan is because they took the most rings from him in his career like the warriors (lead by steph) too the most rings from Lebron
"You gotta split LeBron’s career in 2 main pieces:   •Spurs (Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard) Tim Duncan caused the most damage offensively, so I would consider Tim Duncan to be his greatest rival from 07-14.  •Warriors (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala) Stephen Curry has played longer than KD on the warriors and has had a leader role for almost his  whole career, thats why I believe Stephen Curry is LeBron’s greatest rival from 2015 to now."
"Obviously I was referring to regular season MVP since I said already Steph didn't have a Finals MVP.  Kerr and Draymond don't have as much claim because they weren't voted unanimous MVP of that team. The fact that records ""will be broken"" of course isn't a justification for leaving someone off a list, unless you want to disqualify Jordan because eventually someone better will come along.  You also may not like it, but [Steph is perceived as bringing in this era of the NBA.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-stephen-curry-ushered-nbas-greatest-shooting-era-and-changed-the-perception-of-championship-teams/)"

We got to see Wilt Chamberlain-like insanity thru Stephen Curry. I’m thankful.
"Stephen Curry, the original 90-50-40"
"1. Kevin Durant | Brooklyn Nets: 45 points (38.9% first-place votes)  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo | Milwaukee Bucks: 38 points (33.3% first-place votes)  3. Luka Doncic | Dallas Mavericks: 35 points (16.7% first-place votes)  4. Joel Embiid | Philadelphia 76ers: 14 points (5.6% first-place votes)  5. James Harden | Brooklyn Nets: 11 points (5.6% first-place votes)  6. Stephen Curry | Golden State Warriors: 10 points  7. LeBron James | Los Angeles Lakers: 7 points  Those are  the MVP predictions and the Nets are #1 for Champion with 80 points,Lakers 2nd with 49,Bucks 3rd with 30 and nobody else got more than 4 points in the vote"
"Most greats do both, but most of them are clearly better in one area or another.  Lebron James is regarded as a floor raiser because any hypothetical team he is on, you want to build an offense around him as so much of his value comes when he has the ball in his hands.  Stephen Curry is viewed as a ceiling raiser because most of his value comes from his off-ball shooting that he doesn't need the ball in his hands to boost his offense.  The whole point of the floor/ceiling raiser designation is to help explain what roles NBA players would play on a NBA team, and a lot of superstars do better in some roles than others."
They must be getting Stephen Curry then lol

"&gt;4. Stephen Curry - 2015 NBA Finals Game 5: &gt; &gt;37 PTS, 7 REB, 4 AST, 13-23 FG, 7-13 3P, .74.7 TS%  Hmm. I guess that's ok, but did he even guard LeBron?"
"&gt;A $1 million prize for players would cost the league $15 million (or $17 million if two-way players are included). The trouble here is that $1 million means more to some players than others. It takes Stephen Curry less than six quarters to earn $1 million, and as salaries continue to climb, more and more players are going to shrug at such a prize. A possible tweak would be to base the prize on a percentage of salary. Let's say players were awarded a 10 percent bonus for winning the tournament. Only six NBA teams currently have more than $150 million committed in salaries, so not only could that approach save the league money (for the moment, anyway), but it would shift the bulk of the winnings to the players who did the heavy lifting.   This is actually an interesting idea and something that the best players could get up for for more reasons than making teammates a bit extra.  &gt; The basketball goal for most teams is to win a championship. To get them to take a tournament seriously, they'd have to believe that winning it would increase their odds of winning the championship  This has been my issue with just payout.  If the end goal is the Larry O'Brien trophy, then there needs to be some incentive that helps with getting that trophy.  I think extra wins on the record per round is the best way to solve that.  Same way the play-in gives more runway to try later into the season, extra wins would give you more leeway for rough stretches."
I wouldn't trust Stephen Curry to hit an open shot with the fate of the universe on the line. Don't want my martian death beam virginity taken just yet

"Okay, so do the same for the top five PG's.  Magic played with Kareem when Kareem was arguably still the best player in the league. Kareem was still a top player when Magic came along.  Stephen Curry won two rings playing behind KD. He's the 2nd greatest PG of all-time with zero NBA Finals MVP's.  Stockton made his career playing behind Malone... Yet, he's probably the 3rd highest ranked PG of all time on most lists.  Isiah Thomas and Dumars were just as good as each other with Dumars outplaying Thomas in their first ring together.  Big O won his first ring when he was far past his prime with KAJ being by far, the best player on the team.  The stuff you casuals say without any evidence is just laughable. LeBron will always be the primary player on ANY team... Your argument makes no sense. Does AD deserve credit for his ring?"

FMVP: Stephen Curry
This is why I love Wardell Stephen Curry II
Stephen Curry in a side by side comparison has better numbers and is a more effective player than Kobe Bryant. Never in his career did Steph have the benefit of playing with a talent like Shaq.
"""We tried to trade you for Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum and Stephen Curry, but couldn't find a deal :(. Friends again?"""
"Stephen Curry the Wilt Chamberlain of 3 pointers for future generations, lmao."
"While they are certainly controversial opinions, because the players have large, fanatical fanbases, I am always debating the following points:  1. Lebron James's ascension to 'Goatdom' or near 'Goatdom' was pre-ordained and undeserved. Preordained because it was clear that the media, the NBA, and all the companies he endorsed were on the same page with his hype, and all he had to do was get close enough and their spin and omissions would fill in what he could not. While he is certainly one of the most unique and talented players of all-time, that alone does not make you a GOAT, or a top five player. i personally cannot put a player in my top five who hand picked his All-Star teammates on multiple teams, and his ring total is still lower than individuals who did not. People say he played teams that were 'unbeatable', but that TOO is nonsense. That Houston squad who pushed the Warriors to the brink of elimination, won more games against GS, WITH KD, in one series, than Lebron won against them in back to back Finals. On top of that, despite how great the Warriors were in the NBA Finals, Steph and Klay - with the exception of the last Finals for Klay - were never as productive and or efficient as they were in the regular season. If you look at the production of the top four players on the Warriors and Cavs in 2017, Lebron averaged a 30+ pt triple-double and KD averaged something like 35. Kyrie averaged more points, and was more efficient from the field and three point range than Steph. Klay and Kevin Love both averaged 16pts, and Draymond and JR both averaged something like 11. So, how exactly was the Warrior's collection of all-stars unbeatable? What happened was, the limitations of Lebron as an on-ball player was exposed, once again. His style of play is very predictable and teams simply adjust. No, what the media and Lebron fans do is diminish the quality of his teammates or opponents, based on the result that Lebron achieved. For instance, if Lebron loses, it's because he had 'no help', or his team was the 'GREATEST TEAM OF ALL-TIME', even though a team like Houston had them against the ropes, all because they got physical with them. Beyond that, I could never put a perimeter player in my top 5 all-time, who is a sub-40 percent shooter outside of the paint for the career, and such a poor FT shooter. Nope. Can't do it.   2. Stephen Curry is overrated. If the lack of Final's MVPs weren't enough, it is abundantly clear that Steph Curry's ascension coincided with the NBA's efforts to increase scoring, and style of play. You make the game less and less physical and make three-point shooting the primary weapon, and give Steph a teammate who is almost as great of a shooter as he is - then the results are obvious. However, deeper into the playoffs, where the best defensive teams are, and the refs allowing more physical play, you will have a two-time MVP with Final's MVPs. He is the same as Harden and Westbrook in the sense that, they all explode during the regular season, but come down considerably during the playoffs Of course, Steph comes down less than they do, which explains his trips to the Finals - but it is the same concept.   3. Damian Lillard is even more overrated than Steph. I could write a mini-novel on this point as well, but I am far less passionate about Damon Lilla, as Barkley calls him.   4. KD is highly skilled, but would certainly be less effective in a more physical era. Once again, the Houston Rockets had him and GS against the ropes, ALL BECAUSE THEY GOT PHYSICAL WITH THEM. I remember Colin Cowherd, who always praised GS for their unselfish, highly skilled style of play, saying that the Warriors were probably the greatest team of their era, but struggling so much against a team who is only playing physical defense, proves that their status has been bolstered by a deliberate softening of the league. Not unlike Brady playing and excelling at such an advanced age due to the league becoming hyper-protective of QBs."
"&gt;Proves his point? You mean your point, unless you thought you were on an alt lol  I meant ""proves his defense"" as in, proves Stephs defense lmao. Dunno why I said point.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And no, that’s not how it works. What stats are even saying he’s an above average defender, can you link me?     [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html)  Neutral on DBPM and a significant positive in DWS  [http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm3?id=968924392](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm3?id=968924392)   Positive in D-RAPM  Positive in LA-DRAPM  [https://backpicks.com/tag/stephen-curry/](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/787/onoff#tab-team_efficiency)  Positive Defensive APM  [http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm)  Positive in DRPM  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  DEF RAPTOR of 0.5  [https://backpicks.com/metrics/2021-players/](https://backpicks.com/metrics/2021-players/)  DRTG along with other stats are good  [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF\_WS&amp;dir=-1](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_WS&amp;dir=-1)  Positive in DWS, and DRTG again.  Now, to wrap up this bit, let me leave this note. These stats usually compare player to player, regardless of position. Steph is being compared to Cs and PFs when he's just a PG, the least defensively significant position on the court. If we had the ability to rank relative to PGs.... Well, this wouldn't be a discussion.  &amp;#x200B;  Man, this was really fun. [As I was researching, I found this article.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26833111/what-draymond-sees-warriors-star-details-unique-game) I just got sucked into defensive clips and analysis.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It’s fine if you wanted to say he’s not a turnstile on defense but he’s definitely not good at it. Lack of athleticism, strength and size will do that, I still think he puts in effort which is all you can ask from him     Steph is pretty good on D. The MAIN argument against him is the fact that the Cavs/Rockets targeted him. This is pretty easily debunkable for 2 reasons.  1) Steph was surrounded by elite defensive talent so of course he was the go to option  2) The Cavs/Rockets wanted to exhaust Steph so they targeted him  &amp;#x200B;  Steph is in general a pretty solid defender. He has a strong motor and is pretty tough, and is shockingly physical. He's extremely active with his hands and leverages them against attackers. He's gotten stronger and that allows him to fully push against defenders with his entire body. He navigates screens well because he can react and read offensive moves very well, and he has solid footwork. [Great analysis of Stephs defense.](https://youtu.be/bvTPxCOfjdE?t=1564) He clogs passing lanes well and is an elite preswitcher. [Great GSW defense analysis and Steph preswitching analysis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQr54Toq5eA) He doesn't lose players off ball often either. He rotates well and can get steals off of this. Surprisingly, Steph is a really good help defender for his position. He might not have that Draymond height but he can still blow up plays by forcing the attackers hand. Steph is also a fantastic defensive rebounder for PGs which is pretty well known. In general, he doesn't make a lot of mistakes on defense. [Solid analysis on his defense.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHAEE5Ut5sU) Steph's best defensive attribute is how vocal he is and his defensive IQ. [More great analysis on Stephs communication and defensive IQ.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtzZqNlKZLA)   His size is what holds him back, and that's obvious. BUT, he is still an average to above average defender as I said. The thing is, Steph is actually average height for a PG and stronger than a lot of PGs in the league. This is one of the key aspects. He handles his assignments well most of the time, unless it's a player like Dame or Kyrie. In those cases, it's a whole group project to deal with them. The only times Steph gets exposed include massive mismatches that every PG in the league would go through."

"Started playing basketball since I was 3 years old. Only tuned in to my local basketball league which was absolute blockbuster gold at that time. Now, its shitty.  2008-2009. My family had cable and the Lakers and Celtics were flashy teams. Ray Allen is my very first guy coz I love the 3 ball ever since. Kinda hated Kobe coz I thought he was cocky. LeBron was popular in the circle too. Kinda liked him but I just have a disdain for stars who are not good at shooting so he's meh to me at first impression.  2011, I got Facebook and got into NBA Memes (Pass? Just get the rebound). Hated LeBron coz that's what everybody did (I was young). Went to my cousin's house one day coz I have a potato computer that can't run Powerpoint and he had a reputable PC with a good CPU and GPU. He had 2k11 installed and playing it for the first time was heavenly. I even managed to get on the sliders. I was playing the Lakers at that time and just watching Steve Blake shoot 10 3s in a row decimating the Celtics was peak entertainment. I kept using him coz I don't know him. He's white and looks super unskilled compared to Kobe  Came back there like 2 weeks later and I decimated the Lakers using the GOAT Brian Scalabrine with 214 points. In my mind, I was like ""I gotta get a copy of this game coz I wanna try so many things""  Got the game and played it on a Netbook (its my only computer at that time). It wasn't a good experience so I had to put all settings on ultra low and use Cheat Engine speedhacks to slow the gameplay down increasing the fluidity of the game. Literally hyped when I saw Mike Miller dunk in the span of 10 seconds.   About one year later, mom decided to buy a brand new PC coz she doesn't want me visiting my cousin's house every time we had a big project. It was an i3 with no GPU whatsoever but it ran 2k11 well enough (with astonishing graphics in my eyes). It was the perfect time to milk the hell out of the game. It was summer and I got circumcised and my parents were totally ok with me playing with my brand new computer all summer. I even had the time to download mods (EG FIBA and Slam Dunk 2k11)  2013 forward, I started to follow NBA and pick a team. Before Stephen Curry's infamous 54 point explosion at MSG, my favorite players were Steve Nash and Ricky Rubio because other than the 3 ball, I like point guards who does flashy passing and outsmarting the opponents. When Steph Curry happened, I started to idolize him in 2013. It helps that his teammate is also a shooter in Klay Thompson. So I mained the Warriors in 2013. I actually thought the Warriors could beat the Miami Heat in the Finals during 2014. I was pissed off when Steph missed that Game 7 dagger when I knew that should've been a foul and we would've eliminated the Clipper's ass.   My investment in GSW was the one of the best things I ever did.  2015 to 2018 I was nutting all day coz Steph Curry GOATED. Sucked that they blew a 3-1 lead but hey 2nd best PG of all time baby.   TL;DR it all started in TV then it quickly developed in 2k then Reddit (which is probably my biggest mistake ever that I will never regret, never change r/nba)"
"If I learned anything from Space Jam, State Farm commercials and Stephen Curry commercials, pro athletes just need to stick to their day jobs. Please."
"I called you stupid because you’re making assumptions about the way I discuss basketball because of one thread... where I only brought up this tangent specifically because of the person I responded to, showcasing why it’s a double standard. And you’re telling me I can’t read? Give me a break.   Yeah people are right... that’s their projections coming true. It’s not them knowing lmao. If Stephen Curry takes a wide open 3, I don’t know it’s gonna go in. I can make an educated assumption that due to how great of a shooter he is, it will go in. If he shoots it and it goes in, that’s not me knowing, it’s my assumption being right. The fact that there are so many busts and so many stoles proves it’s impossible to 100% know.  And btw, making extremely random assumptions when you know literally nothing about me or my basketball views just shows you have point worth making.  This is a straw man. I never said people can’t be right. And for the second time since you clearly can’t read, the majority of my discussions in this thread involving basketball are based around hypotheticals. I specifically sent on this tangent cause the comment I replied to said Houston is different from other tanking teams cause they didn’t whif on their picks. That’s the only reason. Because we don’t know if they did. So its nonsensical to compare teams who drafted players we’ve seen fail and teams who’ve drafted players we haven’t even see play.   Um, no, that’s now how it works lmfao. Watching college basketball doesn’t mean you can automatically tell whether a player will be good, or how good they’ll be. Again if that were the case there wouldn’t be busts or steals. Again, it’s simply making educated assumptions on a case by case basis.   What did I ever say about other pro leagues? What does this have to do with any part of the discussion? Again, you making assumptions about me when you know nothing about me outside of this exchange just makes you look stupid. I was one of the people pre draft saying Luka was the clear #1 pick as a 6’7 ginobili/ harden hybrid. Did I think he’d be this good this soon? No, but I’m glad to see it. But I didn’t know he’d be great. I used by basketball knowledge and my analysis of his game to assume he’d be great. And I was right. I also don’t see what this has to do with the discussion at all...   Since you seem unable to read, I’ll reiterate what I said in the most basic terms possible. I enjoy speculation. This tangent is solely to point out the illogical point I responded to. It’s a fact we don’t know whether these picks will pan out, so it’s illogical to say other tanking teams draft badly but Houston doesn’t. And you can’t know how good a player is gonna be before they play in the league. Competition matters. Adjustments to NBA rules matter. Development matters. Etc. Everything I’ve said here is a fact. Idk why you’re acting like a hostile little 6 year old when I was completely civil beforehand 😂"

Team SoloMid owner Stephen Curry has a whole esports facility to lounge around in
"He was already terrorizing Toronto Junior High teams when he was 13.  https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/stephen-curry-toronto-middle-school-big-read/  &gt;James Lackey was out of ideas. There was only a minute left on the clock and the basketball coach of the seemingly unbeatable Queensway Christian College Saints had just watched the visitors do what no other team in the city could: slow down his star, a short, scrawny, baby-faced guard. From the opening tip, the bigger players had pushed the kid around. They fouled him — hard. They triple-teamed him and swarmed him when he dared to bring his spindly frame into the lane. “So we’re down six and I call a timeout,” Lackey recalled from his home in Oakville, Ont. “I brought the guys in and said, ‘Look, I don’t know what to tell you. Do you have a suggestion here? Help me out.’ And there was just silence. It was like one of those Hoosiers moments.”  &gt;That’s when the skinny guard piped up. “Give me the ball,” said 13-year-old Steph Curry. “Give me the ball and we’ll win.”  &gt;“You heard him,” barked Lackey. “Give him the ball and get out of his way.”  &gt;The defence lined up near the three-point line. Curry took the ball up the court, dug his black-and-white Jordan 13s into the weathered blue concrete gymnasium floor, and pulled up a couple of feet in front of them. Good. On the Saints’ next trip up the court, the wall moved closer to Curry. Again, he pulled up two feet in front and drilled the shot. You can guess how this ends: Queensway won by six; **in that minute, Curry scored nine of his team’s 12 points and the Saints finished the season undefeated.**"
"No it wasnt. Proof from Draft Express.    &gt;Projecting him to the next level, Curry is an interesting case. Hes likely to do a lot of his damage in spot up situations in the NBA, but got only 8.9% of his possessions off of spot ups last seasons. Hes not likely to use a lot of one-on-one possessions, but he used 8.6 per game last season (1st). Averaging 8.3 isolations per game (68.3% Left), Curry probably wont sniff half that number next season. In terms of guard play, his 41% shooting in transition ranks second to last, showing how hard he was pressing to score, but his 1.3 PPP on the pick and roll is excellent which leaves a lot of room for optimism. He did use 2.6 possessions per game as a jump shooter running off of screens, so he does have a nice base of experience there, but it is notable how far apart Currys role in the NCAA was from the role he is likely to play in the NBA. - Source: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/stephen-curry-1170/ ©DraftExpress"

There's always a triggered lillard fan on any Stephen Curry post lmao
"&gt;  Listen to your logic: If a player has to take breaks on defense to perform on offense, then he’s not a good defender (he may have good defense skills but he’s not helping the team on the defensive end).  Okay, so rather than refute my arguments, you've moved onto another unrelated and incorrect point.  Here's a fun fact:  FVV scored more points per possession more efficiently after Steph switched off of him.  Here's another fun fact:  Kyle Lowry scored fewer points per possession on lower efficiency when Steph switched onto him.  Steph is not an elite defender, I never made that argument.  But people who argue he's a bad defender don't watch his defense and don't understand how much your brain matters on that end.  &gt;  I’m not saying he’s terrible on defense, but he’s not a top 10 isolation defender just because some metrics rank him top 10.  Actually he's pretty good.  In the history of the finals, no player has ever been targeted as much on switches as Stephen Curry.  And there's a reason for that, it roughs him up and tires him for the other end, it's a strategy that works.  But in isolation in the playoffs (think LeBron and Harden) he actually held them to fewer points per possession on lower efficiency with more turnovers than their averages.  People think because they hunt him that he's a bad defender.  They hunt him so he doesn't drop 40 points in 22 shots on offense.  They hunt him because their other options were Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston etc.  He does particularly well against stronger, taller players because he's stronger than he has any right to be and a low center of gravity relative to them.  People like JR Smith embarrass themselves trying to take advantage of that ""mismatch"".  Does that mean he's going to stop LeBron a meaningful amount?  No, he needs serious helpside to guard a 6'8 monster like LBJ.  But he does a pretty good job of holding his ground until help rotates or steering him into more defenders."

"Stephen Curry. I loved him when he was getting very good and won his MVP, and then I got tired or he got more cocky. Or so I thought…I now realize he is in fact not cocky, he’s just that damn happy when he makes a three. He genuinely loves what he’s doing and I shouldn’t fault him for it."
"Yeah what the fuck is up with that? I hate it so much. I see the same thing on youtube. They all try to play like Curry, keyword try because they edit out all the fails.

"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"
"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
"First of all they were already a dynasty, I don't know what else you consider 5 finals trips in a row with 3 championships.   The ""window"" for another Warriors championship is nowhere near closed.  Last season despite the absolute **trash** roster construction Stephen Curry lead the league in scoring, saw crazy defensive schemes all loaded up on him all the time, with a team who posted one of the all time lowest offensive ratings in the modern era whenever Curry wasn't on the floor.   Draymond's defensive numbers were as good as ever and his assists and playmaking were as good as they've ever been.   They also have 4 young prospects on cost controlled rookie deals with high upside. Jordan Poole has already gone from worst player getting minutes in the league to someone who looks like a future 6MOY winner. Wiseman and Kuminga have *elite* physical tools, Moody has a great feel for the game and is already pretty skilled.   The Warriors literally took two years off and ended up drafting their future stars. The Joe Lacob ""Bridge to the Future"" shit is actually real.   The Warriors roster construction is **significantly** better this season, they've brought in the shooting they were missing, they've retooled their coaching staff bringing in some of the best player development coaches in the world in.  Warriors haters like your salty ass are going to be crying for literally years to come. Their window is simply jammed open right now."
Stephen Curry because no 3pt line.
&gt;I'm guessing when it's the Finals you can't just chuck up 3's and need to play the game more seriously even if you got the two best shooters.  * Most career 3-pointers in the Finals: Stephen Curry * Most 3-pointers in a Finals game: Stephen Curry * Most 3-pointers in a Finals series: Stephen Curry * Highest 3PM per game in a Finals series: Stephen Curry * Highest 3PT% in a Finals series with at least 5 3PA per game: Klay Thompson * Highest 3PT% in a Finals series with at least 10 3PA per game: Stephen Curry * Highest TS% with at least 25+ PPG: Klay Thompson  Your argument doesn't add up lol.
"Yeah, he misses wide open threes sometimes, as is expected of any basketball player..  ..not named Stephen Curry."
"Ok, I didn’t think this needed to be said, but the thing Steph has that Joe doesn’t is volume. Both kyrie and Steph are extremely talented volume scorers. Both are historically great. Just because the cavs beat the warriors once everybody wants to go on and on about how kyrie Irving is their pops. Yes, it was fucking fantastic, historic performances typically are. Stephen Curry is a slightly better finisher, that’s my argument, if you tell me to go watch Kyries highlights then I’ll just say go watch Steph’s. Also, ok great, so what lebron defended Steph? Kyrie has been held to bad outings by good defenders, the nba isn’t frozen in the 2016 finals."
"&gt;Others, however, believe having two non-shooters on the court is too crippling for an offense, even with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, to overcome, particularly in the postseason.  This is the correct assessment"
or wont be disappointed drafting 2 point guards and passed on Stephen Curry.
"Excuse me? I'm sure Stephen Curry is a nice guy but he won't stand for this lol, he's going to try to get Mike James cut when he plays him"
Stephen Curry
"I'll give you the defense excerpt except I'd trust Magic to stop more people than Stephen Curry. Furthermore i'm not going to bring up the steals he averaged simply because the playstyle back then was different. It's like me saying Harden leading the league in steals is impressive when it's not.   &gt; Superteam  Lol, you cannot use this as an excuse against Curry"
"Wasn't it Draymond who recruited KD? Also, Stephen Curry would still hold the unaminous MVP season and also one of the best Non-MVP seasons just last year"
"Warriors are coasting right now because of their easy schedule. Probably will miss the playoffs this season again  their baby-faced assassin won a scoring title on 65% TS and they still got clapped by Memphis and missed the playoffs   Playoff Appearances after KD left: 0  Lottery Appearances after KD left: 2  Stephen “Pippen” Curry will probably get a pity MVP this year, squeeze into the playoffs via play-in and get bounced by some scrub team like Utah lmaoo"
It's inspirational to see Kevin Durant left playing with Stephen Curry to try to win a championship on a team with no other allstars.
"[The Warriors-Bucks trade in 2012](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2815838-stephen-curry-andrew-bogut-trade-killed-by-bucks-in-2012-over-ankle-concerns) is in this same category.  The Warriors wanted Bogut and offered a package of players and let the Bucks choose either Monta Ellis or Steph Curry in return. Bucks medical staff advised not to take Curry.  Curry, Giannis, Middleton woulda been nice."
I don't wanna edit my post but this is probably the most suprising one so far.      - LeBron James is shooting 48.3% from long range and making 4.7 threes per game.   - Stephen Curry is shooting 40.0% from long range and making 4.5 threes per game.

"Except the Warriors can be centered around Stephen Curry and be a title contender. We've seen it before KD and I think we will see it after KD.  It's not an either or.  And what about all the downsides to KD? The constant drama? The team chemistry clearly suffered and was awful that last year. Remember that fucked up Clippers series? If KD hadn't been checked out, if the team handles their business, maybe the injury doesn't happen, maybe the season ends differently.   That's speculation so who knows but I had less fun watching the Warriors every year KD was on the team and I was frankly relieved when he finally signed somewhere else."
"The Warriors entire system is one Stephen Curry, without him they had the worst offense in the NBA when he was out, they've also been a contender for a long time and have not had to develop players since like 2015 hence why the development staff change"
"I got your back Cavs fan, while part me of course was excited by such a talented player joining the team I wish he had never signed with the Warriors. My reasons are mostly selfish, I loved the home grown Warriors an Stephen Curry and I felt KD coming diminished that aspect of the team.   What a rematch 2017 would have been."
One of the greatest shooters of all time and Stephen Curry.
"There was a thread asking whether it was time to be genuinely concerned about Stephen Curry when he started slowly last season. Right the very next game, he dropped 62 on Portland. Ever since that, the thread has entered r/nba lore, even if the creator deleted it."
"There was a post after the first 2 games of the 2020-21 season asking if ""It's time to be concerned about Stephen Curry"".     Steph and the Warriors had been blown out by 26 and 39 points in those games with Curry shooting just 4/20 from three and 13/38 overall. People were questioning if he'd past his prime and if he was getting exposed as someone who wasnt good without all-time great shooters like Klay and KD supposedly diverting attention from him.      Steph quickly put those 'concerns' to bed scoring 93 points in his next 3 games before exploding in the fourth game for a new career high 62 points against Portland."
"Damian Lillard has a difficult start to the season, but with a player of this level, we know very well that it only takes one thing for him to catch fire again and give us an impressive series.  Stephen Curry had known that at the beginning of last season. We know what happened next."

Ain’t nothing better than a Stephen Curry masterclass performance man I tell you… some of the most fun basketball you’ll witness because the team and fans feed off that crazy ass energy and it makes the Warriors SUPER dangerous
Watching Stephen Curry play basketball is one of the highlights of my week. The man is the single greatest offensive player I’ve ever seen in my life.
Stephen Curry is not human
No shame in losing to this Stephen curry performance we showed grit and got the game close at the end
IS IT TIME TO BE LEGITIMATELY WORRIED ABOUT STEPHEN CURRY?
Stephen WARDELL Curry.   Remember the name.
Anyone trying to deny that Stephen Curry is not the greatest shooter of all time at this point it’s just plain delusional
Now it’s time to be legitimately concerned about stephen curry
I LOVE STEPHEN WARDELL CURRY
"He has done that previously tho, has he not? Remember early last year when we ""should be worried about Stephen Curry""."
"Iggy looks so rejuvenated.   Also, Wardell Stephen Curry gave me 50 fantasy points in the 1st quarter."
"Correct. Bob McAdoo and Dominique Wilkins.  3 guys made it in, but weren't on the original list and were mid career. Dennis Rodman, Reggie Miller and Gary Payton.  There were other guys in the league / rookies but obviously didn't have enough resume, since it was 1996/97. That gets Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.  Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce were another year or two away and Dwayne Wade was a few more years.  The rest of the new list is all active. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook.  No real issues maybe other than Davis and Lillard, how do they stack up against full career Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Vince Carter and especially nearly full career Dwight Howard who seems a glaring omission. Does Grant Hill get any leeway for what he should've become and proved he could be (although for not long enough)?  Anyone likely a lock for this in 25 years when they do 100 years? Doncic? Jokic? Embiid? T. Young? Tatum?"

Jordan Poole and Stephen Curry had an amazing game. These Warriors are going to be really hard to compete with if this is the beginning without Thompson.
"Bro, not even a little. The need is a big man and hopefully Wiseman fills that.  The Warriors are *very* happy to stand pat right now. They have a very young, very high ceiling prospect in Kuminga, they have a guy in Moody who may actually contribute a little this season based on his skillset and feel for the game, Wiseman has clearly put on muscle in the off season, Poole has shown that even against a a great defense like the Lakers, on a bum ankle, he can be that guy he was showing glimpses of at the end of last season and again here in the preseason.   The Warriors feel like they are in a very good spot right now, they really like their draft picks and so do I. Belli *closed* the game and it was glorious. His shooting threat and play making ability next to Stephen Curry? It carved up the Lakers a couple times in that last 4 minutes.   This Warriors team is only going to get better. If they can stay healthy they will be a scary team. Look at how Curry shot and the Warriors still closed out this game. And LeBron was carrying and AD was feasting on the Dubs lack of size.   I liked what I saw this game."
"Exactly. When a guy of that caliber goes 5/21, he got shutdown. It’s Stephen Curry, he’s obviously more than his points and his threat (even at 0/10) on the court is colossal. Yet, when you hold him to 5/21 for 21 points that’s about as close to shutdown as you’ll get."
Is it time to be concerned about Stephen Curry?
Does James Corden’s son have a secret hand shake with Stephen Curry
"Certainly didn’t go into that thinking that in a game featuring LeBron, Westbrook, and Draymond that Stephen Curry would be the only one walking out with a triple double"
Guys I think it's time to start being concerned about Stephen Curry

"Speaking for just the 538 model here, and it's that [they're not confident Klay will be back to top form](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-bucks-run-it-back-can-lebron-win-his-fifth-ring-how-our-model-sees-the-2021-22-nba-season/).  It also looks like [Curry has a wider variance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/stephen-curry/), possibly in part due to the change in the rules for drawing fouls.  &gt; We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.5 **RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player**. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with **only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives**, among the team’s projected rotation players."
"Charlie and Mac are totally the two I see advocating for Ben in my head episode.  Episode starts with the gang making plans to go to a 76ers game. Dee making some comment about Barry Simons, to which they’ll all in unison say ‘Shutup bird!’  Queue long drawn out argument about how the 3pter and metrics have changed the game, Dennis arguing until is face is bright red while Mac and Charlie advocate for ‘driving to the basket and fundamentals’ and Frank chimes in with comments about things like ‘we didn’t even have a 3 pointer in the good days, guys like *insert obscure player who frank is a fan of*’ Charlie all shrill *I don’t know he’s the point guard it’s not his job to shoot 3s it’s his job to pass it’  *insert title card* “The Gang Gets Analytical” or something  The next several scenes will deal with various stadium humor, like trough bathrooms, stale nachos, poor parking, etc. As they’re parking or driving there they argue about how some players will shoot an open 3 instead of driving the basket and Frank will chime in with something like ‘in my day you’d be fired for that. Next day!’ And Dennis arguing til he’s red again that some players are so good at 3s that a wide open 3 is better than a dunk. Then the ending…  *76ers are down 1 point with several seconds left to go, a fastbreak starts and they swing it to the corner for an open 3. It clanks off the rim and the opposing team cherry picks a dunk on the other end leaving Philly with .7 seconds to throw up a prayer which doesn’t go in*  *the gang in unison* ‘He should have drove to the basket for 2!’ ‘See this is what your analytics get you Dennis, you lose games by passing up the open 2.’ ‘Well Mac not everyone can be Steve Curry’ ‘it’s Stephen Curry Charlie…’  *insert credits &amp; roll jingle*"
And Shaq is the black Stephen Curry
"You’re on crack If you’re about to compare Ray Allen to Terry Rozier! Christ, this is dumb. Ray Allen has led a bunch of teams far in the playoffs as the number one stop saying 10th seed crap, like that was all the time. You have no clue what the hell you are even talking about and you are so far off with your assessment on Ray Allen it’s honestly comical. Klay Thompson can’t be the number one because he can’t even create his own shot. He wouldn’t put up numbers like Ray Allen did if he was the number one option because he is not capable of doing it. He is a catch and shoot player that benefits with playing with Steph Curry. Ray Allen lead the Milwaukee bucks to the Eastern conference finals is the number one one game away from making the NBA finals, And he also lied a broken Seattle team before you got there far into the playoffs. I have no idea what you were talking about. He was seriously looked at as the best shooter of all time before Stephen Curry came along and that is why he is more comparable to Steph Curry then he is Klay Thompson. Klay Thompson can’t even get a shot off without his teammates helping. He’s a great shooter but he’s not comparable to Ray he’s more comparable to old Ray Allen because that’s what really old round turn this game into, but prime Ray Allen, hell no, that’s the dumbest take I have ever heard. Like I said you clearly have no idea what you were talking about and just saying dumb shit"
I have sources telling me it turns Stephen Curry on and is directly related to his PPG for that night.

"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
Stephen Wardell Curry
"Missing: Wardell Stephen Curry II, since 11/30/2021"
mismatch? thats all-nba defender Stephen Wardell Curry. Ayton should be happy Curry did not use his gravity to force a miss
We'll stop worrying about referees once teams can't get away with absolutely mauling Stephen Curry.
Mikalcartaz Prison   Patient #00987682  Wardell Stephen Curry II
Stephen “Jordan Poole” Curry
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
Point blank period. Wiggins' play gets a mixed reception from his own fanbase. I doubt he'd move the needle enough to offset the effect of one Wardell Stephen Curry II. That man is ascending. I'm excited to see him tonight.
Stephen “Bones” Curry
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
stephen curry is a disgrace i tell you
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"&gt; It’s no coincidence that the Warriors went 15-50 in 2018-19, when Stephen Curry missed all but five games with a broken hand  Wrong year. He only played 5 games in 2019-2020"
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
But what about 3 stephen curry tho
We just faced stephen curry twice in a row adam silver needs to hear about this there’s no more parity in the league

FUCKING STEPHEN CURRY AGAIN
"Everybody did not have the KD's growing up and they were never nearly as popular as Jordans. People who don't care about basketball/sneakers don't really own KDs. Your average anyone might have a pair of Jordans.  Also, your mom, sister, and cousin in a different country would know about Stephen Curry. KD is not as much of a household name like that. When you ask someone who knows nothing about basketball - who are some NBA players you know? the 4 most common answers will be Kobe, Lebron, Steph, and Jordan."
"Dude no matter how you look at it, leaving Stephen Curry wide open is never going to be a viable strategy. Those percentages mean nothing, there’s so many variables that come into play in every shot somebody takes. When Curry is taking those tightly contested shots it’s more than likely in the middle of a hot streak.   I hope your team tries this strategy tho."
"Stephen curry is cool, I respect him a lot. Know who I don’t respect? Coleman Trebor"
Stephen Curry is unstoppable I fear

"I think CP3 and an obscure fella named Stephen Curry might have something to say about that  EDIT: I stand corrected, Steph is quite big for a PG at 6'3"
"leave him open, he's only shooting 35.6% on open triples  /s.  It'll stabilize, he'll shoot worse on tightly covered shots and better on open shots.    I think Steph gets away with a lot, looking at the [clip from this theringer article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/11/29/22807223/seven-observations-stephen-curry-kristap-porzingis-julius-randle) of Steph setting picks they mostly look illegal to me.

It happens every playoffs and while he's still great he's not quite as otherworldly once you spend game after game in his jersey."

That's why we get the takes like ""Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry?"" or the post about the suns being 1-3. Fans who've been around for a while know to at least wait 10 games before making any kind of judgement on the state of a team, especially for ones who got wrecked by injuries like you guys.  Yeah considering the Nugs injuries, Jazz's consistent failures in the postseason and the lack of playoff experience from teams like the Bulls I think the 4 teams you mentioned are the ones with real championship potential. Obviously there are some dark horses like Heat or Clippers if Kawhi returns before the playoffs, but I'm pretty confident facing any other team.

"Parker was the motor of that offense, his impact on that end was equally important as Duncan anchoring the defense. When Parker had a good game the Spurs was very tough to beat. And you're talking about ""somewhat inefficiently"", lol Parker around the rim could finish at 60 to 65%, a frenchie midget had a higher percentage than Duncan himself as a 6'11 PF. Like I said, if Parker never lead that team, if he never earned a FMVP, then the argument of him ridding on Duncan's tailcoat would be more reasonable, but that's simply not true. Lillard could never be the 3rd best player and then work his way to become the 1st simply because he has a big ego, a ballhog who have delusions of Stephen Curry, pulling up from 40 and talking about ""dame time"" when he can't barely advance in the first rounds of the playoffs. In fact Stotts overachieved with such a weak roster, a backcourt of Lillard and CJ, no defense whatsoever, both being constantly exposed all game long. But because Lillard can occasionally hit the hero shot, that makes him a better player than Tony Parker, lol get that casual shit out of here"

"i don't know why this is getting downvoted, this take is spot on. bogut transformed the entire team, he was as instrumental in the birth of this era of warriors basketball as anyone else not named stephen (curry/kerr)  we did replace bogut, but it took entirely changing draymond into a player that could fill that hole. his role as a facilitator on one end and a rim protector/enforcer on the other - both formerly bogut jobs - has directly correlated with the decline in his own offense. people forget that in the game 7 of 2016 loss (the last dubs game of the bogut era), bogut was not playing and draymond led all scorers (with 32!)"

The problem is these guys aren't playing to their strengths. Lebron shouldn't be shooting more than 6 three pointers in a game. AD and RW shouldn't be shooting more than 2 three pointers in a game. These guys should focus on points in the paint primarily and if that doesn't work then focus on the mid range game because points in the paint emphasizes their size and athleticism advantage on most matchups.    You can't shoot threes like you are Klay Thompson or Stephen Curry.  Lebron is average to decent at three point efficiency and AD and RW are god awful at three point efficiency. It's a wasted possession unless you are completely open for both AD and RW taking a three.

It's definitely subjective I can tell you appreciate him but personally his game doesn't stick out to me. He reminds me a lot of cp3 tbh. Very solid pg that plays his roll for his team it's all nice but he definitely lacks the flair of a Ja Morant or Stephen Curry.
Is it time to be legitimately worried about Stephen Curry?
First name STEPHEN last name CURRY!!!!
Curry of Stephen my mvp
I love Stephen Curry
Just got out of Thai prison. Is Stephen Curry the best player in the NBA?  Wait…
14 months ago people were saying Stephen Curry is just as good if not better than CJ. Please stop comparing Curry to CJ. Curry is not even close to CJ’s level. CJ is a transcendent player. Curry is not. The Blazers have to trade Lillard if they are serious about contending for a championship.
and the warriors have stephen fucking curry
That’s a picture of Stephen Curry…   Of the Warriors…
Did I not set the table when I said this is a very unpopular opinion?  I've been a warriors fan since I started following the team in the mid 90's as a kid... I think I'm welcome to my opinion.  I will not deny that the guy plays a great role... I just think he steals a lot of credit for being the reason the team is good.  Here's another opinion that people may disagree with:  Stephen Curry is underrated. He's WAY better than people give him credit for. And I think he's underrated simply because people like to hate the Warriors... because they're that good.
"I personally was surprised lillard made the list. The more you look it’s not too surprising. I think the argument for lillard is he is 17th all time in points per game, and if we’re talking about guards he’s in the top ten all time and he’s done it for a decade. His resume is worthy of making the list. Playing in the era of Stephen curry has overshadowed what he’s done."

"Totals is a shit measure of longevity objectively, no matter how you define longevity, which is the ONLY ambiguous and subjective part as it encompasses years, durability, career consistency, and actual performance as a scorer scored within basketball games. And it's still shit for all of them. Context is the most important thing behind any statistic, and totals lacks any context behind those variables that underpin it, and that is the root of its problem in trying to measure anything. You have no idea where the points are coming from, how much is attributed to each variable, only that these players have accumulated these points, under vastly different circumstances, career trajectories etc.  * if you weighed injury resistance heavily as longevity you have players who struggle to stay on the court (Chris Paul no.45) outperforming players who are ironmen (John Stockton no.49).   * If you weigh years played heavily as longevity you have players (Bob Petit no.40) outperforming players who played half the years of others (Scottie Pippen no.62)  * If you weigh consistent performance over a long period of time heavily you still have no way of discerning from totals whether someone was a truly great scorer for a long time (James Harden no.32) or was simply an above-average scorer who played forever (Ray Allen no.24). Also see Kevin Durant vs almost everyone above him.  * It doesn't tell you anything about career consistency. Eg. over 80% of Wilts points were accumulated before he hit 30 (over 9 seasons), he averaged 18ppg in his remaining seasons 30 - 36. yet he's 7th in all time scoring purely because he averaged almost 40ppg over 9 seasons. Meanwhile Dirk who is right next to him maintained a consistent level of performance over a long period of time.  And the result of this shitshow is so easily demonstrated by removing player names and comparing stats, example:   * Player A - 19711 points total (no.49). Player B - 18713 points total (no.63). who's the better longevity scorer? Most people would pick A.   * I'll divulge more stats: Player A averaged between 14 - 23 points per 100 possessions over 20 seasons. Player B - averaged between 23.1 - 44 points per 100 possessions over 13 seasons. Literally zero overlap in scoring. Who's the better longevity scorer? almost everyone would change their pick to Player B now. These 2 ppl btw are John Stockton and Stephen Curry.  Moving onto Lebron, Lebron has essentially recorded more points per 100 possessions than Kareem every year, every phase of their career. Now late in his 30s, Lebron is recording a full 10 points per 100 possessions more than Kareem at the same phase of their career. Lebron is already the more accomplished longevity scorer by any objective observer. And this again goes all the way back to the problem of points total, Kareem despite scoring less in every stage of his career has more total points simply because he played more games. Has nothing to do with his prowess as a scorer, nothing to do with his ability to sustain his level better, absolutely nothing to do with performance, and given both players have played 19+ seasons, clearly nothing to do with ""longevity"", it's simply a matter of running the numbers and playing the requisite number of games.    Same thing with Jordan. The man averaged more points per 100 possession aged 38 than Kareem ever did in his career. He's scored an order of magnitude more than Kareem ever did at any stage of their careers. The man also played 15 seasons, stretching from 21-39. He's a better scorer longevity wise than Kareem. It's pretty clear the only reason he didn't pass Kareem when he retired is because he decided not to chill on the wizards for longer, or stay on after the second 3peat.   TLDR: This whole points total thing is dumb no matter what angle or definition you look at it. It's even dumber when you consider the public's fixation with it as some great measure of longevity. If you still don't get it at this point, all I can say is good luck, have a nice day, and your job that requires any critical thinking. Ciao"
Jose Calderon made his first 84 free throws in 2008-09 on his way to setting the record for best FT% in a season (98.1% on 154-of-157).  Micheal Williams made 83 straight to end the 1992-93 season as part of a 97 make streak that is the longest in NBA history across multiple seasons.  Tony Snell set the record for most free throws in a season without a miss with 32 in 2019-20. Jeremy Lamb is now tied with Stephen Curry (also 2019-20 when he played just 5 games) for the second most in a season without a miss.

[ESPN] How much help does Stephen Curry need?
Stephen Curry gravity ™
"OK, I'm sorry but are you seriously saying the Warriors might need to win *less?* They are just over .500, the point differential is still poor, they've got a couple good wins in game 2 of these two game series and a win over a dysfunctional Kings team.   This Warriors team still has a big problem with it's offense with the starting unit, which is crazy when these dudes share a floor with Stephen Curry. Half of that is Wiseman is an inexperienced rookie 19 year old, and half of that is Oubre being where offensive possessions go to die.   Against some teams Wiseman will be able to more effective but the truth is Wiseman's development will take time. His ceiling is very high though. I think if they stay healthy, never a guarantee in this league, they could be like a 6 or 7 seed and avoid the play in. Even if the pick conveys to OKC we'll likely get a decent prospect with the Wolves pick and a lot will depend on how Klay comes back and how Dray and Steph hold up throughout a season. I'm kind of glad that this season is shortened, I hope they keep the shortened seasons going forward."

That's a .783 win percentage and is the third-best all time among 78 players to record at least 100 30-point games. The only players who have a better percentage are Larry Bird and Hal Greer, according to Elias Sports Bureau research."""

"I'm reminded of the story where Stephen Jackson saw Duncan getting grilled by Pop and realized that if Timmy isn't say shit, he can't either.   I could see Steph doing something similar.

curry has wiggins and oubre westbrook had sobonos and olodipo and stephen adams
I don't even think we have to get the 5th seed and he average 35. MVP is mostly narrative based and the lowest seed to win MVP is 6th   Stephen Curry carrying this ragtag bunch to the playoffs after being **so** bad last season and him missing essentially the entire season is an MVP narrative the media can get behind. He'll have the numbers of an MVP to tie it all together
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Stephen Curry. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Stephen Curry. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."

I don't agree with the height stuff... Stephen Curry is an elite off-ball player and the GSW offense really flows when he plays offball (of course they have Draymond Green) I know that they're not the same height but still that doesn't mean Trae Young can't play offball
"too tall, too slow (for soccer). maybe a center forward or defender, but probably a keeper. most nba players could probably end up as great keepers, tbh (i think they would lack the necessary speed of turn and agility to have a chance at outfield positions). nimble, smaller guys isaiah thomas, nate robinson or allen iverson would have an excellent chance, though. stephen curry too, considering pogba (6'3) is taller than him, or someone that could reach a nice top speed and use their body like lukaku can or drogba could."

"That’s the one! I knew it was bad because the only person they cheered was Mullin lol.

He's exactly the guy they need to get to true contention and exactly the guy the Warriors will never give up so long as Stephen Curry is on the roster.

Defense isn't just getting blocks or steals, it's rebounding, it's contesting, it's switching these stuff don't show up on the stat sheets   And Draymond can score 0 points for all I care, Draymond isn't on the team to provide scoring for Stephen Curry he can handle the scoring by himself he is there because he can lock up"

When Stephen Curry doesn't miss he hits all his shots
Draymond has more assists than Stephen Curry
"NBA Finals games and playoff games impress me more than regular season games.  Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the NBA Finals and there are better regular season players than him in the league.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving are better than Wardell Stephen Curry II. Two regular season games against the Blazers and Kings doesn’t change anything."
"Clearly Stephen Curry is washed, he is down 32 points, I think we should trade him for Ricky Rubio /s"
It’s a regular season game against a Luke Walton coached team. Not impressive at all. Embarrassing post. I would like to watch Wardell Stephen Curry II play well in an NBA Finals.
Turns out Stephen Curry is in fact a great player.
Stephen Curry basically the entirety of February 2016
"[Charania] Klay Thompson on who’s a better scorer: Him or GSW's Stephen Curry. “I don’t compare myself with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of him putting up 37 in one quarter. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Thompson said."
"Curry didn't win FMVP for a reason other than it was just rigged. In Game 1, he got outplayed by a hobbled Kyrie and even got his clutchtime layup pinned against the backboard by Kyrie, sending the game to OT. Kyrie got injured in OT and the Cavs lost.  [https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/\_/id/13034857/nba-finals-stephen-curry-ot-air-ball-punctuates-5-23-struggle](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/_/id/13034857/nba-finals-stephen-curry-ot-air-ball-punctuates-5-23-struggle)  In Game 2, Curry shot 5-23, looked off all night despite having to play his 4th straight playoff series where the opposing team's starting Point Guard was injured (Jrue, Mike Conley, Pat Bev then Kyrie) and he also *airballed* the game winner in OT.   People who watched the 2015 Finals remember that Curry was playing like shit (partly due to Delladova) until the last, like, 2 minutes of Game 3 where he banged a couple of three-pointers at the end... but by that time the game was already over and the Cavs were up 2-1.  Then he was decent shooting wise for the rest of the series, especially in Game 5 where he had about 37. **The problem is that the game turned around in Game 4 due to Iggy starting in the Death Lineup full time (and not Curry's play), which led people to believe the turning point of the series was due to Iggy's impact on LeBron (and it arguably was), while Curry played below his standards for about half the series.**   That's why Curry wasn't the frontrunner for FMVP instead of Iggy, and why the voters conspired to vote for *Iggy* to ensure a GSW player won FMVP instead of LeBron, and they didn't conspire to vote for Curry. If Curry played better &amp; made his impact on the game more felt when the series actually turned around, they woulda conspired to vote for him and not Iggy."
"I WANT MY CHIPS WITH SOME MFING CHIPS  PUT YOURSELF IN THAT MVP CONVERSATION, WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY III"
Yes.  Matthew Dellavedova  didn’t put clamps on Wardell Stephen Curry II. Wardell Stephen Curry II is the worst Finals performer of all time. Was 5 straight finals not enough to realize Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the Finals?
"Dellavedova shut Curry/Warriors down in the 2015 Finals    &gt; Stephen Curry missed an NBA Finals-record 13 3-point field goals (courtesy of Elias Sports Bureau) in Game 2, in large part thanks to Dellavedova's defense. Curry was 0-for-8 when guarded by Dellavedova on Sunday, including 0-for-5 from 3-point range, his worst shooting performance against a defender in any game this postseason. - [source](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F0608%2FFSNBAFINALSDellavedovadefense.jpg&amp;w=570&amp;format=jpg)   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Overall, Dellavedova held the Warriors to 3-for-15 shooting, including 0-for-6 from 3-point range, and forced six turnovers as a primary defender in Game 2. That's the most turnovers forced by a Cavaliers player in a game this postseason, and only Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton have forced more turnovers as the primary defender in any game this postseason.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; In the fourth quarter and overtime, the Warriors shot 1-for-6 from the field and turned the ball over three times with Dellavedova as the primary defender; the Warriors shot 8-for-18 and turned it over once when guarded by anyone else in the half court over that same span.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Although this number is expected to be high since he was guarding Curry, it’s worth pointing out that Dellavedova contested 11 shots in Game 2, more than any other Cavaliers player."
"Jealousy - I don't like Stephen Curry, because he is so good and not on my team.   Insecurity - I don't like Danuel House Jr., because of the stupid shit he did during playoff bubble. Insecurity, because where I was living at that time, everything and everyone was on lockdown. Couldn't really go out without a good reason. Like him, I was tired of satisfying myself with a rub and was horny af. Him breaking protocol when I'm dealing with the same shit pissed me off, so I flamed him. That pissed me off more than him messing up his team and possibly endangering them.  Boredom - Lol everybody don't like Pat Bev, so I join too."
I’d take current Kyrie Irving over both if I want to win a championship.   Wardell Stephen Curry II and Russell Westbrook suck in the NBA Finals.
LeBron James got swept by Kevin Durant in the Finals that year. Who considers that one of LeBron’s biggest carry jobs of his career? Embarrassing.  That’s like believing Wardell Stephen Curry II was a top 2 player in the NBA in 2015 and 2016. You can’t ignore the NBA Finals.
"idk bro it might just be me but losing Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson sounds worse than losing Kyrie or Chris Bosh."
"James Wiseman and Stephen Curry turning into Michael Jordan now, they took that personal"
"In 6 games, Stephen Curry has surpassed Tomáš Satoranský's total points in the 2016-2017 season by FORTY."
Stephen curry is too good. I would love to see Trae have his confidence.
The Warriors won't have a good enough record but he could easily be top five or even top three depending on his level of play this season.  Stephen Curry's height was 2016 and it was crazy. He doesn't seem to have lost a step physically. Draymond is back in the lineup.  Frankly as a longtime Curry fan I'm expecting it.
stephen curry did it first
Yeah. These were the odds   Luka Doncic +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo +425 Stephen Curry +500 LeBron James +700 Anthony Davis +700 James Harden +800 Kawhi Leonard +900 Kevin Durant +1000

Somebody should give them a lecture on it.  How about this gentleman named Stephen Curry?
[Never forget](https://www.fastcompany.com/3059043/stephen-curry-is-a-god-this-chart-proves-it)
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
"It's weird to me that in another universe, we'd be calling Steph Curry ""Dell Curry Jr."" Both of them are named Wardell Stephen Curry, but Steph goes by his middle name instead of Dell Jr.   DCJ?"
"Idk man, hard to discredit [this](https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2016/05/10/stephen-curry-mvp-season-golden-state-warriors-history). The individual performance accompanied with winning by achieving the greatest regular season record ever, 73-9, holds it own."
"Too bad both of them suck during the playoffs. Wardell Stephen Curry II is probably the worst NBA Finals performer of all time.  Kyrie Irving is better than both. He doesn’t choke when it matters, unlike the other two."
“These days age 32 seems like age 22.”   Why would you even write that? Embarrassing.  I would like to watch Wardell Stephen Curry II drop at least 40 points in an NBA Finals game and win the game. He’s a regular season player lol.
&gt; Kyrie Irving is a better offensive player than Wardell Stephen Curry II  &gt; I watch basketball games    You sure about that?
"Stephen ""2nd most efficient 20ppg playoff scorer of all time, averaged 10.8 PPG on 75TS in 2015 Finals 4Qs (the best 4Q finals performance ever), 27/6/6 averages in the finals and 10th all time in Finals scoring average"" Curry doesn't show up in the finals? Lmao okay"
"Media personalities, but switch Kevin Durant and James Harden. Kyrie Irving is a better offensive player than Wardell Stephen Curry II too.   What an embarrassing post man. My opinion is not based on other people’s opinion. I watch basketball games and ignore the media clowns."
James Harden has never beat Stephen Curry in a playoff series.
Who cares man it’s just the regular season. Wardell Stephen Curry doesn’t show up in the Finals.   I didn’t even watch this lame game. I was too busy watching the Washington Football Team win the NFC East. Why bother watching two teams that will most likely lose in the first round..... Embarrassing
6:18		Draymond Green misses 26-foot three point jumper	  6:17		Stephen Curry offensive rebound	  6:17		Stephen Curry makes two point shot  6:17		Derrick Jones Jr. shooting foul
But is it time to be legitimately concern about Stephen Curry?
Steph full name is Wardell Stephen Curry II and dell curry is Wardell Stephen Curry

Who do you prefer Stephen curry or Stephen curry with a 40 inch vertical? Seems obvious to me
Stephen Curry was never on the Cavs. Only played against them
"Stephen ""Admiral Fujitora"" Curry"
I’ve also noticed that Lebron fans despise Stephen Curry to a remarkable degree.
"Yes, when Stephen Curry secure a 3-peat starting by sweeping the Milwaukee Bucks in the finals this summer he will cement his legacy as GOAT over LeBron and Bald Fraud MJ."
"Yo, KLove earned that ring guarding Stephen Curry one-on-one in Game 7."
Wow im love stephen curry
You can name 50 players all time that you’d rather have on your team than Stephen Curry? Okay let’s hear it
"The difference between all the people you listed and Jackson is that most of them are all much more famous  than Jackson. Mark wahlberg for example, is a piece of shit. We know. But big actors are always gonna be more famous than a non-star NBA player. So they're going to get more attention and relevance. Their fuck ups are more newsworthy for most outlets than any basketball players fuck up because people that don't give a shit about basketball don't know who stephen Jackson is. They know who mark wahlberg is. Obviously this is a basketball subreddit. So we know more about these players than the general public. But the general population aren't die hard fans and the media (outside of sports media) isn't paying attention to anyone in the NBA that isn't LeBron, curry, etc.  Your argument might hold weight somewhere else. But in a basketball subreddit, most of us know more about basketball players and news than the average person. I know Wahlberg beat the shit out of an Asian guy when he was young. I don't really know much else about the guy and I don't care to. That's how most people view Jackson outside of the NBA fanbase."
Is 2x NBA MVP Stephen Curry WASHED?
I'm not kidding mate   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/warriors/amp/Keith-Smart-s-Stephen-Curry-s-mind-meld-2460355.php

"Everyone can’t dunk for fucks sake. Everyone can’t just jump over a bunch of seven footers and slam the basketball in the basket, otherwise they would. we aren’t talking about their abilities in an empty gym for gods sake.   Fact of the matter is that Giannis has been more effective and scored more points the last three seasons, on top of being a massively better defender and rebounder, who even cares if he is lethal from anywhere? Points are points whether your Stephen Curry shooting threes or Shaq dunking on people."
"I'm not saying the Warriors are title favorites this year, but Lebron's favorite hobby is losing to Stephen Curry. You have to be delusional to take the Lakers in a 7 game series when Lebron is 1-3 against his father."
"My dream experience is no commentary, no video, nothing to get in the way of the Audible Stimulus. Sneakers squeaking, ball being dribbled on the hardwood, draymond’s “ANNNND ONEEE” as he drives. Nothing beats it.   I close my eyes and imagine I’m Eric Paschall. I just bullied my way through your team’s big, slow center. I feel something, a warm hand on my left buttock. I turn around, it’s Stephen Curry, gazing at me in admiration. I open my eyes again"

That’s not the full story. https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2815838-stephen-curry-andrew-bogut-trade-killed-by-bucks-in-2012-over-ankle-concerns.amp.html
[He says he regretted joining the warriors after he started getting backlash](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)  [Sources said that KD was tired of being behind LeBron](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-kevin-durant-wants-be-seen-better-lebron-james) the sources said KD was tired of always being number 2. That hold weight because [Durant himself has said he’s tired of always being second](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover.amp.html)  Just using context you can come to the conclusion that he wants to prove he’s better then LeBron and he was never going to prove it by playing with the Nets
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
Lol Stephen Curry got so much more defensive attention than KD it isn’t even funny.
"&gt; Even in today's game where basically any 3-pointer is seen as at least a relatively good shot, to pull up in this situation, down two with 23 seconds to play, with **no chance for an offensive rebound** should you miss because none of your guys have even crossed half court yet, is a bad decision for anyone not named Stephen Curry or Damian Lillard.       Author then proceeds to post a video where Atlanta indeed did get an offensive rebound. Well, not rebound per se, but they kept the possession of the ball. What a clown. Had Trae hit that shot, and he eventually will hit those shots routinely as he progresses his career throughout the years, he'd be a badass hero, deservedly so."
"Timberwolves fan, how did you react to your FO passing on Stephen Curry while picking 2 inferior point guards before him"
"Top 10 NBA players  (in order).   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić.  The Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the NBA."
"LeBron, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Christian Wood, Stephen Curry"
"I mean Luka has been playing with not a great roster so far this season. KP just came back, and we've missed Richardson, Finney-Smith, and Kleber for multiple games now.  Also, I swear people are blind and just say ""oh this person gets no criticism"" as a defense for their guy. Like there were so many posts about Luka's shooting earlier in the season. And everyone is always commenting ""idk why people act like Luka is a good shooter"" when there are no comments saying that.  Luka and Trae have both been criticized, as they both deserve to be. Luka turned it around and started winning games and averaging 30 point triple doubles as we've been accustomed to while Trae is having issues with his decision making, coaching, and teammates.  Luka was first team All-NBA, led his team to the playoffs, and performed tremendously playoffs last season even without Porzingis on the floor last year. Trae Young is a career 34% 3 point shooter being compared to Steve Nash and Stephen Curry who basically never shoot under 40% from 3. If anything, he's the one getting comparisons he hasn't earned.   EDIT: The expectation for Trae as a shooter is much more since its his supposed to be his first or second best attribute after his playmaking. Luka has his passing, IQ, finishing at the rim, that all is and was expected to be better than his shooting."
Because people compare him to Stephen Curry too much imo
"A couple years ago at the all star weekend I think an announcer, maybe at the three point contest went “we’ve got Steph curry here and we’ll donate X amount of dollars for every 3 pointer he makes!” And he missed like every single one.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-stephen-curry-had-the-all-star-stage-and-it-got-awkward-really-fast/"
Man people need to understand that Kevin Durant is *so fucking good* that one of the *best* offensive players ever in Stephen Curry was happy to take a backseat to let KD cook. The man is a once in a lifetime talent that needs to get his roses while he’s still out there.
"Here’s who I would put in that range (not in order) but criteria differs for everybody:    Kevin Garnett, Oscar Robertson, Moses Malone, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, David Robinson, Dirk Nowitzki, Julius Erving, Stephen Curry, Karl Malone    HM: Charles Barkley, Dwyane Wade, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West"

By that logic you should pick Dort over Stephen Curry or James Harden if you care about defense and fit so much.
He’s literally just a better Stephen Curry.
"538 now has RAPTOR ratings for seasons going back to 2013-14.   If you sort by offense only, the top 8 seasons are in order:   Stephen Curry, James Harden, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, James Harden, Stephen Curry.   KD has played with each of the 2 best offensive players of the last 5 years. Add in the fact that he played with Westbrook before that, and you realize that KD has literally never not played with a HoF PG."

Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA right now. Don’t sleep on Kyrie Irving winning a FMVP. He actually shows up in the Finals unlike Wardell Stephen Curry II.   The Brooklyn Nets have a chance to 4 peat. Kyrie Irving has a chance to go down as a top 25 player of all time.

"Close, was actually referring to Wardell Stephen Curry. Thought we all knew that’s what we called him"
"It really is, and while I know MVP voting is subjective his last two MVP's in particular were also insane because he polled 93.6% of available first place votes in those seasons.       I posted this earlier this week but the thread is relevant so as a point of comparison here is how some other recent back to back MVP's in history compared with percentage of first placed votes won:      - Stephen Curry, 88.5%.      - Lebron (12-13), 84.7%.      - Jordan (91-92), 81.8%.    - Giannis, 80.7%.   - Steve Nash, 48.4%.    - Tim Ducan, 47.8%.    - Magic Johnson (89-90), 39.5%"
"Couldn’t you say that Draymond, by playing a key role with the game changer Stephen Curry, helped to change the league? By being able to play elite level defense while also being a game facilitator on offense allowed the warriors to exploit opponents defense. How many times have we see the double team of Curry lead to a 4 on 3 drive by Dray that leads to an easy ally pop? A thousand?   The injury to Lee, a minus defender, opened the door for Draymond and Kerr never looked back."
Chris Paul/Stephen Curry   Westbrook/McGee
I’d trust James Wiseman taking the last shot of a game more than Wardell Stephen Curry II in the playoffs.   Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn’t born with the clutch gene. Kevin Durant can’t carry that team in crunch time anymore because he joined the Brooklyn Nets.
&gt; end of the game sums up how clutch Wardell Stephen Curry II has been his entire career  Clearly you started watching basketball this year..
Draymond Green winning the tip off against Myles Turner at the end of the game sums up how clutch Wardell Stephen Curry II has been his entire career. Aaron Holiday just stole that ball away from him. Wardell Stephen Curry II was not born with the clutch gene.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league. They were born with the clutch gene.
It's only used against Stephen Curry

"Durant left Stephen Curry to play with an immature egotistical jabroni.   Kyrie is immensely talented, but he’s also a freak show that has had issues with every organization he’s been a part of. Seems like he cares more about being a contrarian “free thinker” than he does about playing professional basketball.   I wonder if KD is starting to have misgivings about his decision."
"CJ has been amazing, but he's also getting defended like he's the second option on his team. Steph is getting defended like he's Stephen Curry.  It would be crazy if CJ is actually better than Dame this year. I don't think that will happen of course."
"I think the most underrated ""What If"" in NBA history, that was actually somewhat likely to happen too, is ""What if the Golden State Warriors completed a sign and trade for Dwight Howard signed in 2013.    They don't have the cap space to sign Igoudala, they probably end up trading Klay Thomspon to free up salary space and definitely don't run the same type of offence and have the same type of success as they did in with Stephen Curry, Pre-KD. As a result they don't truly unlock their maximum potential and different teams get an opportunity to win a championship. KD likely doesn't go to Golden State, which you could argue sparked the current player empowerment era, and the NBA over these last 5 years looks completely different."

Depsite his 62 he's not as sharp as he usually is. But he's not alone. Long offseason and playing in empty gym weird circumstances. League has also had years to study Stephen Curry in large amount of playoff games. He's as studied an offensive player as exists today. And due to physical stature he can be effectively schemed with the right personnel. Combine this with him getting a bit older I think we can expect more hot and cold nights from him going forward. Doesn't mean he won't be efffective. Likewise when he gets his dude back next season all bets are off.

"According to [Basketball-Reference HOF probability](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html), Kevin Love has a higher chance of making it right now.  Grant Hill had an amazing college career with 2 championships on top of his great NBA career, where people debated if he would have been better than MJ without his ankle injuries.  Yao Ming is in the Hall more for his cultural and international impact than his NBA career.  Tracy McGrady was one the best scorers the league has ever seen and was debated as the best SG with Kobe for most of a decade.  The defining guards of this generation, the 2010s decade, are:  Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Damian Lillard.  Kyrie gets an honorable mention, but he's closer to a DeRozan than he is to that list."
No because It’s time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry
"Crazy how he is even in the discussion tbh, it's totally media fabricated. Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry all have played better during this season than LeBron, heck, even Kawhi in his own city when you consider his defense and his efficiency is more deserving."
Probably because the warriors are beating them *without* Stephen Curry
"Ex hornet, Dell Curry spotted texting Golden State MVP Stephen Curry. League investing possible tampering"
"Really depends on how you evaluate things like the Warriors first championship their accolades going into the season is 1 time All Star Stephen Curry. He wins MVP that season but there were still a couple years of ""he's not that good he's only getting it because the best player on the team with the best record.""  There's so much retroactive judgement that happens that these conversations get weird. Like of course the Spurs win in 2014 Kawhi Leonard, the finals MVP, is a star! That was team ball all the way. It was Diaw, Mills, Green stepping up with aging veterans.  If the Jazz win it will be of course they won, look at what Conley did. Or Mitchell. Or maybe even Gobert. It depends on who really steps up. And if they lose, of course they lost, they don't have a true star.  There's more to it than just who's who. If the Jazz rely on Ingles getting open shots to win the championship they might struggle. I think Gobert has enough gravity on the roll to keep him open in the playoffs. That team is hard to guard and they're good defensively."

"Ja Morant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Zion Williamson, Lebron James"
"Well you're obviously a Harden stan, but oh well:  https://pickinsplinters.com/2020/05/14/breaking-down-james-hardens-postseason-inefficiency/  The main issue here is, just as he has forced his scoring average up by manipulating bad officiating rules, Harden has forced himself into being a mediocre shooter with poor mechanics and exceptional range, and you portray him as a great shooter. Bullshit. Stephen Curry is a great shooter, Joe Harris is a great shooter, Duncan Robinson, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, are great shooters. Harden is the China of basketball, just a manufactured knock off version of the real deal born out of a dynamic of competitive necessity following the dominance of Curry. He's boring to watch, and he won't win a ring on his own merits. Your favorite player is kind of....shit."
Stephen Curry can't dunk so...
"The stats mean nothing when you’re relating it to game script especially in regards to best and most consistent teams in the league. The Nets have underperformed since the Harden trade. I find it easy to look at stats and prove the narrative you more pushing but a Lebron/Joel Embiid have had a better year and bigger impact, as has a Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry, or even Paul George when he’s not busy dealing with COVID issues. So those stats are impressive for sure but you’re not gonna tell me that Domantas Sabonis hasn’t meant more to his team than Harden has at this gesture which is what MVP awards are mostly tailored around."
"[From a 2015 article:](https://247sports.com/college/kansas/board/103719/Contents/steph-curry-made-77-3-pointers-in-a-row-at-practice-71139492/)  &gt;the NBA regular season draws to a close, Stephen Curry might be just finding his best shooting stroke. The Golden State Warriors guard and owner of the NBA single-season 3-point record connected on 77 straight 3s in Tuesday's practice. Curry rotated around the perimeter, taking 10 shots from several spots. Curry told ESPN the 77 represents the most he's ever made in a row. Out of 100 shots taken during the session, he made 94. Teammate Klay Thompson, who is second in the NBA with 234 made 3s, told ESPN he couldn't believe Curry had made 77 straightand that his own record streak is 36.  I think we can use a little common sense here and say that Klay probably did not reach 100 in a row if 36 was his max in 2015, let alone the 300 or more that you recalled."
Be a Warriors fan because Stephen Wardell Curry is so inspirational when you see him shoot.

Don’t forget the defensive stopper Stephen Curry
"&gt;Like i said, all of them have decent career numbers.  All of your ""decent"" shooters becoming brilliant shooters is not likely to be sustainable.  Morris has been an average shooter over his career to date, and there's nothing to suggest that at 31 years old he suddenly became far better than Stephen Curry ever has been.  Batum has been an average shooter, and now at 32, is nearly 50 points over his career high -- set eleven years ago.  Williams has been an average shooter, and now at 34 is setting a career high.  Beverley has been a slightly-above-average shooter, and now at 32 is blistering his career high.  George has been a slightly-above-average shooter, and now at 30 is 66 points over his career high.  Etcetera.  &gt;They have a ton of open shots, enabled by the ball movement. Why are you ignoring this.  I am not.  In order for ""open shots"" to be the cause of these massive increases, these players must have been taking bad, contested threes throughout their careers to date.  None of them except maybe Williams were.  Even the best shooters in the league don't shoot these percentages on open shots, and none of these guys have ever been in the category of ""best shooters""."
"Look at the clutch playoff champions since 1990. Most have an elite midrange player that can create his own space. Jordan, kobe, pierce, durant, LeBron, kawhi etc. A decent size wing is always gonna be the  most important player in basketball . There is even a quote from kerr that goes:  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"You are asking about the five most productive players.  While there’s no consensus on how to measure productivity, Basketball-Reference uses VORP (Value over Replacement Player).  The top five players according to VORP are:  1.Nikola Jokić	3.3  2.Luka Dončić	2.4  3.Stephen Curry    2.3  4.LeBron James     2.3  5.Giannis Antetokounmpo    2.1  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::vorp"

"I can't believe how I need to point out how Harden's usage has collapsed compared to prior seasons because he is now on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. It's literally the lowest it has been since he was coming off the bench in OKC. You apparently seem to know that yourself, but completely disregard it?  Not to mention that despite Harden's usage being way down, he's still playing 5 minutes more per game than Stephen Curry is. Is it that unbelievable to you that Curry is averaging 1.5 less FTA than Harden?  Curry is not unfairly officiated. He does essentially the same shit (but to a lesser extent) and receives the same calls as a notorious foul-baiter. It just looks like you're trying to believe something that clearly isn't true out of some blind love for a player.  and no, I'm not trying to be an asshole. It's not that serious."
Or because Stephen Curry was a MVP and averaged MVP type numbers MVPs and had a ESW of 22.2
"Bro without the 3 point line, Stephen Curry wouldn't even be a viable starter.  See I can type out dumb shit too"
Stephen Curry is currently the best player in the National Basketball Association.
The only high-scoring guard to have better scoring efficiency numbers than Zach this season is Stephen Curry. The argument is not fucking dumb. Efficiency-wise Zach is even beating Dame and Kyrie.   28/5/5 on 65% TS vs 25/4/4 on 60% TS with both guards averaging nearly 4 TOs a game is not fucking dumb.
Stephen Curry is good at basketball.

Does Kerr have a higher 3 point percentage than Curry? Sure, technically, no one's disputing that. However, one player has taken 1600 three point shots at fewer attempts per game, one has taken 5700 attempts at far more per game. Use some common sense.

Why is every other take on this sub ballwashing Stephen Curry?
"I'm no expert but to me, it seems like Oubre has the same issues with the bench as he does with the starters. Its just that on the bench, he doesn't have Stephen Curry to bail him out for his offensive lapses, or Draymond Green to bail him out on his defensive (and offensive) lapses. He forces shots, is constantly shooting contested threes and it genuinely feels like hes playing for his stat sheet. He drives, and I think he's gonna do what Wiggins does and perform a great kick out to the open man, but nope. Contested layup with 3 dudes on him. Its gotten so predictable that defenses can collapse on Oubre in the paint and it works because he doesn't pass. I also wanna mention that Oubre is improving at all of this. Another factor is simply change. Paschall isn't playing well and a part of it can be attributed to being in a slump, but playing with a ball dominant player is another factor. Thats why Kerrs gonna play Oubre with the bench for awhile. After they mesh  together, he wants to see their ceiling. Unfortunately, that means a lackluster bench until they do mesh. How would it be different if he spent time with the first unit? This is all speculation but I think we'd just have our early season bench, which quite literally carried us and was amazing. With Steph out of his slump and Oubre improving, Oubre going to the starters with less bench minutes would let the bench return to what they were and the starters wouldn't be half as bad as the start of the season. I hope I explained it all."
"Stephen curry is like when you play your 8th My league season and score effortlessly and think ""nah this is too fake"""

why dont you just say stephen curry??
Stephen Curry getting 3 open looks from 3 in a 3-min span also says a lot about their defense. It's just that their offense has looked so much worse
"Stephen Curry has an expiration date. If you go to wikipedia, you will notice on January 18th 2028, at approximately 9:52pm, right after him and cyberlegKlay defeat the washington wizards (led by Bol Bol, Bronny, and Liangelo Ball) in the 7th game of the Fianls, he will be abducted by Adam Silver to the intergalactic Sky Fucker league of misfits. Curry will lead the next generation of moon sky fuckers."

"No it isn’t lmfao. I get it dude you’re a Lakers fan, it’s in your DNA to *not* want to give another CA team props, but Curry *is that guy*. I don’t care what ANYONE says, no one is getting guarded like this dude once he reaches half court because *literally no one in NBA history* is as much of a shooting threat at such a high volume as Stephen Curry. He simply by far the greatest shooter ever, and therefore, gets defended much differently."

"But you said “national tv” specifically which is why I brought up all the national TV games. But whatever.  The sad reality is that a lot of casual fans care about drama and storylines more than team record. They also care more about big names like LeBron, Curry, etc. or big cities like LA/NY. The fact that Shaq is backpedaling and demanding credit for the way the Jazz are playing just shows that he’s saying stuff as a TV personality rather than out of pure hate for Mitchell personally. It’s the same with Skip Bayless, Stephen A Smith, Colin Cowherd, etc. Controversy and hot takes sell in sports media. I don’t personally like it, but it’s the way that industry has been forever and it will continue to happen because it makes money."
"[Yup, it's true](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)  Unsurprisingly he got zero sympathy lmao"
"&gt;Lol you're using the ""product of their era"" argument, which is true, but players today ARE JUST MORE SKILLED than players were 15 years ago, so yes. It is an era thing, but 1. Curry had a lot to do with that revolution and 2. Players are just more skilled today, so the ""era"" argument proves my point. Bob Cousy is considered a top 10 PG ever, and he couldn't dribble w his left hand.  Kobe as we knew him playing today would still be more skilled overall than Curry. So I'm not just banking on the product of the era argument, I'm only saying his long range shot 3 point shot wasn't an emphasis due to the style of play at the time. (And if it were an emphasis, I'm not necessarily saying I would expect Kobe to have the range and efficiency of Curry at that deep end part of the floor).  &gt;not this season: Stephen Curry : 11-24 FG (45.8%)   &gt;Trae Young : 9-25 (36.0%)   &gt;Damian Lillard : 14-45 (31.1%)   Yeah, now how about we wait until the entire season plays on and see where that ends. Sample size matters. 42.4% off of 125 shoots is far more impressive.  &gt;Curry's shooting as good from 30-40 than Kobe shot for his career. Again, the 30 footer is the hardest shot in basketball, if a turnaround fadeaway was harder, Kobe would just take 30 footers. But he was a 33% 3PT shooter on normal 3's.  I'm not taking away from Curry's insane efficiency but it is pretty obvious you aren't aware of the type of shots Kobe took on a daily basis. For better or worse, he took ridiculous contested shots every game, and you can knock him for that. But his top tier skill set still allowed him to make those types of shots from any part of the floor in ways Curry could never.  &gt;lol more favorable spacing ? Have you seen Curry's team this year ? Oubre, Wiggins, Draymond, and Wiseman are the starters he plays with and he's STILL putting up 30 on almost 50/40/90 shooting. Stop the cap, PLEASE  Yes, more favorable spacing. Again, it is crystal clear you weren't even around to see the style of play of 2000s basketball. No one who's been around to see basketball from the 90s and 2000s would argue that spacing today is far more favorable to shooters than it was back then, regardless of who you played with. I don't know what ""cap"" means... We're clearly significantly different in age."
"This sub is way too reactionary. One day Stephen Curry is washed and will never be the same and now somehow after one efficient game from Blake, he was holding out and dogging it for the Pistons. Blake isnt going to carry, but he is a skilled piece that will help. Dont act like hes something hes not anymore."
"And he did it without getting superstar calls and while sitting out TWENTY 4th quarters. So he could have done even more damage if he wasn't being benched after 3 quarters because they were blowing out the other team by 30.  Another stat I like to use to explain how bonkers Curry was is total points scored in 2016:  - Rank 1: James Harden, 2,376 points, 3125 minutes played  - Rank 2: Stephen Curry, 2,375 points, 2700 minutes played  Harden basically played 9 entire games more than Steph in 2016 and managed a SINGLE point more scored than him. That's how broken Steph was offensively.   Jokic is having an insane season, but in terms of impact it's really not close to 2016 Curry."
"sometimes you get Marcus “Stephen Curry” Smart (2020 Raptors Game 2, 2017 Cavs Game 3) and sometimes you get Marcus “please stop shooting” Smart (2020 Heat Game 6), all just part of the experience. I love him regardless"
"It's a weird season with a wide open race, so something weird could happen, but Lebron really doesn't have a traditional MVP pedigree.   Since 2009, every MVP has led the league in PER except 2011 Derrick Rose and 2015 Stephen Curry. Lebron probably should have won MVP over Rose in 2011, and in 2015, Curry was 3rd in PER behind Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook, but those guys both missed double digit games, and Curry was on a 67-win team, while Davis was on the 8th seed, and Westbrook missed the playoffs.  Right now Lebron is 16th in PER.  Similarly, every MVP since 2009 except 2011 Rose and 2017 Westbrook have led the league in WS/48. Lebron is currently ranked 21st in this.  Not saying these stats are the end all, be all, but not being on a top seed, while being nowhere close to the top of some stats that the MVP is usually the leader in isn't a good sign for Lebron's MVP case.  With that said, Embiid is injured right now. No one in the media wants to give it to Giannis, Harden has the Houston situation and also his stats are less glamarous than usual (although he has a weird media thrust behind him), and Jokic/Butler/Curry/Lillard all have team record problems that will hurt their case, although for Jokic an Butler that might not be the case at the end of the season (don't think it's as likely for the Blazers/Warriors to make a run towards the top of the standings in the second half)."
"Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Joe Ingles, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo.  League fucked."
"I just remember right after Curry got picked, they interviewed some old guy (coach or analyst something somewhere) and he was like yall gonna regret not picking Stephen Curry, he’ll be the best player."
"Yes because the MVP is only won by defensive masterminds such as the likes of *checks notes* James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Stephen Curry"

Anthony Davis for Stephen Curry. Who says no?   Warriors get a 28-year old AD locked into a long term contract.  Lakers get a 33-year old Stephen Curry that is more likely to help them contend in the short term to maximize Lebron's contention window.
Stephen Curry
Did you guys know:  Mark Jackson actually used to work for the Golden State Warriors   At the same time that Stephen Curry was on the team?    It’s crazy.

His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."

"&gt;	No one gives a shit about 73-9.  Only dumb Americans only care about the post season. When has a Laker team (highly even doubt you’re from California at all) cleared 67 wins? Curry has done it *twice  &gt;	The funny part is the Warriors would have been better off resting for the postseason rather than chasing the record, but their fans want to eat their cake.  Dude ya they totally should have just said this record is absolutely dumb lol   &gt;	You don’t know shit about basketball. Curry was NOT the primary ball handler and never was. He has a low usage rate for a superstar while averaging 3+ turnovers per game.   why did Curry have the most dribbles per possession, passes completed, time with ball, initiating back and front court offense more than any other warrior? Then came Draymond green. Then as a tertiary creator we had Durant. Sucks when the stats disagree with you, huh?  And lmao you using usage rate to talk about a player like Curry speaks volumes about your basketball knowledge. Keep listening to ESPN clown   &gt;	He’s a mediocre passer and relied on Draymond/Iggy/system to get him preferred shots.  &gt;	You should thank your lucky stars Durant decided to join your team, not mock him for it.  Durant just needed a 73 win team. Curry won the year prior. Max kellerman or stephen a smith take next? Clown"

"Didn't shai and naw grow up in TO but transfer out for High school? I know RJ and Dillon are from Sauga and Cory from Pickering but iirc all of them except Brooks were born in the dot. Olynyk is also from Toronto but moved to bc in middle school  Fun fact, cojo and olynyk were both on the same Scarborough Blues team that dominated the city  (low key my team got slapped up by 40) and one of their only losses came against the 5-0 who were led by Stephen Curry."
"Okay. Here you go.   Wardell Stephen Curry II statistics for the last 10 games.    27.2 points, 5.2 rebounds, and on 44.7% from the field, 32.2% from three, and 90% from the line. That’s essentially a month straight of him underperforming. He’s missing a lot of open threes and layups that he normally makes.     Do I think this will continue? No he will bounce back. Are there valid excuses? Yes, he has to exert more effort on defense and he’s probably discouraged by how bad the team looks at times."
"&gt; You keep referencing what they are doing right now lol, you clearly don’t get it. We are talking ceiling here, not current production.  right and lamelo's ceiling is significantly higher considering how good he is now, imagine how good he'll be in years later.   &gt; And yeah you’re righ dude, age is always the biggest factor. Especially when it’s literally month difference. Good thing the Kings drafted 20 year old Tyreke Evans instead of the older Stephen Curry  Age is the biggest factor, not the only factor. Try reading next time."

Especially when it’s literally month difference. Good thing the Kings drafted 20 year old Tyreke Evans instead of the older Stephen Curry, he even put up better stats as a younger player!"
"&gt; ook I’ve watched a lot of D’Lo and Wiggins on the Warriors, it’s clear who’s better to me. &gt;  &gt; Wiggins has a higher Total RAPTOR than D’Lo even with that dreadful Offensive RAPTOR.  Wiggins is playing with stephen curry and has a -3.0 offensive raptor lmaoo. D'Lo hasn't been played a single game with KAT by the way, his numbers would be better if he actually had his star next to him."
&gt; 2015 Steph and Isiah are the only 2 small guards who lead their team to a chip as the best player. Steph beat 3 teams with key injuries in that run but also had an injury himself which also proves my point that its brutal on smaller guys  lol what an awful argument. Steph's injury had nothing to do with him being a smaller guy. And you think Stephen Curry can't be the best player on a championship team then that's some next level delusion.
"“Stephen Curry: Its not reflected in the box score, but I think Curry played one of his best games of the season. The job he did on Brandon Jennings defensively in the first half was eye-opening. Curry was able to move his feet and stay in front of Jennings, to the shock I think of many. He forced Jennings into 7 turnovers, picking up 6 steals. And he forced him into bad shots.  Jennings came on strong in the second half, largely I think because Curry became exhausted having to play all 48 minutes. And also because Curry and the Warriors big men had to guard against foul trouble.  When Jennings hit his game-sealing three over Curry, it was because Curry had to give help on Bogut on the pick and roll. But I'll give Jennings credit: he likes the big shot, and he makes them.  Still, I think this game showed we got the better rookie.”   Looks like we got us a future dpoy lockdown kinda guy."
"""Stephen Curry""  Man I wonder if that guy had a good career or not"
"Golden State at the end of previous ownership and with Don Nelson coaching his last year only suited up 8 players for much of the season.  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2010/1/16/1254106/recap-bucks-113-warriors-104-no  &gt; The Warriors began this game dressing the NBA league minimum 8 players. After Anthony Morrow injured his knee two minutes in, there were 7. Then Cartier Martin got his eye raked by Andrew Bogut, and the Warriors were down to 6. Martin eventually returned, but by that time the Warriors were in serious foul trouble. Chris Hunter fouled out, Andris Biedrins fouled out, Stephen Curry fouled out. And the Warriors were down to 4. FOUR PLAYERS? When Curry fouled out, the refs were forced to invoke the little-known NBA Rule No. 3 (Section 1A), which basically states that the last player to foul out stays on the court and continues to play, but if he fouls again the other team receives a technical free throw in addition to the usual free throws."
Stephen Curry
"Curry and Westbrook were both knocked as prospects for being PG/SG tweeners.  A [draft profile of Curry](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/stephen-curry/), for example:  &gt; At 6-2, he’s extremely small for the NBA shooting guard position, and it will likely keep him from being much of a defender at the next level … Although he’s playing point guard this year, he’s not a natural point guard that an NBA team can rely on to run a team  Same for [Draymond](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/), as a SF/PF tweener:  &gt;Tweener, undersized for a physical forward yet lacks the athleticism of a wing"
"&gt;not wanting to be a snitch.  Real truth right here.   Lin knows that the NBA is full of (yes I'll say it) black players who 100% agree with calling Asians 'coronavirus'. Just look at what Stephen Jackson said about Jews and got TONS of support from current and former NBA players.  Lin has always been headhunted and overguarded cause no black player wants to be ""beat by an Asian"".   Hell, just look at the anti-light skin racism rampant in the black community. Ask Black Griffin, Curry, Jordan Clarkson about that. Btw, that was one of Kobe's and KG's go-to insults.   And to further prove my point, there was ZERO, ZILCH, NADA former or current NBA player who came to Lin's defense back during Linsanity or now. Not a single one in 8 years. Steve Kerr is basically the only NBA figure who has."

"You mean the guy that was considered the 2 times finals mvp. was seen as the better player on the same team and was ranked higher by kerr himself while on the same team is not the better player. Kd has also been elite for way longer and is not a defensive liability.  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""

How much help does Stephen Wardell Curry need
"&gt;Curry had 3 all stars on his team in Draymond, Klay and Iggy  It doesn't work like that. You don't say someone had all star teammates if they weren't selected as an all star that season.   For the 2015 championship season Stephen Curry played with exactly **one** All Star, Klay Thompson. Draymond Green had not any All Star selections yet and Andre Iguodala has had exactly **one** All Star selection in his career and it was 2012, three seasons before this run.  Stephen Curry was 100% the most important part of the Warriors from the start of the run until today. He was more important than KD, than Draymond, than Iguodala.   The only reason Curry was robbed of the FMVP was they voters did some kind of weird ""can't give it to a player on the losing team so we'll give it to the guy who guarded him,"" as LeBron's usage was very high and so were his counting stats. It is widely regarded as a flubbed vote.   If you go by the numbers, eye test, accomplishments, anyway you slice it Stephen Curry is one the best active players and will go down as one of the best to ever play.   The fact that LeBron stans and Harden stans hate him so much and always try to tear him down ironically reveals just how impactful he is.   So keep talking shit about Curry and telling us all how much you fear and resent him."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25

Maybe we really should put stephen curry on UCLA and put lonzo on the warriors

"The Lakers turned the results of their tank into a player that helped deliver a championship.  The Warriors weren't purposely tanking but they were garbage for a long time and used their high picks to build a core of Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green.  It certainly can work, it just requires a good front office. Something most teams in the top 10 don't have."
"Why did Durant join Curry after Curry kicked his ass? Curry has dominated harden for the past 5 years, why didn’t harden join? Why did Durant join?  You gonna answer? Or are you going to simp for ESPN and Stephen A smith? Clown"
I get that you're a 6ers fan but I'm just saying with or without the 6ers it's still 3pt dominated league. The 6ers would have to have a 2015 stephen curry level impact to reshape the entire league.
"Remember four comments ago when you were arguing stats from 35-40 feet shouldn't be used to evaluate a shot from 37 feet because it's the wrong ""grouping"" and that it was the equivalent of comparing 12+ feet stats to 3s. Good times.      Now you are comparing Dwight Howard, a notoriously bad shooter, and his proclivity to not be able to translate practice to the game, to a top 5 shooter in NBA history and arguably the most clutch player in NBA history. Hardly the same.      ""I didn't want to put it into the referee hands,"" Lillard said. ""Where if there was contact or maybe they get away with contact or I end up having to take a **tougher shot** because there was contact and they don't want to decide the game. So I was standing there looking at the rim and I was like this is a comfortable range.""   ...  For most anyone else, it probably is. For Lillard, it has become maybe his most lethal. Per Second Spectrum, Lillard is 8-of-12 from 30-plus feet this postseason, compared to 6-of-38 for everyone else. ""  Source: [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26592185/lillard-37-foot-buzzer-shot-last-word](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26592185/lillard-37-foot-buzzer-shot-last-word)  "" Yet if Lillard can play anywhere close to this level going forward, it requires at least a brief reevaluation of everything. He had 34 points in the first half alone on Tuesday and hit three of his four attempts from 30-plus feet, including the one that sent the Thunder packing.  Lillard’s ability to sink those shots — paired with Oklahoma City’s surprise that he’d even have the audacity to try them in some cases — was one of the key reasons Portland ran away with the series 4-1. The Thunder allowed him too much cushion, largely because defenders haven’t adjusted to the realization that Lillard, with nearly limitless range on his off-dribble jumpers, has arguably become the closest thing we have to [Golden State’s Stephen Curry](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/basketballs-other-3-point-revolution/).     ...   And unfortunately for the Thunder, that one — **which might have been a bad shot for just about anybody other than Lillard** — was enough to end their season in the most brutal way possible. ""  Source: [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/damian-lillard-hit-a-series-ending-game-winner-for-the-ages/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/damian-lillard-hit-a-series-ending-game-winner-for-the-ages/)     "" “I mean, I see this guy’s \[Lillard’s\] range is crazy, their ability to knock this shot down. And like you said, it’s not like it’s a half-court heave. **These are shots that are well in their range. They probably could shoot them deeper**,” George said per [Tomer Azarly](https://twitter.com/TomerAzarly/status/1368782815001604096).

You think it's a bad shot but no one in the NBA world does. I guess that's up to you"

If LeBron said k*ke he would still be voted as captain of the all star game for the next 10 years if he still plays for the next 10 years. Or Curry. Or KD. KD literally supported stephen jackson when he was being anti-Semitic and no one gave a fuck.
Stephen Curry - The Human Torch
"Probably not. Steph and Dell share the same name, both are Wardell Stephen Curry, and as the elder Curry goes by Dell, I'd imagine the younger is called Stephen in the family.  I've got an uncle and cousin that share the same name, and the uncle goes by the first name and the cousin by his middle.  But then again, I'm not in the Curry family, so I may be wrong"
"Thank you. I always make this point. Stephen Curry is the greatest player to ever play below listed 6’6.” He’s considered by many as the second greatest point guard of all-time, behind 6’8” Magic Johnson. It’s remarkable what he’s been able to do in a game of giants. Not to say 6’3” is short, but there’s a reason someone like Iverson includes Steph in his Mt Rushmore...he knows all too well, even more so, the limitations of being closer to 6ft than 7ft in this league."
"Stephen Curry is having his best season, he has really good he has shots, he will close this season as a leader."
"I feel like it all depends on what you love about basketball. For me it would be the 2010s. You have Lebron reaching his peak and finally overcoming adversity and win multiple rings while making the finals 8 straight years. You also have Stephen Curry making his mark on the leauge and leaving the biggest imprint in basketbalm history in the way people play basketball now and even look at basketball now as in terms of what are ""good shots"" or ""bad shots"". Then you have KD, the EASILY most unstoppable scorer of all time. You also have Russ breaking the triple double record for the first time since the 60s i believe. Lob City, Heatles, 73-9 Warriors, Prime Derrick Rose Bulls, Toronto wins their first ring ever. A young PG13 pushing the Miami Heat to 6 and 7 games. The 2012-2013 OKC Thunder who has 3 MVPs on it in hindsight. The 2016 NBA Finals that weren't really close when it came to game by game results but it was special because the story it told. The 2016 Christmas game between Cavs and Golden State where KD just joined the warriors and Kyrie hitting the game winner. Klay and Steph hitting MULTIPLE 3 point and scoring records. Kobe's retirement going out with 60pts. Even the 2016 dunk contest and TNT's Inside the NBA which really became a thing in the 2010s once Shaq became a permanent member."

I am excited to watch ESPN First Take tomorrow and see Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman either 1. avoid the topic all together and debate whether Steph Curry is better than Wilt Chamberlain or 2.

"I’m not a big Stephen Curry fan but let’s be honest, he’s got a while left."
I disagree Stephen Curry is a glorified Malik Monk and deserves the hate IMO
"Wardell Stephen Curry?  No wait, he's #2."
Wardell Stephen Curry is a god of basketball
Wardell Stephen Curry II is go~~o~~d at basketball.  FTFY.
Wardell Stephen Curry II is good at basketball.
Stephen Curry in 2017 had a better season than Russell Westbrook in 2017 lol

"If we disagree on Stephen Curry playing at an MVP level, then I guess you could make that argument. Though like I said, I don’t know how you could argue that he isn't (or wasn't).  As for the Stephen Curry vs Nikola Jokic argument, no.  I didn't even mention Jokic in my original comment. Come on dude. You're the one who started comparing the two players in response to a comment strictly talking about a single player's level of play.  I then joined the argument."
I watched a video earlier today of how Max Kellerman making a case for Lillard over Curry.  I was disgusted by that but I know he gotta fake it to create more views especially when he talking with Stephen A
I am sure whichever team has to play the GSW in the play in are extremely worried about Wardell Stephen Curry.  I for one would not want to play this man and Playoff Dray in a play in game.

Wardell Stephen Curry is immortal
"Nikola ""Stephen Curry"" Jokić."
Stephen Curry is not the best point guard ever.
"What if I told you, Wardell Stephen Curry?"
What about your eyes is telling you that Stephen Curry is more valuable than Nikola Jokic? And what makes your eyes more important than everyone else’s?
By what metric is Stephen Curry playing better than Nikola Jokic this season?
Stephen Curry is not the most valuable player in the league
"Like The Wire, Steph is STILL underrated. Unreal, how the most lethal three-way-scorer on earth can do his thing night in night out and teams can only really game-plan for him in the playoffs or when he's injured.  You can not stop a healthy Stephen Wardell Curry. MVP!"
"Yeah, it's ""Stephen Curry"""
My bad. I will try to not mention Damian Lamonte Ollie Lillard Sr and Wardell Stephen Curry II in the same sentence again.
MVP Wardell Stephen Curry
Yes. Do you get it though? Do NOT mention them together in the same sentence unless the sentence is “Stephen Curry is better than Damian Lillard” or “Damian Lillard is worse than Steph Curry”  You don’t want to anger them
"As a mathmagician, I can confirm that while James Edward Harden Jr. did it for a longer stretch, the efficiency was no where near Wardell Stephen Curry II."
Whose names? Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard?
 WE REALLY HAVE STEPHEN CURRY ON OUR TEAM
"Lmao spare him y’all, he’s already hurt enough having to watch Stephen “Legitimately Concerned” Curry wreck the league"
We get it Stephen Curry is a good player
stephen curry

WARDELL STEPHEN “SKYFUCKER” CURRY
MVP Wardell Stephen Curry
WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY
"Very interesting point, but can I give you Stephen Curry?"
stephen curry
"wanting to tank with a prime stephen curry makes you a fake fan. even if it is a good chance to make our team better, you don’t tank with curry"
ATTENTION WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY:  FUCKING STOP
"Because there was no 2016 Steph, he is just Stephen Curry."
"Ppl act like Curry is all by himself which I don’t understand. The warriors have their entire roster minus Klay.. they SHOULD be a playoff team.   Andrew Wiggins is averaging over 18ppg shooting 39% from 3 and playing good defense. He reinvented himself into a borderline all-star player again. Draymond won DPOY and is the primary facilitator for the team. Curry is the goat shooter. Throw in some good role players and you’d think you have yourself a decent team. Who would ever think the following would be under 500?  Stephen Curry, Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, Wiseman, Poole"
Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry?
Two words. Stephen. Curry.

He's still smart enough to trap Dame while Terry Stotts literally refused to double team Curry and let him go for 62 in the first month of the season. he refused. to double team. Stephen Curry. Don't even get me started on his dropping the big against Curry PnR in the WCF. Stotts has also shown how overrated he is this season.
Stephen curry wasn’t better than Lebron in the past decade ???
"This is what I mean, though, saying he will be top 20 when he's done is already underrating him. You can't name 20 players right now with a greater, more successful, or more impactful career than Stephen Curry."

Breaking News: Stephen Curry has gotten a random drug test.
"The duel between Jayson ""forever 19"" Tatum and Stephen ""baby-faced assassin"" Curry was something to behold."
wow another fluke but since its Stephen Curry people jerk off to it and ignore that jumping into the defender. They rather make 20 Topics a minute to circlejerk..
You know its bad when stephen curry puts up 47 while losing by 5
"Stephen ""despite the loss"" Curry strikes again"
"Stephen ""despite the loss"" Curry strikes again"
I know you're Stephen Curry but with a timeout you can't be pulling up from half court...
It's wild that someone that coached Stephen Curry doesn't know that picking him up full court doesn't work and just energizes him
Guys. I think it's time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry  .............'s team.   Get the guy some help.
Stephen Ramona Curry is the most disrespectful player ive ever seen. how does he hit those? then my man has the balls to dance like that on the goddamn parquet
"**Three pt FGs**  Stephen Curry - (402,354,324)  James Harden - (378, 299)  &amp;#x200B;  **Free Throws Made**  Jerry West - (840)  Wilt Chamberalin - (835)  Michael Jordan - (833)  Adrian Dantley - (813)  Oscar Robertson - (800)  &amp;#x200B;  **Free Throw attempts**  More Wilt."
I FUCKING LOVE STEPHEN CURRY!
The Stephen Curry of r/NBA  100% TS
In our hearts he never left.      He still has plenty time to catch and surpass Stephen Curry.
I really dont want to believe that. Which is why Im asking how did Chris bosh magically average 6 less points and 2 less rebounds when he teamed up with Lebron and Wade? Stephen curry magically average 5 less points when KD joined? Im asking you to explain to me. Because if theres no explanation from you it just proves that whatever I say is right isnt it? Because whatever Im saying now it based off facts. and what youre saying is based off your personal opinion
Counterpoint: Stephen Curry going super saiyan
Stephen Curry. It’s progressed from legitimate concern early on
"&gt;They were recently featured on an episode of Sesame Street — C is for Cooking — that was filmed before the pandemic. The children’s show amplifies the Curry message about nutrition, education and play: Ayesha cooked with Elmo and Stephen cooked with Cookie Monster (“He’s a cool guy,” Stephen said.). The Warriors star admitted to his children that it took three takes before he made the basket in the “play” segment.  Curry can't make buckets for charity confirmed."

How much is Stephen Curry putting into the Steph and Wiggins duo XD
Did Stephen Curry retire after the all Star break or something
Stephen Curry does not get swept. It’s never ever going to happen
Stephen 'Biyombo' Curry
Oh nah bro.. I’m just saying.. Stephen curry is sadly a smooth Mfka
&gt;Fun isn’t something one considers when torching the National Basketball Association. But this… does put a smile on my face.   \-  Wardell Stephen Curry II
STEPHEN FUCKING CURRY
"Stephen Curry: Captain America - Aim, Endurance, Handles  Damion Lillard: Daredevil - Aim, Handles, Hops  Kyrie Irving: Punisher - Cruel &amp; relentless during a lead, Aim, Handles  Zion Williamson: Beast - Strength, Intelligence, Agility  Nikola Jokic (Yeah, yeah, his nickname is, ""Joker""): Cable - Aim, Strength, Unlimited Dimes  Luka Doncic: Gambit - Aim, Handles, Luck/Likelihood (he leapt through a double-team to LOB a game winning 3)   There are more players and way more superheroes."
"Stephen ""Kendrick LaMar"" Curry"
 god i fucking love Stephen Curry
ESPN: Sources say Stephen Curry is exploring forcing a trade to the Rockets.
And this is why Stephen Curry is better than LeFraud James.
"Yeah, I mean it’s Stephen Curry man, you know who he is, you gotta put him in  1st All-NBA team"
"This reads like a ""Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry"" post where we doubt a player after 5 games back from a break due to injury. Give it time."
Stephen Curry has declining numbers in the finals but his playoff numbers are actually all time great which is a weird conundrum for these entertainers so they don’t mention it to play up the narrative.
"That will never happen.   Not exactly sure why, but your comment rubbed me the wrong way.   Kd is kd and giannis is giannis. Kd is an all time great shooter, like quite literally top 10 all time. He’s special because he can do it while being basically 7 feet tall. A 7 foot Stephen curry would be a decent comparison. Giannis is extremely special and talented in his own way as well.   If you combine any 2 superstars where they fill each other’s weak points they’ll obviously become overpowered. Combine Ben Simmons with Dame that’s overpowered. Embiid with Steph curry that’s overpowered. Jokic with Kawhi is overpowered. When the fuck would combining 2 superstars skills and talents not be overpowered?"
"https://cavsnation.com/stephen-curry-says-wasnt-100-nba-finals/  ud flame the fuck outta lebron if he came out after choking a 3-1 lead in humiliating fashion and said ""i wasnt 100 percent."" act like u wouldnt. do it."
Marcus Smart turned into Mickey Mouse Stephen Curry
"Not exactly the answer to your question, but...  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best."
I’d like to take this moment to remind everyone that Keith Smart often gave Acie Law run over Stephen Curry at the beginning of Steph’s career.

I asked what the diapers were for and he said “they are to contain my full power so i dont absolutely shit on the entire league” then he used an off-ball screen to get out the door"
"&gt; He had Embiid along with Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.       Thoughts guys? I'd personally be putting Giannis, Kawhi, Harden and Jokic all before Dame. Lillard is in that back end top 10 with AD and Luka for me."
Wth is stephen curry?
"This is my last reply, it's clearly futile trying to reason with you.  Draymond is the defensive anchor that literally can control both sides of the court. Steph is great, but there are lapse when things don't go right. What happens when Steph has a poor shooting night? Even if it's rare it has happened. Remember that whole thing I believe in 2016 or 17 Steph had an abysmal like 30% FG with like 14 points? People were like how come the MVP isn't held at a higher standard where if LeBron performed like that he'd be crucified.  It was a valid point, Curry for a superstar has gotten a lot of free passes than Harden, Westbrook, Giannis, even LeBron. Both pieces are crucial to win but one can have a higher value whether its 1A or 1B. Think about better players can raise the ceiling (Stephen, Kawhi) and more important players raise the floor (Lowry, Draymond).   Draymond in his worst games will still offer you ways to win and hold your team together. Curry in a vaccuum, on his worst which albeit rare, cannot."
"The entire discussion was comparing a better player versus a more important player.   I would argue while Stephen Curry is the better player, Draymond is the more important player."
"That one bad turnover? Jeez, no one has higher expectations put on them than Stephen Curry."

"&gt; Robert Horry is not better than MJ.  I mean, that's not even remotely close to the point they are making. The argument is if **Stephen Curry** has five rings, he's above Magic as best. Not ""if any random PG has 5 rings they're better than Magic.""  This is not an unreasonable take. When things are relatively equal, rings do become a meaningful part of the discussion. Saying Horry is better than MJ because rings is fucking moronic, but saying that rings are part of why MJ is better than LeBron is reasonable part of discussion.  Rings are a piece of the puzzle, and when you're talking about separating the top players of all time, it is informative as a tie breaker."

Stephen Curry
"Yes, If you are a real Stephen Curry fan you would want him to be happy and succeed. He needs to go to the Knicks. They would literally be unbeatable. Elite defense + Curry/Randle/Rj is an easy championship. Curry going to the Knicks is a must. If you are a curry supporter, you should want curry on the Knicks."
"Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter of all time, is in argument for greatest point guard of all time, and is possibly the greatest offensive player ever regardless of position.   As a GM, I would look at who can bring about more wins, easier. Either Curry drops 40 or Jokic drops 20/15/12. Both lead to wins. Who do you think can do it more consistently? In my opinion Jokic is the more consistent option.  If you're asking who would I rather have on my all time team? Curry, hands down. As for who I would take to bring a team to the playoffs/finals this year? It would be easier to build a team around Jokic, so I'm taking him."

"The ""Have an MVP on the roster"" would soon be replaced by 2020-2021 Golden State Warriors. I predict that Stephen Curry will finish the season averaging 29-31 PPG 5 Ast 5 Reb 44-41-90, but will not be the MVP since Jokic is hugely favored to win the race."

KD came back for 1 quarter as a sharpshooter and cooked Kawhi and the Raps. He played them in the regular season and had 51 in an OT win.

"Bruh Jokic is great, but I wouldn't put him here for a few reasons. (and this is also the argument for why Hakeem should be there instead.  \#1: **He's just not as good as the best centers of all time.**  Hakeem Olajuwon (when at his best) is the greatest center of all time for my money. He carried two EXTREMELY mediocre teams to back-to-back titles. Wilt was mind-numbingly athletic, and Bill Russel has a case for the greatest defensive player ever (consider fit with this lineup).  \#2: **He is a playmaking/offensive specialist.**  His playmaking really loses value when you also have LeBron James and Stephen Curry in your lineup. His greatest value is on the offensive side of the ball, where MJ is the best ever, and Steph + KD are right on his heels.  \#3: **His defense does not come even close to stacking up to Hakeem.**  I will say that his defense is actually criminally underrated, as he's a very smart and talented defensive player. However, being above average, is not peak Hakeem (arguably the GOAT defender).  Jokic is the only guy here who hasn't played in multiple finals and won championships. Yes he's **capable** of being the best player on a championship team, but all these other guys have **been** the greatest player on a championship team multiple times.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Oh fuck it's the best offensive lineup, and I can't read."

"Harden is just about tied with Luka, while Dame rounds out my Top Ten.  Book is right around that range, too.  1. LeBron James 1. Stephen Curry 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1. Kevin Durant 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Luka Dončić 1. James Harden 1. Nikola Jokić 1. Joel Embiid 1. Damian Lillard"
"You are completely wrong, you are ignoring that being able to draw the attention of two defenders and make the pass the short roll guy through that enabling your team to play 4 on 3 **IS** play making.   What do you think play making is, literally only a direct pass to someone who makes a basket?  That's such a stupid, limited way to look at it.   As far as assist to turn over Curry is better than 2 to 1 over his career, this season with no shooting and no secondary ball handler (Poole started to give a little of this late in the season) yes, that ratio dipped a little.   But if you watch Stephen Curry play NBA basketball and say he's a ""poor playmaker"" you really, truly, either do not understand what you are watching or you're just a hater who wants to try to tear down a great player.   We could flip this and talk about Russ and his deficiencies, of which there are many more than Curry has."
Fun fact: Stephen Curry doesn’t like “Steph.”   Source: I know someone at Under Armour.
"The spacing he provides his teammates his huge, the players he plays with all have their field goal percentages go up when he is on the floor, he is in a 3-way tie for second in screen assists per game this season among all guards, he gets a lot of ""hockey assists"" where he generated the space but gave it to Draymond who then gets credited with the assist when he plays tic tac toe in the 4 on 3.   His actual assist to turnover ratio is good, about 2 to 1, and that's in a season where he needed to score more than in the past, which has coincided with a slight drop in the assists as he simply is ending more possessions with a shot this season than any other year of his career, **including** 2016.   But honestly I could do a whole write up about how great of a playmaker Stephen Curry is but it wouldn't matter because I don't believe you have a deep understanding of the game and I think for you this is about a Westbrook vs Curry thing, which is so sad.  Just enjoy greatness brother."
"This is like when Steph's Putt Putt show (where he's exec producer) referred to him as ""Stephen Curry"" whenever possible. Sounds like Steph himself doesn't like Steph as a nickname, but nobody cares."

"Kobe got me into basketball, Stephen Curry turned me into a fanatic"
Even a two-time MVP in Stephen Wardell Curry couldn't carry a team while having historic numbers for himself into the playoffs.   When you just don't have the pieces you just don't have the pieces; basketball at the end of the day is a team game and Jokic's game relies 100% on assists and passing.

Luka 'Stephen Curry' Doncic
It seems stephen curry here in this dimension of earth is better than 99.6% of all stephen curry's in the universes timeline. It's only a shame that the current draymond green on this earth currently is only better than 41.3% of all draymond greens known to past present and future earth timelines.

Adam Silver is conflicted because this result validates the play in tournament but it means Stephen Curry is done for the season.
Absolutely true. It's like lightning in a bottle if you're able to find someone who is willing to speak out in public that Stephen Wardell curry may have a flaw or weakness in his game that he could fix but won't.   I don't think we'll ever honest to God see this again in the history of this sub and I may just take pictures. It really is that rare
"**OVERTIME**  Unlikely hero with the deep shots in OT as Grayson Allen hits us with bay to back threes, including one after another out of whack pass by Stephen Curry out of the double team. [The vision of Tillman for the assist in the first one is marvellous, in opposition to the abhorrent transition demesne by the Dubs on the latter one.](https://i.imgur.com/5opZ7T6.mp4)  [Jordan Poole with the clutch shot to put Golden State up 2](https://i.imgur.com/apWIKIO.mp4) and Tillman makes up the miss in regulation on the opposite corner, [with a beautiful feed by the best jumping passer in the NBA](https://i.imgur.com/6eZmCeZ.mp4).   The rough patch continues for Wiggins who missed both jumpers, including a 3-point attempt that doesn’t even touch the rim. After Poole dribbles off his leg, it’s up to Ja to clinch the playoff spot. He attacks JTA 1v1, spins inside and [hits the floater - the shot that has served him so well this year - scoring his 35th point in 29 shots, including 5-10 from deep](https://i.imgur.com/2itlkSS.mp4).  Poole [shows up again for a miracle shot and a glimpse of hope](https://i.imgur.com/A6KB3B2.mp4) but there was not enough time to do another comeback.  [Memphis’ defense was the main story](https://i.imgur.com/DgdcXmp.mp4) and I honestly never expected that would have been the case - it’s what brought them to the position of advantage they enjoyed for most of the game. They had more steals than turnovers! Incredible display on the road with high pressure for such a young team.  Put some respect on Dillon Brooks’ name because these 2 games he’s been just outstanding defensively, and the support he got inside to avoid cuts to the rim was great as well. Tillman did a fantastic job coming off the bench, especially on defense in the balancing act of covering Draymond Green and making sure to contain Steph enough to give time for Dillon to recover. And Ja Morant made the most of every chance in a way that he didn’t on the previous game in a great display of control and poise (He even had some great defensive plays, both top-locking Steph himself or bothering people on recoveries). Not to mention the shots by Allen or the masterclass that Kyle Anderson put out there.  For the Warriors, it’s hard to make any takeaway expect it is impossible to win when turnover over the ball in such a way - and that has to fall on Curry and Green, combining for 13. It seems to an extent that they had all these high intensity games caught up to them but the expectations at this level are cold and ruthless. Like in the Lakers game, they had a TOV% and an Opposition FT Rate both crossing 20%. So once again, they win the half-court battle but are completely destroyed in transition (160 ORTG in transition plays for the Grizzlies this game on CleaningTheGlass. That’s a lot btw.)  ———————————————————————   **NOTES:**  Great adjustment making sure to match Brook’s minutes as much as they could with Steph after the way he got hot against Melton the previous game.  Not just the terrible lost possessions, but Dray was so much less impactful on defense than he’s been the last few weeks. Another indication the fatigue caught up to him.  Since the broadcast didn’t call it out, [just want to give props to Looney for the great seal here](https://i.imgur.com/XmkiyNw.mp4).  The Jordan Poole rise is something I will never understand but something I will always be thankful for. He simply came back from the mid-season G-League bubble as a great player. His decision making is surprisingly good and that was visible in multiple points down the stretch. Honestly, if they wanted to have him out there (and I agree it was the right call), he should have gotten more on-ball plays, getting Curry less times facing a double team and taking the ball out of a cold Andrew Wiggins.  Mulder’s shot has just not been reliable enough in these games. 1-8 from deep in the Lakers and 2 Grizzlies games.  Kyle Anderson is such a solid 2-way player and such an unconventional entertaining watch. He got a huge amount of responsibilities on help defense this game and [absolutely delivered](https://i.imgur.com/prSALaH.mp4). A very well earned +11 on the night."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors’ execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip…](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6’9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV’s threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday’s game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that’s always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the “Curry experience”](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph’s 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don’t have Draymond’s help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV’s gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can’t switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ———————————————————————   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven’t mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray’s drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant’s shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an “so wide open its practice” 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond’s drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn’t make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn’t capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."

Maybe Stephen Curry that could work
"Ah yes, NBA Superstar Caris LeVert who has been competing for the title of best player in the league against the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard."
"Stephen Curry is one of the three best scorers in the world. We've already seen with Durant that Kerr is willing to go more iso heavy if the player feels that it's his best way to score. The fact that they haven't done that with Steph makes it pretty clear that Steph thinks is the best way to score. And I'm going to assume that he has some insight into that, seeing as he's Stephen fucking Curry.  Going through PnR has some big advantages. It lets Steph do those plays where he relocates much easier. It lets him catch the ball on the run, or lets him catch it at a stop when his defender is moving, when he gets the ball back from a screener. It creates switches. If Steph thinks that these outweigh the benefits of being doubled on an iso, he probably has a pretty decent reason for thinking that."
"Why is Stephen Curry considered an all time great ?  - No real rings - Needs super teams to win - Carried by KD - Choked 3-1  - Cant carry a team Sorry, Stephen Curfraud is not top 50 in my book"
"Having Stephen Curry on your team inherently skews the Warriors percentage to be higher than what it is.  Both the 15 Rockets and the 07 Cavs have better defensive ratings then this Warriors team  Harden was not doubled full court constantly like Curry was that's just a straight up false statement   Ahh yes the same Larry Hughes who shot 37% from 3 in 06 and had teams guard his 3 point shot instead of sagging off him and doubling LeBron full court all game, if you watched the league back then you'd know that teams actually guarded Larry and he wasn't just some bum ass player you can leave open.   The Rockets argument is an actual joke 2015 Rockets where ranked #1 in 3 point attempts because guess what, James had shooters around him and Dwight.   the Rockets Teams aren't even comparable to this Warriors team, the Cavs ones are the closest and that happened in a time before the 3 point revolution and LeBron was strong enough and fast enough to get to the rim and finish through contact anyhow, it's just not comparable at all."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/86207-stephen-curry-held-scoreless-but-davidson-routs-loyola-anyway
Am I supposed to be impressed by Stephen Curry getting the 9th seed with a DPOY finalist and an overall top 5 defense in the league?
"In retrospect, the Warriors overachiever, all in the back of one Wardell Stephen Curry"
"There’s no Stephen Curry criticism allowed on this sub. I swear to god if Lebron had 7 turnovers it wouldn’t matter what he did, that would be the headline that night. Especially if he lost."
"It's a success of a season to me. Stephen Curry unlocked a higher level of playing, which will only increase in value as he gets re-surrounded with more talent. They developed Andrew Wiggins into a positive impact player with really good defense, something he hadn't done prior to becoming a Warrior. Jordan Poole also made strides, and a number of their G-League style dudes also developed into decent role players that play good defense."
[It irks him too.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/06/23/stephen-curry-regrets-behind-the-back-pass-to-klay-thompson-in-game-7-of-2016-finals/)
"i didnt the mods did  here:  I've seen so many people putting him over LeBron for current best player this year, when he's not even above Kevin Durant (both currently and all-time). If Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were hurt in the 2012 Finals (like Kyrie and Love in 2015) and KD had Kerr instead of Brooks, he would not only have won the Finals, he would have won Finals MVP, something that Wardell Stephen Curry has never been able to do. Additionally, if you replace Kerr with Brooks in 2015, then the Warriors not only would have not won the finals, they wouldn't have even made it past Memphis (which is funny considering tonight)."
And Stephen Curry is one of three finalists in MVP race.. DESPITE the fact that GSW isnt in playoffs.
NOT SORRY LMAO GRAYSON ALLEN &gt; STEPHEN CURRY
Stephen “TO” Curry
If your name is not Stephen curry please do not shoot the basketball
Curry way downtown BANG BANG OH WHAT A SHOT BY STEPHEN CURRY
Stephen Curry is just an absolute treat to watch for any basketball fan.
Stephen Curry is good at basketball.
MVP Stephen Curry?
Let’s go Warriors and by that I mean I really need to see Stephen Curry in the playoffs again
Stephen Curry needs to score tonight in order for the Warriors to win tonight.
1. LeBron James  2. Tracy McGrady   3. Kobe Bryant  4. De’Aaron Fox   5. Tim Duncan  6. DeMarcus Cousins  7. Kyrie Irving  8. Stephen Curry  9. Giannis Antetokounmpo   10.Russell Westbrook
"No but there would be ""Is it time to worry about Stephen Curry?""-threads"
"You people don't like getting called out on your agenda driven nonsense.   The Lakers may have won but Stephen Curry was the best player on the floor in that game.   Y'all **still** can't link to the actual foul calls that you say weren't real fouls, because they were fouls and you know it and you'd look stupid linking to the actual plays.  Have fun watching LeBum Ankle writhe on the floor as he gets eliminated without escaping the West."
"Honestly Jokic and Curry are both unbelievably deserving. By the regular standard by which this award is given Jokic will win, but in a literal sense of Most Valuable Player it's undoubtedly Stephen curry and it's not close really."
"How it started:  &gt; When Lakers governor Jeanie Buss appeared on the podcast last month, she discussed the trade that sent Brown and the draft rights to Marc Gasol to the Grizzlies for Pau. She was attempting to explain how the trade involved two players for one, but Jackson teased that Marc Gasol was the only player traded for Pau Gasol.  https://www.complex.com/sports/kwame-brown-gilbert-arenas-matt-barnes-stephen-jackson-explained/brown-1  Also...  &gt; ...on Showtime’s All The Smoke. In a recent episode reformed NBA tough guys Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson sat down with Gilbert Arenas, the clownish Steph Curry antecedent turned podcast host. When asked about his time with the Washington Wizards, Arenas circled back to his four seasons with Brown. And as much as he tried to tout Brown as a potential best-ever No 1 who had the misfortune of starting his career on the same team Jordan chose to end his, **Arenas couldn’t resist calling Brown a “man child” and “show pony” while rubbing in how he seized primacy on the Wizards in a final blow to Brown’s confidence. All the while, Barnes and Jackson snickered along**. But Brown, in a welcome twist, wasn’t having it. Puffing a hookah from his home with action figures in his likeness and a key to some city in the background, Brown took to YouTube and unloaded on the trio for more than an hour... On ESPN’s The Jump, Barnes feigned surprise. “I get where he’s coming from,” he said. “He’s kind of been the butt of jokes coming into the league and not being able to live up to that No 1 potential. If you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at MJ for picking you No 1.” On Instagram, Jackson was unrepentant. “Your whole career was dirt, your whole life is dirt and it ain’t my job to pour more dirt on you,” he said, wishing him “nothing but success” nevertheless. At the time of writing Brown’s responses to their responses had elapsed more than four hours and effectively seem to say, “if you can’t take the heat, don’t name your podcast All The Smoke.” It’s enough to make you wonder: Where has this guy been all along?  https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/20/kwame-brown-matt-barnes-stephen-jackson-gilbert-arenas-all-the-smoke"
"&gt; Also media personalities saying is curry the best PG of all time, is just shameful. Trying to get clickbait.  Media personalities are literally click whores. They say what they need to garner views. You think Stephen A won’t strip down to a spangled thong if that’s what sells?  Stop looking towards them for journalistic integrity."
"Wow, there is only degree of separation between Wardell STEPHEN Curry and STEPHEN Douglas Kerr - STEPHEN Jackson"

"I mean, we've had 3 blowouts, a game that started as a blowout but got somewhat interesting in the end, and then an actual entertaining game. But that was only that way because of LeBron James and Stephen Curry played in it, which probably wouldn't have happened in any normal year. So far every team that was the higher seed has won so it almost made this whole thing pointless."
"Personally I think Steve Kerr should be DPOY, he is the only one capable of stopping Stephen Curry when we goes nuclear."
"It's pretty ugly.  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 8 out of 100: James, Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 13 players, only 6 were top 3 picks and just 4 were first overall -- over 20 years."
"No awards show according to the ESPN article  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31479904/nikola-jokic-stephen-curry-joel-embiid-named-finalists-nba-mvp-award  &gt;The NBA is reverting to its longtime tradition this year and announcing the various award winners during the playoffs, as opposed to the recently created end-of-season awards show.

Obviously no way to tell that’s what he’s truly doing but it’s very possible.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;shy247er 99 points 3 days ago  &gt; He's just **creating a narrative when Warriors knock them out**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Naekyr  84 points 3 days ago  &gt;Narrative when warriors win: Steph is the MVP no shame losing to MVP  &gt;Narrative when Lakers win: See we beat the MVP, because I'm the GOAT  &gt;**LeMarketing working his magic**   &amp;nbsp;"

my guy stop acting like stephen fucking curry gets fucked by the refs every game. the refs obviously could have been better tonight but it’s not like the league doesn’t want curry to win ever. just enjoy good basketball lmao
"Stephen A is a legit dumb fuck, had Curry gone 0-30 the whole game and had hit the exact same shot in Lebron’s face to win the game he’d be gargling about how clutch he is., he even had the balls to say Curry had no help. Lmao what a fucking joke. Lebron is one of the most disrespected players that’ll probably ever touch the NBA."
"In 2018, he had the highest FG% in deep shots. Bron shoots from that range every game. Sure he's not Stephen Curry level but he squared up to the rim and shot it. No luck there."
"Valid point that would probably be easier to interpret  |Player|Highlights/G|Positive Highlights/G|Negative Highlights/G| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Stephen Curry|3.27|2.52|0.22| |LeBron James|3.09|1.80|0.87|  Again, not surprising that Steph gets more positive highlights because he's the one who had the MVP level season with a flashy playstyle. The difference in negative highlights is huge though."
I dont care what anyone says.  Just LOOK at that defensive attention.  Stephen Curry is the best current basketball player alive.

"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""

"The best player in the league this past season? easily stephen curry or Jokic. Best player in the playoffs? Youre looking at Luka, Dame, or Giannis right now.

Old ass dude isn't going to be balling like he used to. like i get the ""4th prime"" jokes are karma farming, but yall gotta give it a rest. players rise and fall and youve been witnessing lebron's fall for a few years now. a 3 month long offseason before last years Disney Bubble wasn't normal. LeBron's body is too worn down to compete like he used to, unless playoffs came with 3 month long offseasons beforehand"

"Yeah a lot of people think this is a new amount of bounce, but I'm pretty sure he's always had a \*solid vertical\*, though it's never been revealed officially. You can see his explosiveness in his open court speed, lateral quickness and initial burst. Stephen Curry tested at a 35.5 inch vertical, but Kyrie seems like he jumps higher, and he just seems a lot more athletic than Steph so it's weird if his vert is only 33 or 34.  Below is the best dunk I've ever seen him pull off in a warmup. Tough reverse double pump dunk with full extension off two steps.

Hands down Stephen curry
Stephen Curry
"Basically yes. MJ was faster and way more athletic (still holds the NBA vertical jump record with 48 inches), but Kawhi is about 20 pounds heavier and an inch taller.  It has been said multiple times, but MJ in a league with almost the same pace we have today averaged 37/5/4, 35/5/6 and 32/8/8 in a three year stretch in a way more physical league without three-pointers.  For reference, MJ has 10 seasons of averaging over 40 PPG per 100 possessions in his career, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Stephen Curry have 9 of those combined."
He's Stephen Curry. You know who he is.
Stephen Curry.
Why would you model your game after Stephen Curry?
"Meh. Some do it, some don't. Steve Nash and Stephen Curry both line up straight on and are two of the best ever. You don't need to compensate for where your shooting arm is unless your form dictates it."
Stephen Curry. Couldn’t even make the playoffs this year.
I’ll take current Luka over Simmons with a jump shot let alone Luka with great defense    Assuming the jump shot Simmons is getting is  like Tobias Harris level and not Stephen Curry level
Definitely Stephen Curry. He would be that guy throwing spears to kill megafauna from 50 feet away.

"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
"&gt;	 • Arbitrarily determined time frame even if it's meaningful if true.

"The problem is, his title is too weak and so his entire argument is already given up. People don't want to hear what he has to say because of the wording.

Its vague enough to get people to actually read, but direct enough to follow the idea of the article.      Its the author's own fault that people DONT read his article. The title isn't important when it comes to the content, but is important for people who deciding if they want to read it or not.      But let me be clear. The content of his article is stupid anyways, so it may not save him."
"I completely agree that the Warriors were that dominant because Durant was there.   However something you must've forgotten is that the Chicago Bulls, from 1976 to 1984 (the year Jordan was drafted) only made the playoffs twice, and never once reaching the NBA Finals. The iconic Bulls were that good only because they drafted MJ and put a championship roster around him.  I would like to point out the fact that, in the four year span before KD joined GSW, from 2013 to 2017, the Warriors made the playoffs each year, reaching the NBA Finals twice, winning the title in 2015, having drafted a two-time MVP in Stephen Curry, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, one of the best and soon to be DPOY defenders in the league and some quality role players. Piling on to that the Warriors tore most of the regular season records to shreds, in the Win Column, in the 3PT territory and completely revolutionised the game itself.  So while I agree that the addition of KD made the team a Dynasty, it would be moronic to assume that they wouldn't be favoured title contenders without him, atleast for two or three years."
Who was the better player for the series as a whole? Stephen Curry. Who was the most impactful player? Stephen Curry.
"a better player cant join a lesser player? there is a reason kd was the one winning the finals mvps when they were together. and just to quote kerr.Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."" also he once said “I would say Kevin (Durant) is ... when you factor in everything, size, speed, athleticism, I think he’s the most talented basketball player I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kerr said.  “It was more just a level of basketball that I’m not sure had ever been reached before.”"

"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14.

"And they're grinding it playing at a higher pace that involves far more long jump shots.

I mean Curry is Curry lol  Tatum is good but he aint close to being Stephen Curry
Magic Johnson   Stephen Curry   Oscar Robertson   Steve Nash   Who’s he better than?
"that’s why the KD Warriors are the best team in basketball period. Not only do you have arguably the greatest scorer of all time in Kevin “you know who I am” Durant, but you added him to the best regular season team of all time led by Stephen Curry whose offensive +/- the past 7 healthy seasons has been number 1 in the league.   Steph also has an argument for greatest scorer of all time and has the most influential gravity the game has ever seen, on par with shaq. We witnessed that this past season, and he led the league in points and ppg on league best efficiency on whatever minimum shot attempts (Kevin “you know who I am” Durant actually led it but he had too few games to be in contention).  Then you had Klay “Game 6“ Thompson, who can get BUCKETS with the best of em. No one is hotter than Klay Thompson when they get hot, he has the NBA records to prove that. 6’7’ SG who was at one time the best two way player in the entire league. The ultimate SG you’d want on a 5 man rotation. There are levels to catch and shoot. And he guarded the opposing team’s best perimeter player most nights.  This is rounded out by Draymond Green, the modern era’s best defender period.  We took for granted that it wasn’t just all stars joining forces, it was literally two Top 15 players of ALL TIME, and 2 (3 if you think Iguodala gets in) other Hall of Famers. Yeah, watching what Steph and KD did individually this past season was spectacular to watch as a fan. Here’s hoping that Klay, too, makes us remember how fucking badass he is. The game will feel robbed if he doesn’t"
"The only good series imo he’s had in his career:  Conference Finals vs Gs. (2015)   James Harden had 3 good games this series, but in the most important for his team games 3 &amp; 5 he was absolutely pathetic for a superstars standards. Outplayed badly by Stephen Curry.  28.4 ppg 7.8 rpg 6.4 apg on 46.7 % Fg 42.9 % 3pt &amp; 86.8 % Fts"

"""Stephen Curry has invited you to Lake ~~Laogai~~ Merritt."""
Correct me if Im wrong but I think both Stephen Curry and Andrew Wiggins are part of the Golden State Warriors’ roster.
"Decline or get shots, with it being 3 foul shots if the foul is behind the 3 line whether the player is in the shooting motion or not. For example down by 3, if a Giannis gets fouled, the coach probably chooses possesion because Giannis misses too many shots. If Stephen Curry gets fouled, coach probably takes the 3 foul shots because Curry has a good chance of making all 3 and tying the game."

I call it the Stephen Curry effect haha.
"This is the dude who pissed off Steph and prompted him to sign with Under Armour.  https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nike-lost-steph-armour/story?id=39539498  &gt; The pitch meeting, according to Steph's father Dell, who was present, kicked off with one Nike official accidentally addressing Stephen as ""Steph-on,"" the moniker, of course, of Steve Urkel's alter ego in Family Matters. ""I heard some people pronounce his name wrong before,"" says Dell Curry. ""I wasn't surprised. I was surprised that I didn't get a correction."" &gt;  &gt; It got worse from there. A PowerPoint slide featured Kevin Durant's name, presumably left on by accident, presumably residue from repurposed materials. ""I stopped paying attention after that,"" Dell says. Though Dell resolved to ""keep a poker face,"" throughout the entirety of the pitch, the decision to leave Nike was in the works."
"Lol, I Googled him and it brought up this story of how our new GM lost Steph for Nike. Welcome aboard.   ""According to Dell, Nike didn’t send power broker Lynn Merritt for the meeting instead sending Sports Marketing Director Nico Harrison, who managed to mispronounce Stephen Curry’s name, calling him “Steph-ON” and having the audacity to present a PowerPoint presentation featuring Kevin Durant’s name in lieu of Steph Curry’s.""  http://thehoopdoctors.com/2016/03/nike-lost-steph-curry/"
"Curry avg post-season usage is 29.1 That's why I compare Trae Young to LeBron James. And no offense, this year is the highest usage in Stephen Curry career and he couldn't make the post season."
"Since 03 I would say the best 2 are 09 and 11.  09 has Blake Griffin, James Harden and Stephen Curry who will make the HoF (2 of whom reached MVP level), also had multi-time All Star Demar DeRozan who honestly might get into the Hof, pls Jrue Holdiay and Jeff Teague all made at least one All Star team.  Then 2011 you have Kawhi, Kyrie, Klay, Jimmy Butler who are all probably going to make the HoF, plus two additional All Star players in Kemba and Vuc.  And as for your last statement, for this class to be better than 03, either Luka would have to basically be the GOAT, with another player being like Top 20 all time, OR, this class would to have like 3-4 guys be Top 10-15 players.  For 96, again, Luka will need to end up being one of the 10 best players ever, with Trae Young and Ayton being on the short list for consideration as Top 30 guys.  I'm sorry, I can't say ""yeah, I really see that happening""."
Does wardell Stephen curry jr not exist?
"No, you know what's uninteresting? Fucking super team after super team led by Lebron, Durant, or Curry marching their way to the NBA Finals every year. I am so freaking excited that we have some new faces here. How cool will it be if Chris Paul or Giannis end up winning their first title?  Edit: Stephen A is the absolute worst."
So Stephen Curry is never gonna participate in a Olympics then
"As someone who doesn't watch NBA, but is aware of it, as I keep an eye on most sports, it seems like the only NBA players that exist are Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry &amp; James Harden."
"Even Salt Lake City?  I remember that a few years ago the Warriors had a bunch of time there, and a bunch of the players were trying to figure out something to do (because there's not much compared to other places).

In the photo, the team poses at an escape room in Salt Lake City. The caption: #nightlife.  &gt;In case you missed last year's weakest Warriors controversy, here's what went down: During the Western Conference playoffs, ESPN asked the Warriors if they preferred the nightlife in Los Angeles or Utah during their between-games downtime.  &gt;""No comparison. There's no such thing, man,"" then-Warriors forward Matt Barnes said. ""There's no nightlife in Utah.""  &gt;**""The problem with Utah is that you're just sitting there and your mind is, like, dead**, because in L.A., you still got energy for the game,"" added Andre Iguodala. ""Because you're in L.A., you're like, 'Man, this is just the vibe in L.A.' but in Utah, it can kind of lull you to sleep.""  &gt;Soon after the story broke, ""nightlife"" started trending on Twitter. The ""Visit Salt Lake"" tourism bureau even shared a two-minute video highlighting the city's attractions called, ""There's Nothing to Do in Salt Lake.""  &gt;Luckily, it looks like the Warriors found some of the elusive Salt Lake City nightlife this year. Omri Casspi, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee (and his fanny pack), Nick Young, Zaza Pachulia, Jordan Bell and Andre Iguodala all appear in the escape room snap with Curry. Missing are Klay Thompson (probably playing ""Call of Duty"") and Kevin Durant (perhaps the photographer).  &gt;According to its website, the Escape Key has four different rooms with mad scientist lab, Sherlock Holmes, Russian spy and CSI themes. In case you were worried they didn't make it out, McGee posted proof that they did.  &gt;""The champs made it out the escape room,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""TeamWork make the DreamWork!"""

Stephen Curry
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
"&gt;But it's bold of you to assume I'm 'no one knows anything about basketball' just because I'm fucking around posting a cherry picked stat lol.  I didn't assume anything about you.  I said anyone who would base a judgement on a player based on 8 3pt attempts knows nothing about basketball.  If you don't do that, then that statement doesn't apply to you.    &gt;He shoots 32% for his career from 3, and declined abysmally to 26.6% in Denver. He's always been a player tries to do too much, and he's surprisngly a great fit in Denver ever since he's bought into the system, but are we really talking about this guy like he's a 40% shooter for his career? Relax.  I also never said Gordon was a knockdown shooter (although, compared to Ben Simmons, he's Stephen Curry).  All I said was that we can't judge whether or not he provides spacing based on 8 attempts.  Anything beyond that is your own assumption."

In 2013, a point guard named Stephen Curry begins to change how basketball is played by shooting three point shots at an efficiency, difficulty level and volume that broke defenses. Armed with a lethal shot and an amazing team with Klay Thompson and Draymomd Green, Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to 5 straight championships, winning 3. Kevin Durant joined the warriors in 2016, after losing to Currys Warriors, and to the dismay of many NBA fans, helped the warriors win the final two championships they won in decade.   Important players: Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Chris Paul and Giannis Antetekumpo."
When did Reggie Jackson turn into Stephen Curry.
Is Luke Kennard Stephen Curry?
I’m saying Stephen Curry is a better basketball player than James Harden. That’s what I’m saying.
"If those shooters were Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry and prime Ray Allen, then yes, he would become a great"
"“Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the best shooters I’ve played with,” Durant said. “Joe Harris is definitely right up there, getting there.”"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-joe-harris-is-right-up-there-with-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-as-a-shooter/amp/
i can confidently say stephen curry is a better shooter than joe harris despite having worse 3p percentage
Kept that 30 on him like he's Stephen curry
"I have to say this again so what is he’s the best three point shooter, IN THE REGULAR SEASON HE’S NOT STEPHEN CURRY!"
Because Stephen Curry plays in the Western Conference and KD is going up against the great Mike Budenholzer.
Stephen Curry does 1 dribble and shoots it. Jimmy Butler does 2 dribbles and shoots it. James Harden takes 1 dribble and shoots it. Trae Young takes 1 free throw and shoots it. Joel Embiid takes 1 dribble and shoots it.  Giannis taking 6 dribbles before shooting his free throw is the problem.
"Giannis took 6 dribbles on his most recent free throw. He was taking 5 dribbles in game 6. He added an extra dribble to his routine.   For comparison, Stephen Curry takes one dribble before shooting. Giannis needs to be more like Stephen Curry. I would consider Stephen Curry an expert on shooting."
Giannis needs to start doing one dribble and shoot. That's what Stephen Curry does and I would consider Curry an expert on shooting.
"“Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the best shooters I’ve played with,” Durant said. “Joe Harris is definitely right up there, getting there.”"
"“Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the best shooters I’ve played with,” Durant said. “Joe Harris is definitely right up there, getting there.”"
You forget to mention Reggie ‘MJ’ Jackson and Pat ‘Stephen Curry’ Beverly running around shooting back to back 3s in the clutch. HOLY WHAT A GAME
Stephen Curry the only midget in the list
Terrance man or Stephen curry ? Wtf is he on today
The lights come back on and Stephen Curry is in seths jersey
"Seth ""Stephen Curry"" Curry"
"Haupt, Max  MVP Voting:   Curry, Stephen (GSW)   Doncic, Luka (DAL)   Westbrook, Russell (WAS)   Simmons, Ben (PHI)   Antetokounmpo, Giannis (MIL)"
"The NBA salary cap is a soft cap, meaning that it only really impedes signing free agents to your team. As long as ownership is willing to pony up luxury tax every now and then, retaining stars for a short championship window is viable.  The other reason this is possible is that the NBA max contract is criminally low, even if it's pretty high in terms of absolute dollars. This means that the truly elite, the 1% of NBA stars, are actually *underpaid* relative to their production, because they're sitting in the same salary tier as second or even third tier stars.  The Durant Warriors only happened because of an unprecedented leap in the salary cap in 2015-16 that was made possible because of a newly-inked television deal, and because Warriors franchise star Stephen Curry was still on a very team-friendly extension that saw him making 12 million dollars a year.  The Nets had Durant and Irving sign as free agents, taking up most of their salary cap, then brought in Harden through trade. This meant that most of their roster were either cheap rookie contracts or veteran minimums, with other guys like Joe Harris being secured on team-friendly contracts as well. The current owner, Joe Tsai, is also willing to pony up the money and is in a big market too."

So does coach Bud no gameplan and mistaking his superstar Giannis seemingly with Stephen Curry. I swear if Giannis keeps making 3p attempts...
Now that lebron has  declined especially his scoring prowess there is really hardly any debate about Durant being the best right now.   Stephen Curry is the only one I am willing to hear an argument for but with how well Durant is playing defensively I think he has to be the clear cut best player in the nba right now    KDs game 5 performance was in the running for the greatest two way game i have ever watched
"The Warriors have a history of small ball and ball-movement-based offenses, going back to the small ball of the we believe team and the run and gun style of Run TMC. The modern dynasty run and the 07 We Believe run were also underrated in terms of scrappy defense. I think you can construct just such a lineup using only historic Warriors players:   PG: Stephen Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Chris Mullin PF: Stephen Jackson C: Draymond Green  6th man: Juan Toscano-Anderson to rep Oakland.  While Kevin Durant was a truly great player for GSW, he was never quite the cultural fit that this prompt suggests."
Stephen Curry has more chance to miss a freethrow than Ben making it lol
"Ok but did you make the same uproar when Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Stephen Curry, David Lee etc all got hurt and didn’t get the chance to play? Is it only because your team and your players don’t have a chance to win? The players union agreed to it and they all wanted to play, this is what happens. Half the all stars are already injury prone and have problems before the bubble. This is just another excuse."
"1987-88 - Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan      1988-89 - Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan      2002-03 - Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady      2004-05 - Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash      2009-10 - Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade      2018-19 - Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Paul George, James Harden, Stephen Curry      Here are a few of my contenders, I think 87-88 might be my pick."
"Your argument is that I'm not an NBA scout? Are you a joke? I watch more than most of this sub. You literally aren't making an argument besides shitty defensive statistics. Stephen Curry has made MASSIVE strides on defense since 2014. He's not All Defense level obviously, he's not even great. But he's a bit above average positionally, at the least important position for defense. I watch my teams games, I'm familiar with the sport, I know how defense works and when a guy isn't good at it. Curry puts in the effort and knows where he's supposed to be. He's a high IQ player who is limited by a short wingspan and having to carry the team on offense. He hasn't been actually bad defensively in years."
"3pt shooting has been climbing, but it jumped several fucking goalposts all because of Wardell Stephen Curry."
"Oubre should have played better and smarter. As an athletic wing just entering his prime he'd have had much better options in free agency.  Instead he looked off Steph, didn't relocate for Steph, lost all confidence in his 3 ball and is one of a super tiny list of players to be a net negative playing next to Stephen Curry.  He 100% cost himself money last season."
"&gt;Basketball isn't that simple  No, it isn't simple, but you are still wrong.  Schroder drove and dished to Harrell, Davis, and Drummond with regularity, and drove and kicked to various shooters as well.  And that's exactly how he wracked up more assists than any other secondary ballhandler except Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, and two of the Pacers.  In some offensive systems, players can acquire assists just by making perimeter passes, yes.  But Vogel is not an offensive coach, and the Lakers had no offensive system beyond ""Give James or Schroder or Davis the ball, and hope they do something good.""  Next time, watch some games before commenting."
"Stephen Curry is the most efficient 20+ PPG scorer in the history of the game.  In his peak days, Jordan needed 23 shots per game and 10 FT's PPG to average 30+ points.  Steph does it with 21 shots and 4 FT's per game.  That is a very bad example from your side. Jordan could probaby average a lot of points sbut that would come at the expense of his team winning actual basketball games."
Hot Take : Stephen Curry is the best PG in NBA history.
"people just look at the 4-0 and think the Spurs had no chance. the only game we truly got smoked was Game 2 because the entire team looked shook af without two of our leading starters. and even while missing players, Games 3 and 4 were still pretty competitive (contrary to what the final score might show you)  - we were missing our starting PG in Tony Parker, who was having a great playoffs until his injury, resulting us in having to start Patty Mills against Stephen Curry  - we would've won the first game 100% if Kawhi didn't get injured, giving the team huge momentum against a superteam  - Danny Green was playing without his WING STOP running mate, resulting in a massive hole in our defence  - Pau Gasol was running on fumes and getting run off the court because he was essentially our only big who was decent and gave a shit since...  - ...LaMarcus completely gave up (this was before he requested a trade and worked things out with Pop) because he was being forced to play as a center and getting double-teamed on every possession  - Jonathan Simmons looked checked out of trying to win at this point and seemed like he was just playing for his contract year  - we lost David Lee (who had become a key rotation player) after he was injured in Game 3  - our best player was 39 year old Manu Ginobili for fucks sake lol"
"I started watching the NBA 18 months ago... and I spotted an interesting pattern: watch this season as many games as you can... all teams included... and then you'll see for yourself where you should go back in time and inform yourself with background stories... can't say I'm a specialist... but it sure does help me a lot in my betting career... but watching previous entire seasons is pointless. In 2-3 years 80% of all that information will be pointless (Pareto strategy: 20% of all activities account for 80% of all consequences... which means that the other 80% is less important)... if you start this season I will advise watching young prospects and rising stars, but also... turning points like... MJ, Kobe, LeBron, Stephen Curry and guys who influenced the league in a major way... also... some guys go unnoticed but also have huge impacts, it is up to you to choose your protagonists, and let time filter all this info for you. Good luck and enjoy the Association"

"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."

"&gt;If Schroeder had a more solid and consistent 3 ball  He'd make at least $25M a season, probably more.  Check the list of veteran players who averaged more assists than Schroder last year.  The only two who made less than Schroder were TJ McConnell and Ricky Rubio. Rubio is one of the worst shooters in the league, and doesn't defend. McConnell is a 7ppg player.    The rest of that 6+ assist club? Westbrook, Young, Paul, Doncic, Draymond Green, Jokic, Lillard, Morant, Fox, Butler, DeRozen, Simmons, Sabonis, VanVleet, LaMelo Ball, Garland, Jrue Holiday, Conley, Irving, Randle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brogdon, and Stephen Curry.  Not many cheap players on that list.  Playmaking is one of the rarest and most-valuable skills in basketball."

"warriors had an injured team and still made the finals they had jordan bell starting and qiunn cook playing heavy minutes, and jonas and demarcus  and kevon looney , need a go on? klay was injured playing and broke down because of the heavy load , same with kevin   &amp;#x200B;  its not that hard to beat a injured team and giving your best 9 players heavy minutes to capitalize on that , it was basically stephen curry that series vs the raptors. Keep hyping them up tho , because in reality they are just role players lol"

"What if the Suns trade Frank Kaminsky and in the offseason he shrinks 9 inches, develops a 3 point shot and changes his name to Stephen Curry? Do the Suns fire Robert Sarver?"

Oubre is actually fuckin bad though. He wants to be that dude on a team that has Stephen curry. Go play on the Twolves and he is still a #3 option FOH

"OMG! What do you want? Prime Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Shaq and Giannis??? Yes he’s had way more than enough help. Had more help than Curry, Westbrook, and Kobe.

"He knows it isn't true. Just like 90% of the people who say Drake likes kids know it isn't true.

"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"

"So, First Take use to be Skip and Stephen A going at each other (Skip was the big dog tho)… when they first started it was entertaining because the “debates” and “argument” came off as organic to the topic.  When Skip left and Max came on it was the beginning of the transition of ESPN becoming E”Stephen”PN. So, early on they had SAS turn the SASness up to 100 and essentially every topic early on was them arguing instead actually debating. Like SAS would go out of his way to pick a fight with Max:  Molly: is Steph the greatest shooter of all time?  Max: of all time? Yes.  SAS: Max Kellerman you should have you b-ball card revoked… Curry is the greatest shooter of all the times plural… that means this universe and all parallel universes!"
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2741955-report-stephen-curry-player-contract-option-no-trade-clause-denied-by-warriors  This seems to speak to the contrary
"What does KD have to do with this? Stephen Curry choked in the 2016 Finals, simple as that, up 3-1 and choke in game 7, being outscored by Draymond lol. One of if not the biggest choke jobs in NBA history, 73-9 team with the Unanimous MVP? Blowing a 3-1 lead"
Not exactly the *most* surprising but Stephen Curry set the record for the most points in a 4 game playoff sweep in the 2019 WCF where he averaged 37ppg (146 total points) on 66% TS against the Blazers to sweep them without Kevin Durant.

"but some of them did not have them in for practice, and that sort of thing can lead to timberwolves picking johnny flynn over stephen curry.  I can't exactly blame a franchise for valuing a prospect's willingness to show up for a workout, but that sort of thing can lead FOs astray."
&gt;Tell that to the people from literally anywhere else in the bay. What’s the point of gate keeping who gets to be a fan  Fuck them. They ain't from the town 🤣  &gt;We’re talking about getting fans in seats to watch the warriors. Winning = fans. Draymond = winning  Splash brothers = fans.  They'll win a few less but theyll be around the same seed they were this season and selling fine because at the end of the day; Stephen motherfucking Curry. That guy will be selling out games if he was playing in the G league or for Orlando or something.
"I'm fully on board with this. It's hard to think about potentially hurting our future by trading promising young guys, but it's once in a blue moon you have a Stephen Curry on your team. Even rarer to have a Klay Thompson *also*, so I think it's insane to not go all in on that real present in exchange for *maybe* a good future."
kd is a bum who never won anything before Stephen Curry unanimous MVP 73-9
Let's not forget about the Warriors with Stephen Curry and Juan Toscano-Anderson (the 2018 Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional MVP).
Wanted to find a team to support and I didn't know where to start. Watched games from almost very team early in the season fell in love with Oracle's atmosphere and with Stephen Curry.
Best active basketball players alive  1.) lebron James  2.) stephen curry  3.) kawhi Leonard  4.) Kyrie Irving  5.) giannis anteteonlydunkstho    Best player to deceive community with burner accounts  1.) Kevin Durant
Nah they just need Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and they'll be good.
Good thing he’s got Stephen Wardell Curry there to give him an example
I’ve actually thought about this before. Worthy players to add IMO  LeBron James Kobe Bryant Tim Duncan Kevin Durant Kevin Garnett Dirk Nowitzki Dwyane Wade Stephen Curry Steve Nash Jason Kidd Allen Iverson Gary Payton Ray Allen Reggie Miller Dominique Wilkins (snubbed last time) Kawhi Leonard Chris Paul Vince Carter Paul Pierce Dwight Howard Carmelo Anthony Jason Kidd Tracy McGrady Chris Webber Yao Ming Bob McAdoo Tony Parker James Harden Giannis Antetokounmpo Russel Westbrook Alonzo Mourning Grant Hill
Myers and Lacob need to stop talking out of their ass. Stop talking about the “future” and “even Joe Montana didn’t stay a 49er forever” with Stephen fucking Curry on your team.
"They should have known it would be difficult post-Durant &amp; after their core got paid. The Warriors' payroll and veterans make it really difficult to re-build on the fly.  The Warriors' payroll is LOCKED UP for the next few years and they're committed to almost $140 million for just to 4 players  *Players* | 2021-22 | 2022-23 :-- | --: | --: Stephen Curry | 45.8 | — Klay Thompson | 37.9 | 40.6 Andrew Wiggins | 31.6 | 33.6 Draymond Green | 24.0 | 25.8  If Curry leaves next FA, the Warriors have *no* chance at contention without a rebuild."
Take Stephen curry over Johnny Flynn
"If they come into next season with two experimental projects in Kuminga and Wiseman, I'd think twice about signing that extension if I were Stephen Curry."

"&gt;	 Famed Nike power broker and LeBron James adviser Lynn Merritt was not present, a possible indication of the priority -- or lack thereof -- that Nike was placing on the meeting. Instead, Nico Harrison, a sports marketing director at the time, ran the meeting (Harrison, who has since been named Nike's vice president of North America basketball operations, did not respond to multiple interview requests).  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour"
"In addition to all his shooting shenanigans in his unanimous MVP season, Stephen Curry led the league in steals."
"Was 2009 considered the player empowerment era? Because this stuff happened back then as well.  https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/s/the-story-of-how-stephen-curry-s-agent-and-dad-didn-t-want-the-warriors-to-draft-him-023517645.html  EDIT: There's a lesson here for the Rockets. Even if they don't want to play for you, if you think they are the best player you should take them anyway."
"10x was clearly exaggeration for effect.   The point being they don't need the salary as they make more money from endorsements than they do from their salary or comparable amounts.   LBJs endorsements count for 64% of his income. KDs count for 55% of his income. Stephen curry is around 50% as is Giannis, westbrook around 40% Zion makes 66% of his income from endorsements.   All I'm saying is they don't **need** the massive salary."
"Definitely. His last 2 seasons in the playoffs he's shot the three ball like peak Stephen Curry.       83/179 for 46.4% on 11 3PA per game.      He's also 261/640, 41% from three over his last 70 games of pro ball. A big improvement from earlier in his career where he had ""chucker"" tendencies."
"No.  The rules are different and FIBA 3x3 is super fast paced. It’s non stop. There is no stoppage, no time outs. Those 40 year old retired players would have a heart attack after one game or tear an ACL or rupture an achilles   It’s also more physical. Hand checking is allowed. Even shoulder checking is not called. If a player has a weakness in their game, especially on defense, it will get exposed  If america wants to win gold in 3x3 in the Olympics, they’re going to need to send their best YOUNG players  Even then, guys like Steph Curry, Kyrie, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, etc would get EXPOSED. They’re not built for the 3x3 format. They would be complete liabilities on defense and they can’t be hidden. They would get hammered physically. James Harden and Chris Paul would have to ditch their foul-baiting and flopping ways since they wouldn’t get ANY calls  Lebron would adjust and adapt and do very well in 3x3. Kawhi Leonard would also be excellent. Kevin Durant might struggle with the physicality but the dude can still shoot over anyone so he would be a good pick up. John Wall would be great as well. So would Klay Thompson. Westbrook would be excellent…..except he has a super inconsistent outside shot and you have to be able to shoot in 3x3.   If America sends guys like 50 year olds like Stephen Jackson, Cuttino Mobley and Iso Joe, they’re not going to last, especially playing two games a day. They will absolutely tear something or get a heart attack"

"It is pretty insane the chokehold LeBron has had on “best player on the planet” for over a decade. Even in KD’s best years he was always the “clear cut number 2” because LeBron was that high above everyone else. Only time I can think of where it was a legit discussion who the best in the world was, was Stephen Curry in 2016."
"Steph and Dame both scare me when they play my team   That said, Stephen Curry is electric on a whole different level"
"Y'all wildin. The disrespect to Stephen Curry in this thread is disgusting and this is coming from a Thunder fan. I still get a sick pleasure in watching the Warriors lose. But the man changed the game.   But on topic. KD, Lebron, Curry. Others you mentioned are for sure possibilities. Giannis/Kawhi being the closest imo. But like Zion? Sure the potential is obviously there but god damn they need to actually do something or else we can call every athletic monstrosity a generational talent lol."
Stephen Curry in 2015-16 for sure:  - Unanimous MVP  - 73-9 record  - 402 threes and 50/45/91 splits  - Scoring Champ/Steals Champ with the least minutes averaged by an MVP winner (until Giannis in 2020)  - 3 50+ point games and 4 games with 10+ 3s  - 66.9% TS and led the league in many advanced stat categories  - Top 5 in MIP voting too

I will get destroyed but I seriously think not injured kawhi is better than current LeBron. Not injured kawhi means pre current injury. Also Stephen curry is barely a top 5 player and his defensive weakness is sometimes very hard to hide when the warriors miss some defensive players.

Trae Young  Damian Lillard  Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry
"Trae Young Dame Lillard Stephen Curry  This is more of a Level 90, 95, and 100 Charizard."
Kevin Durant vs Stephen Curry
"I thought it would be a joke with him saying ""get the elbow in, so you can get maximum velocity as you pass the fuckin ball to Stephen Curry instead"""
"A good example of this is Stephen Curry. He led the league in scoring this year on insane efficiency and didn’t even make the playoffs. Any further championship success he has will be because guys like Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman end up good instead of being bad.   So whether Steph caps out as being Top 10-15 range all time or cracking into that Top 3 by getting to 6 rings has pretty much nothing to do with what he does and entirely to do with what his teammates do."
Stephen Curry.
"I took a long time to reply cause I don't check reddit while eating lunch or off work hours. I didn't mention upvotes. You took even longer to reply. James Harden isn't as good as Stephen Curry and LeBron being a better player than Kareem isn't a counterargument, you weird dunce."
Stephen Curry has blurry vision. He also out-rebounded Tristan Thompson in the 2017 &amp; 2018 Finals
"I'm taking Kobe but Kawhi is literally right there. Honestly on any given day flip a coin and I'd be okay with either. People are gonna bring up Kawhi's insane efficiency (for good reason, the man is the epitome of consistency) but Kawhi has never played on a bad team, he's literally always played on a contender, a luxury kobe didn't have his whole career, so when you're the focal point of the offense with no other reliable options, you're efficiency is gonna take a dip no matter how good you are (unless your name is stephen curry). Both guys are elite defenders but kawhi is more versatile, kobe has a deeper bag offensively, both are great rebounders (with Kawhi having the edge), kobe is a better leader and a better facilitator. It's Honestly very close"
Stephen curry with lockdown defense and not as much range. I guess a mix of Steph and Gary Payton
"I don’t think players who were eligible and had played the bulk of their careers the last time should be added. If their peers and people who actually watched them didn’t add them, I doubt people looking up their stats know better.   **Next 25:**  1) LeBron James  2) Kobe Bryant  3) Tim Duncan  4) Kevin Durant  5) Stephen Curry  6) Giannis Ant.  7) Kevin Garnett  8) Dirk Nowitzki  9) Dwyane Wade  10) James Harden  11) Russell Westbrook  12) Paul Pierce  13) Ray Allen   14) Chris Paul  15) Jason Kidd  16) Carmelo Anthony   17) Steve Nash  18) Dwight Howard  19) Kawhi Leonard  20) Gary Payton  21) Tony Parker  22) Dikembe Mutombo  23) Pau gasol  24) Anthony Davis  25) Klay Thompson  Honorable Mentions: Alonzo Mourning, Derrick Rose, Tracy McGrady, Reggie Miller, Chris Bosh, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Ben Wallace"
When he said he would take Andre Iguodala if the fate of the world/ game is on the line over Stephen Curry……
"I know you're meme-ing, but I was actually curious so I did some searching and this is some crazy shit:    Player | Total Playoff Minutes | Playoff Points Per 100 Poss | TS% ---|---|----|---- Michael Jordan | 7474 | 43.3 | 56.8% James Harden | 4844 | 33.1 | 58.9% Kevin Durant | 6083 | 37.3 | 60.0% Stephen Curry | 4235 | 34.8 | 60.9% Damian Lillard | 2458 | 31.8 | 56.1%  Jordan's scoring volume is fuckin out of control, and that's before the 3PT era too. Bonkers shit"
"Curry literally trains his diaphragm by putting [sandbag weights on his stomach](https://bluemanhoop.com/2021/01/23/stephen-currys-unbelievable-tactic/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COnce%20he's%20out%20of%20breath,%2C%20and%20train%2C%20Curry's%20diaphragm.&amp;text=This%20unbelievable%20method%20of%20training,almost%20anybody%20in%20the%20league.) and improving his heart rate recovery so he can lower to 80 bpm after a timeout. He's hella dedicated to conditioning and I wouldn't be surprised if he has crazy longevity."
"I don’t care what anyone says, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green was a superteam. The only reason people act like they’re not is because the KD team is wayyy better in comparison but having the clear two best shooters of all time and one of the greatest defenders ever was so unfair. And they’re still together. Man I hope Klay looks at least a little close to 100%."
"I don’t give a fuck what anyone says. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green was a fucking superteam. The only reason people act like they’re not is because the KD team is wayyy better in comparison but having the clear two best shooters of all time and one of the greatest defenders ever was so unfair.

"They do mention the history of this in the article:  &gt; Before Monday, the last professional basketball team to meet with the president after a championship was the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers.  &gt; The reason for the drought is fairly obvious. Former President Donald Trump's animus toward the WNBA and NBA, two of the most socially progressive leagues in the country, was well-known to anyone who followed his Twitter account. Once he entered office, White House visits for both leagues dried up, due to both a lack of invitations and interest.  &gt; The 2017 Golden State Warriors had Stephen Curry signal he had no interest in visiting Trump, prompting the president to publicly declare their invitation had been “withdrawn.” The 2017 Minnesota Lynx didn't receive an invite at all. The 2018 Warriors didn’t even bother discussing it. Bird said the 2018 Storm didn't consider a trip either. The 2019 Toronto Raptors apparently had Trump’s support to visit, but a trip never materialized. The 2019 Washington Mystics never got an invite either.  So basically they mention everything except the one single fact that it was the Lynx back in 2016. But they do say the first in five years right in the headline, which takes us back to 2016."
"&gt;	The list of active NBA players with at least 2 Championships is actually surprisingly short: ​  1. (1 player) Lebron James ​  1.

Edit: lol, and the formatting gets messed up even worse when quoting it. 🤷🏾‍♂️"
has there been a single other instance of an nba player being stephen fucking curry?
Here’s an article following the 2013 playoffs with the byline “Stephen Curry used the 2013 NBA Playoffs to become a superstar for the Golden State Warriors”  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1647606-whats-next-for-stephen-curry-after-impressive-2012-13-season
1. Stephen Curry  2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Trae Young 5. Chris Paul 6. Ja Morant 7. Jrue Holiday 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Ben Simmons 10. Russell Westbrook  That's their top 10
After curry went nuclear in April and his team still went 8-8 I separated his individual and team performance. Warriors were hot garbage last two years.  [Curry's April stats](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/stephen-curry-april-2021-stats)   37.3 points (51.8% / 46.6% / 90.8%)  6.1 rebounds  4.6 assists  And warriors still went 8-8. Such a waste lol.
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
Imagine thinking Andrew Wiggins before he even played an NBA game was going to be better than MVP Stephen Curry
"[Wojnarowski] Kyrie Irving on his unexpected retirement: ""The third eye leads us where truth begins, I have to follow the path of justice, basketball is a gold vortex""   [Charania] Young socialite Ben Simmons has been banished to Minnesota, sources tell the Athletic  [Highlight] Stephen Curry hits the deep three for 102 points in the game, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain for the all time record   [Highlight] Klay Thompson scores his 51st point of the quarter"
Prediction:  Stephen Curry name Klay Thompson’s combine for 90 points in back to back games.
You forgot good play by Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry GOAT
"&gt; I'm just wondering why the disparity, and has there ever been such a wide disparity between stat sheet and acclaim?  Bob McAdoo might be close.  His statistics from his twenties are astonishing, and compare very favorably with, for example, Kevin Durant's.  McAdoo did win one MVP, like Westbrook, and nearly won two others -- missing out only due to the presence of Abdul-Jabbar in his prime.  Theoretically, that should put him very close to the 2-MVP tier of players like Karl Malone and Stephen Curry and at least alongside other 1-time winners like O'Neal, Olajuwon, Garnett, and others.  I don't think anyone outside his immediate family ranks McAdoo that high.  Another guy is Artis Gilmore.  Gilmore played 18 total seasons across the ABA and NBA, and retired averaging 19 / 12 and was the NBA's most efficient scorer of all time, which is a title he still holds quite remarkably.  That, combined with outstanding defense should have him a lot higher on most people's lists.  His teams didn't win very much, but you'll be hard-pressed to find anything else that Gilmore could've done to help them."
Right after Stephen Curry Draymond Green is my second favorite player of all time.
The reverse team would probably be:   PG: Stephen Curry  SG: James Harden  SF: Julius Erving  PF: Karl Malone  C: David Robinson
stephen curry will go insane and cut his dick off in the 3rd quarter
Eh not fussed they probably weren’t around for the Ellis/ curry days.   [he gave up around 15 mil for an extension to not hit free agency due to ankle concerns](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2013/5/7/4308108/stephen-curry-contract-warriors-restricted-free-agent)  Hindsight now seems crazy but there were worries then that his glass ankles would keep him off the court too much
"So really the question is, who can guard HOF-or near HOF-level players at each position well, meaning who can guard Magic, Curry, Jordan, Kobe, Bird, LeBron, Malone, Duncan, Shaq, Kareem. So no one. You think Stephen Jackson could guard Curry?"
Stephen Curry
"&gt;He had about as much chance of winning MVP that season as KD did in 2017  Bad comparison. KD wasn't winning the MVP in 17 not because people hated him, it's because he missed 20 games and his numbers were not better than several people, *including Stephen Curry.* Curry actually got more MVP votes that season."
Wardell Stephen Curry II  (+ Daryl Morey)
"Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, Bill Russell.   MJ surrounded by elite shooting &amp; élite defense with 4 players who  understand team offense and can exist off the ball. 4 alphas but also team players with no insecure mind (hello Kobe, LBJ, Wilt &amp; Shaq) which could ruin chemistry. Larry can obviously have the ball in his hands while MJ and Steph cut &amp; run constantly. Timmy can post up or stay at 5/6m, even wait in a corner if you ask him gently. Bill is deadly fast in transition, MJ as well obviously.  In the other end, 3 all-time defenders and 2 average ball defenders but good team defenders when you ask him nicely.  You can argue that two Big men are too much in modern NBA but it's an all-time competition, nothing says that we have to be driven by the last 8 years strategy.   5 hard workers with sense of humor. And with a pathologic love of winning.  No way you beat this team."
"he saw stephen curry _suck_ in 2019-20 and that's all he needs to know! 😤  (he did play against him 3x last season, though.  kind of got the whole range: bad steph game, average for steph game, great steph game.)"
stephen curry was also born near them and have brought them nothing but pain
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
"Stephen Curry and LeBron James, as well as Kevin Durant, Giannis, and Damian Lillard."
1. LeBron James ($111.2 million) 2. Stephen Curry ($92.8 million) 3. Kevin Durant ($87.9 million) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo ($80.3 million) 5. Russell Westbrook ($74.2 million) 6. James Harden ($62.3 million) 7. Damian Lillard ($56.3 million) 8. Klay Thompson ($54 million) 9. Paul George ($47.8 million) 10. Jimmy Butler ($47 million)
"&gt;Stephen Curry's strengths are obvious, his weaknesses?  It is super exaggerated that is Curry is weak on defense, whereas he is closer to ""not great"" on that end. He is 6'3 and can't defend bigger wings, naturally. He is quite visibly the smallest player on that list. So his weaknesses are well known.   His off-ball game is hard to follow. Even harder to break down how it really distorts defenses providing a tremendous advantage to his teammates.    KD is the best iso player in the world. He is pretty good on defense. His strengths are for the world to see. And the value of these skills is honestly slightly overstated by fans and tremendously overstated by players themselves."

I think it's confirmed but Wardell Stephen Curry II hates Portland
Jaren Jackson is literally stephen curry
Fuck it. Just rename Portland into Stephen Curry instead.
More Game Winners than Stephen Curry BTW. lol.
Ben Simmons and Stephen Curry
"As a Warriors fan, I must say Khan drafting Flynn and Rubio ahead of Stephen Curry was the smartest decision of all time.  It worked out perfectly for us Dub fanantics."
Top 10 players of all time Kevin Durant joining the 73 wins warriors which consist of another top 10 players in all time in Stephen Curry.
And that’s why edwards popped off towards the end of season when the tank started. If edwards had done it throughout the season he would’ve won ROTY  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/edwaran01/splits/2021  Take a look at his month to month splits. He minutes slowly went up. He didn’t even start the first 17 games. He had a much easier route than wiseman who was just thrown into the fire immediately. I don’t know how you look at the two and say edwards had it harder. Wiseman was teaming with draymond green and Stephen curry who day in and day out werent trying to lose so that’s already a lot of pressure being in the starting line up. He had Covid to begin the season and then broke his wrist.
"Warriors are definitely making the play-in, maybe the playoffs, but they’re not going past the first round.  Stephen Curry has shown he is incapable of spearheading a contender without a stacked roster at his side. Zero clutch gene. Couldnt win a single play-in game and got outplayed by Ja Morant lmaoo  He had triple-single Draymond Green who everyone raves about being one of the most “impactful” players in the league and a 20 PPG bucket in Andrew “Gotta do my own Research” Wiggins and he still missed the playoffs….  And this is fresh of a 2020 campaign where he faked an injury (IMO) to sit out the season and the Warriors ended with the worst record in the NBA. He didn’t want to play and have the Warriors miss the playoffs and everyone point to that and say “haha KD carried you, now you a lottery bum”   His G5-G7 of 2016 cemented him as the most phenomenal choker in NBA history. Only more chokes to come! Imagine winning a scoring title and missing the playoffs. That’s some Allen Iverson stuff right there. Now I know why Curry looked up to AI lmao  Also it’s so funny when people act like Warriors made any improvements. Your two rookies are going to be low-impact. Wiseman isn’t taking any jump, hes terrible. Iggy is washed. Klay hasnt played basketball since like Obama was president…But Wilt Chamberlain Jr is somehow going to help propel you guys to contending? Lmao  Warriors 42-40, 9th seed, Miss the playoffs via play-in choke"
"Bruh they give an entire paragraph explaining why, what the hell are you talking about?  &gt;We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.5 RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives, among the team’s projected rotation players.  Nope, not a single mention of why!!!  I just don't understand someone like you who is too lazy to read an article but is still willing to spend time writing out some objectively wrong stupid shit and pressing save."
"You have to look after yourself first before you can help others. Ex. Steph Curry after serval ankle injuries kept betting on himself and used his endorsement money from under armor to provide 16 million meals for families during the pandemic, Lebron a at risk kid made it out and is used his Nike lifetime deal to build the I Promise school in Akron, Ohio to provide not only a better education system for his town but by also providing free tuition to the University of Akron. Which is about 8 million USD a year to kept running.

"He has a chance, yeah. I don’t know if he will, though. I would love to see it just because I love Big Ben  Unfortunately, phenomenal defense alone can’t propel you too high in the all-time rankings. It’s why Ben Wallace (a phenomenal, versatile defender with zero offensive presence) is a much worse player than Stephen Curry (a phenomenal, offensive player with zero defensive presence).  If we subscribe to the arbitrary notion that “defense is half of the game,” Ben Wallace deserves to be in this list without question. But the reality is offense is significantly more important. That said, Wallace still has a chance of cracking the list..I just don’t think he will"
"Stein makes 32 selections.

"Again, not everything is about Stephen Curry Jesus lmao"
"Of course, you have Stephen Curry, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard. Above them is future HOFer Trey Murphy III."
"They fumbled the last two lottery picks imo, which will cost Stephen Curry any chance he had at another ring."
What always impressed me with the Warriors is how well the coach's name fits with the franchise player.  Steve Kerr Stephen Curry  It doesn't get any better than that folks.
"Are you basically just asking who we think the 10 most skilled basketball players are? Or are you asking who we think had the 10 best peaks? I’m confused, but I am going to assume the former.   If so, this is my 10, in no particular order: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Durant, Magic Johnson, and Stephen Curry.  This is in no way representative of my Top 10 though."
Hmmm  1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Shaquille O'Neal 5. Hakeem Olajuwon 6. Kevin Durant 7. Stephen Curry 8. Wilt Chamberlain 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Tim Duncan
i was expecting stephen curry type of shooting he’s a bust trade him to us for cash considerations
not everything is about Stephen Curry
"Dude did a triple-double without points and missed 5x5 by a point. Versatile on both ends. Also was the top scorer in a FINALS GAME 7 that featured LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving. That's nuts."
"Everyday I’m reminded how many people don’t actually play basketball on here …   I said pick and rolls and further explained that DHOs as well. Yes, even the horn sets that create the short roll. As in plays that **lead Draymond rolling because two pick up on Curry**. Anybody with an actual brain wouldn’t just use NBA pick and roll ball handler and would understand what I meant.   Calling me dumb after insinuating Durant is 1.) getting open shots, 2.) getting open shots strictly from … corner curls and horns sets (lmfao) and 3.) ignoring the actual question I posed is just…   In 2017, 29% of Durants shots were open in the playoffs. 58% for Stephen Curry. But I wouldn’t expect someone like you to understand single coverage versus actually open.    But you ignored 90% of what I said, misinterpreted what I meant, and then called me dumb. Lmao enjoy your flight bro"
"- Kobe Bryant at 14???   - Scottie Pippen, Stephen Curry, Julius Erving over Kobe, Duncan, and Shaquille??  - Draymond number 30???  - Dennis Rodman was not better than The Admiral.  Surely, she was on crack when she made her list."

1. Jason Richardson 2. Stephen Curry 3. Klay Thompson 4. Jordan Poole 5. Eric Floyd
Michael Jordan  Chris Paul  Stephen Curry  Jrue Holiday  Charles Barkley
Exactly! He was a net negative for a team with Stephen Curry on it.  He did admit the pressure of the situation got to him.
Lonzo and Ben aren’t the same. Lonzo was pulling 30 footers in college and cashing out.  Remember he was called Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vert for a reason.  Ben was never a shooter a single day in his life.  Ben is a bum who lucked into being 6’11 with insane physical tools.
"&gt;Curry never had a choke like Harden in Game 6 against the Spurs in 2017.  Game 3, 2018 Finals  Stephen Curry: 11 points, 5 rebs, 6 asts, 2 TOs, 3-16 FG - Cavs Win  Game 2, 2015 Finals  Stephen Curry: 19 points, 5 asts, 6 TOs, 6-20 FG - Warriors still Win  [Curry has had plenty of stinkers in the playoffs, but he either get bailed out by the other talent on his team and/or the end up winning the series and the bad play gets swept under the wrong.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=stephen+curry+worst+fg%25+in+a+playoff+game)   Also Harden doesn't have a legion of fans large enough to change narratives"
Why did Stephen Curry get pretty much no heat in comparison to Kyries “earth is flat” when he said the moon landing was fake?

Id take him over Stephen Curry
"No, because DAJ was never capable of scoring more than the low teens in points per game.  When you increase volume you decrease efficiency for everyone not named Stephen Curry.  Stephen Curry has two scoring titles on all time efficiency, 63% and 60.4% true shooting while leading the league in scoring.  That's insane.  That Steph can score more points on fewer shots than any of these people is pretty wild, and putting him next to Kevin Durant who is also scoring more than any of these other people on better efficiency...that is the point I'm trying to make.  They literally combined this season for 59 points on 38.9 shots, and that's at 33 years old for both of them.  Anthony Davis and LeBron James best seasons combine for 59.5 points on 43.4 shots."
Is Stephen Curry holding back Jordan Pooles development?
Does Stephen Curry even know how to shoot?

"I've been calling Steph ""Wardell Stephen Curry III"" for years. Fuck."
"II implies a III but obviously that's not the case here... you hope...  Steph is Wardell Stephen Curry II, but there's no Wardell Stephen Curry III either, so maybe they just prefer it stylistically.  (or if there does wind up being a III in the future they don't have to switch it up.)"
This is fake news.  Curry was joking. He confirmed he was joking but went ahead and did the collaboration with NASA to bring attention to the work they do and for the cool experience.  Curry **never** actually believed that we didn't land on the moon.  https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-nasa-moon-landing-comments-joke-2018-12
"Just my belief, but in this era of the NBA, I just don't think you can win a title anymore with just *one* guy who can legitimately create his own shot off the dribble and break down a defense.   Stephen Curry just had one of the greatest seasons in NBA history and the Warriors were a bottom 10 offense. Do we really think Klay moves the needle THAT much to take them where they want to be, which is a Top 10 offense again? I'm skeptical.   Jazz have Conley and Mitchell, Suns have CP3 and Book, Blazers have Dame and CJ etc."
[Heres an article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/sports/stephen-curry-moon-landing.amp.html)

"&gt; Stephen Curry, Golden State – 3%  When will they ever learn?"
"KD is probably the better overall player but saying that it’s not particularly close is straight up biased.  Thinking Basketball’s Stephen Curry greatest peaks video can give a lot of insight into his significant postseason impact. And saying that someone you’ve deemed as a top 20 player all time has never been the best player in a single finals game out of the 28 he’s played is crazy talk (off the top of my head see 2016 game 4, 2018 game 4, 2019 game 3, and 2019 games 3 and 5.   So while Steph probably had the higher offensive peak and KD probably had the greater overall peak, lumping on nonexistent future accolades to KD doesn’t help the conversation"

It is time to be legitimately concerned about Stephen Curry
"Feeling like a fucking bust.  Nah fr, look at Stephen Curry rookie highlights and his highlights from now.  He was a 40% shooter his rookie year and his form has still managed to change throughout his career.  Very few players maintain the same jumpshot for their entire career, it’s natural.  0 concern about this with Cade."
Look up one motion shooting. Most players are two motion shooters. Stephen curry is the best one motion shooter of all time. One motion shooting is more advantageous for 3 pointers.  Here’s a breakdown of his shot mechanics: https://youtu.be/Lvc8lN6KEA0
Thanks!  Do you think you could compare Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry amongst all-time greats?
"this how i know r/nba's opinion is no better than twitter   KD has never beaten stephen curry in the playoffs. He then joined steph's squad. Straight up delusional to think KD is better than Curry.   inb4 heads say, bUt tHe FMVP... no shit a team with 2 top 13 players of all time in their primes is going to beat any team in the finals as easily as possible, so what the fuck does is matter who won the FMVP? did the KD warriors ever face adversity in the finals lmao? shut that tired ass argument up. a team with lebron got swept, but it was so hard fought that KD's FMVPs mean the world to yall.   u put jordan and bron on the same team, you gonna give a fuck who wins fmvp? theyre both gonna ball out and put the opposing team away in as little games possible"
KD is a better player than Stephen Curry
"Right, cause basketball is only entertaining because of dunks.  Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Luka, all of those players are boring cause they don't dunk"
Stephen Curry should be way lower cause most of that is from the time where the Warriors decided to just tank the season.
You're in luck--there just so happens to be an underdog team on the up and coming. They simultaneously have the #1 show in the NBA in stephen curry.   won't be called a bandwagonner if you choose the Warriors
"If we are talking about chips , you refuse to take into account level of competition . LeBron had harder competition   San Antonio Spurs with Greg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kawhi Leonard. There's 5 hall of famers right there and LeBron had to face them 3 times. The first year, he had Boobie Gibson as his second best player haha. Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant (for 2 years). LeBron had to face them 4 times. The first year he lost Kyrie and Love for the whole series. The second year, Warriors went 73-9 (all-time record) and was down 3-1 for the biggest comeback in the history of sports. Third and fourth year, that 73-9 team added Kevin Durant. One of those years, he had to face the Thunder that had Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka and then the only team he was favored to beat that he lost to, was Dallas Mavericks, who collectively outperformed the predictions by beating Portland, sweeping past champion Lakers, and beating OKC who had Durant, Westbrook, Harden."
"Welcome to the NBA. There are a few historical basics:   1)Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Many people including myself believe that Lebron James can catch him but it'll require a few more accolades.   2) Some of the greatest NBA teams of all time are the 60's Celtics, 80's Lakers, 90's Bulls, 99-03 Lakers, and mid2010's Warriors.   3) There have been more and more rules introduced to make it harder to play defense because flashy offense is what crowds love and brings the big $$$ to the league.   4) Lakers-Celtics is one of the biggest and most competitive sports rivalries of all time.      Now some points that are relevant to this season and more recent times:   5) The Warriors team mentioned above was so good largely due to having two of the best three point shooters of all time. They helped influence the league to dramatically increase its rate of three point shooting.   6) The Lakers and Nets are the championship favorites this year.   7) Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Luka Doncic are currently regarded as some of the best players in the league.   8) Enjoy the NBA! During the season there are games every night so there's always some NBA action to watch. It's a beautiful sport. I hope that the Lakers become your favorite team."
"I don't know if bron ever said anything of Steph specifically, but here is a snippet of Marcus Thompson (The Athletic) saying there is certainly animosity between Lebron and Steph  ""According to Thompson, James and Curry were close from Curry's days at Davidson tho his early years in the league. Thompson said James was ""like a mentor"" to Curry, but as Curry's game improved, coinciding with the Warrior's rise, he ""challenged Lebron's status"". Since then, the two apparently haven't been as close, and it reportedly bothers Curry.   ""Thomspon said:  ""The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that meant there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects Lebron, and he's like... 'Because of the outside world pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool. ' ""  There's more of this story [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-doesnt-like-stephen-curry-2017-4)   Anyway, I genuinely thought people knew about LeBron general dislike towards Steph? This isn't news."
&gt;It's time be genuinely concerned about Stephen Curry  It was such a ridiculous take that it became a meme lol
"Oh you're right, he didn't have a ""[GSW] Stephen Curry"" flair, he must've been a random bystander. 💀💀💀"
"He's one of the most durable and well conditioned players in the league. I'm 100% sure he could play with the same energy he played with tonight on a consistent basis if he chose to. He's 197, literally lighter than Russ and 7 pounds heavier than Steph. It's a matter of effort, he has the conditioning and physical tools to sustain it. Getting efficient looks won't be a big problem as he is on the Warriors with Stephen Curry on his team. I'm just saying man, he undeniably has the talent."
No doubt. But you have stephen curry and that makes everything right

"I don't see why narratives are relevant. It's probably even the case that Wiseman was worse than what most people thought last year. I mean, he was making Stephen Curry and Draymond Green look human lol.   Once again, he had a lot of things going against him that year. Lack of practice, injury, tough schedule, hard system to integrate into and lack of easy PnR plays. I have hope he can be a great NBA player. It doesn't change the fact that he was really bad that year."

Stephen Curry is one of the greatest shooters of all time
"Stephen Curry was the best player the entire season last year, and finished top 3 in mvp voting with a flea hue roster. This year he and KD have been top two so far.  Saying Curry “might” have been top 5-10 last year isn’t just a massive understatement, it sounds like a veiled hater comment."
Stephen Curry Is my favorite basketball player in my opinion he’s better than MJ
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

"&gt;  It's clear that Steph Curry is the best player from the 2009 draft. My question for you is: in what year did that become a reasonable position to hold  Their rookie seasons:   &gt; Real greatness is foreshadowed in Curry's rookie stats. And not just in his stats, but in the opinion of his head coach, and many other coaches and commentators around the league, who consider him on a par with Steve Nash in terms of basketball IQ.  &gt; Brandon Jennings has me wondering if he really is a legitimate NBA starter. Tyreke Evans has me wondering whether he can ever be the kind of player who makes his teammates better, who leads his team into the playoffs, who becomes worthy of an all-star selection.  &gt; I don't wonder about those things with Stephen Curry. I have no doubt that he will lead his team into the playoffs many times, and earn many all-star selections.  &gt; What Stephen Curry has me wondering is whether I'm watching a future NBA Hall of Famer.  &gt; Stephen Curry is the right choice, and the only choice, for the NBA Rookie of the Year.  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2010/4/15/1423388/2009-2010-nba-rookie-of-the-year"
"I'm not saying that his MVP was threatened. The voters had it right for the most part though bafflingly enough he only received 90/101 1st place votes.   But this isn't fake adversity. I'm talking about the fan and media perception of Jokic. The Jump had days of segments dedicated to trying to make the MVP vote more competitive than it was going to be. Rachel Nichols and Windhorst were finding every way not to say Jokic was deserving. This was while the Nuggets had a great record and an incredible run even when Murray went down thanks to Jokic. That didn't matter enough either.  Hell, Windhorst famously went on Bontemps podcast (the guy who does the poll of the MVP voters all season) and got eviscerated by Tim and the other guest for basically saying it was ridiculous to give Jokic the MVP. This is despite the numbers (or bball ref mvp tracker) having him as the leader before LeBron or Embiid even went down to injury.   Of 16 ESPN people polled this year nobody took Jokic as the MVP winner, but had Jimmy Butler and Anthony Davis as picks. Stephen A. Smith didn't have him in his top 8 in the preseason predictions. ESPN has Doncic ahead of him despite being inferior in every possible way because ""Jokic isn't a two way player"", despite not only the numbers proving otherwise but the fact that Doncic is a much worse defender. Preseasons sports books had him with the 12th best odds to win MVP behind people like Tatum, Kawhi, Durant AND Harden, by large margins.  The is the only year that a reigning MVP doesn't get a game on Christmas since they went to the 5 game format in 08, to the dismay of Nuggets players who took to twitter about it.   Nick Wright infamously said ""The Nuggets are a pretend contender with a pretend superstar"" and pretty much sticks to that take, openly mocking Jokic whenever he can in almost a Bayless-like manner. Lets not forget less than 6 months ago he was the one who started the narrative that, ""Historically speaking, he would be the worst [MVP] we've had in 35 years.""  Which is obviously complete insanity.  The only people in the media who are out there championing how good Jokic is are Jalen Rose and and Bomani Jones. Yet so many others are years late to the party and are still stuck on viewing him like some sort of silly outlier who can't play defense.  This isn't just some weirdo homer take either, feel free to google who the most disrespected player in the NBA is and you just end up with a litany of Jokic discussions.   So this certainly isn't fake adversity. Anyone who knows basketball knows Jokic is one of the 3 best players in the league right now, and was last season, but do you honestly think that if LeBron or Embiid didn't get hurt that the MVP would have been given to Jokic? Keep in mind that the numbers and ref tracker were heavily favoring Jokic before anyone had any type of injury.   The answer is no, and why? Because the media has a humongous influence on everyone including many of the voters. That's how Steph Curry and Chris Paul end up with 7 combined 1st place votes last year, despite not even being a consideration until the very last moment when some outlets were scrambling for whatever reason they could find to not give Jokic the award, or to drum up some sort of controversy so the discussion didn't become stale for the last month of play.    He's a big, slow, quiet, uninterested in awards or fanfare or popularity, noncontroversial, emotionally reserved white dude playing in a small market where the fans can't even watch his games locally because of a TV contract dispute. He will never have the look, or the narrative, or the style that is conducive to generating interest from casual fans; and he has absolutely zero interest or concern with that, doesn't care about the MVP, just wants to win games. So he isn't out there championing for himself either and would rather people on the team didn't as well.  Genuinely if you think this is fake adversity, or that Jokic isn't treated significantly different than every other supermegastar MVP in league history, then you are either not paying attention to the league/Jokic enough, or you are being needlessly defensive for whatever reason.   Everyone knows there is a bizarre imbalance in the treatment and appreciation of Jokic with fans and the media. One that is outrageously contrasted to the way his peers see him, as his teammates say that they've never seen anything quite like it, the people he plays against like Draymond and Ayton give uniquely high praise to him, and if another more marketable player had the numbers that Jokic did (or if Jokic were in a large market) people would be clamoring to call last season one of the 5 greatest offensive seasons ever, and he's on his way to another one."
"The irony of this question is he did almost won NCAA on a team that never won the tournament since 1970 (Davidson).

This is less controversial than calling Stephen Curry the greatest shooter of all-time.
Stephen Curry and Cevin Durant
So no one gonna mention Stephen curry
"I linked an explanation of what RAPTOR is... But if you're too lazy to read it, it's not team based system. The point is that you *make your team better, offensively or defensively, when you're on the floor*.   &gt; I remember in the finals against the Cavs the Cavs kept switching on to Curry as their strategy and you know the rest.  If you want to have a Stephen A. type conversation about this, then I totally understand that take. But if you ask any serious analysts like Zach Lowe or Tim Legler, they'll tell you that Curry clearly still injured those playoffs. Kevin Love was destroying him in those match-ups in that series. That says a lot.  The Cavs and other teams hunted Curry in switches the following seasons, and it didn't work. And considering how many minutes he takes up, isn't it weird that he's such a bad defender and yet his team has sustained a top 5 defense every year that he was healthy?  Again, if you want to have a Stephen A conversation about this, I totally understand why you would make that argument. But if you zoom out beyond a specific series and look at other games and series', you'll have a more nuanced view."

"Fanbase has seemed mixed on it with the initial pics, but I've been growing to love them more and more. They have fun nods to the past that aren't overwhelming the clean design of the jerseys.  I'm a sucker for black jerseys when done right, and the Dubs have had some pretty iconic ones ([The Town](https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bng-l-warriors-1126-19.jpg) of course, as well as [Slate](https://www.nba.com/warriors/sites/warriors/files/20141115_curry_760.jpg?w=756&amp;h=440) and [its Chinese New Year spin off](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-k2fFBVEAAv9me.jpg)) vs their other attempts at alternates that aren't throwbacks (like last year's [""The Bay""](https://images.footballfanatics.com/golden-state-warriors/golden-state-warriors-nike-statement-swingman-jersey-stephen-curry-youth_ss4_p-11902771+u-wi8auquok3698w2w79xs+v-694404083d3145c7924546d2223fc7b6.jpg?_hv=1&amp;w=600) jersey)  Also black is a traditional alternate for some other Bay Area teams like the Giants, Sharks, and Quakes (and was the main color of longtime neighbor Raiders) so it's not as strange for me to see it being thrown more as an alternate color."

"NBA: stephen curry, whats your opinion on new basket ball now replaced with a bowling ball?  steph : i just throw things regardless  and it just goes in"
Almost every nba player had to change their shot when entering the league because the time and height of contest in the league is crazy small.  [Literally Steph had to change his shot mechanics entering the league.](https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-changed-shooting-form-nbas-greatest-shooter-2016-5)
"I’m a Harden stan but I like watching Stephen Curry, am I weird?"
"Honestly, I dont know about signing Luka to that supermax with how the rest of the team is constructed. They have so little cap space now and they have like 1 good defender in the entire team and the rest of the team is horrendous, with Luka being a big part of that problem. Its impossible to hide this many terrible defenders and theyre getting scored on at will by any team. Personally I dont believe in signing one way players to supermax unless theyre named Stephen Curry. But if you were to give Luka a supermax I would have loved to see him take that offer from another team that has the cap space or pieces available to cover for his weaknesses better."
Steve Kerr needs to watch this game tape. Imagine if Steve Kerr brought Stephen Curry in at 8:30 left in the 4th to close out the game instead of bringing him in cold with 4 minutes left.
I think it’s also because of two words:  Stephen Curry

"That is because among 7 footers Giannis is the most skilled and athletic of them, that doesn't mean that he is more skilled than Kyrie Irving, James Harden or Stephen Curry.  Giannis is skilled for his size, but if you could magically have Steph be 7ft while maintaining his skill and coordination, it wouldn't even be close, that's why people are jealous of his physical gifts.  People didn't act this way with Shaq btw, Shaq was even more of a freak than Giannis, but nobody tried to act like Shaq was more skilled than AI or that he was a super skilled player when comparing him to guards."
"Please don't compare Leagues. It's waaaaay different in any aspect!!! MAJOR BIG difference between EuroBasket and NBA is Money... Nikola Mirotic is highest paid basketball player in Europe which is $4,000,000 comparison to highest paid NBA player like Stephen Curry with an insane $40.2 million.  Don't understand me wrong, I'm very happy about (especially for Harden) new rule changes. But if I were Stephen Curry, I would get (draw) a foul at every opportunity even on a little contact"
"Maybe you should actually read it - they shower him in praise for pretty much the whole article.   “Ball sees every fast break through passing angles that don’t really exist, detecting in them some new depth that has gone unexplored for most of basketball history. His game feels iterative of all-time greats like Stephen Curry, Pete Maravich, and Magic Johnson, but through the strange alchemy of those influences, Ball will casually try things on the court that feel completely new.”  Yeah, they shit on him alright."
Stephen Curry. His fanbase is overprotective
Stephen Curry has entered the chat
"Yeah I forgot which game it was against the Bucks in the playoffs, but you know, the one where he had more than 50 points. He was pure terminator. A 7 foot tall red hot Stephen Curry. He has that switch but I'm not sure if he can turn it on, or if it just has to happen by chance."
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."

Dallas had a better OFFRTG than the #1 seeded Sixers, granted them the #5 spot in the West despite below average defense, and pushed the Conference finalists to 7 games.

Stephen Curry. I think he wins MVP and i hope this is the year he gets his FMVP.  Giannis might also be a good candidate for MVP.
"Wardell Stephen ""Ben Simmons"" Curry"
Yup. Steph can deadlift at least 400 lbs  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-can-deadlift-400-pounds/
"I feel like this phrasing can maybe work if it's like ""averaging more threes than anyone not named Stephen Curry"" or ""more dunks than anyone not named Giannis"". But here it's so ridiculous."
"So I can't seem to find a way to calc the stat myself. If someone knows please let me know how but I did find this:  During the 2015-16 season, when Stephen Curry was the league’s unanimous MVP, he made 54.8% of the shots he took between 30 and 39 feet from the basket. He didn’t drop off that much when including the numbers from shots 40 or more feet away, either. He shot 46% from 40 or more feet away.

Wardell Stephen Curry II?
OI! I'M STEPHEN CURRY AND I RUN THE THREE POINT LINE HERE!
6 spots higher than Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry
&gt;Only Stephen Curry (42) and Draymond Green (38) have more but both stars have played more than half the minutes as Payton.  Yes... Steph and Draymond have played more than half of GPII's minutes. This is technically true.
"&gt;With every 3rd post being about the Lakers  This sub has millions of people and Lakers fans represent a disproportionate amount of basketball fans globally. Lakers are like a brand. It's like visiting America and all the ""soccer fans"" are supporting Barcelona, Real Madrid or Man United etc. Its a branding thing. Like how you see people wearing Yankee caps and they don't even know that it's related to baseball.  The Lakers will always be the most talked about even when theyre garbage. They're a celebrity team. People who don't know shit about the game and have never watched the NBA could name you ""Los Angeles Lakers"" and maybe ""Chicago Bulls"" because of MJ. Outside of that it'd just be names like ""LeBron James"" or ""Kobe Bryant"". They probably couldn't name any other teams.   I think sometimes nba fans (especially one's based in America) don't realise how niche a sport it is outside of America. ""household names"" stateside are unheard of in a lot of countries. I remember during the Linsanity era someone at my work asked me if Lin was the next Michael Jordan.  There's still people I know who are aware of LeBron James but don't know who Stephen Curry is.  The Lakers, as a brand, transcend the league and the sport."
"Jordan vs Curry will be the debate for the 3rd spot.  The general fanbase will consider the 7’0” kid that plays from 2034-2057 that plays just like Stephen Curry combined with MJ to be the GOAT, but the sentient AI will make a compelling case that their calculations say Tim Duncan was the best player."
"&gt; I'm saying the Warriors haven't shown us anything that would suggest they would even a contender.  15-2 record, best point differential by a country mile, 1st in offensive rating, 1st in defensive rating, Stephen Curry, etc. All of that while having Draymond Green as the 2nd player in that team.   But yeah, they have shown absolutely nothing that would suggest they're a contender lmao.  It's getting really hard to tell if you're just *that* clueless or a high effort troll."
I hope Stephen Curry never makes a shot again and his teams go 0-82 until he retires.
It took me two seconds to google this: https://www.sportscasting.com/davion-mitchell-off-night-already-locked-up-stephen-curry-damian-lillard-donovan-mitchell-first-week-pro/ - but I also watched him enough to see both his on ball and off ball defense.

To top it off, he has to go watch Stephen Curry out there having fun and winning with Andrew Wiggins, who he personally traded to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love, who was a massive bust in his time with the Cavs and who didn’t help him beat the aforementioned Stephen Curry who was out there having fun and winning with Klay Thompson, who the Warriors passed up trading for the aforementioned Kevin Love."

Other than the adjustment made by the coaching staff in Game 4 (similar to what they did in the Memphis series) and the obvious impact of the move (Iguodala inserted into the starting lineup and shifting Bogut out; lessening LeBron's efficiency but not necessarily the scoring output) I still really can't argue for Iguodala being Finals MVP over Curry tbh.

"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.

Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokić	7.45   4.

Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."

"I think the noise comes from lineups. And I also just frankly think KD is a better playoff weapon than Curry. I get your argument, but that’s not how on off works. If KD was benefiting from Curry’s gravity in the playoffs heavily, it would’ve showed heavily in their on off numbers.   I think Curry makes his teammates mlre better. That was never my argument.

"Dude, it's the same link and if i cared enough i'd record my screen and show how both links lead to the same place. But that's just a waste of my time.  Anyways. the reason i feel steph has more substance that lebron is because lebron has been hyped well before he was in the league, he was on the cover of SI while still in high school. They've been promoting him for years and years, because ultimately, the NBA is a business and it needs a face. Jordan was gone and the league had lost it's face. They made their bet on this young kid from Akron, OH, and for the most part he's lived up to it. He's an incredible, once-in-a-gerenation athlete, and a great basketball player. But then this skinny kid, all of 6'2"" mostly unhyped, drafted after the likes of Ricky Rubio (who is actually having a really nice season on CLE) and Tyreke Evans comes outta nowhere to completely change the way the game of basketball is played. Lebron didn't change the game, he's just really good at it. Steph changed everything. That's why i think he has more substance. He wasn't a part of the hype machine until he couldn't be denied. He went from not making the all-star team in 2013 to MVP of the league in 2015. His game re-invented the game. Heck even Dwade said just the other day that Steph is on the Mt. Rushmore of folks who have changed the game. Steph's hype all came about due to his play, i can't say the same about lebron. People have been told to like Lebron for a long time. No one was told to like stephen wardell curry, his play just demanded it.      Anyways that's just how i feel about it.      And i'm not flairing up because i don't work at Chotchkie's"

Lonzo is Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vert and you can’t tell me otherwise
"Asked why the NBA's ratings are up, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr simply responded, ""Stephen Curry."""
Yep. Stephen Curry is still alive. I’d say that’s better than Kobe.
I've been a Heat fan all my life. But this is Stephen Curry we are talking about. I would definitely throw some MVP chants too xD
"&gt; Because the culture and entire thought process about basketball was warped after 2015 about the three point shot. (Credit to Stephen Curry)  And most of the people crushing it in the league right now have had to adapt over the course of their careers to that change.  Kobe took almost as many threes per game as Reggie Miller, if he was going to become a sharpshooter from deep he would have.  It's not like he didn't practice it, he was renown for his work ethic."

(Credit to Stephen Curry)  In Kobe's era, if you took a transition 3 point shot where you had a numbers advantage, I don't care who you are, you're getting benched (or getting roasted by coaches, commentators, etc) You'd have people throwing their hands up saying ""that is the stupidest play I've seen all day, what an absolute idiot""  But now we see that happen at least every quarter in every game and it's just completely normalized.   Kobe and MJ were basketball maniacs. If they played the way today's game is being played, they would for sure, absolutely have more emphasis on 3 point shooting."
"You can't compare across generations of basketball in completely different eras and come out with a factual answer... The best you can do is compare them to who they were playing with/against and see how much better they were. But even then it's not quite the best indicator of how dominant/great a player was.   But here's my two cents: Kobe Bryant played in the lowest scoring era of Basketball, and somehow still has legendary offensive feats that we don't know can ever be replicated. 62 points in 3 Quarters is probably replicable, but outscoring your opponent in 3 quarters is insane...   Today's score after 3 quarters seems like somewhere in the 85+ range  Steph Curry has done things that Kobe Bryant could never do, and Kobe Bryant has done stuff that Steph Curry will never do (probably, we don't know cause he's still playing.)  Like scoring 81 points in an era where it was pretty normal to see games end with a score of 74-80 is absolutely wild.  But bar none no questions asked is Kobe Bryant a much better defender than Stephen Curry. The defensive side, Kobe Bryant absolutely dominates in comparison."
Stephen Curry.
Someone please tell me this isn’t true  EDIT: okay these articles from 5 years ago are making me feel better   https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nfl/2016/2/7/10928742/stephen-curry-panthers-fan-super-bowl-50-cam-newton  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-is-serious-about-owning-part-of-the-panthers/amp/
Yes I would say that Stephen curry impacts the game of basketball more and is better than kobe bryant as a nba player Currys volume scoring paired with his playmaking is more valuable than kobes elite 2 way play imo
"Yeah - full quote in 2019 below-  “I thought it was some bullshit” Durant told reporters after the Warriors win over the Hornets in which Stephen Curry received MVP chants from the crowd. “KD give his all to perfect his craft, his game. I have an MVP, two rings, and two finals MVPs, but fans and media still disrespect my game. KD got it all.”"
"Article text:  &gt; The fitness experts and dietitians scattered about Capital One Arena, who came to watch an NBA game Monday evening, noticed a prospective client sitting near the end of the New Orleans Pelicans’ sideline. They desperately wanted his attention. &gt;  &gt; “Zion!” a man in Section 120 screamed during a quiet moment in the third quarter. “Stand up; get some exercise!” &gt;  &gt; The man laughed at his own joke, then, satisfied, took a swig from his plastic cup filled with a dark-colored drink. &gt;  &gt; Then, just before the start of the final quarter, a group of young adult males choreographed their own version of a weight-loss intervention for the 2019 No. 1 draft pick. The three or four men stood up and chanted in unison over and over: “ZI-ON’S CHUN-KY!” &gt;  &gt; They sat down, giggling. &gt;  &gt; Zion Williamson never turned around and acknowledged either the advice or scorn screamed within earshot. He remained on the padded seat, and his gaze stayed on the court. Williamson, a large human being listed at 6-foot-6 and 284 pounds, didn’t log a single minute of action during the Washington Wizards’ comeback win over his Pelicans. Still, for some, his presence served as entertainment. &gt;  &gt; After teaming up for two titles, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are thriving apart &gt;  &gt; Throughout this first month of the NBA season, while Williamson remains on the sideline rehabilitating from foot surgery, obsessing over and laughing at his appearance have become fair game within the league. &gt;  &gt; It’s no longer considered appropriate or acceptable to empty out our darkest thoughts and publicly aim them at athletes. Jeers about gender or race are rarely tolerated (even in Salt Lake City), and directing crude language at an athlete can get a fan banned from an NBA arena. But somehow, lost in this progress, fat-shaming is still okay in sports discussion — as long as the target is male and wealthy. &gt;  &gt; It’s okay when New York Knicks legend and color commentator Walt Frazier points out to the viewing audience how Zion has picked up some weight and needs to lose it, because he’s just being real. And it’s funny when TNT’s “Inside the NBA” crew cues up Charles Barkley for a scripted roast about Zion’s size because on the other side of the set Shaquille O’Neal melts into laughter. &gt;  &gt; It’s generally accepted that we need to respect an athlete’s mental health, so why is it still open season for fat jokes? &gt;  &gt; Trust that women and their bodies still face an unhealthy amount of scrutiny. But the difference between a sports commentator who would dare mention a woman’s weight in a derogatory manner and one who would spotlight an overweight male athlete is stark. Last year, a broadcaster’s comments about a female runner’s body type drew rebuke. And the WNBA takes protecting women’s bodies so seriously, this past season the league issued a fine and suspended Connecticut Sun Coach Curt Miller for one game for making disparaging comments about the weight of Liz Cambage, the Las Vegas Aces’ star center. &gt;  &gt; But the ceaseless comments about Williamson’s size are echoed in front of national television audiences. And there’s an even greater din of noise on social media, where anyone with two thumbs and an opinion can be a licensed nutritionist. &gt;  &gt; I should’ve known the moment I sent the tweet that it was a mistake. &gt;  &gt; From my baseline seat Monday night, I had a clear view of Williamson. He was arrayed in the look of stylish autumn — a coffee-colored down vest over a lighter brown hoodie, matched with green camo pants. I snapped a photo and tweeted how Williamson was dressed appropriately for the eternally frigid Capital One Arena. &gt;  &gt; Within a few minutes, someone commented that Williamson looked like the Michelin Man. Such a predictable response falls in line with other unimaginative takes and inquiries from fans. &gt;  &gt; Will Guillory, who covers the Pelicans for the Athletic, told me he has received the same question from fans every day. How much does Zion weigh? But Pelicans fans aren’t the only ones obsessed about the scale. As Guillory sat on press row, he said, a Wizards fan leaned in and asked him,** “Why is Zion so chunky?”** &gt;  &gt; Zion has said he needs to reach another gear in his conditioning and weight, but he also has acknowledged that as a youth he once gained 100 pounds in less than two years. The natural and intense ways in which he gains weight and strength — a team executive once bragged how Zion put on eight pounds of muscle after one week of workouts — are what make him different from the average NBA player. &gt;  &gt; But Williamson, 21, has not done himself many favors. It doesn’t help that he is featured in a commercial lounging, playing video games and endorsing a sugary drink. As a highly paid professional athlete and a rising star of the league who also appears in the NBA 75th-anniversary spot shattering a backboard, Williamson has a responsibility to his franchise — and himself — to get into shape and maintain his fitness to ensure a career of longevity. But oversimplifying his appearance as a sign of laziness or lack of self-control does not take into account the emotional, mental and genetic reasons some people pack on the pounds. &gt;  &gt; If Zion needs months to rehabilitate and get into shape, then it’s fair game to examine his motivations as a professional athlete. But too many of his critics have wielded meanness as their message. Theirs isn’t constructive criticism — just another shameful example that, for some sports fans, landing a joke is more important than delivering respect."

WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY II
Mr Wardell Stephen Curry with a casual 9/14 from three. I almost feel sorry for guys who choose to hate on the Warriors instead of just enjoying this beautiful basketball.
"I  have personally said it in the past. Stephen Curry is the most underrated legend the last 15 years in the NBA.  Regardless of tonights game, he has revolutionized the NBA with his 3p% which even by NBA standards its absurd. His efficiency/play making/bball controul is one of a  kind.  I dont get how people even compare him to irving, Steph is above him and its not close imho he is better than Durant aswell. People keep messing up flashiness with efficiency and winning basketball.  He is 33 years old, sticked with his team and the only reason we propably havent witnessed the best dynasty basketball has ever seen its injuries.(And these are not WHAT if injuries...we know what  Klay and steph can do together).  He is above KD as far as i am concerned and it will be extra juicy to see what unfolds after KD's latest likes on some tweets"

Team Cali is clearly better.  But I am not betting against a team who has LeBron James and Stephen Curry together
"Tbh I am more worried about non calls than bad calls, the fact that our Stephen Curry get so little calls is ridiculous XD"

"Wow you’re smarter than most people on this subreddit.  Kawhi Leonard is top 3 though. In what world are Luka Dončić, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Joel Embiid better than Kyrie Irving?  Decent list, but not perfect."
Stephen Curry needs an initial name.
Draymond Green would be great on the Nets. I was wrong about LeVert so far. LeVert has been disappointing.   As a Kevin Durant fan.... I would much rather have Draymond Green than Wardell Stephen Curry II on the Nets. The Warriors need to free Draymond Green from that garbage team.
Steph. 100%. Chemistry is important on a team but we are talking about Don Stephen Curry
(awwHHAAAA)  BANG! BAAAANG! OH WHAT A SHOT FROM CURRY! WITH SIX TENTHS OF A SECOND REMAINING! THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES!
"Lebron fans hate him because he ""stole"" 3 championships that were supposed to be Lebron's. Now Lakers fans (some of who may have been Warriors fans as recently as 2 years ago) hate him now too, because they're aligned with Lebron, which makes it so you have the most obnoxious fan base hating on the guy.  In reality he's still averaging 26 points on a good scoring efficiency, despite struggling with his shot early.  At some point people will have to come to the realization that the Warriors being bad isn't the same thing as Stephen Curry being bad."
stephen curry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
"Yes, Game 2.  &gt; Stephen Curry missed an NBA Finals-record 13 3-point field goals (courtesy of Elias Sports Bureau) in Game 2, in large part thanks to Dellavedova's defense. Curry was 0-for-8 when guarded by Dellavedova on Sunday, including 0-for-5 from 3-point range, his worst shooting performance against a defender in any game this postseason.  &gt; Overall, Dellavedova held the Warriors to 3-for-15 shooting, including 0-for-6 from 3-point range, and forced six turnovers as a primary defender in Game 2. That's the most turnovers forced by a Cavaliers player in a game this postseason, and only Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton have forced more turnovers as the primary defender in any game this postseason.  &gt; In the fourth quarter and overtime, the Warriors shot 1-for-6 from the field and turned the ball over three times with Dellavedova as the primary defender; the Warriors shot 8-for-18 and turned it over once when guarded by anyone else in the half court over that same span.  &gt; Although this number is expected to be high since he was guarding Curry, it’s worth pointing out that Dellavedova contested 11 shots in Game 2, more than any other Cavaliers player.  [Shut. Down.](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F0608%2FFSNBAFINALSDellavedovadefense.jpg&amp;w=570&amp;format=jpg)  And they 100% don't win if Kyrie and Love aren't injured."
"I don’t know, but that Denver “Big 3” isn’t winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokić is a very overrated player. I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, or Joel Embiid than Nikola Jokić. It’s close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."
"Wardell Stephen Curry II, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Dončić are the overrated trio.  You know it’s bad because I didn’t include LeBron James. Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis and Trae Young are better players. The bias of the media is embarrassing."
Name the scrubs Wardell Stephen Curry II carried in 2015. People like spreading false information here. Embarrassing.  I agree that Wardell Stephen Curry II regressed. He has not been the same since choking in back to back Finals (2015 and 2016). He will go down as a top 25 player of all time because Kevin Durant carried him.
"Wardell Stephen Curry II regressed since choking in the back to back Finals (2015 and 2016). Kevin Durant was carrying the Warriors and no one appreciated his skill when he was on the Warriors.  Kyrie Irving might be the best point guard in the NBA right now, but the media hates him.  Kyrie Irving needs to be clear cut better than every other point guard to get his respect. He’s going to show everyone in July.   Get the excuses ready for LeBron James and Wardell Stephen Curry II."

That’s an absolutely terrible way of looking at it. Does Stephen Curry have a lower ceiling than James Harden due to him being smaller and less athletic? A player’s ceiling has more to it than just size
Kyrie Irving is unguardable. De’Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish didn’t lock him up. Embarrassing takes. Probably the same people that think Kevin Love locked up Wardell Stephen Curry II in the Finals.  Bad shooting night from Kyrie Irving.... it happens in the regular season. Thank god it doesn’t happen in the Finals like Wardell Stephen Curry II.
Bad shooting nights happen in the regular season.... chill.  Better to have them in the regular season than the Finals like Wardell Stephen Curry II
I’d rather have Kyrie Irving than Wardell Stephen Curry II because he actually shows up in big games.
I think you’re underrating how great Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving have been in the Finals. They show up in the Finals unlike Wardell Stephen Curry II.  LeBron James might end up scoring 8 points again and Anthony Davis might end up with 5 rebounds.  Nets in 4.
Hell no. You don't waste a year of prime Stephen Curry and Draymond Green for a *chance* at Cade.
A LOT better than Steph. Anyone that puts Stephen Curry as a top 2 point guard of all-time should be banned from this sub. Dude ain’t even top 5. Probably the greatest shooter of all time but if you want me to impressed with 6 assists per game from a PG you’re nuts. The man isn’t even in the top 10
"Lol you're using the ""product of their era"" argument, which is true, but players today ARE JUST MORE SKILLED than players were 15 years ago, so yes. It is an era thing, but 1. Curry had a lot to do with that revolution and 2. Players are just more skilled today, so the ""era"" argument proves my point. Bob Cousy is considered a top 10 PG ever, and he couldn't dribble w his left hand.  &gt;*Shooting from 35 feet has been normalised by him almost single-handedly - he has shot 42.4 per cent on 125 such attempts from between 30-39 feet this season, and both the volume and efficiency from that range are historic. Threes from that range used to be bailouts only. Now, they are by design, even in clutch situations.*  [https://twitter.com/antonin\_org/status/1357412450023464962?s=20](https://twitter.com/antonin_org/status/1357412450023464962?s=20)  not this season: Stephen Curry : 11-24 FG (45.8%)   Trae Young : 9-25 (36.0%)   Damian Lillard : 14-45 (31.1%)      Curry's shooting as good from 30-40 than Kobe shot for his career. Again, the 30 footer is the hardest shot in basketball, if a turnaround fadeaway was harder, Kobe would just take 30 footers. But he was a 33% 3PT shooter on normal 3's.  &gt;But he's also playing a league with more favorable spacing for wing players and the league itself is significantly more efficient because of the style of play and rule changes that favor offense. Kobe's era was iso heavy and also shooters had less space to work with.  lol more favorable spacing ? Have you seen Curry's team this year ? Oubre, Wiggins, Draymond, and Wiseman are the starters he plays with and he's STILL putting up 30 on almost 50/40/90 shooting. Stop the cap, PLEASE"

Trae Young pretty much Is Stephen Curry.
"Yes, because the goal is to win a championship. Stephen Curry is a top 20 player in NBA history in his fucking prime. Those don't grow on trees. You try to win a championship when that guy in his prime while you can, cuz when he's not you'll have plenty of time to rebuild when the Warriors aren't being led by a generational player.  If you trade for Brad Beal, you also have the option of trading him away for more assets later down the line. You don't have to keep him forever."
Imagine having STEPHEN CURRY on your team and you do this. LOL.
"What a stupid play, even if they fouled him. Just a stupid, stupid play.  Which supports my point... These warriors players are taking advantage of the fact that Curry is a nice superstar and keep looking him off and making silly choices. The dude has been on fire the entire game, yet some of these guys keep missing him open in the corners for silly attempts at the basket, the previous play he just made an insane step back 3 that hit nothing but net and look at what this idiot tried to do down 3 with the best shooter in the history of the game wanting to take that shot... Just a stupid, stupid play. So stupid. This shit would have never happened in this situation to Kobe. It wouldn't happen to LeBron, or KD if he didn't have other MVP caliber players playing alongside him. It definitely shouldn't happen to Stephen Curry, especially when he's hot."

"That’s nice. Warriors are ten points better without him on the floor, even though the vast majority of his minutes are tied with Stephen Curry. Looney swapped with Wiseman in the S5 or any other high minute lineup turns it into a huge net positive - team is +12 with him on the floor.  Not a coincidence. Looney has been better than Wisemsn this year. It’s because he has a better understanding of the Warriors system, makes less mistakes, is a better defender and has chemistry with Steph. Draymond doesn’t have to scream at him every trip down the floor telling him what to do. Kerr made this decision understanding that Kevon was better, for damn sure not looking at per 36 estimates that do not describe his defensive nor offensive struggles on the season."
"First, KG was insanely strong.  If you just looked at his biceps and assumed people with bigger biceps were stronger, you don't know much about muscle fibers or weight lifting.  Stephen Curry is consistently a top 3 in the bench press (and many other exercises) on the Warriors despite being skinnier than most of the team and smaller.  KG was one of the strongest players in the NBA during his prime.  He was a mismatch nightmare because nobody that lean should be as strong as he was.  He physically dominated bigger post players.  He pushed them around, abused them, and dunked on their heads.  Strength *was* his game.  Second, there were definitely stronger players than Tim Duncan, and they didn't slow KG down any.  TD was a great player because he was smart, made no mistakes, and was impossible to rattle.  Yes he had a 6'11 body with a decently muscular frame, but there were plenty more impressive NBA bodies than his.  This whole thread is not giving TD enough credit.  I'm usually the one defending KG, not TD, but holy shit."
"Give him credit for 2015 and 2016 at least lol. They were a Stephen Curry injury and Draymond Green suspension away from going back to back and even still, they almost pulled it off."
you have Stephen Curry though
Stephen Curry took 1 shot in the 2nd quarter. That is just wrong.
Steph shot similar in high school and changed his shot in college.  So we have to remember lamelo is still young and hopefully can add strength while improving his shot.  Here is an article explaining curry's progress  https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-changed-shooting-form-nbas-greatest-shooter-2016-5
Stephen Curry unfair! Mr Krabs is in there!
"I don't know how Tim Duncan can be widely regarded as a top 10 player of all time and arguably the greatest to ever play at his position but still have uninformed people like him that will construe any argument possible in an attempt to be right.  Tim Duncan detractors always use the same arguments such as ""he played most of his career minutes at center!"", ""he played with three hall of famers and was coached by Gregg Popovich"", and ""Kevin Garnett was better but he always had a bad supporting cast!"". They're such shit arguments that I can't help but facepalm and get annoyed every time I read them.  There are a lot of people that also forget that Tim Duncan played almost the entirety of his career with a bad knee after injuring it in 2000 that drastically reduced his athleticism - and he still ended up with an enormous number of accolades through playing another 16 years (I also personally think he was robbed of the 1999 MVP, and there are about five serious cases to make for him winning DPOY).  The dude who nearly had a quadruple double in a championship-winning Finals game doesn't deserved to be disrespected like this. He literally dominated every single aspect of the game throughout his 2003 carry-job from the regular season to the playoffs (but ""hE wAsNt bEtTeR aT tHrEeS!!!"") which is a strong enough argument alone to put his peak over Curry - and he actually got the job DONE.  so Duncan's peak &gt; Curry's peak (Tim Duncan's career is clearly better than Stephen Curry's currently is. Let's not even attempt to discuss that).  I don't even know why we're comparing a point guard (that hasn't even retired yet) and a power forward. Their playstyles couldn't be more different and their eras barely align - but that guy is arguing semantics and using anecdotes to try and prove something that clearly isn't true."
"Stephen Curry wasn’t a top 3 player in the league in the 2015-2016 season?  The season that many regard as one of the greatest seasons of all time? The season where he averaged 30 ppg on 67% TS and led his team to 73 wins? Which 3 players would you even put over him that season?   There’s legitimate criticism to be found for Curry, but you’re undermining your own credibility with this take."
"This is a fat load of BS. Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. These years of struggling don't make any impact on his legacy because his numbers are still incredible. Steph is 10000000% a top 100 player, arguably top 30."
"&gt; Who was more valuable to their respective teams?      Duncan without a doubt.      People don't know this shit but when Popovich stepped down to coach, he was under immense pressure and if he didn't get an NBA-ready superstar so fast in Tim Duncan, he'd probably be out of the league. Duncan's leadership style was the enabler of the Spurs culture to grow.      Duncan was in a situation like LeBron James in his first Cleveland stint from 2000-01 to 2003-04. A coach with his only plan to dump the ball on his superstar so the superstar would create something.      &gt; Whose career is better (ofc Steph as of now vs Retired Duncan)?      Duncan's career is better. It's not close enough. Duncan has quality over Curry, and quantity gap is massive. Stephen Curry has 6 All-NBA team selections and Tim Duncan has 10 All-NBA 1st team selections. Duncan's 1st team selections almost doubles Curry's entire team selections.      &gt; Better prime?      Duncan.   Here's some info for you about how Duncan didn't care about his stats and when it became tough for his team, he stepped up big time.      &gt; Tim Duncan in his prime (1998-99 to 2006-07) was   21.9 ppg 11.9 rpg 3.2 apg 0.8 spg 2.5 bpg on .551 ts in regular seasons (+2.7 rts)   21.0 ppg 11.6 rpg 4.0 apg 0.5 spg 2.8 bpg on .556 ts in 38 playoffs 1st rounds games   25.3 ppg 13.3 rpg 3.5 apg 0.7 spg 2.7 bpg on .562 ts in 91 playoffs games past 1st rounds   In that time frame, Duncan played   5 playoff series against prime O'Neal and outscored Shaq in 3 of 'em, 3-2.   4 playoff series against prime Bryant and outscored Kobe in 1 of 'em, 1-3. (1999 is the difference between Kobe and Shaq)   3 playoff series against prime Nowitzki and outscored Dirk in 3 of 'em, 3-0.   These players are known for their scoring and scoring based offensive impacts. And Duncan elevated his offensive production to their level in those series while maintaining his defensive impact. Also his efficiency got better even though he played more minutes in tougher series.      Duncan was basically a 25/13/4/3 player (on a 93.7 ppg team) in a sheep's cloth with 22/12/3/3.      &gt; Steph’s offense valued better than Duncan’s defense?      Curry's offense vs. Duncan's defense? Curry's offense is the bigger outlier but in terms of outliers, offense tends to be the bigger outlier in the playoff basketball. What I mean is that; +8 rORtg, -8 rDRtg, both are outliers but having +8 rORtg is more common. So, those two are on the same foot and Duncan's longevity is better than Curry's in current state.   So, again, it's Duncan.      ---      It's no wonder there are many people taking 2015-16 regular season Curry as the peak of the 2 players but they fail to understand that wow factor and the peak are not necessarily the same thing. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar peaked higher than Kobe Bryant but Bryant's game had more wow factor.   Curry as 'wow'-ful as he was, didn't peak as high as Duncan."
"Several actually, although they're pretty small: https://bodyartguru.com/stephen-curry-tattoos/"
stephen curry is actually psychotic the voices in my head told me
Stephen Curry is not washed up
"I'd credit green for the defense, he is the defensive Stephen Curry in that sense, his size makes him quick enough to guard smaller guards but big enough to guard big man, his defensive IQ helps him to call out plays like a quarterback.  We also had Iguodala, KD and Klay all of which are great defensive pieces as well as Curry who can play passing lanes well to get steals"
"Ops, Stephen Curry and Andrew Wiggins are able to make to this list. So inspirational."
ESPN: The Warriors plan to blow it up and rebuild by trading Stephen Curry without his consent.
"Just add Curry, Beal, oh and throw GTJ off the bench cause why not?  You should be a GM bro, you’re ability to finesse the cap and find hidden gems like Stephen Curry is unmatched"
"Those statements depend far more on team composition and success than individuals. I too would pick the team with success and a better team composition, although, that has little to do with the individuals.     Jokic and Embiid have both been amazing.  Tie-breaker unfortunately goes to availability.     Stephen Curry is having an absurd season.  Quite possibly better than his 2016 season.  His team is fighting for a play-in spot because of the team around him. (Arguably, they have a better chance to make it with Wiseman hurt now, as unfortunate as that injury was).  He has practically 0 chance to win in spite of his on/off numbers simply due to team success and composition. He's arguably been a better player than Embiid this season, just the team composition and success matters."

"Lets also have a clip on the front page titled ""Rookie Isaac Okoro clamps the hell out of Stephen Curry"""
Cavalier's forward Kevin love savagely slaps the hand of warriors guard Stephen Curry and warriors forward Draymond Green
"The funny part is that he was actually 0/8, then remembered that he was Wardell Stephen Curry and proceeded to finish 4/5"
Imagine thinking Kawhi Leonard is more valuable to a Clippers team that has Paul George than Stephen Curry is to his Warriors team.
"This curry vs lillard thing makes absolutely no sense to me. First of all nobody is questioning Currys greatness if they mention another player in the same sentence as him (just stop with this same sentence bullshit). Most people would agree that Steph is a Top 20 player of all time and since Lillard is nowhere near that this comparison is extremely unfair to begin with.  Also it is incredibly disrespectful to Dames legacy if people constantly say ""hes good but hes no Stephen Curry"" as if that makes Dames accomplishments any less meaningful. You should just appreciate both of them for what they are doing and stop acting like giving credit to one of them takes credit away from the other. So please stop being so insecure Curry-fans and enjoy the fact that we can watch both of these guys play at the level they are playing at this season. Pls stop ruining these great moments with your stupid comparisons"
Is Stephen Curry washed?
Is it a forbidden act to say “Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry” in the same sentence?

Steph Curry has got to be pissed that Stephen Curry keeps beating his records
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."

Highschool basketball coaches across the country hate him! Find out about this one trick that Stephen Curry does that will BLOW YOUR MIND!
"this comment was before his 53 point performance. the posts were some dirk quote and ""Stephen Curry is 19 points away from becoming the Golden State Warriors’ all-time leading scorer, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain""  and ive been on here since 2016 or 2017 on various accounts that get banned. i remember ur bucks flair days"
"Stephen Curry is a point guard. He's been listed as pg for his whole career. He has all the tools of a traditional point guard, even if he is a shooting oriented one."
"He probably would've been first team in 2013-2014 if voters didn't prefer to put 1 point guard and 1 shooting guard; especially at that time. It's gotten a lot more positionless since then.  2014 guard spots were a toss up between CP3 Harden and Curry; Curry was significantly ahead of all the other 2nd team players in voting  &gt;First team  &gt;F: Kevin Durant (625 points, 125 first-team votes)  &gt;F: LeBron James (623, 124)  &gt;C: Joakim Noah (551, 101)  &gt;G: Chris Paul (540, 86)  &gt;G: James Harden (502, 73)  &gt;Second team  &gt;G: Stephen Curry (489, 65)  &gt;G: Tony Parker (210, 14)  &gt;F: Blake Griffin (350, 5)  &gt;F: Kevin Love (237, 2)  &gt;C: Dwight Howard (226, 9)  He was only 13 points behind Harden for 1st team all-nba, and had 65 first team votes to harden's 73; while being 279 points above the other 2nd team guard Parker"
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"&gt;Playstyle wise, Damian Lillard and Trae Young are the most similar players to Stephen Curry  They're similar player in that they're small, (kind of) skinny and happy to pull up from anywhere, but their playstyle as in how often they run what sort of actions on court is very different. Curry famously engages in a lot of off-ball movement where fewer fouls are generally called and even then are less likely to not lead to FTs (pre-bonus), and less PnR/iso where it's the ball-handler that's getting fouled. But when he runs PnR/iso plays, he gets fouled at similar rates to the other guys mentioned.  *This isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*  (Data from this season, just as a sanity check, not as a be all end all. Using the 4 players mentioned above and a few other notable high usage ball-handlers/non-bigs.)  [PnR Ball Handler](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|7.5|11.0| |Dame|12.8|11.9| |Trae|14.3|11.9| |Harden (BKN)|8.4|11.6| |Luka|13.5|10.8| |LeBron|5.3|12.8| |Booker|6.2|10.9|  &amp;#x200B;  [Isolation](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|1.6|15.1| |Dame|4.8|13.4| |Trae|2.1|15.5| |Harden (BKN)|8.3|14.9| |Luka|4.9|7.7| |LeBron|4.6|7.9| |Giannis|4.5|15.1| |Booker|3.1|13.7|  Curry doesn't exactly stand-out in terms of how often he gets a foul call. He does stand out in terms of how often he runs an action he's likely to get a shooting foul on.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry does however lead in how many handoff plays he runs -- [let's look at the top-10 guys in terms of handoff possessions](https://go.nba.com/mc0m) and Booker since he's close and appears in tables above:  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Murray|3.2|7.2| |Curry|2.9|9.8| |Duncan Robinson|2.8|3.3| |Beal|2.8|9.9| |McDermott|2.4|5.9| |Jaylen Brown|2.3|8.8| |Jerami Grant|2.1|10.9| |Hayward|2.0|9.3| |LaVine|1.9|7.1| |Dame|1.9|8.1| |Booker|1.6|6.7|  Two things to note -- Curry is not low on the list of Shooting Foul frequency. Also, the overall shooting-foul-frequency is lower than on PnR/Iso plays -- defenders know not to foul the 3pt shooter.  This is just a quick, sanity-check look at why Curry probably has a lower baseline of foul calls and FTA than some other players -- running plays with a lower likelihood of a shooting foul more often, not simply getting calls less often on the same kind of plays.  *Again, this isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*"
"Lmfao, Curry scored more in Game 1, Game 2 and Game 4 while having more defensive attention. Game 4 Curry had double KD's BPM, better eFG WHILE SCORING DOUBLE KD's AMOUNT,  Curry had a better STL%, same BLK%, 3 less turnovers despite scoring so much more, he had a higher ORtg while having a lower DRtg so that evens out. He completely outclassed him.   Game 2 is more of the same but instead of Curry outclassing Durant, here Durants advanced metrics outclassed Curry because of his extremely low volume. Don't think that Curry was inefficient either, he has a 60% TS with a 60% EFG, the dude went 50% from 3 on 17 attempts. This one is completely subjective but Curry being the engine of the offense and being the focus of the defense. Here is the article on it.  [https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/cleveland-cavaliers-focus-on-limiting-stephen-currys-impact-in-nba-finals/95-448035043](https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/cleveland-cavaliers-focus-on-limiting-stephen-currys-impact-in-nba-finals/95-448035043)  [https://www.neosportsinsiders.com/the-cavs-will-use-multiple-guys-against-steph-curry-on-defense/](https://www.neosportsinsiders.com/the-cavs-will-use-multiple-guys-against-steph-curry-on-defense/)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwe7o8Vr\_-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwe7o8Vr_-g)  Do you think its a coincidence that in the game Curry went cold, Durant skyrocketed? This is the whole point of the GS offense in 2018. This is why they have Durant. Let Curry be the focus of the offense and defense, and when he gets zoomed in on, the others go nuts. Kerrs philosophy on this can be seen in the 2021 season where he wants Curry to be the mold for the other guys to blow up as he's getting triple teamed.  Game 1, Curry had a 4.3 BPM to Durants 0.7, had a DRtg 7 points inferior to Durants whereas he had an ORtg 12 points superior to Durants, double Durants AST% more than making up for his turnovers and had a 20% better EFG, 10% better TS. This is the big point here, the massive efficiency gap. Durant shot 14% from 3 dude.   &amp;#x200B;  You're saying KD rolled a 10 but thats not how this works. This dice system is relative, and the guy who did the best scores a 10. And no, you can't score 20. I'm trying to stay consistent."
Kris Dunn (0.0)  Stephen Curry (30.4)  LeBron James (25.4)  Jaren Jackson Jr (0.0)  Ban Adebayo (19.0)  74.8... you can keep the change.
Yeah but also it's Wardell Stephen Curry.
"I still remember before the start of the season nephews were questioning his legacy and wants him to prove it without Klay and KD, and I’m like... prove what legacy? Stephen Curry changed how modern basketball is played. That is his legacy. The greatest shooter of all time."

"&gt;Three players from each team — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins of the Warriors, and Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball of the Pelicans — will be awarded “Marvel Hero Points” for each point, rebound, assist, block and steal they accrue, with points taken away for missed shots, free throws and turnovers.  Wellcome to NBA Marvel telecast, where the rules are made up and the points don't matter"
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
He said Curry wasn't in his top 20 and Stephen Curry is amazing. I don't think he is the best analyst lol.
you know people are going in on you on this thread but stephen curry himself complained about the rule change in the past because he felt like it was intentionally penalizing guys like him with a longer routine
stephen curry came to carmax to haggle on a used sedan  lucky for him carmax he doesnt haggle like that ur good to go

"Clyde Frazier is arguably the best PG of the 70s, ahead of Jerry West. His comparables thru 13 seasons in win shares (most comparable career arc across 13 seasons to least) are:        Dwyane Wade   Stephen Curry   Chauncey Billups   Kobe Bryant   James Harden   Clyde Drexler   Russel Westbrook   Gary Payton   Steve Nash           So maybe [Clyde](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/fraziwa01.html) is excluded from this, but him + Willis were definitely stars. Not to mention, in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals -- against the Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor Lakers -- Clyde's stat line to bring home the win was: 36/7/19 on 71% shooting and 100% from the line.         Clyde on his legendary game 7 performance:        &gt;They call it The Willis Reed Game. I call it bullshit. Willis inspired us, he made the first few shots and then I took over. I had 36 points, 19 assists, seven rebounds, and four steals, sold hot dogs at halftime. I had the game of my life      Clyde was a monster, and people forget that. GOAT color commentator too."

"Stephen Curry did not have a “significant nagging injury”. Whenever curry was sucking ass, they would pan the camera to him on the bike trying to overcome his injury. During the blazers series, he was screaming “I’m back!!!!!” No one gave a FUCK about curry’s fake injury when they were up 3-1. It was never mentioned. ESPN was slurping the warriors cock. Revisionist history.   The warriors were fine. Sure bogut got injured, and klove missed a second half of a game. But the CORE PLAYERS were fine and GSW was up 3-1.   Curry did win in 2017, it was a fake ring tho. Along with 2018. His 2015 ring is also fake lmao"

"Does this prove stephen curry is a good floor raiser ? Is this really Stephen Curry's achievement by his own? I disagree. Yeah curry's gravity makes other players play more comfortably, but I don't see him creating for his teammates all the time(and he should not). Curry is also a great playmaker, but that role belongs to draymond green i think.Also steve kerr is a damn good coach, who is a massive upgrade over Saunders.   Curry needs to shoot, needs to score because no one else can do these things like him. Therefore he is a ceiling raiser, he needs to be used as a ceiling raiser. A hooper as skilled as curry can do whatever he wants, including making bums look like legit nba players, however it is not optimal.  Wiggins had a career year, but main reason behind that is the change of attitude from minny to gsw. All the other factors come after that."
Steve Nash or Stephen Curry. I consider height a part of athleticism as it's a physical attribute.

" I though sport shows should seek to entertain / educate / explore blind spots of the game but the standard of multi million salaried show hosts have descended into the gutters.  In this clip, it seeks to explore if “Lebron should fear the Steph Curry led Warriors”. Well, you dont say! Of fuckity course he should, as would any other team! Steph has produced the greatest body of offensive work that even the blind can see and u only have a game against him. But Stephen A had to go on a superlative charged soliloquy that is highly predictable and simply pointing out the obvious.  Then in come Max who again predictably jumps in to protect his boy Lebron and at one point quoted his height as part of his counter argument. This was when i had to close the video."

Sure Lakers got LeBron but he's hobbling to the play-in and Andrew Wiggins is just enough to make him work for his buckets.

"You legitimately are trying to make the argument that Lebron is as good of a shooter than Stephen Curry. This is not an argument, you are wrong."
"Sunday night, Irving locked in a rare ’50-40-90′ season with shooting percentages of 50.6% on field goals overall, 40.2% on 3-pointers and 92.2% from the free-throw line. He becomes the ninth player to do so, notably joining teammate Kevin Durant (51.0/41.6/90.5 in 2012-13 for OKC) as the fifth to manage it while averaging at least 25.0 ppg.  The other seven are: Larry Bird (2x), Mark Price, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash (4x), Dirk Nowitzki, Stephen Curry and Malcolm Brogdon."
"&gt;But if you’re looking at stats, highlights, records and everything like that, Stephen Curry has had the best season  What exactly are you talking about here? Better stats and record? Jokic is well ahead of Curry in all stats except PPG and his team has the much better record."
Wardell. Stephen. Curry.
I made one on another topic a few days ago when someone was outraged that Wade is not universally acknowledged as a top20 all-time player.  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Karl Malone * Jerry West * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Charles Barkley * Kawhi Leonard * Scottie Pippen * James Harden * Elgin Baylor * Isiah Thomas * David Robinson * Chris Paul  That's a quick and dirty top30. Who does Westbrook replace?
"This put them up 12 with 92 seconds remaining. Even if the warriors ran out every possession without scoring while Memphis ran and scored within 10 seconds, with all threes they'd just be looking at a tie.   This shot turned a possible comeback into asking for a miracle. And this was Curry's third straight three, more so than the points this was Stephen Curry saying get the fuck off my court  Dagger."
"Dillon Brooks, who was fouling Stephen Curry for the majority the game, fouls out. :shocked:"
Man there is nothing better in basketball right now than watching Stephen Curry be Stephen Curry. Here’s to hoping we see more of it on Wednesday
I forgot the Warriors have had no injuries this season sorry man.  Look I believe the Lakers are the clear favorites but it seems as if even making an argument that the Warriors can possibly win a single game or that it might not be easy to guard Stephen Curry seems to make some Laker fans insecure so here:  The Lakers are guaranteed to win this game.

He's well known to be the beat writer that is the closest to the players to the point where he probably is the only guy who can call Steph ""Wardell"".

Wardell Stephen Curry II. Didn’t really give any rules on who we could pick so I’m gaming the system lolz
"""The Grizzlies (37-33, same record as the Warriors) beat the Kings tonight, which means Sunday’s MEM-GSW game will determine which team finishes in 8th place, with the right to fly to the 7th place team’s homecourt and battle for the official No. 7 seed in the playoffs, probably on Tue 5/18 or Wed 5/19 (we think it will be Wednesday as that night is more desirable for the networks to have Stephen Curry on TV than Tuesday, but we’ll see if there are other factors involved).      The loser of Sunday’s big Grizzlies-Warriors matchup would have to face the 10th seed, win that, then play the loser of the 7th- vs 8th-place game for the official No. 8 seed in the playoffs.      Tomorrow’s game for each team (MEM-SAC and NOP-GSW) is thereby actually meaningless because all combinations will result in the Sunday MEM-GSW matchup still deciding who finishes in 8th place, with the notation that the head-to-head series between them is currently knotted up at 1-1:      If GSW beats NOP and MEM beats SAC: both teams are 38-33 heading into MEM-GSW. Obviously the winner on Sunday would finish 39-33, good for 8th place and better than the loser’s 38-34 final record.      If GSW loses to NOP and MEM beats SAC, GSW is 37-34 and MEM is 38-33 heading into the final game. GSW winning that final game means both finish tied at 38-34, but GSW would obviously win the head-to-head tiebreaker at 2-1.      If GSW beats NOP and MEM loses to SAC, GSW is 38-33 and MEM is 37-34, and GSW would have to beat MEM to avoid a tie at 38-34, in which MEM would win the head-to-head tiebreaker, 2-1.      And it follows that if GSW loses to NOP and MEM loses to SAC, both teams would be 37-34 and the winner of Sunday would obviously finish with the better W-L record at 38-38 and in 8th place.      Because tomorrow’s game is therefore “meaningless”, there is speculation that Steve Kerr will rest Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins, as they are all “banged up” (and Eric Paschall and Jordan Bell will be available)""      Courtesy of the Lets Go Warriors Youtube Channel"

"With all due respect to JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, Jrue Holiday (who played well), and even my home team guy Jerami Grant, I wouldn't lose much sleep if I were presented with the opportunity to replace them with healthy versions of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kawhi Leonard."
"This same exact block of text was written in 2004.   &gt;Yeah you can argue they are not as stacked as they could be  Folks seem to gloss over this as though it's an afterthought but this is how it's been for decades now. If Team USA doesn't send the best of the best, things can get variably dicey.   Everyone was convinced the world had not only caught up to the USA, but perhaps even surpassed them in the mid-2000's. Then when USA got their minds right and actually sent the cavalry the next time out (2008), we got original Dream Team types of results.   Circumstances are different this year because so many stars are out with injuries (as opposed to just opting out like they did in the 2000's). But you can't leave these guys at home...  * LeBron James  * Stephen Curry  * Anthony Davis  * Klay Thompson  * Kyrie Irving  * James Harden  * Donovan Mitchell   * Paul George  * Kawhi Leonard  ... and then turn around and casually be like, ""I know we didn't send our best but still."" There's literally a Dream Team sitting home and for a long time now, when those guys aren't in the fold, nothing's a sure thing."
kd never did anything before Stephen Curry. Except lose... a lot. And lose again. And lose internationally. And lose in practice. And lose in twitter

Watching this professional basketball players chunk up threes ruins the game for me. I’m not going to watch 12 guys try and recreate Stephen curry.
In Olympics it's LeBron Raymone James and Wardell Stephen Curry II
Stephen Curry is probably studying it’s form at this very moment so he can start shooting half court shots in games.
Unfortunately no Wardell Stephen Curry
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Stephen Curry type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
Russell Westbrook was one of the best players in the league the last half of the season. That's more than you can say for anyone else besides Stephen Curry.
I felt like heat could have won but then I forgot Stephen curry son was on bucks

How can you possibly hate Stephen Wardell Curry?
"I'm gonna try and take the challenge and see if I can name 30 players with a better career than Paul.       Here are 25 players I'd rank higher.      - Michael Jordan - Lebron James - Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Wilt Chamberlain - Bill Russell - Magic Johnson - Larry Bird - Tim Duncan - Shaquille O'Neal - Kobe Bryant - Hakeem Olajuwon - Oscar Robertson - Jerry West - Julius Erving - Kevin Durant - Karl Malone - Stephen Curry - Elgin Baylor - Dirk Nowitzki - Kevin Garnett - David Robinson - Charles Barkley - Moses Malone - Dwyane Wade - James Harden     Then the group that I'd rank somewhere around him in no particular order include Stockton, Ewing, Iverson, Zeke, Rick Barry, Kidd, Nash, Cousy,"
1. Kevin Durant  2. (Would be Kawhi Leonard but he injured) Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Luka Doncic  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Joel Embiid  8. LeBron James  9. Jayson Tatum  10. Anthony Davis
"“He also earns some $25 million annually in endorsements, with partners that include Nike, JBL and Budweiser in the U.S., as well as Sarantis and Protergia in Greece. That’s the fifth-highest off-the-court haul in the NBA, according to Forbes’ data. Derdenger estimates that number could climb to between $35 million and $40 million based on Antetokounmpo’s success and international appeal, bringing him within range of Stephen Curry.”"
"Yeah so I consider Jerry West to be a SG so my top 5 point guards of all-time list is:      - \#1 Magic Johnson. (All-time rank between 5-7) - \#2 Oscar Robertson. (All-time rank between 12-14).  - \#3 Stephen Curry. (All-time rank between 15-20, only needs a couple more elite seasons to move up..Guys like Duncan, Kobe, West, K.Malone all have about 10 All-NBA first team seasons).  - \#4 John Stockton. (All-time rank around 25ish).   - \#4B/5 Chris Paul. (All-time rank around 25ish, could be interchangeable with Stockton).     After that I have Nash (led the leagues best ORTG team 8 times), Isiah Thomas, Kidd, Westbrook and Payton."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"

"While he wasn't as good as he thought he was, Monta was underrated during his time on the Warriors. He shouldn't be the primary scorer, but he was often the best offensive Warrior on the court playing beside BD and Stephen Jackson during the regular season. I remember him smoking Derrick Rose whenever they matched up. His career would have probably been better if it weren't for the moped accident. But as he stated, the Curry-Ellis pair would never work defensively. Luckily for the Warriors, the Bucks chose him over Curry for the Bogut trade."
Stephen Curry. He finished last season red hot and is enjoying a nice long offseason
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors."
"Stephen Curry is in NO WAY a Top 5 most hated player lol. KD, Bron, Harden, PG, Westbrook, Kyrie, Chris Paul&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all more hated than him"
Weirdly I almost feel like you could also say that Steve Nash time travels into Stephen Curry lol  If he played today he would play a lot more like Curry
Steve Nash evolves into Stephen Curry
Stephen fucking curry
"He literally never had as great runs as KD's.   &gt; Stephen Curry never achieved greatness  So you invent stuff rn?  All I said is that KD is better. Everything Steph did *individually* at the highest level, KD did better. It is not hard to understand.  &gt; BTW Magic was never a great defender, like at no point was that true lol.  Magic would always clog the paint using his big body. You speak as if you watched him. I did, he was never top tier defender, however he was actually playing a crucial role on defense by being an extra big body (he would typically guard PFs) in the era of inside and mid range scoring....  He was never the non factor that Steph was."
"2015, 2017 and 2019 are all time record breaking runs. Imagine saying Stephen Curry never achieved greatness lmao.  If you know he was injured why did you say he missed 2 playoffs in a row ? As if he wasn’t great this season. BTW Magic was never a great defender, like at no point was that true lol."
"I think top 10 all-time is pretty set:  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  2. Bill Russell  3. Vince Carter  4. Royce O'Neale  5. Jerry West  6. Vince Carter  7. Tim Duncan  8. Eddie Jones  9. Paul Pierce  10. Vince Carter   I say Giannis is right in the convo for potentially top 10, along with Stephen Curry and Paul Arizin"
Not sure if Stephen Curry or professionally trained actor.
If you're name is Stephen Curry.
Lol people out here thinking they’re Stephen Curry.
The Golden State Warriors had a 5-8 record without Stephen Curry in 2018-19. Those teams were not “super” without Steph curry.
"The NBA would make an emergency measure and fly in Stephen Curry, challenge him to make a half court shot in 5 attempts, and if he makes it they would give him finals MVP, the championship, and a large donation to charity.    If Curry fails to make a half court shot, the children that the charity money was going to go to die and then the finals are cancelled and they play Space Jam 2: A New Legacy on ABC in place of game 7."
Stephen Curry. The Warriors are back in 21-22! I've missed them!
"I remember a thread entitled ""It's time be genuinely concerned about Stephen Curry"" after like 2 games"
"Yeah it's really exciting. And LaVine's 42% doesn't even really tell the full story. Dude's shooting that efficiently averaging 8.2 3 point attempts per game last year.  The only guy in the NBA last year to average more 3 point attempts per game shooting with THAT kind of efficiency was...Stephen Curry.  Pairing DeRozan up with an elite scorer as well as the rest of the shooters on our team is super exciting. DeRozan will easily be the worst shooter on our team getting the most minutes, but when he has a 7 foot sniper to kick out to it's barely gonna matter IMO."
“I cannot currently comment on the vaccine until the situation with (negative) trade asset 4 is resolved.” -Stephen Curry
"All-time: Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Shaquille O'Neal  Current: Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic"
"&gt; Essentially, are you implying that Steph is the more superior player in pretty much all aspects?  What do you mean all aspects? The stats I'm talking about emphasize which player gives the highest chances of winning in both the regular season and playoffs in 5 vs 5 basketball. And yes that's without a doubt Stephen Curry, in fact big gap between him and KD. They only look comparable when you just look at points and TS% and even there, Steph looks like he has the higher peak despite being only 6'3.  If we are just comparing accolades and not stats, I'd still take Curry. He is by far the biggest factor to the Warriors dynasty. Team went 29-3 without KD from 2017-2019 until Raptors finals, that's again a 70 win pace which includes playoff games."
"maybe. but in terms of legacy, bigger impact on the game, skillsets, etc I think stephen curry takes it with a hand behind his back. that does not take away from kd being a top 20 player oat and a top 6 scorer oat."
"It's about the NBA and due to a national pandemic and some NBA cities mandating vaccines for those involved in ""mega-events"" like NBA games the two topics have converged.  My local team is the Warriors. If Wiggins doesn't get a vaccine and misses all the home games that is a *huge* blow to what the Warriors are trying to accomplish. That's another fucking year of Stephen Curry wasted. That more than anything else is what would be truly criminal about that.  The intersection of these things feels pretty important right now."
"I hope this is a joke, you paid him $205 million dollars, he is not Stephen Curry. I understand the need to pay players to keep them in a small market area but like I said, $205 million dollars is just straight up ridiculous."
"I knew it! I knew Stephen Curry was the cure for coronavirus!  For real though, excellent explanation. I hope a lot of people see this and appreciate your input."
"Yeah but what im telling you is that MPJ's stats are just not in the same category as Zion  The dude had 27 ppg on 65%TS, the only player who had a better scoring season than him last year was Stephen Curry imo. He's in a different league. And those numbers include the start of the season where he wasn't in shape, in the last few months he was averaging over 30 on similar efficiency"

"stephen “fake moon landing” curry also fits the bill   hmm, maybe Wiggins too, but i’m not sure about his handles"
"Depends a bit on who’s describing it. [This atory](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/steph-curry-mcl-sprain) says  &gt;	We do grade the tears, one through three. His is a one which means it’s more of a stretch injury, not really a tear.  while [this guy](https://williamsterett.com/blog-dr-william-sterett/2016/5/3/stephen-curry-knee-injury) says  &gt;	We classify MCL tears as: Grade 1 - partial tears without increased looseness  Either way, there was ligament damage that kept him out two weeks."
"""Unicorns"", aka 7 footers who can handle the ball, pass, shoot and switch on defense, will become much more common.   The whole league bought into the whole downsizing trend once Curry won a title and MVP  but what they failed to realize is that there's really only one Stephen Curry (and only one Draymond). If you're under 6'4/6'5 and are not an insanely great shooter, it's easy to get exposed in the playoffs. Teams have caught on to this, I think, and are starting to go the other way."
Stephen Adams and Steven Curry
Genetically engineering taller human beings to surround clones of Stephen Curry with an Afro with a hole in it to protect and carry the ball all the way to the rim
"I mean Doncic last season was in similar defensive role as Lebron James, Stephen Curry or Chris Paul.  Simmons that you brought up however did guard point of attack so I don't really get how he fits with the other guys you listed."
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."

Stephen Curry
"According to Zach Lowe, just because Lacob says he doesn’t want Simmons doesn’t mean that Bob Myers, Steve Kerr, and Stephen Curry don’t want Ben Simmons. The Warriors core was actually petitioning the front office to trade for an impact player, and Ben Simmons fits the mold. (Bradley Beal was their top choice though).   We already know Morey is willing to do Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, 14th, and 2 future firsts. So the question becomes how much of that are there Warriors willing to give up, and what is Morey willing to accept with the Warriors removing stuff.  My guess is the trade, if it goes through, would involve the Warriors telling the Sixers they can either have Kuminga or Wiseman/Moody."
"Jokic also wasnt better in this years playoffs , and if you describe how kawhi gets his points his 30 ppg on 60% shooting becomes more skillful than whatever jokic did. Kawhi scored that many points shooting contested midranges shots while jokic scored most of those points in the paint.Kawhi’s passing is now slightly above average so his weakness isnt even that daunting. And since stephen curry saves all his energy on offense while kawhi has to expend energy on both sides speaks to how good kawhi is offensively."
"What gets me with these efficiency argument is that Duncan was the enabling force of the offense, he was the centrepiece.      https://youtu.be/3ig9xiu5VOU?t=4919   @1:21:59      Duncan was getting defended as if he was god damn Stephen Curry throughout the series by one of the best defensive teams and the best defensive frontcourts ever (Big Ben and Sheed, Dice coming off the bench). And people are not comfortable with his efficiency?   Yes, he was inefficient at scoring. He was still the driving force. His playmaking value was off the charts.      And this is just offensive end. The lads are talking like there's no gigantic gap on D between Duncan and Ginobili."
next on undisputed: Is stephen curry taking shots at LeMickey?
&gt; If Middleton can be a strong #2  List of championship number 2s in reverse chronological order:  2020: anthony davis  2019: pascal siakam  2018: durant or curry  2017: durant or curry  2016: kyrie  2015: klay or dray  2014: kawhi or tony parker  2013: wade  2012: wade  2011: tyson chandler  2010: pau gasol  2009: pau gasol  2008: kg or pierce  2007: tony parker  2006: shaq  2005: tony parker or manu  2004: sheed or billups  2003: stephen jackson??  2002: kobe  2001: kobe  2000: kobe  I think 2003 would be the only year khris would have a strong argument for being the 2nd best player
"The Warriors absolutely are **not** contenders, at least right now. They *might* end up as contenders come the end of the season if Klay looks like Klay and Wiseman can play without being a net negative player.  They have benefited from two things, playing next to Stephen Curry and having a relatively easy schedule.   I'm not saying the Wolves won't be good btw, I'm just saying it's kind of pointless to use these stats at this point in the season without context."
Is it time to be concerned about Stephen Curry?

"[He finally did it](https://hoopshype.com/rumor/1204499/):  &gt;During an interview at an Under Armour event, Stephen Curry talked about Spanish guard Juan Carlos Navarro, who retired this summer after a successful 21-year career. “[Navarro] was one of my favorite Spanish national players,” Curry told Jugones. “He did a move in the 2010 World Championship where he shot a three off of one leg, and I wanted to copy that move.”"
Jimmy Butler fined $50k for tampering with Stephen curry.
"Stephen Curry nearly willed the Warriors to a win in the Finals against us when our entire gameplay was “let anyone but Curry score”, he’s proven that he is the best of the best, look at the Warriors stats when Curry isn’t on the floor from anytime from 2015 to now. They have a word rating with KD, Klay, Draymond, Iggy + anyone than Curry + 4 bench players. He’s proven it"
DPOY Stephen Curry
If you had never watched basketball before and didn't know who any of these players were... you wouldn't believe if someone told you James Harden was an MVP and top player for over half a decade (6x All-NBA First Team). He looks nothing like his former self. You'd also think Stephen Curry is the best player in the NBA if this was the first game you've ever watched!

But Stephen Curry.
"They aren’t rigging games for the bulls. The bulls have lots of prime-age talented players on their roster and lots of motivation to win it all.   The Washington Wizards have the exact same thing as well.   Stephen curry is just a freak athlete. He is comparable to Michael Jordan in that age is just a number. So, the Gs warriors doing well right now is really not that big of a deal."
"Stephen Curry is the Lionel Messi of basketball: a child prodigy, extremely skilled, short for their sport's standards, and has an insufferable fanbase."
Finally they played a good team. I knew Warriors were fake. It's time to worry about Wardell Stephen Curry II
Are you forgetting Stephen Curry?   https://youtu.be/5_goU7I_DVM
"I'd think by now we'd question the validity of high school rankings.  &gt; [Stephen] Curry was ranked as the No. 16 player in North Carolina in the Class of 2006 as a senior at Charlotte Christian in North Carolina. However, he was ranked lower as the No. 60 point guard in the nation and the No. 300 player overall.  &gt; At 6-foot-2 and 165 lbs, Curry's size presented a disadvantage similar to the one Jordan faced. The difference was that there was no dramatic growth spurt waiting for Curry as a senior, and he had to prove his skills as an undersized point guard to get attention from scouts.   https://www.insider.com/stephen-curry-high-school-drove-him-to-greatness-2021-3"
Keep on shooting. I'm sure you'll become Stephen curry
"Michael Jordan,LeBron James,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,Magic Johnson,Larry Bird,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan,Shaq O’Neal,Hakeem Olajuwon,Wilt Chamberlain,Bill Russell,Kevin Durant,Stephen Curry,Dirk Nowitzki,Dwyane Wade,Kevin Garnett,David Robinson,Jerry West,Charles Barkley,Karl Malone,John Stockton,Russell Westbrook,James Harden"
I dont understand these numbers - just like Charles Barkeley on NBA Analytics. But one thing I understand is that Stephen Curry is greatest shooter of all time.
	The MVP gotta be Stephen Curry  for me
"Right now it's probably:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Kevin Durant 4. Paul George 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Giannis  Jimmy and Giannis have actually been better than Paul George so far, but Jimmy is being penalized for his missed games from injury and Giannis for team record."
Top 3 point guard? LOL get out of here. I can list a couple that are DEFINITELY and NO DOUBT better than Trae:  James Harden Chris Paul Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Kyle Lowry    Now which 4 are you kicking out to put Trae as top 3? LOL
"Was trying to name 20 point guards or ""combo"" guards better than him all time. Could only get to 18.

"Everybody who are playing significant mins on Warriors know their roles, can make good screens, cut to the basket, pass the ball at the right time, shoot, and can defend as team understands concepts and matchups. Stephen Curry can shoot to provide spacing, handle the ball, move well off ball, and can set screens to provide teammates cutting lane or defender forget it is Stephen Curry setting the screen Curry can pop out to shoot with teammates understanding that is an option to pass the ball to him. We won’t see a player like Stephen Curry for a long time."
"&gt; Now I am not saying Stephen Curry is the greatest point guard of all time but the idea that this is a clear-cut #1/#2 situation is basically Lakers propaganda, so either option is valid.  Magic is largely considered a top 5 all time player. Unless you are saying Curry is arguably top 5, it's pretty clear cut. And I fucking hate the Lakers."

"&gt;Obviously I have not seen Magic play  It shows that you have not.  One title was as the third option and the FMVP was one of the most narrative-driven awards in the history of the award. He was only the undisputed leader of the Lakers for three of those five titles, i.e. the same amount as Steph (the numbers are *very* clear on the fact that Curry was the leader of the 2017 and 2018 Warriors). Basically, awarding Magic undisputed GOAT PG solely for his team achievements is rewarding Magic for getting drafted to a team with Kareem fucking Abdul-Jabbar on it, whereas Curry got drafted by a team with an owner who was in a Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes-tier rivalry with Donald Sterling over worst owner in the Western Conference.

Give Stephen Curry the max and then sign minimum guys that aren't complete idiots. Man I should be the Dubs GM.

Stephen curry is in supreme mvp form right now. This team is clearly not a championship level team unless curry has a all time season.  They are off to a great start  If adrien Peterson can come off a acl injury and run 2k anything is possible we will have to wait and seee

"[538 Preseason Forecast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-bucks-run-it-back-can-lebron-win-his-fifth-ring-how-our-model-sees-the-2021-22-nba-season/)  &gt;We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.  5 RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives, among the team’s projected rotation players."
"I've been on this train with Klay for years. I have thought him overrated for a number of seasons, and I think coming off these two injuries, he will be much worse defensively.   My understanding of the Warriors being great has, for a number of years, been that Stephen Curry and Draymond Green are criminally underrated. Iggy, too, honestly.   I thought that the most important thing to do when you have a guy who might go down as the greatest PG in the history of basketball that you do everything possible to maximize what you can do while he's still a stud.   It's why I didn't like the draft picks the past two years. I thought LaMelo was the obvious choice, and that picking Wiseman was a fuckup. I thought Kuminga was multiple years away from being an above-average NBA player if he becomes one. I thought a trade was the logical decision there."
"He's a decent team defender, and has the hand speed and eyes to play the passing lanes decently. On the other hand he can get a bit handsy and pick up unnecessary fouls, or gamble for steals and get blown by.   I'd say he's at the bar for his position. If your point guard is a better defender than Stephen Curry you should be pretty darn happy. If they're worse, you shouldn't necessarily be too upset (PG is the least defensively-impactful position in general)."

He averaged 26/6/5 in 2015. Steph should have won finals mvp that year  He was averaging like 28/game on good shooting in both 2017 and 2018. 2019 he put up 30/game  Overall for his finals career across five finals he’s averaging 27/6/6 on 42/39/92 shooting  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/stephen-curry-ppg-by-season-in-the-finals
"If a player wears 4 inch heel shoes regularly in game does he get his playing height changed until such time he wears normal shoes?  If Steph started wearing 10 inch platforms in game and lazily heaves threes and play no defense does he get to be called 7 foot guard Stephen Curry?  Heck you get Shaq being listed as the same height as wilt when you could clearly notice that wilt was obviously taller than shaq. Olajuwon was not really 7 feet tall, he was short by at least an inch.  Hell the wrestler Andre the giant was claimed to be 7'4 when in reality he was about 7 feet (add an inch if you want).  The reason why some players are billed as taller than they are is the same as wrestlers and that is to make them seem more impressive."
Yeah but you know who really fucked up ? The Warriors taking Stephen Curry over Brandon Jennings who was so much better during the first 5 games of his career
"He's a 26ppg scorer who can shoot 41% while averaging 8 3PA, that's pretty much Klay's career high in both categories. Also probably a top 5 playmaker among big men. Imagine him as the 2nd option instead of 1st, with STEPHEN CURRY drawing attention."
