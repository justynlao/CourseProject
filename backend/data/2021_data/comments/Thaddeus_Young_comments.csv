Thaddeus Young is pretty damn good
"All this tells me is that Thaddeus Young, Daniel Gafford, and Lauri Markannen aren’t good defenders."
Thaddeus Young fouls a lot
"What I meant was I respect Bens ability to get into the paint and handle himself through contact. People dumb as balls and dont understand thats the aspect I'm in awe of. Giannis has that same ability to finish strong and be athletic. I hate the 76ers and I hate Ben Simmons for being a liability as somebody that can't shoot the ball at all, even Shaq shot mid range and had to be marked there, but to denounce Bens basketball IQ is a travesty. Him being not able to shoot the jumper bc of whatever his left hand right hand issue is has nothing to do with IQ and ability.    Just like Lonzo. I've been a bit Lonzo fan for a long time because of his basketball IQ. He's smart and personally I love defense and transition creativity, which Lonzo finds himself being really good at. Dude sometimes looks like a modern day Dennis Rodman with his ability to create simply and his mindset of hounding for the ball and fishing for turnovers. I'm a defender at heart in soccer and ultimate Frisbee, having played with players that have gone pro that are semi pro played in D1 full ride d2 the entire spectrum of top ball in America and there's a difference in somebody who just knows to defend and somebody who just scores. You literally don't learn elite defense, you need to have been born with that mentality and an off beat timing to follow a play before it happens. As a defender in all sports, if you're on time you're late. I lost track of what I was talking about but defense is great great players see the game different. Comparing somebody like Kanter to any time Shaq is like comparing Thaddeus Young to younger Carmelo Anthony. Thaddeus decent player I like him but he's no Carmelo."

The disrespect to Thaddeus Young /s
ah yes the thaddeus young special statistic
"Thaddeus Young played 13 mins and had 3 TOs. Seriously, fuck you and your shit butter fingers Thad. You out tank commandered Mike fucking Muscala.   Also, fuck that foul called on WCJ on that Muscala corner three. They touched hands after the shot. Fucking bull shit."
I'm shocked Thaddeus Young hasn't done that.
"Fun fact, Thaddeus Young is no longer part of this club, his career average dropped to 13.1"
"Again, it’s a very special start either way. But if this post said “he’s the 3rd person to do blah blah blah with 1.6 or less TOS” it sounds way worse than “the first person since”. Just type “Thaddeus Young statline” into google and you’ll see what I mean"
Thaddeus Young stat
We basically traded Dipo for Thaddeus Young. Considering we traded Caris Levert for Young.

The definition isn't clear but it's officiated consistently. Flagrant 1 is usually any illegal contact above the shoulders. Mostly grabs like the one [Ibaka had on Thaddeus Young last night.](https://youtu.be/t4JiDpRonf8&amp;t=1m59s) Flagrant 2 is usually illegal contact above the shoulders with a wind-up. Any wild swipes that land in the head or neck area like [Ingram on Roby](https://youtu.be/C316-HH3JH8) or this one.
"Barely over 12,000 points.  He's missed alot of games, going back to college.   He's not in the top 250.  Heck, Thaddeus Young has more career points.   I hope he makes it one day, but I honestly don't know if it's his goal.  He wants to be famous for something other than being a basketball player."

[never forget the legendary Thaddeus Young](https://awfulannouncing.com/nba/fox-sports-indiana-graphic-compares-thaddeus-young-to-lebron-jordan-bird-and-magic.html)
Thaddeus Young sends his regards
"Individual defense for guards doesn't have much impact on the game. Gobert could average 8 points a game and still have an all-star impact. Patrick Beverley, on the other hand, will never be that impactful.  &gt; everyone values offense over defense  Look at how Paul Millsap got paid. OG Anunoby. Robert Covington. Jonathan Isaac. Thaddeus Young.  Don't compare a shooting PF to a defending PG."
Thaddeus Young could be a good bench piece for a contender to grab in the trade deadline
Thaddeus Young
Thaddeus Young is one of my favorite players to watch.
"[Charania] Thaddeus Young has been chosen as the 398th injury replacement for the 2022 all star game"""
I think this sub calls a lot of stats “cherry picked” when they actually offer some interesting insight. Even the statline in that one Thaddeus Young graphic is actually a validly impressive stat imo.
"Almost benched him last minute but kept him in for the week. Him, Jarret Allen, and Thaddeus Young have helped me turn around a team that started the year 1-3 8nto the top seed at 7-3 soon to be 8-3."
*Thaddeus Young smiles in approval*
That PJ Washington and Lebron graphic is Thaddeus young level
"are you suggesting that a starting lineup of Wayne Ellington, Jarrett Jack, Saregy Karasev, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez isn't a national TV draw? smh my head"
"How big of a quality difference is there between legit NBA branded/sold jerseys, and knockoff cheap ones?  A Thaddeus fucking Young jersey is $70 on NBA.com, meanwhile I pull up random sites and I'm finding like a Shaq jersey for $15 and a signed Thaddeus Young jersey for like $20."
"Zach LaVine is not on the trade block.  Lauri Markkanen is not on the trade block.  The second best player on the Bulls is Thaddeus Young, even though he's coming off the bench.  He may not be starting, but he's playing in the fourth quarter.  And he often plays just under 30 minutes per game, particularly in close games.    However, the Bulls are listening to offers for Young and may well trade him.  Or they may hold onto him in the hopes of getting the team some playoff experience. They really can't lose either way."
"In the Bulls game the other night he looked worse than Thaddeus Young.  Thagic is good, but he is no All Star.  Neither is Sabonis.  Butler, Adebayo, VanVleet, Middleton are all better."
I think Thaddeus Young would be an enticing piece for the nets. Can play small ball 5. Don’t know if Bulls do that though
The second best player Zach has ever played with is Thaddeus Young.   Zach Lavine is a much better player than Demar.  Does everything better.

"So you telling me Clint Capela, Bogdanovic, and De’Andre Hunter are not a better supporting cast than Lauri Markannen, Otto Porter and Chandler Hutchinson?  Our second option is Thaddeus Young and third is second year Coby White."

"I've always liked Thaddeus Young, I used to think he would pair super well with Harden with his skillset"
"Gotta wait until after the trade deadline.  if philly gets thaddeus young back, thatd be a huge weapon against the nets."
"Fuckers telling me, always in the barber shop  ""Zach Lavine ain't 'bout this, Lavine ain't 'bout that""  My boy an Allstar on fucking MJ and them  He, he, they say that guy don't be putting in no work  Shut the fuck up, y'all ain't know shit  All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about ""Zach Lavine ain't no hitter, Zach Lavine ain't this, Zach Lavine a fake""  Shut the fuck up, y'all don't live with that man  Y'all know that man got caught with a 40 piece  Shootin' at the Pelicans and shit  Man been on a tear since fuckin' I don't know when  Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that  Them boys savages out there  If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Zach Lavine  I'm fucking beatin' they ass, I'm not fucking playin' no more Know them Bulls roll with Pat Will and them  (Young Thaddeus on the beat)"
Everyone will be talking about Zach but this was a great great game by Thaddeus Young. He has probably been our 2nd best player this season and was playing like Thagic Johnson tonight. Should really be a 6MOTY candidate tbh
"It won't just be because he cools down, it'll also be because he'll eventually have to play better opponents and stop hiding from guys like Gobert in favor of playing an injured Nurkic or Thaddeus Young, who are easy buckets.   He's literally ducking teams, bailing out before his coach realizes he's sitting out the game in order to avoid competition and no one's made a peep about it, lmao. Lost a lotta respect for him  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/30908195/philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid-late-scratch-vs-utah-jazz-back-tightness](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30908195/philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid-late-scratch-vs-utah-jazz-back-tightness)  He's so lucky he plays in the East and will get to feast on teams like Brooklyn or Boston who have no big men. His numbers would plummet even faster if he was facing regular comp"
Good question; who knows what’s goin on with him when he decides to sit out a game vs the best defender in the league despite playing every game in between then vs players like Nurkic and Thaddeus Young  Not even his coach knows what’s going on with him. He doesn’t even know Embiid isn’t gonna play before he calls in hours before despite being 100% every practice and game before then.
"This is a loaded stat. When Lavine isn’t playing, that usually means it’s bench vs bench. The bulls actually have a pretty good bench with Thaddeus Young being our second best player, along with guys like Garret Temple and Satoransky who provide great value. On the other hand the bulls starters are obviously not very good so they are going to get our scores a lot even with Lavine. I guarantee you the Bulls would have a much worse record if Lavine weren’t on the team."
"Thaddeus Young should absolutely be on this list, dude is having one of the best years of his career so far."
"Anyone who thinks he's an empty stat guy (Hi Bill Simmons) just isn't watching. I have no doubt at this point that he could make up a ""super friend"" group and internally rank them however you want (like Kyrie technically being a ""third option"" or Anthony Davis being a ""second option"" or whatever). But look at the Bulls.. who are the other ""super friend"" guys? Coby White has been ass. Patrick Williams is a rookie who has struggled... Thaddeus Young is a nice player but he's a 25 MPG role player.  The Bulls aren't a ""Zach LaVine just being better"" away from being a contender...  I'm not overly invested in LaVine since I'm about 85 % sure he will likely leave for a better team in free agency so he can be part of a super friend team, it's just amusing how consistently bad takes are on him. You don't score 28.8 PPG on .649 TS% (without even the benefit of superstar officiating) by being some empty stat guy. Any team would be lucky to ad him as a free agent in a couple years."
"They are a proper PG away from being a solid playoff team imo. Coby White is not a bad player, but he’s quite inefficient and he’s not the type of a PG they need. Old school playmaker with defense who picks his shots would be perfect for them imo. Thaddeus Young looks like their best playmaker most games right now."
"Heat fans are all praying for Thaddeus Young if you go over to /r/heat , or John Collins"
"Is he on the same tier as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Thaddeus Young?"

Lavine. Middleton has the reigning MVP with him. I wake up everyday imagining how different lavine's game could be if he had another top 50 player with him. Our second best player is Thaddeus young. No disrespect I love Thad but Zach simply can't be snubbed because of his record if he doesn't have a good team in the first place

Thaddeus Young
&gt; Capable  &gt; Thaddeus Young 25% 1.5 3PM
"**Underrated Bulls Player: Thaddeus Young**  After underperforming last year, mostly due to bad coaching, 32-year-old Bulls veteran Thaddeus Young has a true shooting percentage of .601 this year. He's not being asked to spend all his time at the three point line, and instead getting in the middle of the floor and deciding whether to pop out for a shot or attack the basket based on the defense.   Young is also excellent at passing out of double teams.  He's a decent rebounder.  And Young is Chicago's best defender.    I'm not saying he's an All Star, but Young is a man of many talents, a veteran, and a glue guy who is in his happy place once again.  I think he's been overlooked, understandably because he's scoring 11 points per game on a bad team, and he's not even one of the young guns who fans hope to see develop.  But he's doing his job, and doing it well.  **Overrated Bulls Player: Zach LaVine**  Don't get me wrong, Zach LaVine is an All Star candidate for the Bulls, no question.  He's having his best season, and he's underpaid.  He's a scoring machine, even with all the defenses focused on stopping him.  He really is the Bulls' best overall player this year because of his fantastic scoring.    But LaVine still struggles to do anything but score.  People who say he's improved as a passer are ignoring his turnover rate. Yes, LaVine is making 5.3 assists per game, a career high.  But he's also turning over the ball 3.9 times a game, also a career high.  And that ratio of turnovers to assists is not good.  So yes, his scoring is better than ever, it's eye catching (27 points per game) and it's efficient, too (.645 TS%).  But LaVine still struggles as a passer, and he's still a below-average defender. LaVine is the Bulls' MVP, but the Bulls are not a good team, and LaVine is not quite as valuable as his scoring makes him look."
"Because he’s a 6’4 20 year old with a 7’1 wingspan who can shoot, dribble, pass, and defend. Oh and also because Kuzma was paid 13 million...  I mean shit if Taj Gibson, Trevor Ariza, Bobby Portis, Thaddeus Young, Maxi Kleber, Aminu, Corey Joesph, etc got paid 9-10+ million then THT definitely will..."
Thaddeus Young? Average? Have you seen the legendary company he's in?
Taj Gibson &amp; Thaddeus young
"Love it, although it would be better to have the default be Per36. Gives a much different top 4, which makes sense with “hustle” being an attribute of sparkplug bench guys. Love Dipo and Sabonis but there’s no way they hustle more than TJ.  Per36:   1. Thaddeus Young   2. Andre Drummond   3. Draymond Green   4. TJ McConnell"
"Hopefully not, he probably didn't deserve it over Joe Ingles or Thaddeus Young even when he was playing really well."
Idk thaddeus young is pretty good
TJ McConnell is in fact the greatest NBA player of all time. Greater than Michael Jordan. Greater than LeBron James. Greater than Thaddeus Young.

Lauri and Coby were awful. No idea why they were on the floor that late in the 4th. Really weird decision from Donovan.   Anyways Thaddeus Young is my favorite player.
Thaddeus Young was unbelievable.
Yeah Thaddeus Young is awesome.  Been to the playoffs 8 times too so it's not like he's been on bad teams either.
Joe Ingles or Thaddeus Young should win it but Jordan Clarkson probably will because voters are brain dead and only care about scoring. You might as well have a bunch of Twitter morons vote for SMOTY at this point.

"It depends on the head coach.  Sometimes the coach will name a captain or co-captains, sometimes he'll appoint them.  Sometimes he won't do either.   I remember when Michael Jordan and Bill Cartwright were co-captains under Phil Jackson.  Sometimes the captain is the best player on the team, other times it's the veteran who is past his prime but acts like a coach on the floor.  Otto Porter Jr. and Thaddeus Young were co-captains under Boylen but apparently there aren't any designated captains under Donovan."
They can thank their best player Thaddeus young for that.
"It's like when the Nets traded Thaddeus Young, brook Lopez and Bogdonavic at the start of their rebuild. 3 good players but getting old and not a great fit anymore."
"Young, the rest aren’t really similar at all lol.  Thaddeus is probably a better playmaker then Steph tho."
"Basically all of the vets from the 2018-2019 season: Ed Davis, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll.   Obviously there's D'Angelo Russell but he's not random.   Other guys (some not really random but no stars) who weren't on the team for long but made a memorable impact when they were: Shaun Livingston, Alan Anderson, Gerald Green, Thaddeus Young, Trevor Booker"
"Lavine is literally still being called an empty stats player, idk where that he gets a pass shit from. Lavine, Trae Toung, and Booker were. You can literally go to any previous season and check our postgame threads.  And Kenna Walker is a better player than Lavine? Something that isn’t even disputed. Your point?  Also, that team that should get us 8th Seed, you do know that Porter Jr, and Markannen have been out the vast majority of this season to injury right? So... a team of Lavine, Thaddeus Young, Coby White is supposed to get us to the playoffs.   Zach and Stephen Curry’s current numbers are nearly identical. Outside of literally turning into Lebron or 2018-2019 Harden, he can only do so much."
"Idk if your purposely being obtuse but even in the East, you need decent teammates.   Bro 2nd best player is Thaddeus Young, with the next being 2nd Year Coby White.  You can scream out it’s the East but at the end of day, when your next best player averages 12 POINTS, getting wins is hard unless you’re a superstar."
Thaddeus Young
All time I gotta go with Ben Gordon  I'm young so maybe some older Bulls fans have a different opinion but I don't think he got the respect he deserved.  Currently I wanna go with Troy Brown Jr. Really really good perimeter defender who hasn't hit his potential on the offensive end. Another option would be Thaddeus Young
Thaddeus Young would average 30 points a game easy

I think if Colby White can develop and play point, and if we can get the right depth..  I just wish we could find our groove again, it has been years.. we lost some big names and I don't know why we can't keep players happy.  I worry that Lavine is headed out. playoffs need to be a Bulls thing and it's not even normal anymore."

"Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez    They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge"
"Even if true (I'd probably still take Thaddeus Young), the Bulls suck."
"But what about my boy Thaddeus Young who's in an elite club of players in NBA history to play in at least 800 games and have career averages of 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals, while shooting at least 49 percent from the field and 30 percent from 3-point?"
"This game was for the guys who blamed the Vucevic trade and Billy Donovan for our suboptimal performance lately. And I get that it's only one game, Celtics weren't fully healthy but Lavine was out as well. I dare say we won this game thanks to our defense, which is fucking great for us.  Donovan isn't an elite coach and his tenure at OKC was lackluster to say the least. But a coach can improve just like a player and it's impossible not to see him trying new things almost daily. The most recent example is to move Thaddeus Young back to the bench. This guy isn't shy to shake things up anymore. Right now, we couldn't have a better coach after Jim Boylen.  And I cannot love what Vucevic had done for us more than this. He has been SO FUCKING GOOD. The problem lies elsewhere, we have a paper thin roster when it comes to consistency and basketball iq. Karnisovas is only getting started, it's gonna take some time to clean up after garpax mess."
"PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - Marcus Smart  SF - Doug McDermott   PF - Thaddeus Young  C - Enes Kanter    There's no one on the team that can take over and be the main scorer on a night-to-night basis, neither Rubio or Smart are so deadly or consistent from 3 that I think opposing teams would be content with letting them both shoot the amount it'd take for them to create positive offense, McDermott and Young are both role players that'll give you 10-15ish points a game, and Kanter even if he has a god game like he did recently, could still be abused defensively."
"I still got Thaddeus Young over him so no, maybe he cracks top 80 in a few years?"
He played nothing like Thaddeus Young
Good post game and solid passer sounds kind of like Thaddeus Young
Thaddeus Young and Patrick Patterson are both younger than Steph Curry
And Thaddeus Young floaters
"Probably Buck Williams, Derrick Coleman, Kenyon Martin, Kris Humphries, Kevin Durant, order of those 5 TBD. Thaddeus Young and Jason Collins when Nenad Krstic played center are honorable mentions"
"&gt; there's decent talent on the roster,  Who?   Thaddeus Young?"
"&gt;The Sixers traded Iguodala for Bynum, who didn’t play, and were left with Holiday, Evan Turner, Jason Richardson, Elton Brand, Spencer Hawes, Thaddeus Young and very few draft picks.  Philadelphia surrendered a grand total of one draft pick in the Bynum trade -- a 2018 first.  And even that pick was returned to the Sixers ( along with Dario Saric ) long before being executed, in return for Elfrid Payton.  &gt; After three years we acquired two future all stars...  So did the other teams I referenced.  Miami acquired Butler and Adebayo ( and Dragic ) without tanking.  Toronto acquired Lowry and Leonard ( and Gasol and Siakam ) without tanking.  Milwaukee acquired Antetokounmpo, and Middleton and Holiday without tanking.  This idea that one has to embarrass themselves for three years just to obtain two All-stars is unsupported by fact, and obviously not the case."
"You don’t understand how few assets the Sixers had remaining after the Bynum trade, which means you don’t understand why the process was successful.   The Sixers traded Iguodala for Bynum, who didn’t play, and were left with Holiday, Evan Turner, Jason Richardson, Elton Brand, Spencer Hawes, Thaddeus Young and very few draft picks. After three years we acquired two future all stars along with however many first and second round picks and stashes. Saying the process wasn’t successful is just laughable. But go on showing how little you actually know about this organization."
The Pacers really slandered this man for not beating LeBron in the 1st round with Thaddeus Young lol
I wonder how an Ish Smith/Wayne Ellington/Trevor Ariza/Thaddeus Young/Jeff Green team would do
Thaddeus Young
"Players with 800 games to average 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 49% FG, 30% 3PT that haven’t won MVP: Thaddeus Young ✅"
"They can afford Lavine, Lauri (Restricted) Vucevic, and Fournier? Not to mention Thaddeus young making $14,000,000?"
"I think it would be pretty ugly for the Bulls to match that. Even if they waive the bird rights to all their free agents, decline Arcidiacono's option, and cut Thaddeus Young and Satoransky, picking up only their $11 million partial guarantee, they're somewhere in the neighborhood of $29-30 million in cap space with 6 players signed to the team.   They could do it, but the team would be incredibly thin."
Protect  -Patrick Williams  -Coby White  -Thaddeus Young  -Zach Lavine  -Nikola Vucevic   -Daniel Theis  -Troy Brown JR  - Tomas Satoransky
RJ and Thaddeus Young were discussing this on Road Trippin’. They both said Lue was a great talent manager and excellent at coaching teams loaded with stars.

"&gt; First of all Kevin Love takes a huge percentage of shots from 3 so there is no point looking at his FG%.  Kevin love shot 40% from 3 smooth brain....but just 33% from the field overall. Majority of his field goal attempts were 2’s and he shot just 35% from 0-3 feet. So there goes your nonsensical argument.   &gt; Bosh told Love that playing with LeBron would be ""extremely frustrating"" becoming a spot up shooter and having plays taken away from you.  False, Bosh never said he would become a spot up shooter playing with LeBron. Yes, he did say plays would be taken away from you and that’s expected when you go from being the first option on a garbage team to then playing behind multiple stars better than you on a championship roster. That’s common sense...  &gt; And funny how the 'teammate played horribly' argument is only used for LeBron  I’m just telling a fact here? Kevin Love vastly underperformed as an all star. You’re telling me 11 PPG on 33% shooting is not playing horribly? He was getting bodied by Thaddeus Young lmao. I know you have quite the LeBron hate boner but be real. Love was shooting 35.3% from 0-3 feet and 18.2 percent from 3-10 feet, that’s LeBron fault too, right?  Love also had a 15.2 percent turnover rate per 100 possessions which was the worst in his career. Must also be LeBron’s fault he couldn’t handle the ball in the post.  In the raptors series, Kevin Love averaged 20 PPG on 47% shooting. That is showing up, that is playing like an all star, unlike what he did in the pacers and Celtics series."
The disrespect to Thaddeus Young smh
"I mean I get Wiseman wasn’t great this year but holy crap if Marcus Smart, Terrance Ross, or Thaddeus Young are the best the warriors can do for Wiseman they should 100 percent keep him"
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"Daniel Theis? My ranking is Lavine, then Vuceivic, then Theis. Thaddeus Young was pretty good too. And Coby had flashes of being our second best player."
"And Thaddeus Young is the fourth best player of all time. In all seriousness, though, Tatum has put himself in undisputed GOAT territory. He is the only player in the history of professional basketball to score 50 points in a game in the regular season, a play in game and the playoffs."
Give me Tobias Harris &gt; Thaddeus Young
"The thing with the SuperTeams is that if you look at the rest of the roster, it's actually fairly easy to find depth and solid role players. Because once the SuperTeam is formed, guys who have a choice of either getting an extra $5M one year or going for a ring with fewer responsibilities, they choose the ring over a basement team with a bunch of rookies.   If you traded Caruso, Kuzma, and Shroedder for Lillard you'd have guys like DJ Augustin, George Hill, and Thaddeus Young showing up for minimum deals.   It's not really the tradeoff you're thinking anymore. There's just a TON of guys between 25-33 that are good enough to be Championship Level Role Players when the main attraction is something like LeBron-AD-Lillard."
The lack of Thaddeus Young votes (for 3rd place) is what shocked me
"&gt;Indiana gives up its second rounder to Brooklyn as a result of their loss to Washington. The pick had been acquired (but protected) in Marks first trade, the 2016 Draft Night deal that brought Caris LeVert to Brooklyn for Thaddeus Young. Under terms of the deal, if the Pacers fell out of the playoffs in any year from 2017 through 2022, the pick would convey to the Nets. The protection would have ended in 2023.  &gt;So, the Nets will now have their own first rounder, the 27th pick, as well as three seconds: the Pacers at No. 44, the Hawks at No. 49 and the Suns at No. 59. The latter two were acquired in salary dumps, Atlanta’s as part of the Allen Crabbe trade in June 2019 and Phoenix’s as part of the trade that brought Jared Dudley to Brooklyn in 2018."
"Magic, Bird, MJ, LBJ and the GOAT Thaddeus Young"
"We suck, but Thaddeus Young deserves a mention.  He came off our bench and was our best player a lot of the time.  Flirted with a triple double often while being one of our best defenders."
thaddeus young should win this year outright
&gt;. It seems Thaddeus Young lost his Basketball abilities via space jam ball touch absorption.  Just say u don't watch the bulls bro.
"I give you Thaddeus Young plus Thomas Satoranaky, Coby White and two picks if you throw in Brogdon"
"Lmfao Thaddeus Young?? He has been a great piece for us this season acting as a point foward. Im happy that Gafford is good and hutch, WCJ is mostly the same on the Magic tho. This post is so questionable"
"If Thaddeus Young hadn’t dribbled the ball off of his foot on a wide open fast break against the Spurs, the game where they came back from down 20, maybe the Bulls would be in the play in rn. Of course injuries played a role too."
"I imagine every team. The most roster turnover I've seen was from the Process 76ers and they still had Thaddeus Young &gt; MCW &gt; Joel Embiid, that I can think of off the top of my head."
The Thaddeus Young one is a hard cherry pick due to 1.4 steals requirement. There is no going around Jokic having one of the best box score seasons ever.

"I don’t think you’re making the point that you think you’re making. The sixers were mired in mediocrity for the entire time post-Iverson. They sucked for like 3/4 years, and are now perennially in the playoffs with young talent,  even after a squandered jimmy asset, an overpay for tobias, an overpay for horford, a trade up for fultz, + misses on Okafor and Nerlens and Zhaire.  the point of the process was always to be in contention. Their best players were Jrue and Thaddeus young when it started. Don’t have to be a juggernaut for the idea to be successful in practice."
People making jokes about Thaddeus Young but he’s actually a pretty good passer. Dude ran point centre a lot this past season.
Idk man… Thaddeus Young and Luka Samanic are both damn good playmakers
"I like Luka Samanic’s potential as a do it all 4 but at this point and time it’s clear Thaddeus Young is the better passer, and it’s not really close."
Thaddeus Young
I think it's fine as long as you don't make up the club to suit a particular player  Iirc the Thaddeus Young one was cherry picked to tenth of stats
Where the fuck is Thaddeus Young

New graphic of goats featuring Thaddeus Young/Wesley Johnson
"Idk abt Lebron, Kobe, or Jordan, but we all know that Thaddeus young is the goat according to espn"
"A decent comparison for him is Domantas Sabonis without the nifty passing or Thaddeus Young with worse defense.  Well he was not in my original post, so if you'll excuse me..."
"""Bad"" is probably the wrong word, but he has been an extreme disappointment. As a rookie he looked to have the potential to develop into a franchise centerpiece and instead he has stagnated completely, and he's now a 24 year old FA with an extremely limited skill set who wants to be paid and played like a star.  He struggles with a consistent variety of injuries and he's had 3 HCs in his 4 years, none of which has helped his development, but other young players have succeeded despite similar challenges.  He's basically a 7 ft shooting guard. He has no post game, he struggles scoring at the rim, he's a mediocre rebounder, he can't handle the ball in the half court, he's not a good facilitator or playmaker, he can't create his own shot, he gets pushed around by much smaller players which means that any supposed mismatch advantage is completely wasted...  Basically the things he's good at are:  - he's a career 37% shooter from deep  - good FT shooter  - ok but not *good* rebounder  He lost his starting role this season to 33 year old Thaddeus Young, but according to all reports he wants to sign with a team that will guarantee him a starting role and pay him upwards of $15m per year. He would be fine as a backup PF for like $5m a year, but it's clear that he doesn't see himself that way.  About 5 games a year he looks really good, then the rest of the time he just stands at the 3 point line for catch and shoot threes."
Tells you they’re at least as good as Thaddeus Young lol
With 5 you get Thaddeus Young
First player to play on NBA Final G1 on his birthday. That's some Thaddeus Young stat level bullshit.
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
Isn't that the role Thaddeus 'Thadgic Johnson' Young played this year

"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14.

"I mean other than the Harden trade (which is obviously a unique situation) Marks has never really ""fleeced"" anyone in a trade. I mean for the first few years of being a GM he was never really in position to anyway but overall, I think the majority of his trades have been mutually beneficial.  -Trading Thaddeus Young for the pick that became Caris LeVert. He traded a good starter with 3 years left on a very good value contract for a 20th overall pick. Far from a fleecing, if anything its him who got the low end of the bargain (you'd expect at least some random young guy on the roster who doesnt get many minutes to be thrown in for the sake of it but that didnt happen).  -Trading Bogdanovic for Nicholson+the pick that becomes Allen. Bogdanovic was an expiring so getting a 1st for him was great (even better that we got Allen out of it) but we still had to take on Nicholson's contract (dude was playing in China only a few months later with 3 years left on his contract) and its still only a late 1st for a very good starter. Looks worse with Bogdan not staying but they were still 1 game away from the ECF which is the farthest they'd been in nearly 40 years.   -DLo. Sure in hindsight getting DLo for the 27th pick+Lopez seems like a fleece but DLo's value was at his lowest then and the Nets had to take on probably the worst contract in the league to get him. And  we know with hindsight that the pick was used for Kuzma (who for all we clown him for, getting him at 27 is amazing value) and the cap space was used for LeBron.  -Carroll trade. Got a 1st (used on Musa who was traded for Brown) and 2nd (Kurucs who was a throw-in in the Harden trade) to take on Carroll's contract. Sure he was good for us once he got here but again, his value was at an all-time low when we got him and the picks were not great. The Raps got the cap space needed to finish off their championship roster so far from a fleece there.  -Crabbe. Traded Crabbe+2 1sts for Prince and the cap space needed to get KD+Kyrie.   Not really surprising Marks isnt getting the same treatment. Yea the poison pill contracts were pretty crazy but I think most teams acknowledge that they were an act of desperation to try and bring more talent in when he had limited resources and that screwing over the other team was the side effect not the original intention."
"I’m a pretty big fan of the prestigious 800 game, 13.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 1.4 Steals, 49% fg, 30% 3pt club which includes the all time greats, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Larry Bird, Thaddeus Young, and Magic Johnson"
The name could have been Thaddeus Young instead of PG and the random stat still would have been neat
"If Dame wants out do the blazers blow it up completely?  Maybe the Blazers want young assets?  Disclaimer I realize this isn’t the best offer the blazers could get, but its just the best i think the Bulls can offer so i’m throwing it out there.  Bulls can offer:  Patrick Williams Coby White Troy Brown Jr Tomas Satoransky Al Farouq Aminu Future first?  Why the blazers do it:  Patrick Williams is a promising young player, a lotto pick and the 2nd youngest in the nba before the draft.  Star potential.  Coby is another player with star potential who may have been held back by playing next to Lavine.  TBJ is a sweetner as a decent young prospect and the rest are salary fillers   Why the Bulls do it: Sucks to trade Williams, but you can’t acquire superstars without giving up something.  Dame is a top pg in this league and you hope putting him next to Lavine and Vucevic is enough to become contenders.  You cut 4 mill salary with this move too so you can attempt to keep Thaddeus Young as a valuable glue guy and maybe re-sign Theis to become your starting PF."
"Hey Portland I’ll give you 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 pick swaps, pick 38, 2025 and 2027 and 2029 firsts, Coby white, Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky, Al Farouq Aminu, rights to Marko saminovic, and anything else?"

Thaddeus Young
"It's really hard to create a good formula for rating a passer, but the two advanced models I've seen have Giannis as the 5th best passing PF in the league. He's behind Draymond, LeBron, Sabonis and Thaddeus Young.  There's really no advanced stats for passing I'm comfortable with - but I can't think of that many power forwards who pass better (other than the obvious above and maybe some players I've not watched that much of)."

I’m not big on Hunter either.  He’s like a bulked Thaddeus Young.
"Lavine is the reason we would want Simmons so he’s off the table.  Probably Thaddeus Young, Coby White, and then anyone else not named Zach, Vucevic, or Williams to make the salaries match.  If you guys really wanted we could try and make a sign and trade with Lauri work too.  Bulls take it to pair a 3rd star with Lavine and to address holes in playmaking and defense.  Its not the best haul for the 76ers, but Thad just had a career year and Coby is already an excellent scorer on a rookie deal. I don’t think thats enough to get it done, but thats the hypothetical."
"IDK if this works salary cap-wise, but i'd say Simmons for 2 of Satoransky/Thaddeus Young/Lauri/Coby White+ 2nd round pick(s)"
"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
"we ain't tanking. we just parted away with our three vets in rudy, demar, patty that sadly where damaging more than helping us, stats speak. with damaging i just mean they were kinda ballhoggin. we have added doug that would substite demar, luka samanic will substite rudy, tre jones will substite patty mills. all our young guys gained another year of improvements. we get derrick white back, arguably our best player and definitely our most complete and experienced one. we get guys like collins and landale that can be solid pickups. so we gain ton of shooting, easily our biggest problem last year. and this to exclude thaddeus youngn who i think we will deal before the season starts for picks and maybe a young guy. and we still have pop.  i mean, i doubt we will be much worse as everyone predicts. let's see."
He’s 32 and they gave him a massive three year contract *after* giving up Thaddeus Young and picks in a sign and trade.
"Bam Adebayo, Joe Ingles and Thaddeus Young all averaged more assists."
Thadgic “Thaddeus” “Thaddy Daddy” Young will lead San Antonio to the championship book it
&gt; You put someone like Paul George in that position and I’d say Lebron is a 5x Champion right now  &gt;People forget that 2016-2017 Cavs were actually performing far better than the year previously and Bron was on a war path in those years.   Is this the same Lebron who barely beat the PG/Jeff Teague/Lance Stephenson/Thaddeus Young/Myles Turner pacers in 2017?
yeah lol idk why you're downvoted. The post is unnecesarily arbitrary when he could have simply used TS. He did not need to go Thaddeus Young to show steph is the goat shooter.
I would not want to attach a pick for Thaddeus Young
"We really want Simmons or in my view thaddeus young. But ya we both know the pain of not being able to sign players due to the small market. Lauri is a much better player than Juancho statistically but he’s still not great.   Rosas is doing everything he can, it’s just that no one wants to be in the Minnesota cold ."
I'll play along because I too am bored.  Bold players are my starting 5.  **PG Stephen Curry (2009; All-Star)**  **SG James Harden (2009; All-Star)**  **SF Kawhi Leonard (2011; All-Star)**  **PF Kevin Durant (2007; All-Star)**  **C Nikola Jokic (2014; All-Star)**  PG Chris Paul (2005; All-Star)  SG Klay Thompson (2011; All-Star)  PF Anthony Davis (2012; All-Star)  C Joel Embiid (2014; All-Star)  PG/SG Jamal Murray (2016)  PG Ja Morant (2019)  SF Jeff Green (2007)  C Clint Capela (2014)  SG J.J.

Very close to Thaddeus Young and MJ Bron cutoff
All I’m gonna say is I used to think this of Thaddeus young if this question was asked to me in 2009
the Thaddeus Young stat
Damn Thaddeus Young really is our best player. We should have done this years ago.
Thaddeus Young
"The success they have had at 29 is immense.I kind of think they took the better approach.ie draft with upside.They have many players who can be 3rd or 4th options at best but really looking forward to the spurs season..perhaps dejounte can kick on and be all star calibre,and hope they start Dejounte,Walker,Vassell, Keldon and poeltl and get assests for White and Thad young...some contender will be willing to give them an frp and young player.Kind of feel they should have tried to get Markannen on s and t than get Thaddeus young who would have better suited to the bulls timeline anyway"
"Calling Zach Lavine a good but not great player is highly questionable.  Anybody who watched Zach Lavine play last year knows that he's a bonafide superstar now. He takes over games on a regular basis.  The dude averaged 27, 5, and 5 on 50% FG and 42% 3PT. The bulls second best player was Thaddeus Young for most of the season. Think about that. Lavine would have been in the MVP conversation if he was surrounded with better talent last season."
Freddie is easily worth more than thaddeus young but i agree him and brogdon are pretty much the same tier of guard. Although Brogdon was a sign and trade i’m pretty sure so one 1st isn’t actually his market value.
"Stupid Lauri. Had he accepted to go to Spurs, not only do we still have Thaddeus Young, but he would legit have put himself in a great place. Pop would have extracted the best out of him. And on a rebuilding young team he would have got plenty of opportunities.   Watch him end up going somewhere way worse and getting paid even lesser."
Their off-season is a lot like the Lakers off-season to me in that I like almost all their moves except for the biggest one they made which looks bad.   Thaddeus Young is the type and quality of player that impacts playoff series and they gave the Spurs a first round pick to take him so that they could overpay DeRozan.
"Who would like a Mr. Thaddeus Young (one of 5 players to average 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 49% FG, and 30% 3-PT FG over 800 games), for the low price of a measly 1st round pick?"
"&gt;Which is exactly why I said ""who got paid like Dennis wants to get paid.""   So why, exactly, did you list two shooting guards when we were talking about point guards?  Because you've no idea what you are talking about, like I said.  &gt;Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton are the ones you mentioned there that 1) actually played 20 years ago, 2) actually were stars. But guess what? Those aren't the guys Dennis Schroeder plays like.  Schroder is not asking to be paid like a star.  $20M, even $25M, is not presently star money.  Gary Harris and Danilo Gallinari are over $20M, as are a whole bunch of other players.  And yes, other than the fact that Schroder is quicker, those are two players similar to how Schroder played for the Lakers last year.  I did not say that Schroder was the caliber of those players.  Consider learning how to read.  Having a similar style is not the same as being as-good.  &gt;Jason Kidd percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('02): 14%   Gary Payton percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('96): 25%   Dennis Schroeder wants more than 20% of the cap.  Again, consider learning to read.  I never even discussed Schroder's salary, or his requests.  That said, in his 9th season, Kidd signed a massive contract with an average value of $17M per, which was around 30 to 40% of the cap each year.  &gt;If you're just saying ""old school point guards"" to mean someone who plays the traditional point guard role then just say that.  I did, and for the third time, consider a remedial reading comprehension class or discontinue wasting my time with your nonsense.  &gt;So let's go through it, let's take out receipts. Here are the Eastern Conference point guards who started the most games for their teams, and you tell me which one Dennis Schroeder is most like in terms of being a traditional point guard and we'll see if they're getting 5 year deals at an average of one fifth of the annual cap if they aren't high volume low efficiency guys:  Again, learn how to read.  I never said that Schroder's contract demand -- whatever it currently is -- is reasonable.  You are arguing red herrings that you completely invented, in order to cover for your embarrassing lack of knowledge and/or accuracy.  &gt;Also, get the fuck out of here with ""Don Buse"" and ""Mo Cheeks."" Sure, if we want to go back 50 years you can talk about ""old school point guards"" then, but that's not what you said.  Again, learn how to read.  If you cannot figure out what the words ""old school"" mean, look them up.  There are dictionaries online, you don't even have to buy one.  &gt;And if you just want to say ""well he would've been better if he played a long time ago!"" Well shit, Thaddeus Young would've dominated in the 50's and 60's!  Again, learn how to read.  And also, educate yourself on basketball history.  Thaddeus Young would not be an extraordinary player in those decades, and if you knew one-hundredth as much as you think you do, you'd know that, and I wouldn't have to tell you.  &gt;So where are these ""old school point guards... who handles and distributes the ball, and guards ferociously to stop the opponent from doing the same... typically didn't shoot much, nor particularly well... were usually small and exceedingly quick, and they were fairly common until around 20 years ago"" at all  For the final time, learn how to read.  Saying something was common until around 20 years ago does not necessarily mean that it was common exactly 20 years ago.  Do yourself a favor.  Delete your reddit account, and go back to grade school."
"Which is exactly why I said ""who got paid like Dennis wants to get paid."" Jason Kidd, and Gary Payton are the ones you mentioned there that 1) actually played 20 years ago, 2) actually were stars. But guess what? Those aren't the guys Dennis Schroeder plays like.   Schroeder is 8 years into his career.   In his first 8 years, Jason Kidd had made All-NBA First Team 4 times, All-Defense First Team 3 times, All-Defense Second Team once, 5 time all-star, rookie of the year, and was the motor behind a Finals appearances ('02) for the Nets and unquestionable franchise guy.   In Gary Payton's first 8 years, he made All-NBA First Team once, All-NBA Second Team three times, won defensive player of the year (96), made All-Defense First Team 5 times, 5 time all-star, and was the backbone of a team that went to the Finals ('96) and was the unquestionable franchise guy.   Jason Kidd percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('02): 14%  Gary Payton percentage of salary cap in year 8 ('96): 25%  Dennis Schroeder wants more than 20% of the cap.  &amp;nbsp;  If you're just saying ""old school point guards"" to mean someone who plays the traditional point guard role then just say that. You mentioned a specific timeframe when those types of players were exceedingly rare and not paid the way we're talking about.  &amp;nbsp;  So let's go through it, let's take out receipts. Here are the Eastern Conference point guards who started the most games for their teams, and you tell me which one Dennis Schroeder is most like in terms of being a traditional point guard and we'll see if they're getting 5 year deals at an average of one fifth of the annual cap if they aren't high volume low efficiency guys:  76ers - Allen Iverson  Heat - Tim Hardaway  Knicks - Charlie Ward  Magic - Darrell Armstrong  Celtics - Randy Brown  Nets - Stephon Marbury  Wizards - Rod Strickland  Bucks - Sam Cassell  Raptors - Mark Jackson  Hornets - Baron Davis  Pacers - Travis Best  Pistons - Chucky Atkins  Cavs - Andre Miller  What I see are either role-players guys starting on bad teams not making near one fifth of the cap, and high volume low efficiency shoot first guys on bad teams making lots of money, and a single ""old school"" point guard (Andre Miller) who - even in his top earning years - didn't make a fifth of the cap ($10.3M in 2009, Cap: $57.7M; let alone in 2001 when he was on his rookie deal of $1.8M and the cap was $42.5M).  &amp;nbsp;  Also, get the fuck out of here with ""Don Buse"" and ""Mo Cheeks."" Sure, if we want to go back 50 years you can talk about ""old school point guards"" then, but that's not what you said. And if you just want to say ""well he would've been better if he played a long time ago!"" Well shit, Thaddeus Young would've dominated in the 50's and 60's!  &amp;nbsp;  And I know this is minor, but there are exactly 2 years where Steve Francis isn't listed as a point guard on basketball reference, and it's when he was playing with another notorious chucker point guard in Stephon Marbury. And, if you'd actually watched them, you'd know they played point interchangeably depending on matchups and the whole thing was a shitshow.  &amp;nbsp;  So where are these ""old school point guards... who handles and distributes the ball, and guards ferociously to stop the opponent from doing the same... typically didn't shoot much, nor particularly well... were usually small and exceedingly quick, and they were **fairly common** until around 20 years ago"" at all, let alone one's getting paid 20% of a teams salary cap?   FOH."
"kinda glad the spurs didn't get this guy lmao. i'm fine with doug mcdermott and especially with Thaddeus Young, 1st, 2 2nds."
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
I had to look up who the hell this is and then i came across the person with this MAGINIFICENT NICKNAME. Goddamn thaddeus young.

"Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Thaddeus Young, 2022 Top 10 protected pick, 2024 swap, 2025 bulls pick"
Are we sure Thaddeus Young hadnt done this either? 🧐
what about thaddeus young huh?!
I won't get into the Kawhi deal but getting Thaddeus Young plus 3 picks for a guy you weren't even attempting to keep was incredible and you should be ecstatic.
"Thaddeus can only play so many minutes. When he's not on the court, we lose his defense  Now we are set so that we can have 1 solid defensive wing on the floor at all times.  Backup centers? You mean Theis? He's the only backup center worth talking about that we lost.  Essentially, your entire argument is that DeRozan is so bad defensively that it outweighs gaining 2 good wing defenders.  2020-2021 Season  DeRozan Defensive Win Shares (DWS): 1.5 | Defensive Rating: 115  Alex Caruso DWS: 2.1 | Defensive Rating: 106  Lonzo Ball DWS: 1.7 | Defensive Rating: 113  vs  Thaddeus Young DWS: 2.2 | Defensive Rating: 110  Daniel Theis DWS: 0.7 | Defensive Rating: 111  I'm not seeing it"
"It's silly for you to try and redirect the attention from your healing process to the Spurs roster moves, especially because it seems you're unaware of them.  The Spurs signed Jock Landsdale and re-signed Bryn Forbes, both good moves.  That's on top of getting some trade assets from the Bulls and adding Thaddeus Young and Doug McDermott, a quality shooter.  But you didn't ask to be informed, you tried to make a hurtful comment (yet again).  I see you and I acknowledge you are hurting.  Whoever hurt you can't hurt you anymore.  You are loved.  This is a safe place no matter how much you try and self-sabotage."
"Because only one of Caruso and ball are going to be on the floor. Lavine is still going to be playing most of the minutes and that limits how good the perimeter defense is going to be, especially with DeRozan at the 3.   Thaddeus Young was their only good forward defensively other than Patrick Williams, and DeRozan is an awful defender who's going to be playing a lot of minutes. They don't have Theis or Carter either, so Vuc is going to be asked for more defensively at center."
"And gave away Thaddeus young and are going to be starting DeRozan. Caruso and Lonzo aren't both going to play a bunch of minutes together, Lonzo is a good team defender and Caruso is an excellent point of attack defender, but there's a limit to how much you can do when Troy Brown and Patrick Williams are the only players on the roster bigger than guards who are decent defenders."
"You gave away Thaddeus Young, one of your best defensive players, to add DeRozan, who is immediately one of your worst defensive players."
Hey! That's an insult to *checks roster notes* to... thaddeus young?
"Thad Young, you probably know him as Thaddeus, but I call him Thad."
"Bulls also sent back players like Thaddeus Young. If they didn’t, they would have no room to sign Demar. So it had to be a sign and trade for the contract to work out. Thus, Bulls also had to add picks just to incentive SAS to take the deal."
"Fans seem to like to apply their 2k knowledge too much or something... bordering on “Those two don’t even have dynamic duo” type of shit lol.   These are great basketball players who will figure it out.   I’m already seeing Bulls fans going “the fit with lavine and Demar makes very little sense to me”. Like what? Explain to me how? Have you played basketball with them? Do you think they’re the same player because they have a few common attributes? Do you think that a big athletic combo guard is something that NBA teams are wary of having too much of?  I personally think ppl just love to criticize when their front office doesn’t do exactly what their little 2K GM hearts thought of. Obviously there are moves to be criticized, but when the Bulls’ last big free season acquisitions have been Dwayne Wade, Rajon Rondo, and Thaddeus Young, i don’t get how you can be less than thrilled with our recent additions (including Vuc)  Call me crazy but I’ll put my trust in people like Arturas Karnisovas. For whatever reason, I think he knows a lot more about basketball than me or any fan here."
One Obi Toppin for Thaddeus Young please
Why do people consistently disrespect Thaddeus Young?
Wild Thaddeus Young appeared
"I agree, a 40% 3 pt shooter is a good thing to have but there is also roster construction.   Thaddeus Young shot below 30% from 3 last year but he was still a better fit next to Vuc than Lauri.   Lauri is not a fit next to KP either. We will give up more points than the 40% 3 he brings to the team."
I’ll take one Thaddeus Young on the Trailblazers please and thank you.
Possible the Bulls want to trade Thaddeus Young to clear space for signing Lonzo? Always wanted Thaddeus on the Heat
"You forgot to mention the all important piece of this delightful 8th seed puzzle. Thaddeus ""LarrMichael JameSon"" Young."
If the bulls salary dump Thaddeus Young they’re insane
I'd take 1 Thaddeus Young please.
3 trades.  Lakers trade Schroder in each scenario.  Nuggets trade: Will Barton and PJ Rozier. Why- Nuggets get a sidekick pg to Murray.  Bulls trade: Thaddeus Young and Al Farouq Aminu. Why: Bring in a pg for that Bulls team.  Grizzlies trade: Eric Bledsoe and Jontay Porter. Why: provide Ja with another ball handler
"Are you seriously gonna argue with me using a perfect cutoff to when the Mavs beat the Heat for the championship? Lmao you are literally the Thaddeus Young stat meme.  First off, pacers are in the east. They didn’t have to face the Kobe Lakers every year, the Spurs, the Suns etc.   Are you really gonna argue who’s been the better franchise? It’s the Mavs man haha, they won the damn thing, along with having pretty good success overall"
"Thaddeus ""Daddeus"" Young"
Thaddeus Young and the Chicago Bulls would like to have a say on that.
"Chicago could trade for him. Patrick Williams, Coby White, Satoransky, Aminu, and 2 FRP works.  Not sure if it's a great idea, but Lavine, Beal, and Vucevic should theoretically give a good offense at the very least. Would be pretty thin roster wise, but would have Thaddeus Young, could re-sign Lauri, and work on bringing in some cheaper veterans to round out the roster."
Cherry picking is stupid when you're just trying to compare Thaddeus Young to LeBron and Bird. This shows he's done something no one's ever done before.
Thaddeus young
Cool but does he have a winning record against Thaddeus Young?
"Yeah no worries.      [This](https://twitter.com/BallySportsIN/status/969012390158262272?s=19) is the Thaddeus Young stat. A bizarre set of criteria that placed him in the company of 4 players that won a combined 15 MVPs.      As for the Stockton stats they talk about how far ahead he is all-time in assists and steals. Some key ones that come to mind.      - John Stockton has 7 of the 9 seasons all-time where a player recorded at least 1000 assists.   - John Stockton would be the all-time assist leader if you removed his 3 best assist seasons.  - John Stockton would be the all-time assist leader if he retired 6 seasons earlier than he did.   - No player has averaged over 12.0 assists per game since 1995, that player was Stockton who did it for the eight consecutive season."
I'm a big fan of the 1000 different stats that all relate to how unbreakable John Stockton's assists and steals records are.      As for a direct answer I've always found *that* Thaddeus Young stat to be a personal favourite because of the way it shows how easy it is to cherry pick stats to put a player in elite company
"If Davion makes it this is gonna be one of those “Jordan, Magic, Bird, LeBron, and Thaddeus Young” stats lol"
"Honestly with how messed up Simmons value is right now that would be a solid return no matter how much it may seem like selling low from Philly's perspective. If you look at the best player likely to be traded from Minnesota (Russell), San Antonio (Murray), Sacramento (hield), and Cleveland (sexton?) There's a good argument that van fleet is currently the best player and best fit on Philly. Chris is a unique talent . He may not be a high-end role player like Thaddeus Young, who they could get from the Spurs, but again he has a unique skill set and combined with Van fleet being likely the closest thing to an all-star they're going to get at this point I think it would be a solid trade. I think if San Antonio is going to trade DJ young Walker and a couple firsts that would be comparable but I'm still not so convinced the Spurs are truly committed to these trade rumors. If anything I think pop and co are hoping to jump in at the last second and try to get him for scraps. I honestly have no clue as to what the heck Cleveland would even offer and Minnesota is going to have a hard time coming up with solid value without giving up more than they should."
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
"Jrue Holiday, Bradley Beal, KD, Lebron, Clint Capela….    7 man Bench would be TJ Mcconel, KCP, Jae Crowder, Thaddeus Young, Nerlens Noel, Javale Mcgee and Seth Curry"
Thaddeus Young
"I associate multiple players with that stat line.  Jordan, Magic, Bird, lebron and of course Thaddeus Young.  Min 800 games though"
"Tbf except for the Lakers not any other team has strengthened significantly to make me them fear.   1)Warriors had a damn good All-star player level trade package of Wiseman/Wiggins/7th pick/14th pick(or any combination of those four) but thankfully they didnt take advantage of it and chose to develop. Also we dont know how good Klay is gonna be  2) Utah wont do damage as long as Gobert is there. Our center can actually exploit small ball and Bridges/Crowder are much more physical than their wings  3) Clippers, have Kawhi injuries issues and as good as PG13 and rest of them are they still need him come playoff time,   4)Nuggets. Similar to Clippers. Though if MPJ goes one more tier up then they can do damage. My dark horses for next season   5)Mavs. Have Jason Kidd as a coach. Next  6)Portland idk what to say given the Dame situation  I honestly think there is a WCF path still there easily and if we add some more size to help Ayton  vs that AD or Giannis matchup (could be through Jalen Smiths development or god willing a Thaddeus Young acquisition) we can also beat Lakers, we have the shooting to do it"
"I can understand that. You guys bringing in Simmons would of course be the first step towards building a team around him Edwards and Kat and other moves would of course happen over the next couple of years such as adding shooting specialists. Like you said I can't possibly imagine a trade happening unless they give something up of tangible worrh.   For Minnesota I don't see how a trade happens unless you include at least dlo and pics used to bring an additional value to send to Philly.(such as a first round pick used to entice a team like the Spurs to part with high end complimentary players such as Derek White / Thaddeus Young).   No matter how low his value is if Minnesota isn't at least willing to do something like that I'm sure there are half a dozen teams that can offer better role players staright up than you guys can if that becomes the high end of what they're willing to trade. I like what you guys are building out there and I'm really happy to see that it appears your management is turning the corner. I've always liked the Timberwolves and it's always been frustrating to me how many times your management has shot themselves in the foot And it would be exciting to see a good playoff quality team for the next decade plus for you guys.   I honestly think getting rid of dlo and picks for Simmons would be incredibly huge for you ( assuming you Philadelphia wants him in the first place) i think Edwards is going to be twice the guard that D'Angelo Russell is and can be, and will eventually become a nice to have, but not vital part of your team. As far as friends are concerned if your star player doesn't understand that he's part of a billion-dollar business and not a friend group then that's its own cup of tea. Chemistry is important but I like to believe that towns would be understanding if the front office comes to him with a vision on how they plan on putting him in position to eventually compete for a championship.  And shooting can always be added through the draft or free agency as needed. For the record I'm not a Simmons fan I just think you guys are one of the few teams where it's easy to imagine a very seamless fit without him having to improve his outside shooting.   Again I have no dog in this race I'm not a Simmons super fan. Just voicing my opinion in regards to the pros of you guys going all in for him."
Thaddeus Young wouldn’t get minutes on the Suns roster because Jae Crowder and Cam Johnson are on the roster? I highly doubt that lmfao
"all they traded was   Thaddeus Young - honestly a solid player but the salary works out and Aminu has a player option next year   Al-Farouq Aminu - bad, salary filler in the Vuc trade and again in this trade  future first - 2025 is the earliest but it has some layover protection  2022 2nd (Lakers) - picks in the 50-60 range can be bought  2025 2nd (Bulls) - picks in the 45-60 range can be bought  and they got DeRozan and a spurs second"
You know who would be really good and wouldn’t count as enough of a star to reduce the assets attached? Dejounte Murray. Him + Thaddeus Young for Ben is a good trade
"Phoenix Suns: pg chris paul sg devin booker sf mikal bridges pf crowder  c ayton  bench: payne, shamet, cam johnson, jalen smith, mcgee (if we trade for thaddeus young then insert him at pf)"
"No. Kawhi had killed his value at that point. Danny was not worth a pick, he was an aging replaceable 3 and D guy on a one year deal.   And the return was solid. Demar who had his best individual seasons as a spur. The pick that became keldon Johnson. Jakob Poeltl, one of the best defensive bigs in the league. And then Demar was traded for a 1st, some 2nds, and Thaddeus Young who could net a young player or a 1st rounder"
If you mean only specific to this matchup then can understand it but otherwise no way McGee starts over Ayton  &amp;#x200B;  And I dont think our bench sucks . Need a physical presence (praying its Thaddeus Young) but otherwise its good probably a top 5 bench unit in the NBA
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
I’m high on Trae Young so by process of elimination the most overrated Young player is Thaddeus Young.
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
They gained one good defender in Lonzo and lost Thaddeus Young who is a fantastic defender. They also got DeRozan who is one of the worst defensive SFs in the league
"Other than Lavine, maybe Coby White? Would hate to lose him but I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t trade him for an all star lol. Thaddeus Young is one of my favorite players in the league but he already got traded sadly.   The only answer is Lavine. Unless we got like Luka Doncic back I’d feel like crying lol."
Thaddeus Young was the best player in the DD sign and trade.
Thaddeus Young only has an all-rookie team
Thaddeus Young is still the GOAT of cherry picked stats though
Amazing how much Trae Young needs to beat Thaddeus Young
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I’m still acting as if he’s a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
[obligatory thaddeus young stat upload](https://imgur.com/gallery/45pfrzE)
"Ben Simmons needs to market himself as a playmaking PF. In that role, his shooting becomes less of an issue. He'd be like a more dynamic Thaddeus Young type player."
&gt;Thaddeus young  &gt;underrated   No
Thaddeus Young is so under appreciated. That guy has been more than solid his whole career.
Oh I really like Thaddeus Young for the Suns.
Thaddeus Young
"bruh, i wanted Lauri but daaamn, hell no. To get him the Bulls got a 1st so if we would basically swapped DeMar with Lauri. We instead got Thaddeus Young, who alone is much better, and a 1st, much more valuable asset, and Aminu, wr had to use our cap space. Also contract is kinda massive and most importantly long, not ideal imo. We also got McDermott who alone is better than Lauri, wanna be here and also said that being thr vet mentor in this young core is something he is looking forward to and will happily embrace. So I'm waaay satisfied we didn't get Lauri snd got what we got"
Thaddeus Young still available 😏
3. Jarred Vanderbilt   2. Thaddeus Young   1. Draymond Green
Magic Johnson   LeBron James   Thaddeus young
If current day Thaddeus young thought he was prime Andre iguodala
"I'm not convinced that their defensive success towards the end of the season was sustainable, and I'm not so sure they got better on paper— replacing Thaddeus Young with DeMar DeRozan is a pretty big defensive downgrade in my book, and having watched Lonzo in New Orleans, I don't think he's the defensive stopper that people seem to think he is. Alex Caruso is a great pickup coming off the bench, though."
"It was thaddeus young, now its probably patrick williams"
"The only players through their first 800 games to average 13.5 Points,5.9 rebounds,1.4 steals,49% fgs and 30% at 3's   are Larry Bird,Michael Jordan,Thaddeus Young,Magic and Lebron"
Only thaddeus young no one else
"RFA.  Either is going to stay with the Bulls on a 1-year deal and eventually get moved  OR  Sign the MLE with a team that wants him.   However of course he is wanting big money but there are no teams that can sign him for what he wants. The guy ruined his chances just like how Schroder ruined his.  At this rate he's best off going to a team that's going to give him PT. Spurs would be a good destination, especially since they are rebuilding and have a need for a PF with upside. I know they've got Zach Collins, but that guy is a walking injury just waiting to happen. Only appeared in 11 games in the Covid season, didn't play at all last year. Thaddeus Young might be on the move eventually and Samanic isn't exactly good enough for regular minutes."
Thaddeus Young
"Does the Wiggins-Love trade count?  I totally understand why Minnesota would do it, since they were going nowhere with Love and took on a hyped prospect. But Wiggins ended up not doing much, and fleeced the organization with a max contract.  Minnesota also received Thaddeus Young (from Philly), throw-in super bust Anthony Bennett and a trade exception."
Chicago should talk to the Spurs about getting Thaddeus Young for Coby White and DJJ.
Pop needs to give fantasy god Thaddeus Young minutes.
"Yeah, I like Keldon and Lonnie and Dejounte and Derrick, but let's be real, this is quite possibly the most boring team in the league. I have genuine admiration for the Spurs organization and don't disagree with the direction, but call a spade a spade. The most exciting thing they did this summer was acquire Thaddeus Young."
Why isn’t Thaddeus young playing
[That Thaddeus Young one is legendary](https://m.imgur.com/r/nba/kdJ6mMx)
Thaddeus young has more career points than AD. But I understand your elite argument against Aldridge
"Oh **NOW** the season has started for the Spurs. This team fucking sucks! How do you let a single fucking person beat you?! HOW!! Micahel Porter getting paid millions for 7 fucking points, Gordon immediately turned into Dwight 2.0 after leaving Orlando and there was no Juhmal.   Thaddeus young fucking sucks and I want to see how damn long people defend Bryn ""i can only do shit when I wear green,"" Forbes."
Bro I thought you meant Thaddeus Young at first lmao
Thaddeus Young
So... Thaddeus Young?
"I was downvoted to hell on the sixers sub for suggesting a trade with the Spurs for Murray, Thaddeus Young, 1st rd pick. Sixers fans think they deserve a perennial all star, a role players and multiple picks for Ben “cantshoot” Simmons."
Why did I read this and immediately think “damn Thaddeus Young getting the bag?”
Thaddeus Young: “finally a worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!”
Thaddeus Young would be proud.
I think every team could use a Thaddeus Young
Thaddeus Young. The dude was solid as a rock for 10+ years.
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
"[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  So basically overrated is Thaddeus Young and Dorian Finney Smith, while underrated is Giannis in this case"
"what pride has to do with it. going out there and try to do the best and win is simply the coach's job, whether you team is bad or a contender. we won't be very good this season, as you said, but pop literally doing his job and not tank, so intentionally lose, has nothing to do with pride.   also add the other comment over pop and our fo laughing at us for taking that offer because it was a ""win-now"" move when the offers on the table weren't much better and we do not even know what was behind. kawhi tanked his value like crazy and nobody offered much. we got a solid package considering the situation. you would come out with that brandon ingram and first package aren't you. yeah, it might have been better, maybe not. we got ourself jakob poeltl that is a top 3/5 defensive big man, we got gold medalist keldon johnson (pick given by the raptors, maybe the lakers one would have been the 30th instead of the 29th and maybe we couldn't have picked keldon) and he showed ton of potential, and we turned derozan into thaddeus young and 1 1st and 1 2nd and thad can maybe be traded for another 1st. might not be the best ,but it's definitely fine and not intended as ""win-now"" mode."
"A team with players like Derrick White, Murray, Poeltl, Thaddeus Young can't bottom out"
Thaddeus Young
Either Smith develops into what our GM thought to be or hopefully we can convince San Antonio to trade him and Saric for Thaddeus Young.  The theoretical fit of Stix helps us give an extra physical edge and probably even beat Bucks so hopefully he develops
Where does thaddeus young fit into the rotation? I think the sun's front court is solid right now
Suns team will be well rounded when they get Thaddeus Young.
Thaddeus Young
Thaddeus would dunk on Trae in an act of Young-on-Young violence.
Ben Simmons and Thaddeus Young
"Thaddeus young, he cant shoot well though"
Thaddeus Young?
"I didn’t say WE would be top 2 but yes our offense should jump to at least top 7 not just because we got Demar, Lonzo and Caruso but because they’re replacing Satoransky Coby White,Thaddeus Young as our primary ball handlers. You know it infuriating watching Coby White “run the offense” last year? Lonzo,Demar and Caruso are ridiculous upgrades over what we had last year. Zach had to try and create everything for us last year and he tried but it’s not his strong suit, having him play off ball will make him even more lethal offensively. Same with Vooch no point guard to actually utilize him so we were just running horrible pick and pops with him every possession."
"Jerami Grant or Thaddeus Young for the Suns. I think we’re pretty damn solid at every single position right now except for PF. Jae Crowder is good but we need a guy who can slide in at PF to start or backup and who can move up to C for small ball lineups and Jae’s not really that, nor is anyone else on our roster"
For us honestly think someone who can offer more physicality for short term like Thaddeus Young and im fine. We are betting on internal development
Thaddeus Young lmao
"overpaid Demar Derozan so he can pass up open 3 point shots for a contested midrange jumper, expected Lonzo Ball to be anything more than a 6th man type player, traded Thaddeus Young. Vuc and LaVine, while “good” by some measures, aren’t really anchor level stars that you can base a franchise around. So what the fuck are they doing? But I’m willing to wait and see. I just think the overall optimism surrounding this roster construction is a bit on the delusional side but I am sure people will run in with advanced stats to show why the individual players are good, but that would just be missing the point."
"That rule only applies to re-acquiring Thaddeus Young, they couldn't send him back to the Bulls but they can absolutely trade him again"
Reckon McGee would have helped us beat Bucks as we were getting massacred in the non-Ayton minutes in the finals so Bucks are beatable. Hopefully we add more physicality either through Jalen Smith development or Thaddeus Young trade
"Well y’all deep as hell 1-3 but a lot of those dudes are young and still learning. As a Bulls fan I think getting Thaddeus Young was pretty underrated because he is an High impact player when it comes to winning games. If y’all just lost Demar I would say y’all are still a a solid team but losing Rudy and Patty kind of hurt and outside of Poeltl and Thad no trustworthy big man depth. I think the Spurs can finish slightly worse than last year win percentage wise, probably around 32-37 games."
"Flex broke the cp3 trade and was first on the suns having interest in Thaddeus Young so he seems fairly reliable. Espo might have sources too, he was a former social media manager for the org and just joined a new site full of high profile suns media members."
"I mean, yes, but he must be traded before the beginning of the season. We have 17 Players. Aminu will most likely be cut and the next most expandable player that would guarantee the most future assets in a trade that do not align with our timeline is exactly Thaddeus Young."
average 27 ppg on 64% ts with Thaddeus Young as his team’s best playmaker
"Dragic, Wall, Thaddeus Young, Kemba, Gary Harris, Satoransky and Derrick Favors are probably the best candidates for the buyout market this year, guys that are pretty good veterans for a contender, but hard to trade with their contracts"
"I often talk about the ""Hall of Very Good."" The logo is Thaddeus Young with Jeff Green in the Top 10. But Aaron Gordon doesn't even make that team. Instead he is in the Hall of ""Oh Yea, he was in the NBA"""
"I get what you're saying and that you do make a good point. He's dominating the advanced stats for rookies akin to Jokic.   I just meant that he plays more like a Thaddeus Young with superior playmaking than Jokic. Plus, when Houston played Denver he looked tiny compared to Jokic. Maybe, he'll fill his body out but he's not that big."
"I think he played a lot off guys like Lowry/FVV/Norm/Siakam last year, mostly as a spot-up shooter and roller. Now with Lowry/Norm gone and Siakam still easing back from injury, he has to create more often and it's basically exposing his flaws as a player.  He wouldn't be a good option for the Wolves -- y'all would probably be better off with a high IQ vet like Thaddeus Young."
Reminds me of the Thaddeus Young graphic
"[This one here?](https://youtu.be/bShFbwcOia0)  Yeah, Thaddeus Young really swiped violently at Lebron's head. Can't believe he didn't get a full season suspension, let alone a single game."
2018 Cavs against Pacers. Thaddeus Young swiped at his head.
"Thaddeus Young is very likely to get traded, surprised he even made it past the offseason. While McDermott and Forbes can certainly be had for the right price, they will likely stay as they're the best shooters on the team and having shooters that can space the floor is still beneficial to developing young players. Can't just expect young guys to run out there and improve with no organized offense."
"I read this the other day   Spurs Receive: Russell Westbrook.    Lakers Receive: Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Thaddeus Young"
I miss him like everyone else but we need to stop talking about Thaddeus Young. We sound like an obsessed ex.
Someone post the Thaddeus Young pic
This reminds me of that one Thaddeus Young graphic
"They wouldn't be the best by any means, but you could build a solid team from former sixers. A lot of the process guys turned out to be damn good elsewhere.  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Butler  SF: RoCo  PF: Jerami Grant  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Richaun Holmes, Fultz, Dario, Nerlens Noel, Iguadala, T.J McConnell, Thaddeus Young"
You forgot Thaddeus Young.
They won't play a center rotation of Drew Eubanks and Thaddeus Young every night unfortunately.
Thaddeus Young of the 13.5/5.9/1.4/49FG%/30 3P% with a minimum of 800 games club?
"Spurs - Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, future 2nd pick  Suns - Thaddeus Young  To make it dumber, add in 2 firsts from the Suns because Thad Young was on a graphic with MJ and Bird once"

"Thaddeus Young. A really good 33-year-old role player should be helping a contender somewhere, not the 10th man in the rotation on the Spurs."
"if that trade package got traded for Thaddeus Young or Brandon Clarke the Bulls wouldn’t bat an eye, let alone friggin Myles Turner LMAO"
"Yeah. He has to know that, I mean the Spurs could trade him Thaddeus Young for JB.  It's a gotdang steal and Brad would be a fool to pass it up.  Thaddeus would help with defending, passing, rebounding and would make the Celtics younger"
Thaddeus Young. Dude has been a solid rotational player since 2007.
"After a slow start, this game stands out as being the best Thaddeus Young has looked yet. He had an excellent game."
Any damn half decent physical PF like Thaddeus Young
"we honestly """"""just"""""" need a superstar which we are aiming to get this draft by selecting high high. paolo banchero fits like a glove here. DJ, Jakob, Vassell, Keldon, Primo are staying here longg term (as for now) and would build a really solid team in the future, but, as I said, we need that superstar PF (casually the same position as Timmy). Then add Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV: we are still figuring out what to do with our SG position, wr have ton of guards. In any case, the ones that we do nog keep would provide us a good value in return. Same goes with Doug McDermott and in an immediate future Thaddeus Young."
Thaddeus Young is literally one of the GOATS
"yes, i would send tatum to san antonio for thaddeus young and bryn forbes"
they really need to do everything to get THADDEUS YOUNG 😎
Or Thaddeus Young last year
Man definitely not a net loss but this team literally has one Thaddeus Young-sized hole with the loss of Williams that I hope we can fill.
what about getting thaddeus young 🙃
"I'm familiar with that, happens with Giannis all the time. It's amazing how ""Giannis stoppers"" turn out to be mediocre defenders when he torches them.   Turner, Thaddeus Young, Aaron Gordon, Simmons, Ayton etc. have moved from the ""Giannis stopper"" group to the ""can't guard Giannis 1v1, needed hmore help"" group overnight.  People were saying Ayton is the best Giannis stopper before and during the finals. Then the narrative changed, they were saying the Suns didn't help Ayton by doubling Giannis and Giannis is lucky they let him score 50, bad coaching by Monty etc.  Fuck the haters. Dame was a BEAST vs the Nuggets, one of the best playoffs performances I've ever seen."
"In the promo pic, they seem to display the jersey number of the/one of the franchise players. Except Spurs. No hate against Thaddeus Young though."
Our third string big right now is Thaddeus young. Him&gt;. Boban &gt;. Dwight &gt; Kanter&gt; Kaminsky (maybe) &gt; dieng(when Atlanta is healthy) &gt;  paschall &gt; Thomas Bryant
"Probably one of those three centers might go to Chicago as they need anyone with an resemblance of a rim protection in an otherwise good roster  Anyways Im guessing for us Stix unless Monty rapidly starts trusting him, we need a physical PF to fill the Torrey Craig void, so Stix+ Saric or Stix+ a pick for Thaddeus Young?"
"nice point on jakob, i didn't even think about that. surely an ugly game by both teams but somehow we came off with a W in probably our worst game so far.  Thaddeus Young finally looked good. Sadly he didn't get enough time with us so he is struggling to fully integrate himself in the team. About Bryn he shot well. Hopefully wr can package them two for a contender in order to get a 1st (and a filler).  DJ is the man fr!"
"I thought Spurs were doomed with such limited minutes from Jakob Poeltl, who is one of our two most important guys. (Key facilitator of offense, criminally underrated on defense.)  Luckily we got some great minutes from Thaddeus Young, finally. He and NBA Champion  Bryn Forbes kept us in it heading into the third, putting DJ and the starters in good position to close it out late."
lmao. hopefully he helps us getting a first if packaged with thaddeus young
"My gawd, that’s Thaddeus Young music."
"&gt;60%+ FG percentage is heavily biased towards people that take shots in close, and field goal percentage leaders have a lot of not super impact players on it.  A shot near the rim is a tough shot to earn.  &gt;You know McHale did that once right? His next highest season average was 22.6 points per game and he also barely broke that 60% mark at 60.4% If you lower it to 24 points, or lower it to 59% then dozens of other players get in lmao.  That's just a bad point. Dozens of players have gotten close to 25 PPG on 60% shooting, Charles Barkley was ONE BASKET away, but he didn't. Think about how many player haven't achieved that.   &gt;Btw did you know only Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young have 800 games and averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals 49% FG and 30% 3P?  Why is this bad?"
"Giannis' career right now is better than McHale's lol  Why do you think the arbitrary numbers you set to make McHale stand out makes him seem better?  60%+ FG percentage is heavily biased towards people that take shots in close, and field goal percentage leaders have a lot of not super impact players on it.  Like is Deandre Jordan in the discussion for top 200 players all time?  He's the field goal % leader currently.   You know McHale did that once right?  His next highest season average was 22.6 points per game and he also barely broke that 60% mark at 60.4%  If you lower it to 24 points, or lower it to 59% then dozens of other players get in lmao.  Btw did you know only Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young have 800 games and averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 steals 49% FG and 30% 3P?  Lmfao"
