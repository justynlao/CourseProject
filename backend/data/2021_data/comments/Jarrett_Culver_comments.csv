A little late to post! But here it is for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (9-11) | [](/MIN)Timberwolves (5-14) ---|---   D. Garland | D. Russell  C. Sexton  |   Malik Beasley Isaac Okoro |    Josh Okogie T. Prince |  A. Edwards  Jarrett Allen |   Ed Davis  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (9-10) | [](/MIN)Timberwolves (4-14) ---|---   L. Nance  (OUT) |    K. Towns (OUT) M. Dellavedova (OUT) |    J. Culver  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |        A. Drummond  (OUT)|
"I remember the first time I saw Jarrett Culver play I commented something like ""wow this dude is slow as balls"" and just got thrashed.  He's still slow as balls"
"Miami drafts well, the Wolves do not.  Minnesota took Jarrett Culver, the Heat took Tyler Herro, for example  That is the main difference in a nutshell"
That team where he can be the primary option and shoot 20 times a game is called the Iowa Wolves .  No NBA team will let Jarrett culver have a green light lol
"Lol, basketball isn't anime.  Taj gibson grunting at Anthony edwards won't make him become a respectable shooter.  It won't make D'Angelo Russell not the slowest guard in the league, it won't make Jarrett Culver show any sort of offensive skillset"
"&gt; WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Jarrett Culver, Ricky Rubio, Mathisse Thybulle, ‘21 PHI 1st   Look at what Pelicans got for Jrue. Washington can get a similar package if they're patient enough"
I was hoping garland fell to the wolves last year but nope they’re stuck with Jarrett not elite @ shit Culver &amp; no pg of the future. Dlo &amp; Edwards are 2s
"Watching the Wolves play, you got Russell, Jarrett Culver, Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, and then literally WHO? for the other guys. Because of COVID, they should have Chuck play ""Who He Play For"" every week, but they'll use 5 guys who started at least one game in the past week."
Jarrett Culver and De'Andre Hunter are rivals. Hunter's Virginia Cavaliers bested Culver's Texas Tech Red Raiders in the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game.
"Anthony Edwards is not ready to contribute to winning basketball team, and Jarrett Culver just isn't that good to overcome his weaknesses. Kat got injured and COVID which gave DLo time to shine. Wolves fans finding out what DLo value is to the team."
"Who He Play For? is just general ignorance of the league, not aimed at any particular race or ethnic group.   Also, the best way to keep track of player movement is to play fantasy. Even if a Garrett Temple isn't good enough to be directly relevant in fantasy, he's indirectly relevant by being just good enough to steal minutes from guys who are. Examples: Jarrett Culver taking minutes from Anthony Edwards, Troy Brown taking minutes from Deni."
[Jarrett Culver flies for the slam !](https://streamable.com/p7nk0b)
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
reminds me of Robin Lopez acting like a bitch last season cause he got dunked on by Jarrett Culver  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=galaLjaUijk
hahaha low key contemplated putting him over Jarrett Culver
Jarrett culver and a second rounder
"It’s not project to franchise guy.   Projects are Patrick Williams, Jarrett Culver, etc.  This guy could’ve been the number one prospect barring injuries in his class."
"Jarrett Culver and Josh Okogie for Kyle Lowry, who says hell  no??"
"*laughs, then cries in Will Avery, Ndudi Ebi, Jonny Flynn, Derrick Williams, Kris Dunn, and Jarrett Culver*  The only legitimate success in player development this team has pulled off with its own drafted players is probably Rasho Nesterovic and that was with years of McHale teaching him post moves."
"Just checked, it's Jarrett Culver"
Jarrett Culver
I remember when he made Jarrett Culver look bad in the national championship game. Now Culver just does that on his own.
Jarrett Culver + Juancho Hernangomez + Filler for Aaron Gordon
"Yes, that's generally how the NBA works. Jarrett Culver was drafted by the Timberwolves and they traded for Malik Beasley and then a year later they drafted yet another guy at the same position and his minutes are down as a result. There are a very limited amount of spots available for all NBA roles and many more people working to get them."
"As a Wolves fan, i've seen plenty of players who on the surface seem like they have potential, but really don't have any skills that will translate once they refine them (Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Jarrett Culver, etc). Ant is not one of those players. He's doing almost everything all-star wings do, he just has to perfect his skillset. I see no reason why both LaMelo and Ant can't be high impact players that contribute to winning basketball."
"Same reason they didn’t draft Coby White, and took Jarrett Culver instead.  Same reason they took Ricky Rubio (who’s had a nice career) and Johnny Fucking Flynn before Steph Curry.   The front office is world class dumb, and they don’t know how to put a team together. Our only success as a franchise is tied to Flip Saunders and Kevin McHale (who was a HORRIBLE GM) taking a chance on a high school kid named Kevin Garnett when nobody else would."
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).
"Repeat from a similar post a few weeks back:  Kris Dunn over Hield and Jamal Murray hurts  Trading #19 (which was Kevin Huerter) for Adreien Payne and then taking Okogie at 20 (the back end of that draft was mediocre to be fair)  The Butler trade was a year too early and he clearly didn’t fit with Wiggins/KAT personality-wise  Some bad luck (missed out on Bam by two picks) compounded by bad decisions (taking Justin Patton with OG and Jarrett Allen on the board, drafting Culver with Rui and Cam Reddish available, could have stayed at 11 and had Herro/PJ Washington/Cam Johnson).  Missing out on two top-10 picks inside of 4 years will hurt any franchise. Add in poor player development and the “we’ve gotta make the playoffs!” mentality, and you’ve got a recipe for a disaster. The Wiggins trade was just another cherry on top"
"Gotta make a trade  I'll trade you Jarrett Culver (6th overall pick!), Okogie, and Jake Layman for Larry Nance Jr"
"Suns  2011: 13 markieff Morris  2012: 13 Kendall Marshall  2013: 5 Alex Len  2014: 14 tj warren, 18 James ennis   2015: 13 Devin booker  2016 4 dragon bender, 13 Georgia’s papagiannis  + 2nd round pick bogdon bogdanovic traded for 8 marquess chriss  2017 4 josh Jackson  2018: 1 Deandre ayton, 16 zhaire smith  2019: 6 Jarrett culver traded for saric + 11 cam johnson   2020: 10 Jalen smith"
Praise Jarrett Culver for “getting it out the mud” as the kids like to call it.
"Even worse, they traded Robert Covington for Jaden McDaniels and Ricky Rubio and traded Dario Saric to move up 5 slots in the draft to pick Jarrett Culver"
About the odds of a Jarrett Culver free throw going in
"We love him too. I have a super random question. How has Jarrett Culver been for you guys? I remember he was great in college, but haven't heard anything about him since he got drafted."
Definitely. Going into a proper organization is often the make or break point. If Jarrett Culver went to any other team besides Minny I think he'd be showing some promise.
"1. Injuries, this team played fully healthy in the first two games of the season but KAT's injury really derailed their season as a whole. We still don't know if the core of KAT, D'Lo, Edwards and Beasley is actually good because we have only seen them play for two games.  2. Coaching, Ryan Saunders probably made his gameplan around KAT and after he was injured he didn't have second plan. Hence D'Lo tried to carry this team but he failed miserably as only good teammate he had was Malik Beasley. (Anthony Edwards was pretty bad and inefficient.) He tried to implement a gameplan that obviously did not work, and he was fired after going 7-24. But in the great news, Chris Finch looks like he is a pretty great coach, at least after the ASB. The teams record is 6-10 after the All-Star Break and Edwards and KAT looks like completely different players. We knew what KAT was capable of but Edwards came in as a surprise as he is averaging 25 PPG with %54 TS after the all-star break.  3. While a trio of KAT, Edwards and D'Lo looks really good on the paper, basketball is a team sport at the end. Even if you score 60+ PPG as a trio every game, if your teammates are bad, you're not going to win the game. While they have great pieces like Jaden McDaniels, Malik Beasley and Naz Reid to an extent, other players are not helping. Jarrett Culver looks like he is a bust without confidence, Okogie is an offensive liability and Rubio, while his playmaking is still pretty good, he shoots %38 from the field. And the bad thing is I really don't know if they could fix this. We don't have a lot of trade pieces as our first round pick and second round picks were traded and I don't know if free agents would want to come to a team that is the worst team in the NBA.  4. KAT, Edwards and D'Lo are good, but their defense is really bad. To be fair, KAT and Edwards improved a little bit on that front, but they are still pretty bad. KAT improved his pick and roll defense and Ant gets a steal here and there but they just allowed 141 to an Indiana team that didn't have Sabonis, Turner or Brogdon. They are pretty [self-aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mmi27z/anthony_edwards_coach_cant_come_on_the_floor_he/) about their defensive problems and Edwards at least shows effort on that front but they still need to learn how to do team defense. We'll see if they will fix these problems in the off-season I guess."
Morally I have to say Malik Beasley.  However taking away off the court issues it's Jarrett Culver. The guy fucking sucks and seeing him on the court just reminds me we traded away a potential Tyler Herro or PJ Washington + Dario Saric for him
I see your Juancho Hernangomez and raise you one Jarrett Culver
James Jones got CP3 for Ricky Rubio and Kelly pines. Goat move.  He also got cam Johnson and saric for Jarrett culver.
"Id say its 75% scouting, 25% development.  The example i always use is to look at all the timberwolves busts they've draft.  Now name 1 who went on to do anything significant after leaving the Wolves?  And don't tell me Lavine.  Zach was putting up 18 ppg on the wolves in his third season before he tore his ACL  The wolves can't identify talent , thats their problem.  Look at Jarrett culver.  This guy was drafted 6th two years ago and he'll be lucky to be in the league 3 years from now"
"Culver will be tossed in the heap of busts we've picked who never amount to anything even on another team.  Derrick Williams, wes Johnson, Shabazz Muhammad, Kris Dunn , and now Jarrett culver"
"Jarrett Culver, dude has no mental strength."
"I think saying MKG was a bad pick is just hindsight bias. Firstly, MKG was drafted in 2012 before the breakout of curry and evolution of 3pt analytics impacting the game. His scouting report says:   ""A raw playmaker, MKG is arguably the most versatile player in the draft.  An elite athlete who can score in a variety of ways, he is also a lockdown defender. A 6'7"", 210-pound frame allows him to be an effective rebounder, especially on the offensive end.  He's still just scratching the surface of his potential and his biggest weakness, an inconsistent perimeter game, will be developed in time.  There is a strong chance he becomes a legitimate superstar in this league""  He also shot 75% on FTs in college which is better than #4 overall pick jarrett culver who was also expected to develop 3pt shooting in the NBA based on his FT%. MKG was a good pick and the hornets at the time needed a wing to pair with kemba/biyombo."
"When you consistently use those picks to draft bad players like Jarrett culver, a lot apparently"
"No. Timberwolves are the only team making it out of the west. A top 10 PG, a top 3 C, a top 5 SG, and some great athletic wings like Jarrett Culver. Timberwolves in 4 vs any team. Maybe the rockets have a chance though."
Has Nowell surpassed Jarrett Culver in the Twolves lineup even when Culver comes back from injury?
"Thats not true.  Its just that what they do is often stupid.  Passing on Lamelo, trading up and drafting Jarrett Culver when at least the next 7 guys taken after him are much better, taking Kris Dunn with Buddy Hield and Jamal Murray on the board.  Just a few examples  These are things are not bad luck, they're just decisions made by people who are not smart"
"I mean its pretty strong evidence that the horrible drafting is the main problem.  Draft Flynn and Rubio, Curry goes right after  Draft Wes Johnson, Demarcus Cousins goes right after  Draft Kris Dunn, Jamal Murray goes right after   Trade up and draft Jarrett Culver, the next 7 guys who go after him are easily better   When the Wolves hit on a pick, they nail it.  Kevin Love, Lavine, KAT.  All 3 players developed just fine on the Wolves.  But theres just waaayyy too many shitty picks mixed in between.  Like not even players who underachieve,  just straight up bad players with these high lottery picks.  And thats why they can't ever build around their all star talent  Would a guy like Greg popovich have gotten more out of , say, Derrick Williams than the wolves did? Sure, but youre still just putting lipstick on a pig"
"The wolves problem has far and away been in IDENTIFYING talent, not in failing to develop it.    Who left Minnesota and really blew up? Zach Lavine is probably the best example you can give, but he was putting up 18 ppg on great efficiency during the 2016/17 season (his third in the league) with MN before he tore his ACL and was traded for Jimmy Butler.    The problem with the Wolves is talent identification, they take players in the lottery who simply are not particularly good.  What did Derrick Williams do after his couple seasons in MN? What did Wes Johnson do? What about Johnny Flynn?  Rashad McCants? Shabazz Muhammad? Kris Dunn? And soon you'll be able to add Jarrett Culver to that list.    Ita stuff like passing on Lamelo that keeps the wolves franchise down, its really that simple"
I actually disagree. Dario Saric was not gonna re-sign in Minnesota. So I thought trading him to move up from 11 to 6 in the draft was a good move.  Now using that 6th pick to draft Jarrett Culver however...
"You're the first Wolves flair that's popped up when I'm sorted by 'best' so I'll ask you.    What the fuck is going on with Jarrett Culver? I loved him in college, loved him in 2K, but I haven't seen shit about him all season."
Jarrett Culver has had the same issues
"Sixers receive: Dame Lillard  Blazers receive: Anthony Edwards, Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, '23 MIN 1st, '23 PHI 1st, '28 PHI 1st  Timberwolves receive: Ben Simmons  Who says no?"
Jarrett Culver
you can have jarrett culver
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
With actual tweet formatting since tweets like these are brutal when they're post titles:  Jarrett Culver's final stat line for the 20-21 season  Games played: 34   Minutes played: 499   PPG: 5.3   RPG: 3.1   APG: 0.7   3P: 24.5%   2P: 48.7%   FT%: 60.4%   TS%: 47.6%    Culver was removed from the rotation post-All Star break and is now being shut down for the season w/ an ankle injury
Wolves trade Beasley + Jarrett Culver 🤔
"Not necessarily.  Josh Jackson is a bust and he's still in the league .  Marvin Bagley , Jarrett culver, etc.  Lots of guys"
"Unpopular opinion: Timberwolves are a dumpster fire of an organization and having another lottery pick in addition with their core (KAT - #1 Pick, Dlo - #2 Pick, Ant - #1 Pick, Jarrett Culver - #6 Pick) won’t change anything"
"Don't buy into that BS that the wolves can't develop players.  If Ants a star he'll be a star period  You think Jarrett culver has some hidden stardom in him? Kris Dunn? Okogie? Derrick Williams? Wes Johnson? Nah these guys suck plain and simple.    When the wolves hit on a player, they develop him.  Its just theres way more misses than hits"
"???   2018: 8th pick sexton. 6th pick; mo bamba. 9th pick; kevin knox   2019: 5th pick garland. 6th pick; jarrett culver. 8th pick; jaxson hayes   2020: 5th pick okoro. still early, but opi toppin was picked 8th who we were rumored to take.   like, i know the sentiment was like that before 2016, but we've had shit luck in the last three years and still managed to get quality players that have a floor of being productive starters in playoff teams. still have a lot to learn from Masai/Bobby who manage to strike gold with prospects at the end of the first/second round or undrafted though."
"&gt; If those picks are top 4-5 it won't matter  Lol a Wolves fan saying this. Wesley Johnson, Derick Williams, and Rubio were all top 5 picks. Not to mention y’all having Wiggins, a number 1 pick who sucked. Kriss Dun was top 5. Jarrett Culver was top 6. That’s just a smattering of the bad picks made overall by the league in the top 4-5 range (and of course Culver who was 6)."
"Teams shouldn’t be drafting for “story”. Mikal being from philly and his moms connection is irrelevant, if you think zhaire smith is going to be a better player then you’re right to make the trade. Mikal is as good as we could have hoped for and zhaire had a medical emergency that derailed his career, so it looks bad in hindsight. Teams take gambles like that all the time though. The Jarrett culver/cam Johnson Dario saric trade is worse but doesn’t get talked about at all."
Jarrett Culver
Jarrett Culver.. maybe it’s Minnesota’s fault though
For every Booker there is a Jarrett Culver.
"You're 100% right but minor amendment - we already had Saric at that point, he was part of the trade for our 2018 6th overall (became Jarrett Culver) that netted us him and pick 11 (became Cam Johnson)"
"This is a man who turned Jarrett Culver into Dario and Cam Johnson, found Cam Payne off the scrap heap, maybe probably the best mid level exception signing in Jae Crowder, the corpse of Trevor Ariza into Kelly Oubre, and upgraded Tyler Johnson to Ricky Rubio and then Ricky Rubio to Chris Paul. I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he did his best with TJ Warren. The revisionist history around him has hit as he was coming off a season where he missed the majority of it with a head injury."
Dayum.. And I thought the T-Wolves got the worst one in Jarrett Culver
"2019 who?  Zion, Barrett, and many others.  I thought THAT was the loaded class?  Only Ja Morant looks like a world beater.  Darius Garland, Jarrett Culver, Coby White, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  2017 doesn't look that bad but its not good either."
Will he give up 3 first rounders for Jarrett Culver please ?
"What about if he was in a starting 5 with Jarrett Culver, Keljin Blevins, Thon Maker, and Jahlil Okafor?"
"Wrong on:  * Anthony Edwards. I thought he was a really good prospect, but the shot making he showed in the second half of the season was really impressive and ahead of schedule IMO. * Sekou Doumbouya. He's still a very young prospect, but after two years he hasn't improved as much as I would have hoped. I thought he had super high potential coming out of the draft but so far he hasn't shown much.  * Grant Williams. I wasn't as high on him as some other draft people were, but I didn't expect to just be flat out terrible.  Right on:  * Jarrett Culver. Great college player but I never understood why he was such a high pick. He's an inefficient jump shooter and he's not athletic/explosive enough to be a great finisher. His offensive strengths (passing/ball handling) aren't very valuable unless his scoring is good enough to be an on-ball threat. By all accounts, he sounds like a great dude and hard worker so I do hope he proves me wrong in year three though. * James Wiseman. He looked really raw which I expected. I still think he has high potential moving forward, but I was not surprised that he was a net negative as a rookie. This one is a major TBD though because he could make huge leaps moving forward. * Desmond Bane. I'm a biased Grizzlies fan, but Bane has been really damn good this season. He's older so his potential is lower than most picks, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's someone who averages like 19/4/4 in his prime."
Jarrett Culver
"Man, I had such high hopes for Jarrett Culver."
&gt; early second round: Jarrett Culver  Still too early
"Its nice to not fuck up a pick.  We get things right every now and then,  but the misses are absolutely crippling and lead to this failing to build around the stars that we are known for (looking at you, wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Shabazz Muhammad, Kris Dunn, Jarrett culver).   Flynn gets a pass, he failed due to injury"
anyone want Jarrett Culver?
Look out for Jarrett Culver on Sunday night. Had to skim through their roster.
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
For a second I thought you meant Jarrett culver and Andrew Wiggins… than I realized this is Milwaukee not Minnesota…
"Woah, Jarrett Culver? That guy was the number six pick! Now imagine Marvin Bagley for SGA!"
Wolves fan coming in sheep's clothing.   Would you be interested in Jarrett Culver for SGA? He was great a few years ago in March Madness and still young. If he learns to shoot he has potential. What do you guys think?
What about Jarrett Culver for Ben
"Is there a three way trade to be had between the Wolves, Sixers, and Pacers where they all come out on top?  How's this for a three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcom Brogdon  * Malik Beasley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Pacers get:   * Ricky Rubio  * Tyrese Maxey  * Jarrett Culver  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts   Brogdon moves into the Sixers starting lineup as a hyper-efficient 20ppg point guard. Beasley gives microwave scoring off the bench, averaging 20ppg himself last season. Sixers offense gets superpowered by moving on from Simmons and giving up one of their three promising guard prospects to win now.   Timberwolves move their expensive backup guards, a bust that needs a change of scenery, and picks that probably won't be in the lottery for Ben Simmons, who slots right into their offense. DLo/Ant/Ben/McDaniels/KAT is sp00ky for real. Again on the picks - they don't need any more young prospects, so moving a few picks for better players, now, is a likely and sensible move.   Pacers move on from Brogdon to try to build for the future while continuing to make the playoffs, which is their MO. They get Rubio, who can start in Brogdon's slot. They get Maxey, a promising guard prospect. They get Culver, who's really just filler but is still only 22yo and could be a reclamation project. And they get two 1st round picks that, who knows, could still be pretty good picks, knowing the Wolves."

"They get Jarrett fucking Culver, what more could they want?"
"I don’t see it with Barnes. He reminds me of Jarrett Culver, which is not who you want to be compared to. I’m probably wrong, but I like Mobley a lot more."
"I remember everyone trashing the suns so hard for trading #6 (Jarrett Culver) for Dario and the pick that became cam (and calling cam a bust) 😭😭 so glad we pulled that trade, both have been great for us"
"Just a reminder that your actual, honest question is applicable to a 24-year-old in his sophomore year, who was traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves *with* Dario Šarić to the Phoenix Suns for Jarrett Culver.  We feel so fortunate to have this guy."
"I just want an all star week soccer game addition lol. Good bit of foreign nba guys played soccer til they got too tall, and others just generally played for fun growing up.   There’s videos of some players juggling and then there was that clip of a Twolves playing a game after practice where Jarrett culver was cutting up lol"
That doesn’t necessarily mean he’s part of the future tho. Don’t think many Wolves fans are clamoring about #6 overall pick Jarrett Culver as part of the future core. You’ve got got show you belong
LOL imagine if Phoenix ended up Jarrett Culver
Minnesota willing to offer Jarrett Culver 1:1 straight up. Philly pls call back.
"Some people were pretty vocal about Jarrett Culver not even necessarily being a lottery talent. I believe Nate Duncan and Danny Leroux were saying that during their draft preview/scouting report podcasts. They identified his strengths in college (shot creation, passing, perimeter defense) as not being likely to translate to the NBA, and his weaknesses (poor jump shooting, unspectacular athleticism and quickness) as being potentially debilitating in the NBA. So far that evaluation has been spot on, though Culver still could improve a ton."
"Yes  Because Minnesota went second star chasing in the draft  instead of acquiring legit nba talent because they thought  guys like Jarrett Culver and Kris Dunn would be the mystical second star. The one time they smartly made a move (Jimmy)  they won .     New Orleans  dicked around with AD ,acquired Boogie ,then we know what happened .They also think using draft picks on guys like Kira Lewis,NAW and whatever they draft this year is better than using those assets to acquire actual NBA players …which is why Zion is grumbling now apparently .  Dallas is trying to acquire talent , they just have bad timing with this years FA class    The clock is ticking in Memphis ."
Jarrett Culver's comparison was Andre Igoudala and Culver now is a certified bum (still love the kid and believe in him don't get me wrong)  Player comparisons mean jack shit is all I am trying to say.
Jarrett Culver. Any player with tons of tools but bad work ethic.
"Idk, probably one where you’re asking dame to carry Jarrett culver, okogie, juancho hernangomez, Naz Reid, to the finals with only KAT as the help and no first round picks left or roster flexibility… so, nah."
"Jarrett Culver.  I know, I know..."
D-Lo + Beasley + (Jarrett Culver and/or coupla 1sts?) get it done?
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
"On a slightly unrelated note, what is the general opinion on Jarrett Culver? I was excited for this kid."
Man we could have drafted Cam Johnson instead of Jarrett Culver
"Someone who can pass the ball and defend, but doesnt take away the offense from the others, like Ricky Rubio, or a lights out shooter like Malik Beasley. Maybe a young up and coming prospect like Jarrett Culver"
"They need some PG laeding the team, a solid, established court general, someone like maybe Ricky Rubio. They also need some surefire offense, which they heavily lacked outside of Embiid, so a good cheap lights out shooter, like Beasley would be really good.  And maybe a promising young aspect to carry on, like Jarrett Culver or Jaylen Nowell.   Huh, thats weird, they're all on the same team."
Cam reddish and Jarrett Culver
Jarrett Culver and an actual Culver’s restaurant
oh no we lost jarrett culver what are we gonna do
You can’t take Jarrett culver number like that!
Makes me mad that Jarrett culver didn’t stay in college. He had a lot more to learn.
2010 Wesley Johnson  2011 Derrick Williams  2012 Thomas Robinson  2013 Anthony Bennett (duh)  2014 Jabari Parker  2015 Jahlil Okafor  2016 Dragan Bender  2017 Markelle Fultz  2018 Marvin Bagley  2019 Jarrett Culver
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
G: Jonny Flynn G: Kris Dunn F: Wes Johnson F: Jarrett Culver C: Derrick Williams
I'd love to text this hypothesis and see Jokic play with Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver instead of Jamal Murray and Gary Harris
Was Jarrett Culver really that bad for the Twolves? I had high hopes for him coming in but I never watch their games
"Suns could have had  2016: Murray, Siakam or Sabonis  2017: Fox, Mitchell or Adebayo  2018 : Freaking Luka Doncic  2019 : Hachimura, Reddish, PJ Washington, Thybull anyone but Jarrett Culver...  2020 : Haliburton (his development alongside CP3 will remain a ""what if"")."
I know what they did… which is not much to improve the team. Traded for Bledsoe and then traded him away for Bev who they traded for Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez. Downgraded from JV to Adams
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
"Isaiah Thomas, Jarrett Culver, Dame’s cousin (I forget his name), Haslem, Alen Smailagic  Feel like that should do it. They win 1 game where IT &amp; Smiley get hot and they make a bunch of 3s vs an ice cold/tanking Magic squad"
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
"What's the deal with Jarrett Culver? Former lottery pick who was considered a mature, NBA-ready prospect coming out of college, still only 22 years old, but hasn't done a whole lot since being drafted. His shooting numbers across the board look poor; Can his shot be fixed? Is he just a defensive player at this level? Does he have any real value?"
I rather have a months supply of Culver's than Jarrett Culver
"For Jarrett Culver the shooting was not the only problem in Minnesota — career 28.8% from 3, 50.3% from the FT line.  Of the 231 players who took over 30 shots out of pick and roll last season, the 0.312 points per possession Culver generated ranked dead last in the NBA (231st)."
Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez
Can someone eli5 what the hell happened to Jarrett culver
Wait is Jarrett Culver this bad? I haven't heard anything from him in a while but being traded for pat bev must be pretty low.
"Jarrett Culver? That’s a great high risk - low reward gamble. The guy is a great ball handler and has strong ball iq and can bail out and run the offense as a secondary creator when teams dial up on Ja Morant. He’s also a great team defender and wing defender. I believe the Minnesota Timberwolves were a bad a situation for him. They had DeAngelo Russell, Malik Beasley, and ANT at the guard/forward spots. That’s also excluding Okogie. That team was very unbalanced and Culver was a casualty.   He also dealt with injuries and I think his jump shot will recover. He was a 70% ft shooter and shot at least 2 attempts/game in 3 pointers. He’s not trash guys. Trust me. He was in a bad situation in Minnesota. They had a very unbalanced lineup and was forced to play to his weaknesses."
Jarrett Culver is the worst Wolf in history. That includes Brandon Rush
"As a Texas Tech and huge Jarrett Culver fan, I am absolutely stoked about this. I had a bad feeling about him being in Minny from the start, and when it seemed like the expectation for him was to play more of an off ball guard I figured he would struggle. He's always played his best when he was the lead ball handler/play initiator on the floor, and he was never going to be that in Minny with Russell and now Edwards. I'm really hoping Memphis can help get him back on track, the dude works too hard to not be a serviceable player."
Lool the grizzlies really got jarrett culver
Lmao Jarrett Culver 😂
Clips won by getting a serviceable player. Memphis took an L by turning Valencuinas into Zaire Williams and Jarrett Culver. Definitely a regression for a team you thought was going to be competing this year
&gt;Jarrett Culver is 2 years removed from being the #6 pick and is now being dumped for Pat Bev. Another homerun draft pick by the Timberwolves.   It was a bad pick but come on we found Naz Reid in the undrafted bin and drafted Jaden in the late 1st round. Like Culver is the only decision you can point at that was bad.  Also Rosas was hoping to draft Garland but Cleveland gazumped us.
"Great trade for the Grizzlies, they dont need Beverley and turn him into Jarrett Culver (a former lottery pick), low risk high reward move"
Rip Jarrett Culver
Jarrett Culver is 2 years removed from being the #6 pick and is now being dumped for Pat Bev. Another homerun draft pick by the Timberwolves.
"Id try to force a trade to 6ers, essentially forcing the Blazers to rebuild, which means they wouldn't want Simmons, so a third team that really wants a defensive pf who won't take touches away from players will have to be involved in this completely hypothetical and unbiased trade. If I was the Blazers FO, I would get rid of McCollum obviously, but I would need draft picks and some young players who haven't hit their stride, someone like, idk, Jarrett Culver, maybe a shooter and an ok pf, like, Malik Beasley and Taurean Prince maybe? That's just what seems fair and unbiased to me."
Jarrett Culver 😤😤
"Everyone knows we're not going to the Finals, heck maybe not even the second round. Is everything just about winning the whole damn thing or tanking? If that's the case, the Sixers/Suns/Clippers/one of the Nets or Bucks should just pack it in. What's the point, right? Trade everything for draft picks, so we can draft the next Jarrett Culver (no offense Wolves fans). Also, don't forget about cap space flexibility™, that shits important. Go ask Miami how vital that is, oh wait-  These guys talk about the Bulls like we're getting DeMar and Vooch as the chosen ones to lead us to the promise land. Like our front office is that naïve. That's not the point of all of this. The idea is to raise the floor for Zach to flourish and re-sign, while we also try to compete until Pat Will develops into the player the front office aspires him to be a few years from now (maybe something between Siakam-Paul George level?), AS WELL AS being a destination for free agents. It's no coincidence Lonzo and DeMar chose us. The culture is changing. Players are keeping a close eye. If we're spicy next year, we should be in the running for superstars in the future (just a coincidence that Vooch's contract expires the same year as Jokic's. It's a great bet that if Jokic enters free agency, AK, the guy that brought him over to the NBA, will try his damndest to bring the Joker in      Why is it that when Miami does shit-- zero draft picks in the future, signs Jimmy Butler to a 4-year max contract (someone who freaking got outscored by Bryn Forbes in the Playoffs mind you), commit 90 million each to a 35-year old Kyle Lowry and one dimensional Duncan Robinson, as well as throwing out their MLE to a zero on offense PJ Tucker-- it's all good. Pat Riley is a genius. #HeatCulture. I don't hate the Heat or their moves, just sucks that there's a double standard      But when we do the same shit, experts hate it. Zach is only 26, Pat Will is only 19, Lonzo is only 23. We're still a young team. We just got guys to raise the floor for these guys to succeed, while also changing the infrastructure for future free agents who would want to come here"
Another player who has vastly underperformed. Maybe Bamba or Jarrett Culver?
Might we tempt you with Juancho Hernangomez and Jarrett Culver?
Jarrett Culver hits the door on the way in
"Timberwolves:  Jarred Vanderbilt is extremely replaceable and not worth $5 million a year.  Jarrett Culver should be ahead of Josh Okogie in the rotation because he has more upside on offense.  A team can never have enough offense, so signing Lauri Markkanen to a deal worth $15-$18 million a year isn't a terrible idea.  If we don't get a PF, Nathan Knight should start at C while KAT moves to PF.  Naz Reid is best suited for a bench role."
"We Finna flip him but the wolves have nothing we want, I’ll pass on Jarrett culver 🤮"
"This is great for MIN, that means no one else wants Lauri. Can we interest you in Taurean Prince, Jarrett Culver, and a 2nd round pick?"
feel like a naz reid + jarrett culver deal could be nice for lauri
Okay well we need to send you 11m. We can only do that by sending you Josh Okogie - whos a phenomenal on ball defender and a solid cutter as well as one of Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez. Juancho will shoot well but nothing else. Culver will defend well and probably wont do much else
"Can I offer you a Juancho and a Mr. Jarrett Culver and nothing more? Thank u, feel free to fax my secretary"
Incorrect.  2021: #7 traded for D'Lo  2020: #1 Anthony Edwards (got an issue with that? I didn't think so)  2019: #6 Jarrett Culver  2018: #20 Josh Okogie  2017: #7 traded for traded for Jimmy Butler)  So we have had a top ten pick four times in five years. One was used on Anthony Edwards and another two were traded for D'Lo and Jimmy Butler.   Get your facts straight.
"The Suns got eviscerated for trading the sixth pick for Saric to get Cam at 11. That sixth pick turned into Jarrett Culver so, yeah, I’d say the Suns did very well for themselves."
"&gt;He traded multiple picks to move up to # 6 to land Jarrett Culver, for better or worse (worse, seems like.)  We traded Šarić and 11 for #6. So how did we trade multiple picks? And Šarić clearly wasn't happy in Minnesota so we were happy to dump him.  From an asset standpoint it was a W it's just a shame Culver didn't work out."
Jarrett Culver
Allegedly the Wolves fell into that too. They traded up to get Darius Garland but the Cavs took him at 5 and they had to take Jarrett Culver.
objection worked for phx.  they traded the 6th pick (Jarrett Culver) to the Wolves for the 11th pick (Cam Johnson) + Dario Saric.
"That’s still not a great bet, if and only if they’re basing it off of a changed shooting form. The list of doctored forms, however smooth they appear to be in pre-draft process, is littered with bad NBA shooters.   I remember Jarrett Culver and MKG both were touted for their insane work ethic and drive, and how they’d both lock themselves in a gym to learn how to hit 3s. Still didn’t take.   Just playing devils advocate. For what it’s worth, I think it’s more likely that Barnes was higher all along on your FO’s board. Seems like a Masai pick built in a lab"
"This guy’s offense is terrible. Reminds me of a better defending, less of a playmaker Jarrett Culver. Suggs was a perfect fit. Don’t get it."
"Look I’m only going to say this one more time. Jarrett Culver future MIP and DPOY 1:1 for Ben Simmons. They are the same person, but JC is younger and has time to fix his offense. There’s no salvaging Ben.  Final offer take it or leave it"
Barnes reminds me of Jarrett Culver. He’s a huge risk.
Jarrett Culver and a first
Jarrett Culver has cone coupons?  I need to score a couple of those babies.
Have you seen him play since entering the NBA?   Jarrett Culver on paper as a prospect is a loooooot different from actual NBA player Jarrett Culver
"I'm sure he's a nice guy, but Ryan Saunders was so over his head while trying to be a head coach that it just ruined Jarrett Culver. I'm just glad they figured this out before he ruined Ant as well."
There were serious conversations two years ago about who'd end up as a better wing; DeAndre Hunter or Jarrett Culver.
There were serious conversations two years ago about who'd end up as a better wing; DeAndre Hunter or Jarrett Culver.
[Remember when Culver was supposedly better than Dario Saric and Cam Johnson combined?](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/21/nba-draft-trade-grades-jarrett-culver-suns-wolves)
"I mean, we have seen the Heat and now Nets construct rosters with no picks involved, and the Lakers constructed a championship roster with basically nobody homegrown. Milwaukee sold their farm and just won a title.  FRPs are great, but not every team needs them at every moment. Especially when you still need to actually draft a good player.   For example, trading the thirteenth pick and a slumping backup big for the sixth pick doesn’t sound bad. Then you realize we traded Dario Saric and Cam Johnson for Jarrett Culver and it looks much worse."
Forever the GOAT for the slick Rondo fake vs Jarrett Culver https://youtu.be/4U59VrXRKwA
"He is definitely not a bust. Averaging 18,5,3 as the number 2 guy on a playoff 40 win team at age 20 should already propel you past bust range. Literally no one in that class besides jarrett culver and maybe sekou doumboya should be considered busts"
Wtf happened to Jarrett Culver
"Any idea why Wolves fans were so high on Rosas?   His notable contributions in my mind are:  2019 - Drafts Jarrett Culver with #6 pick.  Culver is no longer on the roster.  2020 - Drafts Anthony Edwards with #1 pick.  Edwards is a good prospect and it's hard to criticize this that much, but I think most NBA people would put Lamelo #1 in a redraft.    2021 - Trades a lottery pick in the Russel/Wiggins trade, which to me is a trade the wolves badly lost.  Fires Saunders and replaces him with Chris Finch.  Wolves get a ton of criticism in the media from players and analysts for their shady hiring process.  I guess they were trending upward? but it's not like this dude has been dunking on the league."
Rosas wasn't _that_ good. Cam Johnson and Dario Saric for Jarrett Culver is indefensible
Rosas tenure highlights:  Signed Saunders to a multi-year deal (can’t pass up the opportunity to lock in the worst coach in the league)  Traded up to get Jarrett Culver (Timberwolves Legend)  Traded for D’lo who’s not really that good and makes max money
"This makes sense.   I really never understood Rosas moves. The team lacked a defensive identity and he brought in D’Angelo Russell, one of the worst defenders in the league. He missed on Jarrett Culver and just never really made the right moves."
"still think it's crazy how ben simmon's trade value went from james harden to tyus jones, jarrett culver and a couple srp's"
Jarrett Culver ~~asking for friend~~
Don't forget Twolves legend Jarrett Culver
He’s had the most abysmal supporting cast out of any star in the nba. Hard to win many games when you got Wiggins going 6/24 and your spot up shooters are josh okogie and Jarrett culver
Jarrett culver
"No chance he cracks rotation and we've got more guys than spots.  I'm just curious out of Kris Dunn and Jarrett Culver, do either or both of them stick around and figure things out with us."
"Man… I don’t know what to tell you if you expect him to lead a team starting guys like Jarrett Culver, Shabazz Napier, Jake Layman, Josh Okogie, Hernangomez, and a whole host of other players who shouldn’t even be in the league. Now he has Russell, Ant, and Beasley, but they haven’t gotten a chance to play a full season together. What KAT is working with, in the west, you can’t expect him to will them into the playoffs."
It's only been two years  Also at least he showed flashes of potential in a series and that's more than Jarrett Culver ever did lol
Saving this post and will look back 5 years later to see if any of these came true.   Personally I have to say Jarrett Culver. And for a looong shot Kevin Knox.. lol
Jarrett culver
"My love of basketball started when my brother bought me NBA 2k7 for my birthday 14 years ago.   My favourite player was KG so I naturally became a Wolves fan.   Since that day, aside from glimmer of hopes (the hype around Rubio, KG coming back, 2018 playoffs, DRose 50 point game) times have been dark.   -KG got traded to the Celtics  -Al Jefferson looked like a stud only for the Wolves to bring in KLove  -Johnny Flynn say no more  -Wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Jarrett Culver, Kris Dunn  -Flip Saunders passing away when things looked to be getting on track  -The Wiggins max deal   -So many coaches including the Thibs experience    The saving grace is that Towns is a monster. But I am concerned it will be an AD situation eventually."
"Jarrett Culver has one brother that is a world class high jumper, and another who scored 100 points in a college game. Also his dads name is Hiawatha"
Memphis isn’t getting nearly enough criticism for ruining a young playoff team instead of trying to get it better  They basically traded their most consistent player for a rookie and Jarrett culver
Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are a bit better than Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver I think
Jarrett Culver RJ Barrett Jimmy Butler
Wolves trading the 11th pick &amp; Saric for the 6th pick and selecting Jarrett Culver.  Not only did they get a worse player than essentially every player in the 11th pick range (the only one you can argue is Sekou) but they also gave up a decent rotationally player in Saric.  Wolves would've been better off sitting on the 11th pick and trading Saric for a 2nd rounder or some shit.  Edit: It's the biggest mistake during Rosas's tenure besides him being dumb enough to bone a coworker in public while married.
"I thought both Kris Dunn and Jarrett Culver were the guys that would fix our defense, and both are barely in the NBA anymore."
Now imagine a unified team without a 34 million dollar contract weighing down your ownership's luxury tax bill!  Like honestly Pat Beverly/Jarrett Culver would be an upgrade to this team over Ben literally sitting out doing nothing. It's fine the Sixers are unified but it's pinnacle copium to say that him just sitting is better for your team than a trade.
03-04  Sam Cassell-Chris Paul  Trenton Hassell-Jarrett Culver  Ervin Johnson - Justin Patton  Latrell Sprewell - RJ Barrett  Kevin Garnett - Giannis
"Jarrett Culver also has 1 year of TO on his contract, meaning he can be used in trades next offseason or declined to free up space. Kris Dunn is a UFA after this year no matter what."

"I hate the narrative that it's his fault the team is bad. What, he's supposed to carry treveon graham jeff teague andrew wiggins jarrett culver and josh okogie to the playoffs? In what universe? Its a team sport and when he finally gets a modicum of help he's ""carried"""
Jarrett Culver is likely to not get his option picked up
Or when Robin showed Jarrett Culver that he’s really not about that life.   https://youtu.be/galaLjaUijk
Am I way off here or is this kind of an important game for Jarrett Culver?
"If you make everything about keeping KAT here then yeah I guess it makes sense to settle for being a first round exit team with no future .  But you play to build championship contending teams, thats the whole point.  And for the Wolves it requires hitting on draft picks, theres no way around it.    When you do things like draft Jarrett Culver there is pretty much no amount of trickery you can pull to get around that if youre not the Lakers or someone like that"
"Right:   Ball Bros. When people were talking about LaMelo not even being picked in the draft, I was saying he could be a top 5 pick and would be an asset to any team.  Lonzo I wasn't necessarily exact about but I knew he would be a productive player. I thought his college shot would transfer and he'd be fine even with the unconventional jumper. Well it took a rework but he's become an elite shooter, mixed with everything else he does, he's only going to get better.  Wrong:  I thought Zion would be the next Greg Oden, shit I may still be right. Dominant when he's on the court but plagued by injuries and retired far earlier than he should. But so far it only seems like minor setbacks rather than career altering or ending injuries  Jarrett Culver: I thought his size and switchability would make him a valuable asset right from the start and the offense would come in time. Well he's almost out of the league so..."
"In the quote he was talking about his goals and how he believes he’s in the group of up and coming young players who are gonna be all stars. He mentioned guys who are obviously franchise players compared to him but he’s also a top 5 player in his draft class, it’s not that unreasonable for him to think he can be in that category. If he said ‘I’m better than these guys’ then obviously it deserves clowning but he specifically said he considers himself one of the up and coming young players in the league which is totally fair. He’s a lot closer to them than people in this thread are making out, which was my point. He’s not gonna say ‘yea I wanna be considered with Killian Hayes and Jarrett Culver’. Considering this dude compared it to a guy in the YMCA saying he could be on the Lakers, you can see how disrespectful the comments are."
"Right: Luka, Trae, MPJ, Zach Lavine  Wrong: Lonzo, Dennis Smith Jr, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Culver"
"I mean, Jarrett Culver will be out of the league if he doesn't show anything in a new franchise. The option will still be decline and he's buried beneath a lot of other wings but he does actually *need* to elevate his game"
Jarrett Culver told him it was possible
Jarrett Culver jack of no trades master of none
"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
Jarrett culver was afraid for his life lmao
"If you agree elaborate on your thoughts. What makes him worse than someone like Jarrett Culver, Dennis Smith Jr., or Elfrid Payton on offense? Be specific.   Alvin Robertson, Bruce Bowen, Andre Roberson, Tony Allen - all of these guys were TERRIBLE on offense, yet still played plenty of minutes because of their all league defense. You would think that the worst defensive team in the league could find a consistent spot in the rotation for an all league level defender, even if it was just 20 minutes a night.  I’m also still waiting for someone to actually SPEAK to his game. What does he do in particular on defense that makes him so good? What do you like about his on ball defense? His off ball defense? How does he handle switches? What does he do defensively in transition that stands out?   What in particular about his offense not only makes him bad, but the “worst offensive guard in the league”? It’s all fun and games until you ask people to actually provide descriptions of the players they want to make blanket statements about."
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough… seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I’d say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he’s already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"Cavs:  *2016: Kay Felder - Marcus Paige  We didn’t select Felder, but the Hawks traded him to us on draft night.  2017: No draft selections  2018: Collin Sexton - Kevin Knox  2019: Darius Garland - Jarrett Culver   2020: Isaac Okoro - Onyeka Okongwu  Yeah I’ll stick with what we drafted."
"Apparently Jarrett Culver, trade exceptions, and a 2026 2nd round swap when the dust settled."
"💀 worst player I’ve ever watched. Cannot believe we got Patrick Beverley who’s been a god send for us, for Jarrett culver. He gets no minutes in Memphis."
He attended Jarrett Culver's. Culver uploaded a pic of them on IG. So I assume he attends some of them.  https://www.instagram.com/p/ByLns-fAGKC/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet

I remember we traded him for Dario and the majestic sharpshooting posterizer that is Cameron Johnson.  Jarrett Culver started the Bubble Suns confirmed.
Jarrett culver and juancho hernangomez
for jarrett culver and juancho hernangomez😭😭  and then they traded juancho too lmfao
Juancho Hernangomez and jarrett culver
the most noteworthy thing that Memphis did was Jarrett Culver airballing twice in his 4 attempted shots
Jarrett Culver from 6th pick... to guy who only plays in extreme garbage time... ouch.
"Timberwolves 1st round draft picks since KAT: Kris Dunn, Josh Okogie, Justin Patton, Jarrett Culver (traded up), Ant, Bolmaro, McDaniels.   We also traded 1sts for Adreian Payne and DLo.   It's pretty obvious why this team is successful and it has nothing to do with KAT."
"KAT 100% could be/could have been the guy.  Here's what we've done with every 1st round pick we've had since KAT.   Kris Dunn, traded away for Adreian Payne, Josh Okogie, Justin Patton, traded up for Jarrett Culver, Ant, Bolmaro, McDaniels, and traded away with Wiggins for DLo.   I could accept trading KAT away at this point as a ""we blew it"" move since we failed to put a team around him and it may be too late now.  But it wouldn't be a ""KAT's not that guy"" trade, imo."
"Obviously Davis is the better player and the Lakers won a championship so no regrets in their part. But what would that team look like if they had just kept everyone and let them grow?  Ball at the one. Evolved his shot. Could take play making responsibilities when LeBron needs a breather. Randle a good 4 or small ball 5. Play Ingram at the 2. LeBron at the 3. Take any of DAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, or Jarrett Culver to round it out.   They probably don't win the championship in the bubble. But they might win it this year. Still have Curaso and Hart for depth. Fun thought exercise if not irrelevant."
"Sorry, he wants to come to Memphis and play with Ja again. We have agreed to send Jarrett Culver, some stale hot dog water, and a CD that Marc Gasol burned in 2004 titled ""Hot Jamzzzzz 2004"""
&gt;2019 (6th pick) Jarrett Culver: traded on draft night for Dario Saric.  Jarrett Culver was traded for Dario Saric and Cam Johnson. Massive win for the sun's on that one.
"He’s the exact kind of reclamation project the Grizzlies would take on (Jarrett Culver, Justice Winslow). The warriors and Spurs could be dark horses too. Spurs took a chance on Trey lyles and warriors revitalized Javalle McGee."
"Jarrett Culver, given a need to improve as a shooter his lack of athleticism was a big concern. Both were on point so far.  Jahlil Okafir another, it’s not that he can’t play, he just can’t hang athletically in the NBA.  #1 that comes to mind is Jimmer though."
