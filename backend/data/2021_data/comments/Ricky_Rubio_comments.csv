Jokic as 6'6 is just Ricky Rubio in my opinion.
"Other names include: George Hill, TJ McConnell, Elfrid Payton, Delon Wright, Ricky Rubio, Brad Wanamaker, Tyrese Halliburton and Alex Caruso"
"There's not really any top-tier true point guards anymore though. Steph would definitely be a combo guard 20 years ago, but what pass-first guys are there to compare him to? CP3 is probably the last bastion for a true franchise PG, and after him you have guys like Mike Conley and Ricky Rubio, who are very good players, but more specific role guys. Almost all the top point guards today except for CP3 would be considered combo guards. He's more the exception than the rule now."
"All but 3 of the games you have listed here came in series Russ lost. Putting any game from the OKC / Jazz series is a joke. In that same series, the Thunder got blown out because Russ took offense to Rubio getting hot the previous game and broke from the game plan to face guard Ricky fucking Rubio, a noted non-shooter. The Thunder got walloped that game in large part because Russ’ personal vengeance game plan opened up all sorts of passing lanes for Utah."
"But Jimmy can actually make contested mid-range shots, it's not like he's Ricky Rubio or Markelle Fultz. He's not a *great* shooter, but he's not incapable of scoring, he just picks his spots.   And my point was more in relation to what OP was saying by not getting the Butler hype, which is preposterous to me because the guy has:  - Been the best player on a team that made the Finals  - Made 5 All-Star teams  - Made 3 All-NBA teams  - Made 3 All-Defense teams  How many players in the league have that kind of resume? Bottom line is he's a winning basketball player, and every team he joins wins more when he joins, and loses more when he leaves."
He is just allergic to the line and his ballhandling is meh. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is point guard. If he hasn't been learning how to get involved offensively with them it isn't a good sign.
"If we're gonna run PG iso at the end of every quarter then get Ricky off the fucking floor. I'm losing my mind watching Rubio playing in iso, because he's so fucking bad at it."
"Wolves beat the Cavs again, 52-50 on a game winning half court shot by Ricky Rubio."

Ricky Rubio deserves better than this
Ricky Rubio...
"I’ll take one Ricky Rubio, please!"
I don’t think you were around in 08 if you think Ricky Rubio had no hype and was just another random Europrospect. Luka was better but Rubio had a *ton* of hype when was first coming up too
"I personally thought he was way too skinny but once I saw that he was no longer a skeleton, I thought his floor would be a taller Ricky Rubio. Idk what his ceiling is since I haven’t really watched Hornets games but just based on highlights/stats, I think it’s safe to say he’s gonna better than Rubio"
"If anyone knows anything about being terrible, it’s Ricky Rubio."
Ricky Rubio is out in the wilderness. Wonder if he'd fit
"You still have to quarantine (albeit I think it’s a shorter timeframe). Ricky Rubio got it before the bubble last year, got exposed by a teammate this year and had to sit out for like 5 days or something."
"a freshman in high school?  i mean theoretically, if they have the body and skills for it, why not. Not the exact comparison, but in EU, Ricky Rubio turned pro when he was 14.  if you mean college... then you have plenty of examples of guys coming straight out of HS and being able to play at a high level so I'm guessing you meant high school.."
"The points you are trying to make dont make sense. Being athletic is the #1 thing in the NBA. Milos is unathletic, so you are saying he is an NBA player but he doesnt have the most important NBA trait.  In conclusion what is an NBA player to you? Because milos is a good passer and makes flashy passes, that makes him an NBA player? lull is absolutely not an NBA player.  Ricky rubio is a player that is better suited for euroleague than the NBA, rudy fernandez is more of an NBA player.  Euroleague or NBA, its still basketball, good players are still good players.  Someone that is considered ""He is more of an NBA player"" is someone that has the culture of NBA and is athletic. AKA taking bad shots.   Luka didnt really take bad shots, at least not that much. If anything, Luka being 16 years old and playing for real, he had to do what coach wanted so he can earn playing time. If u wanna see an NBA player in euroleague you can check jimmer playing for PAO 2 years ago. The epitome of a player taking bad shots and make coaches angry  PS: I never talked about level of talent, im obviously talking about playstyle"
I’m starting to think the Nets are better when Harden doesn’t play like Ricky Rubio without the defense.
Is there where I come to finally say for 10+ years now whenever Ricky Rubio plays and I see him (casual out of market bulls fan) I can't help but think he cute AF. Like when did he get a sleeve? Does he have diamonds on his neck?
"+/- is not a good stat for measuring individual performance.  That said, here are the minus leaders:  1. D'Angelo Russell    /  -165 2. Cory Joseph         /  -117 3. Glenn Robinson III  /  -113 4. Darius Bazley       /  -111 5. Ricky Rubio         /  -102"
I have one slightly used Ricky Rubio.   Although it seems mean to send him back to Thibs. I don't think they get along very well.
"It sucks cuz, like, Ricky Rubio has a shitty jumper and he still managed to be a plus contributor on the Jazz or the Suns. Russ just isn't the type of guy to take that sort of ""step back"" I feel.  I suspect, when him coming off the bench is gonna turn into a real conversation, Russ might retire"

"Chase Down blocks is LeBron (Prince honorable mention)   Transition Defense is Danny Green (Draymond also good because of his IQ)   Cutting passing lanes and stealing the ball, very underrated Ricky Rubio as a defender (CP3 too)   And I can make a bet right now that Haliburton is gonna be also one of the best at it"
"It always blows my mind these conversations. You're 100% right.  Zion is 6'6 with 6'10 wingspan and crazy athleticism.  If Caruso, at 6'5 with 6'6 wingspan can defend James Harden. If Ricky Rubio at 6'3 without athleticism can defend prime Westbrook, I don't get why others (athletic as fuck blacks) can't be at least a bit better.  At the end of the day is work and will to ve better and /or giving a duck about defense.  That's why I don't like players with all the potential to be great on defense but are awful. Like Irving. Like not post defense Harden."
I've never seen somebody slander Ricky Rubio.  It is tough to say who is the most hated. This sub follows the media narrative and it seems to change at least once a week.
Yeah no good if he's putting up Ricky Rubio statlines after a supermax contract and that trade. It'll probably even out eventually but yeesh.
"it's not respectable to pass down open shots in favor of throwing it to reggie perry. Stop it. There is a point where passive crosses into stupid, and that is where Harden was tonight. This is not respectable. We didn't trade for him to play like a fat ricky rubio"
People have always overrated Ricky Rubio. He’s like the inverse of Westbrook when it comes to hot takes and how this sub talks about them
The Nets really traded Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert for a bigger bearded Ricky Rubio
Kyrie's looking like Cleveland Kyrie. James Hardens looking like Ricky Rubio
Harden is playing like a really overpaid Ricky Rubio.
"10 points, 8 assists, 6 boards, 2 steals is pretty much Ricky Rubio in his  first stint in Minnesota. Of course without the 4 blocks. The 10-6-8-2-4 is also something Kirilenko would put up consistently in his prime in Utah, maybe a few more points but a few less assists. It's an all-star player because of the defensive stats and ability to pass. If I choose 30 stats, give me a guy who gets 30 blocks a game with zeros elsewhere. Easily the best player in the NBA."
What was the point of trading for Harden - probably could have just traded a pick for Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio?
"Utah generates a ton of them, have for years. We just have Mike Conley and Bojan taking them now instead of Ricky Rubio and Jae Crowder (who I love both those guys, but not the best shooters)"
"Harden with 2 FGA at the half.   Imagine trading Levert, Allen, and 8 picks for basically a chonky Ricky Rubio. Turning one of the greatest iso scorers ever into a pass-first PG."
The catalyst was drafting Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn over Curry.
"His worth is 'good third guard you're happy to have on your team', you don't build an entire offense around Ricky Rubio or something"
Actually...Ricky Rubio tends to be the most overhyped player bc he’s European and there seems to be an emotional attachment to him by European fans. I’ve noticed this on multiple sites. Real GM is another one
"I can excuse nepotism, but I draw the line at Ricky Rubio being sad"
"I think a Bledsoe for Rubio swap would be huge for the Pels. He would make them better right away and help get the ball to the right guys in the right spots. I also think at this point, Lonzo's best-case ceiling is Ricky Rubio, so maybe it would help his career to learn directly from him. The problem is, Minny has no use for Bledsoe, so I don't know how you make that work."
I miss Ricky Rubio every single day
"&gt;have won 50 games  And gone to the finals 0 times and got bounced last year in embarrassing fashion. Their team doesn’t work in the playoffs   &gt;they absolutely fit together   Imagine thinking a point guard that can’t shoot fits with a center that likes to lost up. I’m sorry but if you truly can’t see how their fit is problematic you’re either ignorant or don’t know basketball.   &gt;Ben Simmons is the best player in the league at creating open threes   No he’s not.   &gt;and scored 11 straight points    You’re really struggling to understand the difference between playoffs and regular season. In the playoffs he isn’t creating shit. They sag off him and close off his passing lanes forcing him to shoot or drive into a wall. It’s why he spent their last meaningful playoff run sitting in the baseline without the ball in his hands. It’s like comparing Ricky Rubio in the regular season to the playoffs. He works great in the regular season but becomes a massive liability in a 7 game series   &gt;again you’re just parroting shitty first take lines   It’s seems you’re incapable of understanding the truth even when it hits you in the face 3-4 years in a row. When the sixers get bounced again I look forward to you reciting regular season stats and trying to convince people Simmons and embiid is a great fit despite them being unable to win    &gt;the sixers are favorite to win the East without harden   No they’re not. Bucks/nets are the better team, and the Celtics will likely bounce them as well easily enough. This sixers team will be lucky to take a second round team to 6"
"Weird that ricky rubio is still in the league, damn feels like he's been around forever"
[The one about his mom i think](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/ricky-rubio-phoenix-suns-nba-foundation)
"Exactly  When we had Ricky we were still trying to make the Favors/Gobert frontcourt happen  With all the added spacing now and the higher pace Ricky would be a crazy fit with this team. Imagine a 4 guard rotation of Conley, Mitchell, Clarkson and Rubio. You can run small ball with Clarkson or Mitchell at the 3 and Bojan/Royce/Ingles at the 4 and Gobert/Favors at the 5"
There’s a lot of players that get amped up to play the Lakers but it seems that Ricky Rubio always takes his game to another level. I’ve really come to respect him. Surprised he wasn’t targeted by more teams this offseason
ricky rubio seems like a great teammate i wish i was on his team
I love Ricky Rubio.
"That's 2019 FIBA World Champion Ricky Rubio, to you"
ricky rubio finals mvp
"Nah man, There’s plenty of good ones now, people just use numbers and last names more, these are ones off the top of my head  Spida - Donovan Mitchell  Patient Zero, Stifle Tower, French Connection - Rudy Gobert  Minivan - Georges Niang  Juan Stockton/Spanish Samurai - Ricky Rubio  The Greek Freak  Durantula/Slim Reaper  The Brow  The Beard    Those are pretty cool"
"This is your conversation  Guy: wow ricky rubio spoke out, thats rare  You: who gives a shit he's a journeyman  Guy: what? im saying its rare for rubio to get upset  You: these other journeymen don't talk  Guy: that wasn't my point and rubio is better than those guys anyway  You: rubio's not *important* though  Guy: I didn't even say he was.. but yeah he is, here's why  You: well, rubio's not important in the NBA   Literally you're having your own conversation, and moving the goal posts each time. Its honestly rather fascinating"
This might be a hot take but I sincerely think a lot of Mitchell's early breakout and player development is attributable to Ricky Rubio's on-court leadership and PG abilities.   Mitchell always looked the best with Rubio instead of when he tries to play hero ball like he does in the playoffs
Those players also were never as a big of a deal as Ricky Rubio.
Nah Andre Johnson is a top two player in Texans history it’s a bit different than Ricky Rubio saying something
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Ricky Rubio involve himself in any kind of drama
Your better than us and the sixers. We have a weak bench and no one to stop the giants of the East. Sixers have tall Ricky Rubio with defense. You have a top 5 player and a good supporting cast. Keep your head up high.
"A deal involving Ricky Rubio could be good for both teams. NO needs playmaking, and MI could use his defense, which I think is Lonzos strong point. Having seen Ricky help Don, I think he's the perfect PG to help young players like Ingram and Zion thrive."
"It's almost like Utah's system isn't built for guys to rack up solitary stats in things.  Ricky Rubio is a career 8-9 assist a game guy, in Utah his average was short of 6. Did Ricky just suck in Utah? Not at all, but Snyder's system isn't one where a guy is going to tally a ton of assists. In fact, Gordon Hayward's last season with Utah the team single game high for assists was 8.  I wouldn't look at Donovan not having a bunch of 10 assist games as a thing to knock him on."
Jazz's offense just doesn't stockpile assists all with one player though... everybody gets a slice of the assist pie. It's just the offense  Same reason Ricky Rubio never put up eyepopping assist numbers with the Jazz
"when ricky rubio averaged barely 6 assists for us, you know we just play a different system. horrible analysis from TNT"
Ricky Rubio
"Look at Ricky Rubio. That looks like Lonzo's ceiling. That's fine, but not enough to make you a starting point guard in a championship caliber team, honestly."
I think we are better without Ricky Jmac played pretty good lmao Rubio hasn’t been too good lately
My original prediction of him being another Ricky Rubio might have been giving him too much credit in retrospect
"Basically a spread out pick and roll scheme with 4 playmakers and Gobert setting screens or diving towards the rim. They pass the ball around the perimeter several times. No single player ever gets too many assists, it is typically balanced out to 4-7 assists from several different players. For example when Ricky Rubio played for the Jazz his assist numbers were well below his career average just because of the system"
"I’m pretty happy with both teams. The Yankees provided more entertainment than any team employing Ricky Rubio has over the past decade, and the Knicks are headed in the right direction  Guess you’ve lost the argument and need to insult me. I’m a Jets fan too. Make  a Jets joke"
Chris Rondo  Rajon Paul  Carmelo Rubio  Ricky Anthony  Michael Benett  Anthony Jordan  Rudy Mann  Terrence Gay  For NBA Team: #1 and #30  Los Angeles Pistons  Detroit Lakers
"He's a good defender and playmaker, that's about it  He's basically Ricky Rubio before he developed a decent shot. Which is a fine player, but it definitely caps his ceiling"
*Ricky Rubio has quit on the wolves to join the chat*
"This is what I'd do:  **Minnesota Receive**: Ben Simmons  **76ers Receive**: Bradley Beal  **Wizards Receive**: Minnesota FRP (unprotected?) 2022/2024/2026 + pick swaps 2023/2025/2027, Anthony Edwards, Jarret Culver  Matisse Thybulle (PHI), Philly 2022 FRP (Top 15 protected, if not conveyed then 2 SRP)  Hawks FRP (Protected Top 20, 2022-2025, if not conveyed then SRP 2025/2026 conveyed), Tony Snell  **Hawks Receive**: Ricky Rubio  You could sub out the Hawks for a different team that you think could use Rubio more (maybe Blazers/Heat/Pacers/Bucks)."
"&gt; WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Jarrett Culver, Ricky Rubio, Mathisse Thybulle, ‘21 PHI 1st   Look at what Pelicans got for Jrue. Washington can get a similar package if they're patient enough"
"Yeah his back ups are/were Ricky Rubio, Jordan McLaughlin, Ky Bowman, Jordan Poole and Alec Burks and dspite that the offenses were better with those guys on the floor and Dlo on the bench, surely a sad coincidence"
"Dude is trash, trade him to the Timberwolves for stars Anthony Edwards and Ricky Rubio and a cool 2028 first round pick. Got to get overpaid Booker on a shitty franchise like Minnesota to also free Anthony Edwards and Rubio"
Ricky Rubio had a 5 year stretch where he basically turned into peak Nash against us.
ricky rubio against the thunder
I would rather have Ricky Rubio. More reliable I feel.  Minnesota has already Dlo and they are playing Rubio off-ball. Cheap trade.
"Yes, and Curry is basically Ricky Rubio with slightly better shooting.  Durant is basically Caboclo but slightly taller.  Lebron is basically Paul Milsap but slightly stronger"
"I mean you could do this for every team right. Here I'll do it for the T-Wolves:  Malik Beasley has been good for them averaging over 20 points a game, Anthony Edwards looks like he's going to be a star, Ricky Rubio is good enough to contribute for a contender, and their own pick could fall top-3 this year and they could get Cade Cunningham. D'Angelo Russell has had a rough start but once he gets going he's gonna be scary. KAT's mom passed away through COVID and he's going through a lot rn as well, and he's missed a few games through a hand injury, but there's a great chance he could get to all-NBA level play soon enough and Wolves could go on a winning streak.  But nobody gives Wolves or any other team extra context for no reason. So I'm not sure why you feel Warriors need so much extra context."
"hes not as good of a playmaker as you think, and no playmaker is valuable without a shot  ask ricky rubio  his only thing was defense and hes not been good at that either"
"Sorta, him and DLo clash as they both need the ball to shine, Rubio especially.   On top of this, generally speaking if Rubio plays with starters he'll likely look better as he'll get more assists with shots falling. He can help facilitate the bench but if he gives a good feed and the other player misses than it won't help Ricky on the stat sheet.  I'd like to think it's more on the playbook but can't say for sure."
I just don’t see how he’s not just Ricky Rubio with no defense
Glorified Ricky Rubio.
because people still have hope for shitty ricky rubio
Okay Ricky Rubio Stan I don’t ever want to hear you chat about Rubio but realistically I know LeVert would never be an all star lmao he’s streaky and not very efficient he can drop 50 and look like All Nba for a couple games then be an average role player but he has a cool name and I liked him
Ricky Rubio is proof that floor generals who can't actually score are liabilities
Ricky Rubio says hi.
"I tend to think that any starting point guard that can't shoot would be better in the 70s-90s. Westbrook, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Ricky Rubio, etc. Westbrook would probably get the kind of criticisms that Jordan got in the 80s for trying to score much too much by himself. If Ben played in the 80s he'd be right there with Magic and Bird in discussions and popularity."

"This is r/nba.  They are still waiting for the Ricky Rubio breakout season but Lamelo is a 1 game bust, lol."
"Ricky Rubio is kind of a vet now, but they do need like a vocal type of guy."
Ricky Rubio was suppose to be a future hall of famer. He was a child prodigy and just never developed passed being a solid starter
"I understand them going for Rubio, especially with his reputation at the time, but why they didn't draft Curry to go along with him is something that I still can't understand. Ricky could have run the offense with Curry playing off ball (as he did during his first two years at Davidson) and on defense, Rubio had the size and strength to defend shooting guards while Steph would get put on the PGs. A bit unorthodox, but a pretty good combination."
"Yes this is real. The starters of GSW, a part from Curry, can provide zero shooting and only Green can create some good offense and play D, the other (Wiggins, Oubre and Wiseman) have all low basketball IQ, put low effort on defense (have only few good possessions) and can't buy a three.  And good lord how shitty looks Oubre in GSW, the front office made another terrible mistake to trade for him! I would have rather preferred Ricky Rubio if i had to take someone from the aftermath of the CP3 trade..."
"were they not satisfied with jonny ""hip surgery"" flynn and ricky rubio?"
What can he get back though realistically because there isn’t a pick to attach to him to trade with. You’ll likely just be getting a similar level creator probably just a lateral move then. Ricky Rubio is the guy that would work well here but minn doesn’t need Kennard.   Lou Williams for george hill might be another option that would help in the playoffs maybe
"&gt;That being said, I hate how the Timberwolves offense is fucking STUPID for embracing too much of a trigger happy mindset (Ricky rubio, culver, AND naz reid ALL HAVE GREEN LIGHTS TO CHUCK 3'S?? SERIOUSLY?).  5 of our top 10 minutes getters shoot under 40% from the field.   3 of the 5 who don't have missed significant time.  Somebody on this team has to take shots to end possessions, and it's usually not going to be a good scorer."
"Even before he was drafted, the big question was: ""He's fast enough, strong enough, and twitchy enough to get any bucket he wants at will, but will that translate to recklessness or endless buckets?  That being said, I hate how the Timberwolves offense is fucking STUPID for embracing too much of a trigger happy mindset (Ricky rubio, culver, AND naz reid ALL HAVE GREEN LIGHTS TO CHUCK 3'S?? SERIOUSLY?). In turn, Ant has spent too many games taking 3's and buying into an outside-inside approach. It's obvious from his baptism of yuta watanabe that his biggest strength has always been his quick twitch, ultra attacking versatile playstyle, but it sucks that he's been kind of slow to embrace  an inside to outside approach.  Im a Laker fan tho, so I dont watch too many Timberwolves games so I hesitantly argue that I think the more 3's he trades in for drives to the rim, the better ALL his percentages will be."
"I greatly favor a more marginal move with the TPE now, even trying to bring in a couple of bodies on smaller contracts is better than giving up a ton to get Barnes.  Bjelica would help a lot as a big that can stretch the floor and give the Celtics something they don't have &amp; should be less expensive considering his deal is expiring this year.  I'd also like to see the Celtics go out &amp; get someone like Ricky Rubio, who has been bad this year but maybe needs a change of scenery more than anything, gives them playmaking &amp; defense and would be a $17M expiring next year that could be used in another trade down the line.  It's much easier for me to see a world where you can get both Bjelica and Rubio without giving up a 1st, that helps the Celtics this year and preserves a good deal of future flexibility.  Mostly I favor sitting tight and seeing what develops this offseason."
"Multiple times this season he's blankly said things to the effect of ""this franchise is heading in the wrong direction."" It sucks for the fans because I did follow the Wolves for a few years, and they're really passionate. They want their ownership and management decisions to reflect a desire to win, and Glen Taylor couldn't care less.  edit: found his most recent comments: [“I don’t feel like this is building something""](https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/basketball/6911534-Frustrated-Ricky-Rubio-says-Timberwolves-%E2%80%98playing-the-wrong-way%E2%80%99)"

Him and Ricky Rubio
"Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Raul Neto, Harden"
Curry been broken since patch 20.09 came with the ankle buffs and the nerfs to meta heroes like Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio.
Just let him have this one.   When you see ‘centre’ or ‘defence’ you know you bout to see some wild shit about how JV is secretly Jokic or Ricky Rubio should be an all-star.
"&gt; Kawhi 7ppg &gt;  &gt; Kobe 7.6 ppg &gt;  &gt; Nash 3ppg &gt;  &gt; Butler 2.6 ppg &gt;  &gt; DeRozan 8.6 ppg  You called me low IQ and then you just start throwing comparisons around that hold no weight.  Keep thinking that Ant getting 30 mins a game and chucking up shots is the same as those guys, **WHO WERE NOT NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICKS,** and getting a proper treatment and being brought along the right way with limited minutes and shots.   I haven't even spoken of the fact that he doesn't look like he knows how to play basketball. How many years of coaching do you think it'll take before he realizes barreling down the lane with 3 guys won't work? Or establish a post game and not just toss it out to Ricky Rubio when you have the mismatch inside? That's fucking middle school stuff, ffs.   I guess you're also ignoring the  fact that he said he'd rather be an NFL player and has released a mixtape while in the league! Seems just as focused as those guys!!!!  Once again, big red panic button but you're far gone on the copium."
"It wasn't really a jab at Kemba's ability, moreso his fit. Ricky Rubio was a free agent the same off-season. I think he would have fit better with the current team, and would have been cheaper to boot (although he did kinda get overpaid by the Suns)."
"It didn't have to be those guys...there's like 30-40 guys you could replace Rubio with who would produce more than him.  This idea that it's either Rubio or Teague over the last 3 seasons, is a false dichotomy.  Hell, the Wolves could have drafted a guard better than Rubio by now, but they keep making shit selections.  &amp;#x200B;  Rubio was playing alright for the Jazz and Suns, and played like crap come post season (a crisp 27% from deep when he had to face good defenses in the playoffs). He was not ""great"", and had a down year with the Jazz....that's why they went out and replaced him, and then stuck with that replacement even when Conley played like trash initially.  &amp;#x200B;  Ricky Rubio playing bad basketball for most of his career does mean he's kind of bad.  People want to ignore the 7 seasons with the Wolves and the down year with the Jazz for 2 seasons of play."

"Tbf to Donovan, he spent his first 2 years with Ricky Rubio AND had some early success in the clutch that boosted his confidence to maybe unreasonable heights."
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust. Not like the guy that went to Golden State at Pick Number 11: KLAY THOMPSON. They also missed out on Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard. Woof."
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"That is Ricky Rubio (career 32% three point shooter), Jake Layman (career 31% three point shooter), Naz Reid (33%)  and Jarred Vanderbilt (25%) standing around the perimeter while rookie Anthony Edwards (who has less than 10 career post up possessions) tries to post up.  What's wrong with that?"
"Ricky is currently 2nd in the worst FG% in the league and 4th in worst eFG%. We absolutely need playmaking but not someone who can't shoot to save his live. Satoransky is a good corner 3pt shooter, 6'7 guard who is an average defender will do instead of Rubio."
Can Ricky Rubio shoot any slower? What the fuck was that release time? Looking like a time lord out there.
"ricky rubio just died a little, again"
"Funny how it is 2 rookies and then 10 veteran, Ricky Rubio, who practically invented low EFG%."
I saw one a couple days ago that said we should trade Goran dragic for Ricky Rubio lol
"I think the TT acquisition was fine but that doesn't excuse poor roster construction.   I felt like I've had a few conversations with Celtics fans recently who've made the comment: ""Who could we have traded for?"". For the record I'm on board with not dumping one of the Jays/Smart in a rental. That's fine.  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
The entire 2008 Spanish Olympics team did the slanted eyes thing in a team photo. This includes such r/nba darlings as Ricky Rubio and the Gasols. Insane how stuff like that continues to be seen as ok.
"&gt; His efficiency is much better,  Is it really? His TS% is 1% better than his previous highest year and 3% better than his average. He is playing with the best pointguard this generation so his efficiency isn't really that much better considering he is now 26 years old and playing with Steph and his gravity.  &gt;solid defense on a team that is ranked 4th in defense   He is playing with someone who has been defensive player of the year instead of KAT.   &gt;Part of it is him getting better and part of it is being in a good situation.  I really think it is much more his team. People are quick to say a player all of a sudden looks good when he switches teams and find success. For example when Kanter went on the trailblazers many said his defense improved and the team was playing better defense than when he was on the Knicks but he was just on a better team. When Booker went from playing with Isaiah Canaan and Tyler Johnson to Ricky Rubio his TS jumped up 4 % higher than his best and 6-7% higher than his average. Most people who watch Suns games thought Booker always had that in him but just the difference from bad PG to an adequate PG makes a huge jump."

I gotta agree Broadie and Simmons can't be compared to Ricky even if they shoot &lt;20% from 15ft and beyond. They are beasts that can bully their way to the basket and Rubio is definitely not the same... so he needs the 3pt% to be effective.
Ricky Rubio in shambles
"Same reason they didn’t draft Coby White, and took Jarrett Culver instead.  Same reason they took Ricky Rubio (who’s had a nice career) and Johnny Fucking Flynn before Steph Curry.   The front office is world class dumb, and they don’t know how to put a team together. Our only success as a franchise is tied to Flip Saunders and Kevin McHale (who was a HORRIBLE GM) taking a chance on a high school kid named Kevin Garnett when nobody else would."
"LeBron James, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, CJ McCollum, Ricky Rubio, Jusuf Nurkic, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller and other NBA/former NBA players disagree with you"
Ricky ‘trae young’ Rubio
I will say Rubio has been off this year so upgrading from Ricky to CP3 is huge but I think Suns would absolutely be in the playoff mix regardless.
"Besides what others have mentioned about his line-drive-like jumper, I think his ACL injury (banging knees w/Kobe) took a lot of flair and confidence from his game.   He was by far the most fun to watch his first year in the league - he was basically a different player afterward. Maturity, coaching, the injury, a combination of all three? You be the judge: [Ricky Rubio Offense Highlights 2012/2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-PMriKM-y4)"
"Rubio hit a peak sooner than most, but didn't have the physical upside to keep getting better. Had the crazy wingspan and excellent size for a point guard even as a 14 year old, but just not the high end athlete to be an NBA superstar and never really developed the range of scoring tools to make up for it. But to be fair to Rubio, the hype was so far out of control at the time that he had very little chance of hitting it anyway.   Rubio as a 14 year old played in the U16 Euro Championships and in a double overtime game to win the finals he had 51 points, 24 rebounds, 12 assists and 7 steals. And a half court shot to send the game into the second overtime. By the next season he was a 15 year old starting games in the Euroleague, and the hype was aided by the Euro to NBA craze at the time. In some ways I wonder if Luka was hurt by how things transpired for Ricky, because I saw all the top guys in the draft class and to me it wasn't close. Luka is a guy you put 1 in most any class."
Ricky Rubio
"Steve Novak, Patty Mills, Ricky Rubio, JJ Redick, Troy Daniels, TJ McConnell, DJ Augustin, and FVV"
Ricky Rubio! https://twitter.com/rickyrubio9/status/1364425211349729286?s=20
I'm old enough to remember when Ricky Rubio was drafted and he was the first player born in 1990.
"That’s such an overly simplistic way of looking at it. This team without cp3 and a much thinner bench was tied for a play-in spot, and cp3 is coming in as an addition to that team. Of course they’re better with him lmao. How good is Phoenix if you swapped booker for whatever the sg equivalent of Ricky Rubio is? They’re definitely not the 4 seed. Probably right around where book had us last year..."
"Steph had a lot of downsides. He played 3 years in college (making him older), played for Davidson (this does actually matter), was basically only seen as a shooter, bad at everything else. And you gotta think, in 2009, 3 point shooters weren't valued nearly as much.   Flynn was the #1 guy at Syracuse and won the big east MVP. And Ricky Rubio was already a pro player in Spain at 17 (and actually started at 14). Honestly, I'm surprised the Kings didn't pick Flynn over Tyreke Evans but that turned out to be the better pick immediately."
"I really don’t get the panic of the Clippers need a PG discourse. They have the second best offense in the league and have plus passers like Kawhi and Batum in the closing 5. If you can do Lou Will and the Kennard seconds for George Hill or Ricky Rubio yeah sure, but I don’t think the Clippers absolutely need that to win a title."
"Only tangentially related to the Timberwolves being a bad organization, but I will never forgive you guys for picking Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio back to back when we were 2 picks behind you and needed a PG.  Steph went 7th and we were left with Jordan Hill  Just why =("
"“Behold, Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre shall we trade, and shall bring forth a Sun, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, (the Point) God with us.”  Matthew 1:23, King James (Jones) Bible"
They’re on pace for a 16 win improvement over 82 games. They weren’t going to do that with Ricky Rubio.
Ricky Rubio had already left the Phoenix Suns.    He's playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves currently.
What's crazy is that they already had a good veteran guard in Ricky Rubio. Chris Paul is god tier. I will never doubt him again.
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).

"My 2 preferred TPE targets: Ricky Rubio and/or Thad Young.  Rubio would be good Kemba/Smart insurance, could be had cheaply and has a $17M expiring salary next year that could be used in another trade.  Thad Young is consistent and would provide some more scoring at the 4 and had a $14M expiring contract next year."
Not seeing Ricky Rubio on the list?
"The obvious solution is some sort of performance-based bonus structure. That way you can DEFINITELY ""fine"" refs for bad performance. Players have bonuses tied to their performance. In 2018, Ricky Rubio made an extra $75k for making &gt;82% of his free throws. You could also think of this as a $75k ""fine"" for missing &gt;18% of his free throws, if he had done that.  The real trick will be to find an impartial body that can accurately judge referees' performance."
"Everyone saying Lonzo would be out of the league after his rookie contract were crazy. If Ricky Rubio has been in the league a decade average 51% TS, then Lonzo will always have a place, especially if he continues to hit 3's at an above average pace."

Hopefully he implements something that doesn't see Ricky Rubio become an isolation scorer in clutch time
"Listen man just because we are the timberwolves doesn’t mean we are the biggest  brain-dead embarrassment in the entire history of sports. We can’t be tricked into crappy deals so easily anymore, the re uniting of Ricky Rubio wad the last straw. Nobody fools US 519 times.  Throw in an overpaid pile of crap that hasn’t been good at all this year and we will call it a deal. The bidding starts at Drummond."
No no no but you can have one Ricky Rubio :)
"12th blown 4th quarter lead, but who's counting. ME. I'm counting. I've watched them all. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. if I have to see ricky rubio take a one-legged fade away in the clutch again I might claw my eyes out."
"This is the worst fourth quarter team I've ever fucking seen. We either fight back into the game or get a lead in the fourth, and then choke it away in the last 3-4 minutes. It's been literally the same fucking story every goddamn night. Terrible plays drawn up and terrible execution in the clutch. So fucking miserable to watch.   KAT played out of his fucking mind in the fourth and literally everybody else was invisible or actively fucking the game up. I am so tired of seeing RICKY FUCKING RUBIO taking shots late in the fourth."
Ricky Rubio. He didn't have to run the offense.
"It's cyclical,   * Euros started off being underrated * Dirk paves the way becoming the first major European star. Pau Gasol soon follows as does Peja Stojaković. * GMs in the early 2000s want the next Dirk, spend high picks on players who are not good (e.g. Darko Milicic, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Yaroslav Koralev etc...)  * Euro players are now all busts again. * New Euro player makes it big (e.g. Tony Parker, Marc Gasol, Mehmet Okur) and the Euro hype begins again.  * GMs want the new international superstar/hidden gem. Instead draft busts like jan Vesely or not living up to their potential stars like Ricky Rubio, Enes Kanter or Jonas Valanciunas (all top 5 picks who failed to live up to the hype).  * Euros are back to being soft/not good again. This is why Porziņģis got booed on draft night by his home ""fans"".  * New crop of Euro talent makes it big guys like Nikola Jokic, Giannis, Porziņģis, Gobert and Luka dominate.  * Now GMs take a chance and take guys like Poku high in the draft.   Euros because there aren't as many are compared to their peers way more than an american player. The boom/bust scrutiny is 10fold it seems."
Ricky the Sun God Rubio
Ricky Rubio ~~lowkey~~ choked this away.
And one of them is Ricky Rubio 😎
At worst with his playmaking ability hed be a slightly worse Ricky Rubio.
Gorgui for Ricky Rubio. The Wolves trifecta.
Ryan Saunders: Ricky?  Rubio: say no more fam
Ricky Rubio lowkey choked this away.
The All-Underwhelming but have had a Solid &amp; Long Career team:   C: Tyson Chandler (2nd Pick in '01)  PF: Tristan Thompson (4th pick in '11)  SF: Marvin Williams (2nd pick in '05)  SG: Mike Dunleavy (3rd pick in '02)   PG: Ricky Rubio (5th pick in '09)
Sucks Ricky Rubio didn't get to throw an elbow into his jaw
This. He was supposed to be Jason Kidd 2.0. Turns out like Ricky Rubio 2.0.
Ricky Rubio
"Yeah, Gobert was basically the hard counter to MVP Russ. Dude being in the paint meant Russ needed to settle for a lot more outside shots, which made him much easier to deal with. Was a matchup problem for Okc that series.  Also Ricky Rubio balled out for a few games."
" &gt;Being a high level shot creator and exploiting that to create plays for your teammates is definitely playmaking.  Yeah but Kawhi doesn't directly create plays for others at the rate that other players do.  &gt;You think defenses respect ricky rubio more than Kawhi Leonard?  No? But your post is about playmaking, not overall best offensive player."
Being a high level shot creator and exploiting that to create plays for your teammates is definitely playmaking. You think defenses respect ricky rubio more than Kawhi Leonard?
&gt; Not a good year for the Ricky Rubio stans  Rubio has been turning it around with D'Angelo Russell out. He's been a starter all his life and I don't think coming off the bench was good for him. I also think that playing off the ball with D'Angelo Russell running point is a horrible terrible awful atrocious misuse of Rubio. What the hell is the point of a Ricky Rubio when you put him in the corner while Russell dribbles the air out of the ball?
"Gaurds: ricky rubio, Steph Curry  Forwards: lebron, KG  Center: Tim Duncan  Nash, TMac, Dirk, and KAT off the bench"
I thought Ricky Rubio was gonna be more like Steve Nash
"Only the best of the best NBA players have a good amount of control ovet their careers. We're talking guys like LBJ, Durant, Steph, etc.  Mid-tier vets, stars, and even some all-stars don't have that luxury. The Blake Griffin trade comes to mind for instance.   Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre also didn't seem too pleased that they were traded by the Suns (they came to mind first because they're on my favorite team).   Oh, and don't forget about the draft that basically connects any good young player to the team that picks team for the duration of their rookie contract and their likely extension.  The absolute superstars have a lot of power, but let's not pretend that the teams have lost control here"
Inquire about Ricky Rubio you cowards
That's an interesting play with Ben as a roll guy. Imagine him with a real past first point guard like Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio:   Hold my Gatorade.
Paying Kemba at max money &gt; paying Ricky Rubio
I remember going into that offseason accepting that Ricky Rubio would be our PG after the shit storm after we lost.
"Thought he was gonna be a cross between Brandon Jennings and Ricky Rubio. I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him.   I haven't been this wrong about a draft prospect since I paraded around middle school in Adam Morrison's orange ass Bobcats jersey prior to his rookie year telling everyone the Bobcats future was set between Wallace, Morrison, and Raymond Felton."
Donte is a decent 3 and D player but he is 24 which is not old but also not very young by any means. I think he will end up being a decent player with averages of like 12-13 points on 40% shooting. I think the best comparison for Donte would be Luke Kennard. Both were solid 3rd year players but not great and not future all star caliber player. Luke Kennard went for the 19th overall pick and I would say that’s pretty fair value for Donte.   Brook is 32 and while his contract is not bad it is not that attractive. Next 2 seasons he will be making 27.2 million and the question is that do I really want to be putting 14 million into my cap space for Brook Lopez? He’s not a negative asset but he certainly is not a very attractive one given his age and how he is a pretty bad rebounder. I can’t see Brook Lopez being a very attractive asset and more so be salary filler   As for your trades there is no way Charlotte gives up Rozier who is balling out and biyombo for that package.   As for the second package I don’t think Milwaukee does that. Ricky Rubio looks super washed this year and his numbers look awful even on a garbage Timberwolves team   I think a good target for them would be Terrance Ross. He can create his own shot pretty well and he can get very hot very fast. Past 2 playoff runs for the Magic he is also averaging 15 points on 56 TS
Could’ve been Steph but nah Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio right
he had KP to help off of DJJ in the paint in perfect position too. just pull a ricky rubio on harden and say you’re not gonna make a three on me. have him make a tough contested layup or make someone else beat you.   just a defensive lapse on the clutch by a young team. i think they’ll grow from it
Does Ricky Rubio help the Celtics ?
"&gt; Ricky Rubio--always will give you good defense, good passing, and zero scoring.  Every 20 games or so he'll go off for like 40 though lol"
ricky rubio and seth curry would do more for the celtics than kemba
You forgot Ricky Rubio and Darren Collison
Ricky Rubio
"Well just to disagree a bit, they shouldn't all be primary ball handlers, they should be primary options offensively (maybe you're interpreting those as the same idk), and Giannis falls into that as well. Ricky Rubio is a better primary *ball handler* than KD or Kawhi."
Maybe a Simmons + picks for Beal and try to send someone else for Ricky Rubio? Idk I’m just spitballing
"&gt;My point was that Jazz didn't get to conference finals. That's it.  But you're avoiding looking at *why* they didn't get to the conference finals. In past years, it was because the Jazz didn't have a second scorer beyond Donovan. That goes for last season, when Bojan was out for the playoffs, and it goes for years before that, when it really was true. They also didn't have 3 point shooting in years past - two years ago against the Rockets, the Jazz created an *incredible* number of wide open 3s - and shot 12.5% on them. Now they have a slew of players that can shoot instead of Ricky Rubio, so odds are that if Ingles is having an off night - who was once the single reliable threat from deep - someone else can step up for him.  &gt;Miami were the fifth seed and went to the finals  Yeah, and how'd they do that? They had a deep, balanced team that didn't rely too heavily on one single player until crunch time, great 3 point threats from 3 players on the court at all times, and a strong defense that didn't let the opposing offense do anything easily. Sound familiar?  Again, the teams you're pointing to as postseason failures had exploitable flaws that weren't corrected. The Bucks failed because Giannis hasn't developed from 3. The Nuggets don't have much outside their top two players. The Grizz during their peak played only one style of ball.  The Jazz *have* corrected their flaws. New ones might show over the course of the season, that's totally true - but that's the point, they'll be *new* flaws. What you're doing is pointing to teams that were limited and inflexible for years on end as proof a team that has very clearly been flexible in improving its level and style of play will likely flame out again. That's being lazy and stupid."

Ricky Rubio makes me want to commit die
There’s a reason Ricky Rubio isn’t a perennial all star.
"To be fair, Presti did trade up for him. Ricky Rubio and two late firsts from that same draft."
Well on our roster the alternative is playing Ricky Rubio and having teams leave him wide open constantly.

James Jones got CP3 for Ricky Rubio and Kelly pines. Goat move.  He also got cam Johnson and saric for Jarrett culver.
and yet the most shocking thing is why the fuck has Ricky Rubio taken 9 shots and the most of the team wtf
"kind of off topic but sometimes it gets lost in my mind how taller than everyone else basketball players are. Ricky Rubio is 4 cm, nearly 2 inches, taller than Sergio Busquets, who's a big fella. Rubio's also 9 inches (23 cm) taller than Xavi, a football player whose play style was similar to Rubio's (lots of passing/playmaking, not much aggressiveness)"
"Ricky Rubio is like Kuroko. Super inconspicuous, cant score, can only shoot"
"This is an uninformed take. Ant was forced into a huge role due to injuries. The team is not trying to tank.   KAT gets triple teamed at least half the time he has the ball. Ant has become one of the only guys on the team that can create offense for himself and others. With D'Lo and Beasley out, who the hell was gonna score when KAT is neutralized?. Ricky Rubio? Without Ant, we don't win half the games we've won post All-Star break."
"Remember when Minnesota thought it was doing that by picking Jonny  Flynn and Ricky Rubio  Or Philly picking nerlens Noel, Okafor and embiid ?"
nah dude ricky rubio is totally better than Dlo...
My man Ricky Rubio had a pretty low arc during his stint in Utah. Haven't seen as of lately though.
"Without CP3, the Suns are at least 6th seed level, if Ricky Rubio plays close to how he did last year for us. The Suns had a positive differential last year and was higher than their rank which many argue is a better indicator for how good a team is. By the end of the year with Ayton back, and their core youth growing, they were easily not a lottery team. Chris Paul wouldn't have wanted to come here if this was just some lottery team."
"This just in, Ricky Rubio is more skilled than Shaq"
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez
"You could always try to swing a trade for a guy like Ricky Rubio, or a sign and trade for Lowry  Lowry/Beal/Embiid would be nasty"
I'm guessing Ricky Rubio as my first guess. DeRozan as my 2nd guess.
Bruh Russ is a superstar lol or atleast he was in OKC and Houston. This is even worse than asking Harden to play like Ricky Rubio
"Thing is, with KAT in the lineup, dlos iso ball and shooting makes way more sense. With dlo out, KAT just gets triple teamed and throws it out to fuckin Ricky Rubio for a brick. That being said, the teams still not good haha"
"Facts. Ayton got suspended for 25 games, Aron Baynes goes out with injury when Ayton is about to come back, Ayton comes back but Frank and Dario start having injuries. Rubio fought back spasms all year. This team was a decent team but with the acquisitions during the off seasons made this team good. This team would have the same success if Ricky was on the team."
"This dude, as well as a few g-league players, and what should be a very late first round pick got us an upgrade from Ricky Rubio to Chris Paul.  We love you James Jones."
"It's good to see the Suns thriving right now. Chris Paul was the missing piece for them. It was sad to see Ricky Rubio go because he was killing it too, but CPaul is just a great floor general."
"Rubio started basketball very early, and was widely known as a prospect since he was 14. But he even then Luka was just much more accomplished than Ricky."
Ricky rubio with Joe ingles shooting
"Not even sure that the “only” argument Curry had over Luka a month ago was 3-pt shooting. Honestly don’t know how we can say Luka is a better playmaker or floor general than Curry. Higher APG doesn’t necessarily mean that one player is a better floor general than another. For example, Ricky Rubio has averaged more assists than Curry his entire career, but Curry is by far a better floor general if you actually watch the games."
The only other prospect similar was Ricky Rubio who was also at the highest European level but wasn't at a Mvp level back then

I'll trade you one lightly used Jarret Culver and Ricky Rubio for him.
"My 5 favorite players are all on the Jazz, so just for fun, I'll compose my team from other franchises:  PG: Raul Neto   SG: Ricky Rubio   SF: Malcolm Brogdon   PF: Giannis Antetokoumpo   C: Steven Adams  Greek Freak carries this team to a playoff position in the East, but there's probably not enough shooting for a playoff run."
What about Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn tho
Timberwolves drafting Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio when they could have had Steph Curry and DeMar DeRozan.
Luka Donkic and Ricky Rubio
"Harden wasn't necessarily considered a ""reach"", but he was considered a lower ceiling player than Ricky Rubio (who at the time was an insanely talented prospect from europe that started playing in Spain's top league at 14, and had played well against the US in international play). Harden was a polished SG coming out of college, and people said OKC was choosing fit over BPA/talent."
"Bruh I like the wolves chill lmao, but as the team that used to start your backup pg, trust, y’all got some good pgs. Ricky Rubio lead the highest net rated on the floor offense in the nba last season on the suns so you’re . Y’all need 3&amp;d vets and defensive identity, not new shiny point guards"
"THT is overyhyped by Lakers fans but he ***absolutely*** has more trade value than Rubio. Rubio is pretty close to neutral value at this point, probably even negative value.  Last offseason Minnesota sent out James Johnson (salary filler at this point in his career), pick #17, pick #50, and two 2nd rounders and they got in Ricky Rubio, pick #23, and pick #28.  So basically Ricky Rubio is the difference between pick #17 and picks #23 + #28. He's just a body at this stage of his career."
"the 2027 first round pick, alex caruso sign and trade, and tht sign and trade are all worth more individually than ricky rubio lol  2027 could see the lakers lose lebron and AD and have no first round tier prospects in the cupboards  and rubio isn't doing anything for the wolves right now anyway  now i wouldn't trade for rubio, but there's surely more options in addition to him"
Better than Ricky Rubio
&gt;  instead of the games in actually lost the series for OKC : game 2 trough 4  Games in which Westbrook played like shit and got embarrassed by Ricky Rubio.
"I thought it was gonna be some Ricky Rubio on harden type shit but this is legit   Very impressive speed and footwork, wow"
"As recently as a month ago he was 99th percentile in isolation scoring, while Ricky Rubio 3's are only 34% while wide open"
"Ah yes, famed spot up shooter Ricky Rubio, strange to see him doing poorly in this area /s"
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  Ainge had a contending roster with Kyrie and Hayward but Kyrie's a headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. Then prior to last season it became an issue of too many mouths to feed and didn't lead to roster cohesion.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
"&gt;The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.  Fair enough, but I think given the respective records, it's fairly close.  &gt; You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.  14-7 corresponds roughly with Ayton's availability.  Obviously he's a huge deal.  Yes, the bubble was unique, but just in the last month, as I noted elsewhere, the Suns have wins over: the Davis-less Lakers, the McCollum-less Blazers, the Curry-less Warriors, the Davis-and-James-less Lakers, and the Wolves twice.  They also lost to the Wolves and the tanking Magic.  So I think it's fair to equate this season and last, and even to the bubble."
"The Bubble Suns had $18M of that $24M invested in Oubre, Ty Jerome and Jalen Lecque, who were also part of the trade. Granted we took back Nader, that adds $2M more, so realistically, we would have had $8M extra to spend. Considering we have $-18M in cap space, we would have still been $-10M over and unable to sign anyone outside of minimum contracts anyway.  The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.   You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.   This team is demonstrably better with Chris Paul and a full bench."
"The Suns are only marginally better than they were with Ricky Rubio for the last third of last year, and Rubio's numbers were only slightly worse than Paul's.  That's a small and very expensive upgrade."
"Phoenix was undefeated in the bubble, and won 14 of their last 21 last year, with Ricky Rubio putting up very similar numbers to Paul's.  How much better, exactly, did they get due to Paul?"
kat gets the honor of passing out of double and triple teams to known shooters like ricky rubio and inconsistent rookies like ant and mcdaniels. other teams have no reason to not double and triple team him

"I started getting interested in basketball about 2011.  I got a pirated copy of 2k11.  As a huge nephew that time, I was obsessed in 3 point shooting and sliders so I always beat up the Celtics with Steve ""GOD SERENA"" Blake  Since I like 3 point shooting, I followed closely to the GOAT shooter at that time who was Ray Allen. Wasn't really big on the Celtics or the Heat because I fucking hated LeBron so I settled with my second favorite thing in basketball which is flashy passing. Didn't help I was a huge weeb and liked Kuroko no Basuke so I was a Steve Nash/Ricky Rubio fan at that time.  About 2 years later, I discovered Steph Curry and realized ""Yeah I fuck with this dude"". That's how I invested a lot on Warriors stock. Really helped that his tag team duo was arguably the second best shooter of all time in Klay Thompson."
"Gary Trent, DJ Augustin, and Ricky Rubio."
Ricky Rubio wears the same number Ricky Rubio wore on the Wolves.
[Karl-Anthony Towns has now shared the floor more with Ricky Rubio since the All-Star break (96 minutes) than he has with D'Angelo Russell all season (90 minutes).](https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1372029495813795841)  That's just nuts
Bum ass Ricky Rubio always lighting up the Lakers for no reason
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"

"Wolves probably would have sent out some combination of Nowell/McDaniels/Okogie with a future pick and Ricky Rubio as salary filler. Sounds like Rosas has pulled back from discussions for now, though."
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
We can't always choose our loves- Ricky Rubio is my favorite.
"OKC has a vested interest in making sure the Clippers stay mediocre so I can't see them trading Hill to them. Also what assets do they have to trade for Hill? Lou Williams makes sense salary-match wise but he straight up said he'd retire if he got moved.  I think the Clippers need a playmaker but they have to lower their expectations. I don't even think they can get Ricky Rubio now. As much as I hate to say, two potentially obtainable playmaking upgrades are *gag* Elfrid Payton and Eric Bledsoe."
"Outside of current Jazz players, Ricky Rubio. Been a fan of his since the first time I saw him play in the Olympics when he was just 16. Wanted the Jazz to draft him. Was super happy when we traded for him. And super bummed when he left. But, I will always root for him."
Ricky Rubio.
Ricky Rubio is so clutch 💉💉💉
We can interest you with Ricky Rubio?
"Otto porter for Ricky rubio, let's go?"
"I dont think I've ever seen Ricky Rubio make a layup, but apparently he has made dozens of them"
"I mean this really can’t be a Bender situation. Bender was picked 4th, Poku 16th I think. There’s a huge difference between gambling with the 4th and 16th picks, especially because all OKC really had to give up to get him was Ricky Rubio"
"You can be slow and play fast. For instance, Rubio is pretty slow these days, but he pushes the pace and is willing to move.   D’Lo‘s a good player (better than Rubio), but he doesn’t play particularly “good” basketball. He’s good mostly because he’s a very talented shot maker. If you’re trying to pick someone to model traits for Ant, I think D’Lo’s one of the last people I’d recommend. Ricky, on the other hand, plays basketball the “right” (quotes to indicate that this is a bit amorphous and subjective) way most of the time.   Edwards is super talented but what he’s lacking is a sense of how to fit in on a winning team and contribute outside of shooting. Ricky is far better at modeling/nurturing that than D’Lo."
The way he talks about this team I wouldn’t be surprised if the calls were coming from Ricky Rubio pretending to be the GM for the clippers
"he's better at 19 than I expected him to be in his prime. I was low on the dude, really didn't think he'd hack it as an NBA starter in the 2020s, thought he'd be somewhere between Ricky Rubio or Brandon Jennings depending on his confidence level in the NBA but inefficient... but he's improved a lot in a short amount of time, and I'm officially on board.  Nice handles, insane court vision and passing for anybody let alone a 19-year-old kid. Definitely can get overzealous and make some ill advised passes but again, much more in control than I anticipated, and looks like an absolute natural.  The biggest thing is he's a quality shooter and scorer, a vastly better shooter and finisher than advertised. Still has a quirky looking jumper at times, but it works, so I'm not fucking with it, aside from maybe cleaning up his lower body mechanics, which he already seems to be doing.   15.8ppg on 44.9/38.7/80.8 shooting (56.5 TS%) on the season is better than anything anybody could've dreamed of him doing as a rookie on a team with three other really good guards, and those numbers are much better since he became a starter 17 games ago (20.0ppg on 46.4/45.5/85.5 ~59 TS%).  He's every bit as good as he looks offensively.  Defensively, more of a mixed bag. He's not as good as the 1.6stl would have you believe. He's trying hard to make things happen, which is more than you can say about most bad defenders, but I don't think he's going to be a good guard defender at this level. Most PGs blow by him, a lot of wings can body him. This isn't super popular, but I think his future is bulking up to about 200-205 pounds and playing the SF/SG defensively, due to his length. Which plays well into our current lineup, where we have three smaller guards in Rozier, Graham, and Monk."
James Johnson was traded for Ricky Rubio.

Ricky Rubio isn't going to dick to move the needle on their title chances lmfao.
Ricky Rubio to Indiana
"Ayton missed half of last year between the suspension/injury, most of the team was ravaged by injuries all year, including Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre, and missed the playoffs by half a game. Also, people ignore the fact we added Crowder/Nader/Cam Payne/Etwaun Moore and Langston Galloway to replace a bunch of g-league guys.      The year prior we didn't have a single point guard and we were starting 2 rookies on offense with Igor Kokoshkov at hc. Devin Booker also injured his shooting hand that year and was basically shooting left handed for a while"
"Are you one of those guys that was all pumped because we got Johnson for playoff defense and Luka protection, and now you want to trade him for Ricky Fucking Rubio?"
I too would like 1 Ricky Rubio
"Can Rubio get traded to the Clips?  Seriously though I don’t know why they didn’t get Rondo before Ricky is a solid fit.   He’s an excellent, tricky facilitator and the Clippers don’t exactly need more firepower."
"Nah we just give them powell and Johnson. Make the salaries match. Brunson/luka/DFS/KP/maxi is our first unit. Now Timmy can come off screens and just pound the ball in the 2nd unit, with Ricky at PG. unless we can get a big, which we need more. I would take Rubio."
Ricky Rubio
I would take 1 Ricky Rubio here. Insert Brunson into the starting lineup and Rubio runs our second unit.
He's the least efficient 2nd option in the league. His ideal role is closer to a Ricky Rubio than a Mike Conley imo
Ricky Rubio

"Hey now, have some respect for Ricky Rubio"
People don't talk enough about the [Spanish National Team doing this photo](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/784128/spain-slant-eye.jpg) after they beat China in the Olympics. Notably Ricky Rubio and Marc Gasol.
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: Vince  SF: Giannis   PF: KG  C: Jokic
"Hey welves fan, here Ricky Rubio"
Imagine the kind of things he could get out of Fox and Haliburton both extremely vocal and cerebral playmakers who can score being lead by the vet presence of Rubio showing them the way. I would absolutely prefer CP3 but Ricky ain't that far behind in terms of bball understanding even if he doesn't have the absolute masterclass skills of CP3.
"If purely based on passing, Ricky Rubio should be on there."
"It's 2063, Ricky Rubio is feeling down. But suddenly, he remembers way back when, to the time Anthony Edwards praised him so highly. He smiles..."

Idunno man part of me wonders what would've happened if they took that Kemba salary and instead signed like Ricky Rubio and some depth.
"Ricky Rubio  Eric Gordon  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Clint Capela  with d rose/hart/ariza/pj/zubac off the bench would be a 60+win team imo. spacing,scoring,defense,depth,rebounding, etc. winning 60 games is a lot harder than it seems but this squad could do it"

Naaa i think it’s Ricky Rubio
"I guess this is a somewhat unpopular opinion since I don’t see this addresed here like ever, but it is surprising to me that Ricky Rubio never got any buzz for being a great defender (i’d say as good of a defender as some of the guys that made an all-defense team in the past 10 years. Maybe I just particularly like his defense, or maybe it is just that he is somewhat flashy on defense, getting a lot of steals, annoying the ball-handler, etc"
"&gt;Roster construction doesn't determine the effort they are willing to put into the game when it's being played. THAT falls onto the head coach.  A great coach will build his system around his players, not expect to fit his players into a system.   The Jazz got very lucky with Donovan Mitchell, and to a lesser extent Rudy Gobert, but outside of that Quin Snyder has turned the Jazz into a group 10x the sum of their parts. If you track it from George Hill, to Ricky Rubio, and then Mike Conley the Jazz essentially traded 5 first round picks to finally land a fit with Conley. That leaves us filling our roster with undrafted or unwanted players. Ingles, O'Neale, Niang, Ilyasova, Forrest, Oni, are all playing great basketball and it should all be to Snyder's credit. Clarkson is playing the best basketball of his career because Snyder built a system to take advantage of his talent.  Stevens is a good coach, but he's had this golden boy status for a few years and I never felt like he deserved it. I've always been a bit jealous and salty over Steven's rep because I've always felt Snyder is a better coach and underappreciated."
"Fuck that man I want everyone talking trash. I want Ricky Rubio talking shit to Chris Paul. I want Jae Crowder threatening to home invade a Lopez brother. I want Embiid to catch and chug two milk shakes, Stone Cold style, right before he goes on a monologue of hate to Jahlil Okafor. I want the Clippers to raise a Joe Ingles pinata before every game."
"He did hit the open man out of doubles.  That open man was Ricky fucking Rubio, Josh Okogie, Jared Vanderbilt and Juancho Hernangomez.    DLo, Beasley and McDaniels were out.  They can hit open shots.  Miami only guarded KAT and Ant to close the game."
Ricky Rubio. Great on some nights and then trash on others

"&gt;I should have said stats don't directly correlate to ability  Name a single player leading another player in ALL those metrics and you have the better player dude - you don't need a PHD to understand it.   This isn't cherry picking stats, it's ALL the stats.   When a guy leads someone else by 6 ppg, on higher efficiency, he's a better scorer. Period.   When he leads by 6 RPG, on a higher R%, he's a better rebounder. Period.   There's no ""context"" that will make Ricky Rubio a better rebounder than Embiid just because I might not like the outcome. The fun thing about stats is that they don't care about your opinion.  Literally the only bias here is the dude going ""nah despite everything in the box score saying otherwise I'm going with my guy"" lol.  &gt;we KNOW can be a best player on a good team.  Bruh he wasn't even the best player on the WOLVES trust me one of us actually has to watch this team."

Yeah we need the nuggets to sucker punch Ricky Rubio or something so I can really hate them
If Ricky Rubio could hit 3s over 40%
How bad does it hurt that they traded him for Dlo and a top 3 protected pick? Prolly not as bad as drafting Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio ahead of steph
4 techs? One on rubio? Who ts up ricky rubio
Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio say hi
Is it really that surprising? Internationally people can play full grown adults as teenagers. Ricky Rubio is probably a hall of famer because of his career as a teen.
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"
"Forreal, there’s a huge difference between Mike Conley and Ricky Rubio"
"Has KAT proven he can lead a team yet? No. But it’s also hard to do that when your best teammates the last couple of years have been Andrew Wiggins, 40 odd games of DLo and Malik Beasley, a 19 year old rookie and Ricky Rubio."
In today's game:  Ricky Rubio lol  Rajon in the 2010s  Jason Williams in the 90s  It might be too easy choosing defensive/pass first PGs though
"Jrue was just fine in the bubble. Tatum struggled but still played way better then russ. You’re also ignoring the fact that almost every star had covid and came back just fine. Westbrook had no citable issues with covid.  I said 4 on 3 because the lakers left him open all series and he couldn’t do shit against a 4 on 3. He had 17 and 4 on 40% ts for the series with trash defense, that’s horrible.  He wasn’t injured for shit in 2019, he was just trash. Not buying that excuse. And did *you* watch that 2018 series lol? Dude had a 40% TS and was getting bitch slapped by Ricky Rubio on the other end. Delusional"
"Get your coats, we’re going to cheer for Ricky Rubio at the airport! ...or you’re fired"
From what I know isn’t Edwards mostly an iso scorer? It’s not like he was playing with absolute bums when Kat and dlo were out. Ricky Rubio can facilitate and get him open shots and Malik can take off some pressure. I haven’t watched many timberwolves games this year so correct me if I’m wrong.
"I think your right, but damn, it sucks moving players you love that just aren't gonna ever fit.   It was the same for us 2 yrs ago when we had to let Rubio &amp; Favors go to get Conley &amp; Bogey.   Luckily Favors came back, but im 99% sure the basketball gods are punishing us for letting go of a dude as awesome &amp; pure as Ricky, &amp; that's why we cant win against Minnesota this year! Haha."
Because some players while good also have severe limitations that can get exposed in the playoffs.   Some examples: Lou Williamms. Solid sixth man who can score off the bench. But in the playoffs he gets absolutely torched so badly he’s not even worth having on the floor.   Ricky Rubio: great point guard and playmaker also was always a solid defender. Come playoff time though his lack of offensive game led to teams forcing him to try and score and not letting him just play make.
Ricky Rubio is a good example.  Solid point guard and was a good defender. If he was your starting point guard you were fine in the regular season but his lack of offensive game also put a cap on your teams playoff success.
"Amazing how Ricky became the forgotten man in Minny - even if he's back there again.     Do fans really forget the hype surrounding Rubio, and the atmosphere in Target Center when he first started playing? I'll always wonder what Ricky could have been w/out the devastating knee injury - his game lost a lot of joy after that.      RR/Love/Pek/DerrickW/Randolph/Barea/...fun squad."
Or the playoffs games where he somehow made it his personal mission to destroy Ricky Rubio for no reason who was like the 4th option while getting trolled by Mitt Romney
"I think rubio gets a bad rep because of the horrendous teams hes been on. His jumper and athleticism are less than desirable, but hes a really nice passer. Probably a top 10-20 passer in the game rn. He plays passing lanes well on D and can generate steals. He was just such a breath of fresh air at the pg position for the suns last year because we had g leaguers there for a few years. He cant compare to cp3 however... which is unfair to ricky but if you can get a legend like paul you do it"
Something funny to wake up to....    &gt; Anthony Edwards says he's going to Spain with Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez this summer.    &gt;Says he's gonna learn fluent spanish so he knows what those two are talkin about all the time.
His other quote tonight has me cracking up as well.  &gt; Anthony Edwards says he's going to Spain with Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez this summer.    &gt;Says he's gonna learn fluent spanish so he knows what those two are talkin about all the time.
"Even without the contract that’s a quick no. By now we should know that the stats are a smokescreen. What’s we should really pay attention to are the little things: defensive lapses, IQ mistakes, and yeah, shooting. When it’s all added together I’d rather have someone like Ricky Rubio on my team than Westbrook."
"Johnny Flynn, Ricky Rubio, Corey Brewer, Wesley Johnson..."
"What about Darko Milicic? Or Ricky Rubio? Or Jan Vesely? Or Dario Saric (No disrespect to Dario, but he was picked over LaVine)? Or Mario Hezonja? Or Frank Ntilinkina?  All of those guys played overseas against adults and were picked early. All of them (Except to an extent Dario) didn't pan out. Using Luka as your example is terrible because he's been that ONE guy who has been amazing. So many other guys have been busts or underwhelming."
We would be better than the wizards even if we had still had ricky rubio instead of chris paul
"I watched about 30 suns games this season on TV since they are my local team. And Devin Booker is obviously the better and most valuable player. CP3 is one of the worst defenders in the league, he plays super safe, the suns would’ve been just fine with Ricky Rubio running point. In fact, the offense is better with Booker and without CP3. I will credit CP3s leadership. I think he does help their team out, but he is not the most valuable player."
Then you guys just need to draft Steph Curry and Demar Derozan instead of Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio and everybody wins.
"""Ricky Rubio stays getting bitched"" - Flightreacts  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOUrrgwtPY4"
"Ricky Rubio, Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, KAT"
I like how they threw Ricky Rubio under the bus as well.
"Yall thought the guy who orders spaghetti [""pre-chopped""](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/2/22/2817671/lebron-james-steak-ricky-rubio) at restaurants was going to line up for a vaccine?"
"Not arguing with you, but who’s the 2nd best pg rn? Ricky Rubio? Lol"
I mean it was either him or Ricky Rubio taking shots.
Vuc has taken 400 3s this season. About 33% of them have been contested (defense within 6 feet)  That's the same rate that Ricky Rubio -- a notoriously non shooting threat -- gets contested on his 3s.   He aint stretching anythinig
"I read you’re not a fan, but Ricky deserves the shoutout, thank you. Man has a lot of fans in Phoenix still. We love our former Spanish PG. He really did do us well, but management did him dirty. He thought he was staying. All this to say, without Ricky Rubio there would be no Suns CP3."
"and all it took was trading Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, and a FRP"
My Ricky &amp; Monty hoodie is a precious item. He's no CP3 but will always respect Rubio for what he did here.
"Motherfuckers in the media gave him an F last off-season, after they signed Ricky Rubio at point guard. The prior season, they started Isaiah Canaan, Mike James, and Tyler Ulis at point guard and won 19 games. Like, was he supposed to just run it back?"
Actually ricky rubio
At least Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre
Ricky rubio

Lol you really think LeBron James and Ricky fucking Rubio would have averaged more assists than Stockton if they played with Malone?   Ice cold take holy shit.
"The Twolves, as seen in this clip,  selected PG Ricky Rubio 5th and PG Johnny Flynn 6th in the 2009 draft.  PG Steph Curry was the 7th pick."
Ricky Rubio is shooting 37% from the field and 29% from 3 this year and yall let him shoot 5/8 from 3.
Ricky Rubio was just there to prove he is a better shooter who deserved to be picked before Seth Curry's brother
"Ricky Rubio scoring 26 with 8 3PA, what in the fuck timeline is this?"
"Chase Budinger, Alexey Shved, AK47, Nikola Pekovic, Kevin Love, Ricky Rubio  With Timberwolves legend Coach Rick Adelman. What a squad"
"Here's hoping he never loses the childish joy he brings to the game - it's what makes him so much fun to watch.      Respecting the gap in talent between them, that's what happened to Ricky Rubio after a couple of years in the league - he was a blast to watch when he first got to Minny, lost a lot of that joy along the way."
"I don't think you do, given what I mentioned. Ricky Rubio had phenomenal passing and IQ. I'd still rather have Gobert's ""replaceable"" rim running."
"I said top 10 all time.  Ricky not even sniffing that.  Serious question, is Ricky Rubio even top 100 PG all time ?  I will try to throw some names, maybe you want to help me complete this list ?  * Magic * Big O * Isiah * Stockton * Nash * Kidd * CP3 * Curry * Cousy * Iverson (at some point he was a PG, at least nominally) - 10 * Walt Frazier * Gary Payton * Rose * Penny Hardaway * Tim Hardaway * Tony Parker * Kevin Johnson * Billups * Arenas * Rod Strickland - 20 * Cassell * Bibby * White Chocolate * Marbury * Price * Ron Harper * Nick Van Exel * Mark Jackson * Andre Miller * Westbrook - 30 * Wall * Lillard * Rondo * Deron Williams * Baron Davis * Blaylock * Francis * Kemba * Terry Porter * Terrell Brandon - 40 * Mo Cheeks * DJ * Scott Skiles (maybe) * Kyrie * Derek Harper * Kenny Smith  &amp;#x200B;  That's almost 50 and I am sure I missed some of the guys from the 60s and 70s."

Cap ricky rubio has thrown him lobs
Dont forget our lord and savior Ricky “Jesus Christ” Rubio
"Definitely current Ricky Rubio: - can’t sprint anymore, only jogs and occasionally runs - can’t jump anymore, hops barely enough inches off the floor  - majestic hair and facial hair  - occasional genius-level pass or steal"
Ricky Rubio has been helping the suns all year🥰🥰
if you actually think Manu coming off the bench for Danny Green for the Spurs is the same for DLO coming off the bench for Ricky fucking Rubio then idk what to tell you bud other than that you're dumb as hell lmfao.
how about these fucking  announcers giving zero credit to Ricky Rubio
7. Taj Gibson  8. Pat Beverly   9. Ricky Rubio
Why would you draft a second point guard if you already took Ricky Rubio with your first pick? That wouldn't have made sense at all
"[This year and last year](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/paint-touch/?sort=PAINT_TOUCHES&amp;dir=1) Ayton has been top 2 in paint touches along with Clint Capela. Ricky Rubio made Pekovic a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best statistical years, and Chris Paul is Chris Paul. If we can't get him involved more with them two don't know how much more we can get him involved. It seems like half of Bookers TO's are him trying to give Ayton the ball, I sometimes wish Booker just shoots the ball instead or passes it to another 3 point shooter rather than feed Ayton but that is mainly on Book. I wish Ayton was better dribbler and he was able to get the ball on the outside and was able to drive to the basket, creating for himself more."
He’s no Ricky Rubio that’s for sure
"Just another Ricky Rubio, those Euro PG are all the same ^^/s"
Ricky Rubio was *such* an exciting rookie to watch and I cannot think of a single time I went out of my way to watch him since.
"How come they drafted Jonny Flynn *and* Ricky Rubio over Steph Curry? Everyone makes bad choices, some worse than others."
Hey knicks fans can I interest you in a slightly washed ricky rubio?
"You can mention him. Just also mention he sucks, has little potential, and wants to make as much money as possible. Like I said, Ricky Rubio if he’s lucky. I don’t care what an idiot thinks either."
Stfu. You can’t mention Lonzo without his dad. Lonzo brought him out on ESPN. Lonzo never responded to his antics.                                                                 Idk who you think I’m giving Credit to. I think Lonzo and his dad suck for the sport. I’m fucking glad as influencers they asked for 1b and got laughed at. That thing with their business manager screwing them was funny af. Lonzo’s high school girlfriend baby trapping him was funny af.                                                           All that aside Lonzo and his Dad will take like 70m from the NBA. So good for them. But Lonzo is a Ricky Rubio at best player and I haven’t heard about Lavar in months. I don’t think they have a lot of power.
"CP3 has zero right to be upset.   ""It's A Business"" works both ways. Houston could not retain some of their key players because Chris Paul wanted the max possible, so the Rockets gave him a four year max. Paul even had the rules changed to the Over 38 Rule, since he runs the NBPA's executive committee, which enabled him to get that massive extension.   He could have left money on the table to resign other key players to help win a championship.  But he didn't, and that's OK, that's his right, since ""It's A Business""   But it works both ways. Chris Paul can look after what's best for him but the Rockets can't? And what would have been the purpose of a conversation? So Paul can go to his agent and cry to the press and say the Rockets are backstabbing him to force them to trade him to a different place?   If Chris Paul wanted freedom of choice in where he plays, he should have signed one year contracts. Give And Take. You give up long term security but you take more freedom. What Chris Paul wanted was both, which is utter bullshit. Or Chris Paul could have stayed with one team long enough to trigger the ability to have a NTC, and then use that power. But he didn't.   It's a sad day when being a leader on the court and playing hard is some kind of magnificent achievement. It's called being a professional. It's called doing your job. That's what he's being paid to do.   The ridiculous notion that NBA players are doing these franchises a favor by doing the bare baseline of being a professional is mind boggling.   ""You owe me for doing the job that I'm being paid to do!""   That's what the money is for....  As for the Suns, if another team was offering more in value to OKC than Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque and a 2022 first-round pick, do you think they'd pass that up to reward Paul for simply doing his job?   This kind of stuff drives fans from the game. Lots of people are out of work and many are losing their businesses and homes because of the pandemic. Hearing about  NBA guys bitching about the food in the bubble or crying on social media about things that don't have anything to do with basketball or just being divas, it's not the right way to appeal to masses of fans out there.   It's not just the social justice messaging, it's not just the pandemic, it's not just the Free Hong Kong stuff, it's all of it together, including crap like this issue with Chris Paul - It drives fans away."
They go up. They’re much better than his rookie year. That’s to be expected though. Everyone said he’d improve and they were right. The Lakers also gave him way too big a role.                                               He’s been in the league 4 years now though. And his shitty fundamentals were driven into his muscle memory as a child.                                                            Imo it is safe to assume he won’t make another leap like he did from Rookie year to now. Especially considering the role switch.                                             If you trade for Lonzo you’re trading for who he is now. There is not much potential there. He can develop better finishing around the rim but he still can’t get to the basket without a screen.                                     He’s going to be a slightly worse Ricky Rubio
"I man all of these guys (Jokic, Harden, Luka, Trae) depend on their scoring to get assists. Not asimilar to Westbrook. Maybe Ricky Rubio is a better passer than all of them if they didn’t attract any attention."
Wouldn't have even needed a kings ransom to get him. Suns gave up Oubre/Ricky Rubio/Ty Jerome/Jalen Lecque and a first. Horford/a young player/cap filler/2 1sts likely would have got it done.
Ricky Rubio  Mark Madsen  Steph  Dame
"&gt; he ends up shutting down someone like Ricky Rubio  Yes, scoring legend Ricky Rubio. Lets not forget him getting punked by rubio in the playoffs lol"
"It’s a pretty common thing when euro NBA guys give non-English answers/interviews to foreign press for it to go under the radar in the US.   They usually are a lot more straight forward/frank/comfortable speaking in their native language and also probably feel like most Americans won’t really pay attention (which is true) so it’s not uncommon to get some juicy nuggets here and there. We usually don’t hear about it until a while after the fact when someone eventually transcribes it and re-aggregates it.  I can recall Pau Gasol, Tony Parker and Ricky Rubio having things like this where they said some eye opening stuff that they probably wouldn’t have said in front of an American media scrum"
"&gt;Malik is a problem off the court and he isn’t that good either, Ricky and Ricky Rubio is just meh   20 ppg on 57% TS. The only thing bad about him is his defence but at least tries."
"Malik is a problem off the court and he isn’t that good either, Ricky and Ricky Rubio is just meh"
"Literally even just an ""average"" point guard like Ricky Rubio would be an upgrade. You have enough defensive players, and your PG doesn't have to be a god when you have Embiid at center and flamethrowers like Curry."
Ben Simmons for Ricky Rubio
"Is he? Hes got the power and hustle, or used to have the hustle, but he was always kind of a bad attitude to me which seem to be supported by the fact his team won the world series their first year without him.. similar to how the 76ers would definitely have won this series with a number of any serviceable point guards... Say a Ricky Rubio or Lonzo would have worked.   And going back to the attitude thing I'm not aware of Simmons having any reputation as a bad teammate although I think him not being the hardest worker is kind of obvious at this point.  But I'd imagine mentally that your teammates would have a different way in approaching their game when they can comfortably pass the ball to you when you're wide open and trust you to take a shot."
"I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Ricky Rubio is more useful than Ben Simmons."
6’10” Ricky Rubio
"From an spaniard, who has had the privilege to witness (and still some time to go) two fucking golden generations of players in a row in the National Team... Well, I'm sorry to you guys.  Pau Gasol, Ricky Rubio, Marc Gasol, Navarro, Garbajosa, Rudy, the young guys... no matter how far or how hard it was for them in the NBA or in Europe, they have always fought to play for us, and happily. That's fucking huge.   Sorry, I don't want to make it about us. My point is... I'm sorry, for real, for you to not having the luck we had. And I get 100% your point. I don't like when a player like Ibaka or Mirotic played with us only when they felt like it. Fuck those guys."
"Ricky Rubio became the youngest player ever to play in the Spanish ACB League on October 15, 2005, at age 14"
"Terrible front office. Their core players used to be KAT, Zach Lavine, Andrew Wiggins and Ricky Rubio. Zach Lavine (post Achilles tear season) and Andrew Wiggins both improved tremendously almost instantly after leaving Minny and iirc Ricky did as well although can’t remember for sure. Says something about their coaching and roster construction if players all improve after leaving. There’s a reason SPOOKY wolves became a copypasta, the potential has always been there but wolves just can’t put it together."
"The team was half a game out of the 8-seed last year with Ricky Rubio, Ayton's suspension and Baynes' injuries, and a year less of development from the young guys. I still can't tell if /r/nba underrates the core or overrates Paul's impact"
"Booker wouldn't have been the primary ball handler - that would have still been Ricky Rubio. Suns had a pace for better than a .500 season last year in games that Ayton played. That 25 game suspension really boned them because it forced Baynes to play way more minutes than he's ever played and he ended up injured, too.  &amp;#x200B;  IMO Suns probably finish in the play-in and take the 7 or 8 seed."
"&gt;I really wish I had the time in my day to refute all of your shitty takes regarding Schroder and Lowry.  Time is not the problem.  Intelligence and knowledge are.  Go gather a ton of both, and come on back to try again, if you dare.  &gt;You place too much emphasis on meaningless regular season games.  You were the one who brought up Lowry's meaningless regular season game.  &gt;The fact of the matter is Schroder gets exposed for what he really is in the playoffs.   The fact of the matter is that Lowry never went anywhere without Leonard and Gasol.  And Lowry's 3-point shooting in the playoffs drops off to 34%, which is barely better than Schroder's playoff number.  Yet more inconvenient facts that you ought to know before engaging in this discussion.  &gt;Good players wilt in the playoffs and great players raise their game.  Lowry's shooting and assists fall off in the playoffs, and his points stay the same.  &gt;And you said old small players don’t succeed, take a look at Chris Paul  The Suns have so far defeated two heavily-injured teams, and one of those series was largely without Paul's help.  Denver was starting a guard who couldn't make an NBA roster a couple months ago.  The Suns, with everyone available, were just as good with Ricky Rubio last year as they are now with Paul.  You need to pump the brakes on that until Paul actually does something of note."
Ricky Rubio
I don’t think any of us were. It was quite the upgrade over Ricky Rubio
"And with the fifth pick in the 2009 NBA draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves select Ricky Rubio"
"&gt; 3) Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio were very valuable contributors to the Suns  The Suns were radically better when Oubre was injured, just like the Warriors were this season"
3) Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio were very valuable contributors to the Suns despite their lack of success (ricky was crucial to the 8-0 bubble run) and fan favorites (which doesn't matter at all in the basketball sense) and nobody predicted that they would lose basketball ability so quickly
Missed opportunity to reference one of my favorite titles [Ricky Rubio finishes his béchamel sauce with a little nutmeg versus the Mavs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/i30fxs/highlight_ricky_rubio_finishes_his_b%C3%A9chamel_sauce/)
"Well, #1 the year before CP3 so.. credit to Ricky Rubio, too…"
"Karl-Anthony Towns- 1st Overall   Anthony Edwards- 1st Overall  D’Angelo Russell- 2nd Overall   Ricky Rubio- 5th overall   I wonder which team had the most 1st overall picks, probably Showtime Lakers or a LeBron team"
"&gt;There are guys making that much or a couple mil more that you'd easily rather have.  Only one veteran player averaged more assists than Schroder, and made less this past season.  Ballhandling and playmaking is arguably the most in-demand skill in the NBA.  Lots of players can shoot, and lots can rebound.  Only a few can create shots for themselves and others, and those players tend to be handsomely rewarded.  The only veterans who averaged 5+ assists and made under $20m last season were; Schroder, Lonzo Ball, TJ McConnell, Ricky Rubio, and Dejounte Murray.  &gt;I bet he gets something more like Dejounte Murray.  Murray is an even worse shooter than Schroder, and had nothing remotely resembling Schroder's resume when he signed that contract.  Murray is not even a comparable.  At the time Murray signed that deal, his career high was 8.1 ppg.  And he still got 4 x $16m."
"As a Ricky Rubio fan, it would be the ultimate pain.  As someone who likes both teams, it'd be a great series to watch."
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
"Someone posted a video above if you want to look at it that way, but I don't think most teams would try to build their defense specifically to stop Ben Simmons from scoring and the Jazz won that game easily. It'd be like Westbrook deciding to sell out to shut down Ricky Rubio a few years ago. I mean yeah he got his points, but the Jazz played the way they needed to in order to win the game. Simmons was also the Sixers best defender in the lineup that night and the [Sixers let the Jazz post a 132.7 ORTG compared to Philly's 121.8](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202102150UTA.html). That's not good for either team but I can't see how that would be a worse indictment of Rudy's defense than Simmons'. Maybe Ben should've used his versatility and guarded Clarkson apparently? Idk.   It was a tough game for Philly without Embiid but given that the Jazz won and we're able to score at will with Ben on the floor I don't see how it would help his argument. I know single game +/- isn't that useful but it's not like Philly even won the minutes when Simmons was on the floor and the game leaders in individual DRTG were Gobert and O'Neale."
Ricky Rubio?
Ricky Rubio died for this
"dude was doing everything he could to win us games but when the best shooters on your team are going 28% and 33% from three and the next best guys are ricky rubio and jae crowder going 30% and 20%, then you're going to get a shit ton of on ball pressure. Alas, he grew through it and is dealing with on ball pressure like a king now."
"He won't. He'll go down as a guy who couldn't win alongside multiple MVP candidates, largely as a consequence of his poor on-ball decision making, lack of off-ball activity, porous defense, and outsize pride. He's the guy who focused on shutting down Ricky Rubio rather than winning a series, who can't shoot but still tries to wins game with jumpers, who won an MVP over a more deserving candidate because people like round numbers. He's the last echo of the low efficiency hero ball era, an arrogant villain, and currently a below average starting point guard."
Ricky Rubio or Steven Adams
ricky rubio to portland otw
Ricky Rubio. Let us not forget the first oasis in our point guard wasteland.
"This is a man who turned Jarrett Culver into Dario and Cam Johnson, found Cam Payne off the scrap heap, maybe probably the best mid level exception signing in Jae Crowder, the corpse of Trevor Ariza into Kelly Oubre, and upgraded Tyler Johnson to Ricky Rubio and then Ricky Rubio to Chris Paul. I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he did his best with TJ Warren. The revisionist history around him has hit as he was coming off a season where he missed the majority of it with a head injury."
Can we get Ricky Rubio some how?
Wonder how Ricky Rubio feels about now? I know he felt hard done by with all that but please CP3 is about 1000 times better than him haha
Ricky Rubio is just a worse Tyus jones who turns the ball over a lot
Maybe Ricky Rubio? He's a pass first PG with decent perimeter defence.
"Love Ricky Rubio, miss him on our roster."
"I want to personally thank Ricky Rubio and George Hill for throwing bullet passes to him over and over in practices to improve his hands.  Still not great, but much better than his first few years in the league."
"USA had all NBA players at the world cup and didn't look that crash hot. With the differences in FIBA and NBA rules, being an NBA player no longer automatically makes you a good contender in world cup and Olympics. Look at Giannis, he was MVP but struggled to average 10 points at the world cup, and Greece had some solid players around him.  Additionally some players that are just alright in the NBA are absolute studs in FIBA, see Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio."
We had the same problem with Ricky Rubio as well.
Ya I’d take my team winning two NBA championships as well. Instead we went with Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn.
"Why not a farewell tour with fellow Spaniard, Ricky Rubio? 👀"
"when?   ""almost a decade"" lmao Love was in Minnesota for 6 years and his best teammate was Ricky Rubio"
"I'm curious then... do you feel that Monty got robbed last year?  The Suns were slated to be a bottom-feeder, and were half a game out of the playoffs in the West. Additionally, we over doubled our win percentage (.232 to .466) with our biggest pickups being Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio. We were slated to be 1-game out of last place in the West and 15-games out of the playoffs, yet we nearly made it in a shortened season despite losing our starting center and constant injuries.  I'm not as over-the-top as the other guy, but it is admittedly frustrating that we **never** seem to get any accolades since Nash left.  *Prediction Source:* [*https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/27426015/nba-preseason-predictions-our-experts-picks-2019-20*](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27426015/nba-preseason-predictions-our-experts-picks-2019-20)"
This completely glosses over the fact that the Sun's went from Ricky Rubio to Chris freaking Paul as the starting PG. I really don't think coaching has that much to do with it.
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
Thought Tyler Ulis would end up one of the top players from the 2016 draft.   Dude was an absolute stud in college and I really thought his pesky defensive play and his insane passing abilities would overcome the fact he was *maybe* 5'8. I thought he could be what people thought Ricky Rubio was gonna be. Just this ungodly pure passer with a BBIQ and passing vision that you rarely see.
"&gt;its not like it takes anything away from Trae  It is literally, specifically, and only stated to take praise away from Trae and give it to Luka. It is the singular reason any of this stuff gets posted.   Every advanced stat has its purpose and I'm aware that on/off is an unbelievably unnuanced stat that gets less accurate the more games it covers, but it seems that if you talk about raw numbers you get ""advanced stats are terrible for Trae"" and if you go advanced stats you get ""Well actually this is a shit stat""  Also just going to kind of ignore the paragraph about you telling me the dynamics of a team I've watched 78 games of this year.   The Hawks roster is better, for sure. What isn't true, or at the very least unknowable, is how well Luka would do with this roster. Saying ""if Luka had Trae's team they'd be top in the east"" is ridiculous but it gets said.  Also Gallo is by no means great. He can provide offense off the bench when he is on but when his shot is off he is almost the worst player on the team because he provides nothing else at this point in his career.   Trae is a dramatic floor raiser and, yes, posts like this are trying to take that away from him. This roster with Ricky Rubio at the starting point is the 11th seed."
At one point the Jazz had Ricky Rubio and Raul Neto as our point guards.    Easily the sexiest PG duo in NBA history.
Haha damn Ricky Rubio getting clowned out of nowhere.
Sexiest PG of all-time? Ricky Rubio. Anyone who says otherwise is a lier.
he is playing at all-time greatest PG level  I would rank him #5 all-time behind Ricky Rubio
"You know that Ricky Rubio isn't retired, right?"
I met Ricky Rubio at a gas station  Super random occurrence
"For the folks contributing to the Schroder slander below, a few points:  * Schroder led the Lakers in A/TO ratio * Schroder had the third-highest offensive rating on the team, behind James and Davis * Among Lakers with 60+ GP, Schroder had the second-highest net rating behind only his most-frequent teammate, Caldwell-Pope * As noted elsewhere, among non-primary ball-handlers in the NBA, only Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two Pacers\* averaged more assists per game than Schroder's 5.8 * Schroder was 26th in the league in APG.  The only veteran among the 25 ahead of him who had a lower salary was TJ McConnell.  In fact, the only other ones even close to Schroder's $16M were Ricky Rubio at $17M and Fred VanVleet at $21M.  If you don't like Schroder's attitude, or off-court behavior, or whatever, then fine.  But if you are going to argue against his play, educate yourself first.  He was a fairly incredible bargain this past season.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Indiana's trio of McConnell, Sabonis, and Brogdon all averaged about 6.5 assists"
Ricky Rubio
"Funny because love beats lowry in every advanced stats and their efficiency isn't much different, at their best   Plus Lowry had Derozren and Jonas Valenciunas where love had ricky Rubio and Nikola pekovic world of differenc there as far as best teammates go.   And his team won 40 games in the west with all his teammates except Ricky Rubio missing significant time    Love was the better player,  compare Lowry 2015-2018 to love 2015-2018 where the cavs were undeniably better than the raptors and love was a 3rd option than its close and they are comparable    Kevin love 2015-2018 averaged 17.1 ppg 10 rpg 2.1 apg. 433 fg% .377 3p% .842 ft% .573 ts% .169 ws/48 3.4 BPM 10.5 VORP   Lowry 2015-2018 averaged 19.3 ppg 5 rpg 6.7 apg. 432 fg% .387 3p% .820 ft% .580 ts% .187 ws/48 5.1 BPM 17.9 VORP   Longetivety sure but for all that longetivety he is still less accomplished as a player"
"Man, I still think Tyler Ulis could have made it in the NBA if he'd been in a better position. Guy was a great defender for his size, and he knew how to run an offense at a high level. Just couldn't really score and his teammates at the time were absolute ass. I could have seen him in a Ricky Rubio type role if things had turned out better."
Ricky Rubio was a pro at 14.
"maintaining the same ratio other PGs do at lower volumes isnt impressive and all three of the guy you mentioned are around the top in the league in turnovers themself. Chris paul, Ricky rubio, FVV, Mike conley...those guys are elite playmakers and they crush westbrook in ast/to.  i would also caution against any metric that suggests demar derozan is one of the best passers in the nba. hes really good but i think situation counts for a lot on both cases. westbrook has a ton of weapons at his disposal."
"I wonder what deal makes sense for Rubio to the lakers.    I love Ricky.  Ant loves Ricky.  I don’t want to trade Rubio, but I can add.   And if we’re trading for John Collins or someone like that, we need Rubio’s salary to make it work.   The Lakers are a great fit for him."
Would you like 1 Ricky Rubio
"If you pay the young guys and keep a solid bench, do you thinks someone like a Ricky Rubio could be a solid cheaper PG option?"
"&gt;I’m saying Luka is better than Ricky Rubio  This is all that ever needed to be said. Luka has always been much better at basketball than Rubio. That's the difference. Luka is a ball handler but he's more of a point forward. The size difference is irrelevant because they are essentially playing different positons.  &gt;And if you’re honestly about to suggest that size isn’t an advantage in basketball then you’re obviously not having this discussion in good faith.  Never said that. Rubio is also fucking 6'4. It's not like he's even a short point guard, but you basically compared Westbrooks size to Lebron to try and make an argument. It's pointless."
"We were talking about being able to predict Luka’s ascendance to near HoF levels, and there are three factors that we’ve been talking about: his age, his size, and his accolades in Europe. The dude brought up Ricky Rubio as the closest analogue to Luka because of his age when he was playing well in Europe, and I pointed out that Luka is 4 inches taller and 40 pounds heavier than Rubio.  I’m not saying Luka is Jesus, I’m not saying Russ or Steph or DRose aren’t good, and I’m definitely not saying shorter guys can’t go to the HoF.   I’m saying Luka is better than Ricky Rubio, and he also happens to be much bigger. I’m just stating facts.   And if you’re honestly about to suggest that size isn’t an advantage in basketball then you’re obviously not having this discussion in good faith."
I would start Ricky Rubio over Dennis. Literally just because. Even Rudy at PG &gt; Dennis
Ricky Rubio isn’t 6’7” and 230 lbs either
And there’s Ricky Rubio in with the tackle!
"&gt;Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  I will say that Ainge has been pretty obsessed with chasing a super star PG the last few years.  He stood pat on all the disgruntled super stars then committed the last Nets pick to get Kyrie.  When that didn't work out, his big money signing was Kemba.  Now, I know PG is important, just look at the different CP3 made for OKC last year and the Suns this year.   But feels like he could have made safer bets here, Kyrie being a shoot-first PG was always an odd fit to me.  Kemba I guess is more unlucky that his injuries keep piling up (he was pretty durable in Charlotte I believe).  Super star point guards are hard to find, even the Lakers and Clippers are/were title contenders without all-star caliber options.  So maybe Ainge is justified for his obsession.  But it didn't pan out."
&gt; Been visiting sometimes the wolves sub and almost all opinions about rubio were bad.  Wolves fans have always had a love-hate view when Ricky was around. Then hated he was gone (mostly).  I like Ricky a lot - he didn't shoot well and for a while was really in the tank mentally (a big part of that was the prior coach) - but he was arguably the most legit coach on the team until Ryan was fired.
For one Caris LeVert you can have Ricky Rubio!
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
A point guard that can't shoot doesn't help you in the playoffs. It gets magnified. I had to tell this so many times to Suns fans who wanted to keep Ricky Rubio.
Tall Ricky Rubio
Bimbo Coles  BJ Armstrong   Ricky Rubio  Elfrid Payton  Rusty LaRue
I don’t want to hear Marv see trae do something and say “what a great play from Ricky Rubio”. Man is too old to be doin this
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Jahlil Okafor  C: Enes Kanter
"I was going to say CJ, but looking at his stats, CJ has done much better. So I'd say closer to a ricky rubio or something."
So far we've had everything from Ricky Rubio to Buddy Hield. Guess I'll chip in with Javale McGee.
Ricky Rubio? He doesnt have a ring though
"We've got some great connections. Crowder's return to Vivint, we've both had and given up Ricky Rubio, both teams have a backcourt made up of a steady veteran presence and a score-first first option, and top two seeds in the regular season (briefly swapped that first seed)."
"Tony Parker and Ricky Rubio improved their 3, though Jason Kidd is the first one that comes to mind. Not a guard, but Kawhi wasn't a good three point shooter early on his career."
"Kidd is the gold standard. Other examples include:  Rajon Rondo, Ricky Rubio, Jason Williams and Derrick Rose"
No.  They should’ve done the PG trade &amp; tried to trade for Ricky Rubio.  Playmaking &amp; defense all in one.  If Rondo keeps performing he will fit that role tho.  Rubio is a better defender tho.
"Yeah, people acted like it was some blowout, because they're filthy casuals. That was with that meme-worthy 'guard Harden from behind' defense that everyone clowned on. It actually fucking worked for the majority of the series, insanely.  Houston completely controlled the series, don't get me wrong, but Utah shot like 20% on a fuckton of wide open threes. Jae Crowder, Ricky Rubio, Royce O'Neale, and even Ingles and Mitchell were essentially ice cold.   Hence the last couple years of Utah moves. All offensive based, Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, and adjusting to building even more of the defensive scheme around what Rudy brings to the table.   But Rudy was never played out of a series. It's not like Clint Capela was pulling him out of the paint, or like Harden was constantly getting Rudy on a switch. Wasn't happening like that."
We did add Ricky Rubio to that deal for what it was worth.
Lonzo's probably way too expensive since he's gonna be a RFA but Ricky Rubio would be a good alternative and probably cheaper
the 08 team almost went down to 17 year-old Ricky Rubio...
Is it really worse than trapping Ricky Rubio out of PNR one year but not doing it with Dame the year after tho ?
"Would you rather have Ricky Rubio or Bradley Beal and KD? An elite playmaker that isn’t an elite scorer isn’t as useful as an elite scorer that isn’t an elite playmaker, especially not two of them."
Ricky Rubio
"I don't really get it either. It's not like he's good enough to warrant that much hate. It's like attacking Ricky Rubio, what's the point?"
So what about him being cooked by Ricky Rubio?
Ricky rubio could be a good playmaker for them? What about Mike conley
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
so elite losing to a rookie and offensive phenom Ricky Rubio in 2018
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"
Yeah but Westbrook got into the weirdest pissing contest with Ricky Rubio of all people and got in his own head too.
His high basketball IQ combined with his inability to shoot basically turned him into Ricky Rubio haha  Wasn't pretty but we still were better with him on the floor than off the floor
Basically a rich man‘s Ricky Rubio now haha
"“russ got outplayed by ricky rubio!!!!!”  “he definitely didn’t, russ was better in every part of the game”  “well, rubio wasnt supposed to be as good!!”"
People thought I was crazy for betting Spain at +1600 to win the Fiba world cup until Ricky Rubio led me to the promised land lol
Leading scorer Ricky Rubio… other teams take note
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
"I mean yeah and they’re pretty comparable…   From 2015-19 you guys didn’t have stars but you guys did have solid pieces at various times, including ayton(still developing was pretty good last year), TJ warren who could give you about 18-20 a night, Kelly oubre gave you 18 a night. Also had Ricky Rubio last year who is by no means a star, but very capable of running an offense and certainly better than any backup luka’s ever had on the mavs.   The only player that compares that luka has is kristaps and well, we all know how far he’s fallen and in the 2 playoff series luka has played, kristaps has sat out 1, and played like a literal g leaguer in the other.  Wouldn’t say it’s all the unrealistic to compare the 2 rosters."
Ricky Rubio on a contender  Ben Simmons in Minny  Indiana moving off one of their bigs  Sacramento trading Harrison Barnes
Ricky Rubio the ex-mvp with the nice airball
Ricky Rubio should be enough.
"""sharpshooter Ricky Rubio"" 3 words that don't belong together."
Ricky Rubio is cookin dame
Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio in FIBA are like a Steph and Klay backcourt
I love Ricky Rubio. Has had a great NBA career. Total professional.
They need to get Ricky Rubio back for this to work
Suns in 4 if Ricky Rubio out there tonight
Should’ve kept Ricky Rubio at this rate
Crowder goes from Klay Thompson to Ricky Rubio in one quarter.
Ricky Rubio and Johnny Flynn over Steph Curry :(
"There are lots of Spurs defending the decision but TEAM USA is still lacking a playmaker and We already have Lavine, Booker, Jrue, and Middleton.  Meanwhile, the only half-way elite passer is Draymond Green.   There's also a lack of speed on the defense which Fox would have helped on.  As far as working together, the entire team has barely played together and on the other hand, its not like johnson is going to play right away anyways or whomever would have filled the spot.  Then you add McGee who hasn't played with the team so its like fill a need here and we will just add johnson there.  To make it worse, Luka Doncic for Slovenia and Spain who has Ricky Rubio.  All I have to say, I hope we win Gold."
"But they kept him because they didn't feel like the return was enough and you think we're gonna just get Ricky Rubio back  Trading Kyle made a lot more sense in a down year on an expiring deal vs re-signing him to see if this team is actually bad or if last session was an outlier  If we're good with Kyle then we go back to what we were doing pre-pandemic, if we're still bad then trade him at the deadline to a contender for more than Ricky mf Rubio (who I love but not for Kyle lol)"
It's Ricky Rubio time
"You're not gonna find a day 1 playoff level playmaker in the draft, even Cade is gonna have some down nights because he can't turn the corner reliably against NBA level guys and NBA game speed always takes adjustment. You need a guy with more league experience to fill that specific hole meanwhile you can draft good shooters and they have a better track record impacting teams day 1  I'd be crossing my fingers the Knicks FO could outbid Sexton's dirt cheap offers. Despite the hit pieces Kevin Love gave anonymous quotes for, Sexton had a good assist rate for a guard this past year. Not quite floor general level, but he's at the very least in that John Wall/Derrick Rose slash and kick mold. That or Ricky Rubio would be a good Thibs PG too."
Send Ben to Houston for Gordon and Wall. Then send Harris to Minnesota for Beasley and Rubio. The Rockets can take Ricky.
"people forget that '08 final if it was for Kobe Bryant they lose that game, ricky rubio was cooking with grease"
"When it comes to fit with the Suns roster, Ben Simmons isn’t Ricky Rubio, much less Chris Paul."
"Simmons is also not really the right personality for Philly. He is kind of passive and more of a shoulder shrug type guy that just is gonna keep pissing off the Philly fans. The trade is strange because Simmons is losing trade value for Philly because there is no way to convince the fans that just running it back is gonna be a good idea after the way they went out in the playoffs, but at the same time Simmons received an MVP vote last year so you can't just let him go just to shake it up. Simmons probably NEEDS to leave but the Sixers probably aren't getting equal value back unless it is multiple trades.   Here is the trade idea I have seen kicked around the Wolves sub.   Raptors-Wolves-Sixers.  Raptors get Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio  Wolves get Simmons and Baynes.   Sixers get Malik Beasley, Kyle Lowry and 2 Wolves 1sts.   Raptors do it to get the veteran leader in Rubio to come in and hopefully mentor Suggs (Mitchell and Edwards have both raved about how good Rubio is at helping them get up to NBA speed), also as an expiring they can restock next year they can possibly flip him. They get a super team friendly contract in Naz who has shown flashes and they get to not play Baynes anymore. Giving up Lowry is just a S+T so the cost to them is minimal to be part of the trade.   Wolves get their guy in Simmons, take on the Baynes contract and maybe he can show better here than he did in his disaster season in Tampa.   Sixers get a real PG that they can trust to take big shots and they get a knockdown shooter to help create space for Embiid. Curry doesn't need to be the only threat beyond the arc if they add Beasley. The 2 1st can be packaged together with some of the Sixers other assets or picks if they decide they need to make another run at a star like Beal."
Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio are both prime Magic Johnson with Australia and Spain respectively lmao
"Kelly Oubre, a good starting wing. Ricky Rubio, a decent starting my PG. Ty Jerome, a decent young bench PG, Jalen Lecque a prospect with decent defensive upside and a 2022 first round pick which at the time was a projected lottery pick.   That’s a pretty decent haul. A Deal centered around Maxey and Thybulle isn’t better. Now it might be crippling for you considering a deal would involve putting Green in to match salary and having very little if any SG depth, but to say their value is higher than that Kelly, Ty, Jalen and a projected lottery pick is not true. It’s ridiculous to imply so.   CP3s deal is marginally better, just like how CP3 is marginally better than Lowry. But value is subjective so you’re free to think whatever you want."
"Since Siakam seems to be on the table for the right deal, how would this look for all involved?   Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Malik Beasley  Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Ricky Rubio  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Some number of Sixers 1sts (1-4). Maybe two of them?   Sixers get a star wing who can score plus a microwave 20ppg scoring guard.   Timberwolves turn their backup guards and a young prospect into Ben Simmons, who fills all the holes in their starting lineup. DLo/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a damn solid core.   Raptors flip Pascal for a haul - a great prospect (McDaniels), two good prospects Thybulle, Maxey), a veteran PG who can replace Lowry or come off the bench (Rubio), and some pick(s) from the Sixers."
True but he’s also elite at defense. More comparable would be who is more valuable Klay Thompson or Ben Simmons.   Or maybe Ricky Rubio vs Duncan Robinson.
"We dont need to do that because he has a team option. If we decline Baynes option and Hoods 11 million cause they are both horrible we have about 20 million in cap space and that includes Gary Trent Jrs cap hold, im not wasting that 20 million on Ricky Rubio just for a late ass pick"
"Cam Johnson  In all seriousness though Dr. J, his rock the cradle dunk and behind the backboard layup made a big impression on me as a kid.  In modern times - shoutout to Ricky Rubio and his behind the back dribble move in transition."
"Sorry Nuggs bros, but I would be fielding all calls asking about Murray. A super dynamic guard on a max deal, tearing up his knee at age 23? Sorry, it's a business move.  Hundreds of promising young guards have been taken out of the league like that. I would downgrade Jamal from perennial all star to... Ricky Rubio at this point. I think the injury is that serious and will likely lead to more knee injuries down the road. That's a lot of risk for a max player when you are in a championship window."
"*After a key of cocaine, Elton leaned over to Gerrson and softly whispered ""I want you right here, right now."" Gerron slowly undressed, caressed Elton's throbbing manhood, and inserted it into his mouth. Elton then turned Rosas over on his stomach, and proceeded to roughly penetrate Gerrson's anus. After a minute, they both screamed and climaxed.*  *The next morning Ben Simmons was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ricky Rubio, Malik Beasley, and 3 first round picks, with a pick swap.*  --END CREDITS--"
Ricky Rubio
"Is there a three way trade to be had between the Wolves, Sixers, and Pacers where they all come out on top?  How's this for a three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcom Brogdon  * Malik Beasley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Pacers get:   * Ricky Rubio  * Tyrese Maxey  * Jarrett Culver  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts   Brogdon moves into the Sixers starting lineup as a hyper-efficient 20ppg point guard. Beasley gives microwave scoring off the bench, averaging 20ppg himself last season. Sixers offense gets superpowered by moving on from Simmons and giving up one of their three promising guard prospects to win now.   Timberwolves move their expensive backup guards, a bust that needs a change of scenery, and picks that probably won't be in the lottery for Ben Simmons, who slots right into their offense. DLo/Ant/Ben/McDaniels/KAT is sp00ky for real. Again on the picks - they don't need any more young prospects, so moving a few picks for better players, now, is a likely and sensible move.   Pacers move on from Brogdon to try to build for the future while continuing to make the playoffs, which is their MO. They get Rubio, who can start in Brogdon's slot. They get Maxey, a promising guard prospect. They get Culver, who's really just filler but is still only 22yo and could be a reclamation project. And they get two 1st round picks that, who knows, could still be pretty good picks, knowing the Wolves."

He could start but why start him ?  You could start Ricky Rubio too but you wont be a winner.  Just because someone could be a starter doesnt mean you should start them.  You have to earn that starter role with consistent play that elevates your teammates and Bledsoe keeps UN-earning it with his performances.  He just doesnt work hard enough or seem to care to work hard enough to be a top starter in the league.
"Ricky Rubio has mentioned this line repeatedly while with the Timberwolves this year. He had fully bought into Monty's coaching, and it was very difficult for him to be traded away from there."
"He wanted to go to the Bucks when he first go to OKC but they didn't make a move for him so we do know CP3 would have been happy to play for the Bucks.   Did you see what PHX gave up for CP3 compared to what the Bucks gave up for Jrue?   Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque and a FRP  Bledsoe, Hill, 3 FRPs, 2 pick swaps for Jrue Holiday   Bucks could have got CP3 if they wanted. That's damn near a Harden package they gave up for Jrue Holiday."
"I think he's going to get a contract similiar to Terry Rozier / Ricky Rubio, 18-22m/yr range"
"I know the Ben Simmons rumours have been non-stop, but what do you think a fair trade package would be?  I reckon Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Ricky Rubio, 2022 2nd (via either 76ers or Nuggets) and 2023 lottery protected 1st would be more than reasonable. Philly get their pass first point guard, a scoring wing and a combo of prospects and picks.  Starting line-up of Towns, Simmons, Okogie/Culver, Edwards and Russell is pretty decent and a low seed playoff squad for sure."
Forgot Ricky Rubio
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"I don't think you get Chris Paul for Eric Bledsoe, George Hill and a single first round protected pick. Bledsoe is on a long, expensive contract and I don't think F.O's saw him as a positive asset; I don't know what the contracts were like for Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio but it looks like Thunder managed to get more picks out of them, whereas Pelicans are going to have to pay to offload Bledsoe.  The Harden trade changes the landscape of the East - Bucks got lucky with injuries to get through that round, but with that big three a four year window is much more appealing than a shorter one."
"Ayton arguably looked better last year on offense with Ricky Rubio, who played with Gobert too."
"2009, wolves had 2 high t10 picks and knew we needed a point guard. 3 clear top point guards in the draft. We ended up drafted both johnny flynn and ricky rubio over the 3rd option steph curry lmao. Could imagine how it might be different with him."
"As much as I like the idea of seeing the Celtics get paired with a table-setting point guard, I have no idea of a practical example that seems like a viable option.  I've always been a Ricky Rubio stan, but he makes too much money to be easily traded for by a lot of teams.   Who else does that seriously leave?"
Ricky Rubio is forever a Jazzman
Shoutout to Ricky Rubio. Was crucial in the Suns making enough noise last year that we attracted CP3 and Jae. Unfortunate that we had to trade him (but it was CP3). Hope he gets to be on a contender soon. He deserves it
"  Lou can effectively be their second point guard. I for one wouldn’t want another point guard eating trae’s minutes and stifle his growth.   If I were to look at a pass first point guard, looking at this weak free agency this off-season, I can only see them potentially signing Devonte graham and tj mcconnell for the MLE; or Jeff Teague for the minimum.   If Ricky Rubio gets waived, I think they should try to sign him."
"I just realized the moment Gasol brothers retire and Ricky Rubio past his prime.. all Spain got left is the Hernangomez brothers leading the pack, maybe hopefully Usman Garuba if he pans out"
"He's a star.  It's hard to believe he's been in the league since 2009 - the same amount of time as Blake Griffin, Ricky Rubio and Harden, DeRozan and Steph.  Man that was a pretty solid draft class.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2009.html"
"As I replied to someone recently : Ricky Rubio was super hyped and  didn't live up to it. Yet, he's been a very reliable player for more than ten years.   He might be the only on of the top ten in his draft class still in the nba that has not been an all-star. He could've been picked first in a bad draft class and it would've been fine."
i was really rooting for Spain that one year. it was unfortunate Ricky Rubio got injured that year. literally messed up his career development too. he was starting to develop a shot
"this coming season I think will be a transition &amp; evaluation year.  It's a sink or swim year for so many of the Celtics pieces (Timelord, Langford, Grant Williams, Smart) that the team needs to see where those guys are and showcase them to try &amp; increase their trade value if nothing else.  What they can get on the court from Pritchard &amp; Nesmith in year 2 will also have a huge impact on the future, those guys need reps next season (and hopefully a summer league &amp; full training camp this offseason).  I could see the Celtics making a move around the periphery to move Tristan Thompson for some veteran PG depth to go with Smart (maybe Ricky Rubio or someone like that on an expiring), but nothing major.  I wouldn't be in a hurry to throw lots of money at Fournier, he's a fine player but I'd much rather preserve flexibility for next summer if at all possible."
Minny gets 24 year old 6’9 light skin Rubio for the price of Ricky Rubio?
Three team trade: Minnesota/Toronto/Philly  Minnesota receives Ben Simmons Toronto receives Ricky Rubio and 2020 first rounder Leandro Bolmaro and perhaps a future first  Philly receives Kyle Lowry and picks/filler.  Obviously trade needs to balance with other players added for salary matching reasons but Philly gets local boy with championship pedigree who is win now and fits with Embiid. Toronto get Ricky on an expiring who they can flip again and a top Argentinian who played for Barcelona last season and should fit into the Raptors international roster. Minnesota can put Simmons together with KAT and have Coach Finch make music between them. You still have Dlo in the back court and Ant-man scoring all over the place.
Ricky Rubio is a far more talented shooter than Ben Simmons.
"&gt;	He’s gonna be really good again.   Yeah, in regular season.           &gt;	Either his offense needs to change (unlikely) or the team offense needs to be re-tooled to work around a non-shooting PG, a la Ricky Rubio.  How many winning teams have Rubio been part of? And Ricky is still a better shooter than Ben.         Ben had 3 great outside shooter and 1 superstar center next to him. That’s the best you can ask for as a non-shooting PG.          Maybe Ben can work as a small ball center/PF in playoffs, but I don’t see many ways to utilize him better as a PG with his current skillset."
"Ben is at an all-time low right now, but, to act like he's ""done"" is kinda silly.  He's gonna be really good again.  Either his offense needs to change (unlikely) or the team offense needs to be re-tooled to work around a non-shooting PG, a la Ricky Rubio."
"3/4/7.  He’s too unathletic to score and rebound in today’s game, which would obviously hurt his playmaking. He’d be like Ricky Rubio with worse defense"
Rajon Rondo  DeMar DeRozan  James Johnson  Kyle Kuzma  Clint Capela  Ricky Rubio  Bradley Beal  Bojan Bogdanovic  Al-Farouq Aminu  Kosta Koufos  Jarrett Jack  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Kyle Korver  Gerald Green  Markieff Morris  Marcus Morris  Bismack Biyombo  Tristan Thompson
Ben Simmons is just a taller Ricky Rubio... and brogdon and a first is as good as its gonna get for them.
"Minnesota gets: Ben Simmons    Philly gets: Kyle Lowry, Malik Beasley, Ricky Rubio, Minnesota 1st   Toronto gets: Minnesota 1st     lets do it"
"They're not even close, CP3 is a superior scorer and a much better athlete that changes his entire game compared to Stockton  Ricky Rubio is Stocktons comparision, pure pass first, good from the line but bad from the field at scoring, good at getting steals (i'm not saying as good but in terms of style)"
Ricky Rubio hype been there since he was 15
"I don't understand why fans love Ricky Rubio so much...  And tanking teams need to stop with the ""timeline"" stuff... odds are your franchise will only have 3 or less years of true contention this decade. Need to strike"
"Whats with all these hindsight posts, 2 years ago Suns fans clowned the suggestion that CP3 would be an upgrade on Ricky Rubio. Y'all just have the power of hindsight now, this sub isn't any better.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cdhux3/if_hes_still_available_at_the_deadline_and_hes/"
One Ricky Rubio for them!
"Just a recap on CP3 recent past.  - Got traded for Russell Westbrook to OKC and Housto(!!!) sent also 4 picks to OKC (lol).  - Got traded to the Suns for Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and a 1st rounder (lol x2).   It is the classical evaluation of your average guy who dropped 40 in a WCF game...   When Lebron last year title speech talked about 'put the damn respect' he really didn't know what he was talking about. CP3 went through a true pile of shit along his path. He need his damn respect now. Whatever happens in the finals. He was treated like shit last two years and evaluated like an untradeable asset. Shame on 2 organisations who passed on him"
Ricky Rubio died for this :'(
after 8-8 people were saying we should have kept Ricky Rubio...
Ricky Rubio Deserves a Ton of Love for what happened tonight! None of this is possible without him. Not just because he was in the trade. But he was the first veteran PG to help stabilize and teach the young guys last season through the bubble
Ricky Rubio in Phoenix.
"Sexton’s absolutely been improving as a playmaker. Over the regular season, he averaged as many potential assists per game (9.2) as Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic. Over the last fifteen games, he averaged the same number (11.5) as Ricky Rubio and Malcolm Brogdon did this season."
"Ricky Rubio is trash. Not controversial anymore, but in the early 2010s in Minneapolis it was very controversial"
I think Ricky Rubio is one of the most exciting players and is underrated as a PG
Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio too maybe?
Ricky Rubio was going to be better than Chris Paul. All of the Rubio hype was stupid and predictable.
do you think he improved or do you think he went from playing with ricky rubio as his pg to steph curry lol
"&gt; They just need a pass first point guard  I've seen this parroted a lot, but I really don't think this is true, especially after watching the Clippers who run so much of their offense through their wings and the breakout guy for them in the playoffs is a score first guard in Reggie Jackson.   The Jays have to get better at making plays, yes, but we don't need a Ricky Rubio type on this team, we need more 3-point shooting."
"&gt; if this team even had Ricky Rubio to grease the wheels, they'd have been way better off  Rubio on a team with Smart, Brown and Tatum could be a really good fit, actually."
"I think the implosion was in large part situational, as in I think both pressure on Ben Simmons from the Philly side and the Hawks being an unusually bad match-up for Simmons made him look worse than he is. The Sixers were a shot away from winning game 1, an injury (albeit to Embiid) away from winning game 5, and a few free throws away (albeit from Ben Simmons) from winning game 3 (I think I got the number right), and if we imagine them coming up against the Bucks, but particularly the Nets, who despite injuries to Kyrie Irving and James Harden were an inch of KD's toes away from winning game 7, Simmons would have been absolutely indispensable to the Sixers' chances in the Conference Finals. His value would be very clear in a series against either KD or Giannis.  Also, in Philly, he was often the second scoring option, basically unless Seth Curry was hot. Minnesota has what he lacks (KAT for shooting from a big, DLo for a playmaker who has the threat of just pulling up) and he has what Minnesota lacks, a good secondary ball-handler, good defense to cover for KAT or DLo depending on opposition, and good passing out of the interior. If you could get him for Ricky Rubio and some young guards/wings that already sit behind Anthony Edwards and Dlo and would sit behind Simmons too if they stayed, doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world.  But I'm a Knicks fan. I'm the kind of person who thought it was realistic that KD, Kawhi, and Demarcus Cousins were coming in 2019. So what do I know lol."
"He's not great, but a 30% shooter is at least serviceable. The real difference is like you said: Ricky Rubio isn't a 6'10 monster who can guard the 4 and 5 positions."
This would be Ricky Rubio X 100
"Wonder if they could pull off a 3-way trade with Toronto &amp; Philly. Something like:   - Wolves get: Simmons / George Hill (for cap purposes), 76ers 2021 1st #28  - 76ers get: Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), Malik Beasley, Best of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks.   - Toronto gets: Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, Worst of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks."
"honestly though they didn't have playmakers, so it's Brad's current job more than his last job. Kemba being the best playmaker on the team when he's always been an undersized 2 playing the 1, is not good roster construction. if this team even had Ricky Rubio to grease the wheels, they'd have been way better off."
Ricky Rubio to the Celtics confirmed
"#Perfect offseason  Tatum recruits Bradley Beal during the olympics, he requests a trade to Boston and we trade Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, and a decade of picks and swaps for him  #Realistic offseason   Re-sign Fournier to a 3 year deal around 40-45m   Trade for a good starting PG like Derrick White or Ricky Rubio  Agree to a cheap extension for Timelord"
"&gt;Yeah they took it on in exchange for another bad contract.   So follow my logic here....they use Kuzma's contract like they did Ricky Rubio, Danny Green, and Kelly Oubre to facilitate another deal which nets them more future value along with possibly a worse contract"
Ricky Rubio
"And the second time they lost to the Rockets in 2019 their best player in the series was Ricky Rubio lol. Houston was obviously the better team but the Jazz just didn't show up, especially Don."
"PG, JWill, Dominique, Yao Ming, Ray Allen, KG, Ricky Rubio, Steph and Seth (duh), and many more I can't think instantly."
"A lot of analysts point to Chris Paul and the bubble suns as the turning point, but real Suns fans acknowledge the arrival of Kelly Oubre and the valley boys identity he brought, along with Ricky Rubio, as the point where things started turning around."
"FIBA WORLD CUP MVP, Ricky Rubio—you mean."
"I genuinely don't understand it, with some players they just absolutely refuse to call some stuff they blatantly do that's against the rules even when it becomes a meme, and eventually the referee twitter and last-2-minute report starts even acknowledging that it's a violation...and *they still won't call it*.  It happened with Harden too, he kept taking extra steps and the refs and other people would wave it off and say it was alright, then finally he took like 4 steps against Ricky Rubio, nobody called s\*\*t, and the referee twitter account said, yeah, he traveled.  Then CALL IT. It's not hard to see this stuff, what the heck is wrong wtih them? Are they embarrassed to admit that they've been letting this go that long?"
Minnesota has his own Simmons in Ricky Rubio..
Just Google Ricky Rubio unhappy.  There's stories every year.
Last seasons Suns with Ricky Rubio
"yeah because Chris Paul and Clint Capela make comparable amounts of money  the rockets last year would've literally had no use for ricky rubio, ty jerome, kelly oubre or jalen leque so i dont see where they get capela in all this  i just dont get how you think Luka and Capela is better than CP3 and Ayton, especially when you dont have to worry about the biggest problem with Luka and Booker - who's the first option? Luka is a ball dominant guard, Book's a ball dominant guard - just seems silly to me, especially when Ayton is as good as he is at such a young age  Capela grabbing boards isn't enough to anchor a championship-level defense, and neither is two ball-dominant superstars - basketball teams arent JUST about being good at scoring, they need to be versatile and having CP3, Ayton and Booker makes the Suns a more versatile team than if they had Luka, Booker and Capela"
"2009 got to be the worst; James Harden, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday and even Jeff Teague (had an all-star appearance!) and the only one he went for was Ricky Rubio."
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
"I'd say that's creation. For example, KD isn't a great playmaker, but his scoring gravity allows him to create a bunch of opportunities for him to exploit. Meanwhile, Ricky Rubio is a great playmaker, but his lack of scoring means he creates less opportunities and has less routes for his playmaking to go."
ricky rubio - vision
"So, you're saying that (using the 2001 team as an example) Wally Szczerbiak, pre-Detroit Chauncey Billups, and Rasho Nesterovic are 27 games better than D'Angelo Russell, Ricky Rubio, and Malik Beasley?  Come on."
"&gt;Yeah but only one of those players the offense runs around is an MVP who's won heavily in the both the regular season and the playoffs.   One of the players didn't play most of the season with Josh Okogie,Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez as his shooters."
Ricky Rubio and Johnny Flynn
Derrick Rose didn’t have a problem with KAT. Robert Covington didn’t have a problem with KAT. Taj Gibson didn’t have a problem with KAT. Ricky Rubio never had a problem with KAT. Literally no one ever had a problem with KAT but Butler yet somehow KAT is the one to blame for running people off his team. Gotcha. Great argument.
I love how now Ben Simmons isn’t even better than fucking Ricky Rubio  Some of the Ben slander is just hilarious
Draft Steph Curry instead of John Flynn/Ricky Rubio.
"&gt;It is documented that they had significant interest in him  Yet they declined to sign him as an unrestricted free agent, apparently feeling that his salary demands were excessive.  &gt;Slightly worse compared to this team? Until the bubble the Suns had a terrible record with Ayton.   Again, you are going to want to read.  And you cannot just discount the bubble entirely.  Phoenix won 14 of their last 21 games with Ricky Rubio running the point, and his numbers were not that far off Paul's -- 13/9 vs 16/9 -- despite missing Ayton for some of those games.  They also started the season 7-4 despite only one game from Ayton.  &gt;The suspension Ayton faced was early in the season and was short.  25 games in a 71 game season is not short.  &gt;The Heat’s offence was better in 2019-20, as they should, considering that 7 of our top 8 offensive players missed 112 combined games during a 72 game season.  A minute ago, a player missing 25 games was no big deal.  Now your 8th-best offensive player missing \~15 is?  Pick one.  &gt;I mean I’m assuming you watched the series? The top backup point guard in Brunson shat the bed that series, as well as most of his supporting cast.  Yes, I did.  How so, exactly?  Other than having his minutes slashed by 40% from the regular season, that is.  Brunson's TS% was only a little bit lower than Doncic's in that series ( and Porzingis' equaled Doncic's ). and his assist/TO ratio was superior.  The fact of the matter is that Carlisle chose to go all-in on an all-Luka-all-the-time strategy.  Whether or not that was the optimal strategy is debatable, but it did not work.  &gt;New Orleans literally had up to $36 million in cap room if they didn’t re-sign Ball or Hart.  Not sure what point you are attempting here.  If they were considering keeping Ball or Hart a priority over signing Lowry, I'm sure that's evidence that they didn't value Lowry nearly as much as you do -- and pretty much agree with my opinion here."
"He’s not. But the idea of Lowry being that type of player for these teams is what made teams willing to have him on the team despite his contractual demands. It is documented that they had significant interest in him until Miami got the pieces trade for him.   &gt;The Suns were only slightly worse with Ricky Rubio, when Ayton was available.   Slightly worse compared to this team? Until the bubble the Suns had a terrible record *with* Ayton. The suspension Ayton faced was early in the season and was short. Even after the bubble their success doesn’t compare to the success of the Suns after they landed CP3.   The Heat’s offence was better in 2019-20, as they should, considering that 7 of our top 8 offensive players missed 112 combined games during a 72 game season. The Heat’s offence was worse in 2020-21.   I mean I’m assuming you watched the series? The top **backup** point guard in Brunson shat the bed that series, as well as most of his supporting cast. He did dominate the ball because he can, he did it because his other ball-handlers weren’t reliable.   New Orleans literally had up to $36 million in cap room if they didn’t re-sign Ball or Hart."
I'd go td but I'm biased towards the spurs and td in general due to there live of 2 way players who weren't selvish with the ball.  But the goat to me is Ricky rubio praise be the sexy Spanish slingshot getting all the great passes haha
Zion vs Ricky Rubio
I miss baby faced Ricky Rubio
"This is a great summary of two ways someone can be a good playmaker.   I think the first type, a reactive passer, is someone who has a great BBIQ and knows their offense and the other teams defense down to a T. Usually great players can become a reactive passer.   Whereas the second type is someone who has exceptional awareness, which is a bit different from just BBIQ. An example of this is guys like Ricky Rubio and Jason Williams. They can make really amazing plays, but don’t always necessarily make the right play."
\*finger combs long hair a la Ricky Rubio
"&gt;The success of adding CP3 to Phoenix,  Lowry is not, and never has been, Chris Paul.  The Suns were only slightly worse with Ricky Rubio, when Ayton was available.  &gt;the Heat’s offence looking awful against the Bucks,  Looked a damn sight better than Toronto's over the past two seasons.  Would've looked even better if Butler could have hit water from a boat.  &gt;Luka Doncic having historical usage-rates in the postseason because THJ was the only other player who can consistently create for himself  You are assuming Doncic doesn't just shoot the ball because he can, which is more likely the case.  By the way, Dallas had one of the top backup points in the league in Brunson.  &gt;Pelicans resorting to having Zion essentially play PG for the latter half of his sophomore season catapulted the desire for Lowry to the point where Lowry could ask for more.   New Orleans had room to sign Lowry outright.  They had zero reason to trade for him.    As did Dallas, for that matter.  Really, even I think you can do better than this tripe."
Ricky “Drafted 2 spots ahead of Curry” Rubio
"&gt;  He got a successful operation, that means absolutely nothing about his recovery.  In fact it means a lot, display your ignorance more proudly.  &gt;  And KD came back from just an achilles and he had the greatest comeback of a town achilles ever.  Yes, because he literally had a different operation than Dominique Wilkins or Kobe Bryant.  Medical advances.  &gt;  Klay tore his all and his achilles back to back. The only comparison that we have of that is Boogie and that didn't end pretty.  And instead of trying to rush back too soon...twice...Klay hasn't played since the playoffs in 2019.  &gt;  Draymond was never a scorer sure. But before KD got to the Warriors he had to score for them to win games and that was with Steph, Klay and that killer bench. He averaged 7 points a game last season that's just not going to cut it. Yes he lead the league in assists last year but most of those were assists to Steph.  No, he didn't.  Draymond's highest scoring season at 14 a game was nice, but he slowed scoring on purpose because we didn't need him to.  He's talked about it in interviews.  We would be just fine with Dray scoring under 10 a game if he could shoot 36-37% from 3.  Also, just by virtue of Steph and Klay being on the court, Draymond will get open layups/dunks.  &gt;  You are out of your mind if you think Wiggins was a top 3 wing defender in the league.  So you didn't watch?  That's not an opinion, it's a fact.  He was top 3 in every advanced defensive metric and passed the eye test with flying colors.  This isn't Minnesota Wiggins.  &gt;  And I don't know what you've been smoking dude but Jordan Poole averaged 12 points a game last season on 43% from the field while shooting 35% from 3.  Seriously, do you have trouble reading?  I said for the last third of the season he averaged almost 18.  Not the whole season, the last third.  It's called development, it happens sometimes with young players where they get better over the course of a season.  He also upped his 3 point shooting percentage to almost 40 by the last third.  &gt;  If you think flipping those 3 young dudes for Turner and Rubio makes you a contender you're crazy.  Maybe I should just stop paying attention to your opinions.  &gt;  I also don't think you know how salaries work because there is no way to make any of those deals work without giving up Wiggins. No one makes enough money to match the salaries.  Oh, so you just...don't know anything?  Aside from the fact that there are ways around the salary matching, Myles Turner is making 2.38m a year right now.  We wouldn't have to salary match for that because it's such a small amount above the vet minimum that the rookie contracts would cover it.  Ricky Rubio trade would require a buyout anyway, so the salary matching is irrelevant, he could sign with us for anywhere we can afford above the vet minimum.  Another thing you don't seem to know is that we still have a mid level exception to hand out.  Besides, Rubio and Turner were just examples.  The point is that we need a rim defender and a facilitator off the bench, and we can move resources to get them."
"Klay’s achilles surgery was as successful as KD’s and he’s been just as careful rehabbing.  It will take some time to shake off rust but he’ll be back to form or close.  Draymond was never a scorer, if you didn’t notice, but he was top 5 in assists last year while anchoring our defense.  Wiggins was a top 3 wing defender last season while having his most efficient scoring season ever.  Poole averaged almost 18 a game off the bench for the last third of the season.  It seems you need some reading comprehension skills sharpened as well as not actually knowing what’s going on with our team, because I said I think we have the resources to be a contender.  With Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody and other movable resources we could pick up a real rim defender and a bench facilitator.  If we got, for example, Myles Turner as a starter and Ricky Rubio to run our bench squad, we wouldn’t just be contenders, we’d be favorites."
"In the last few years Minnesota has turned Kevin Love, Zach Lavine, and 4 lottery picks into D-LO, Malik Beasley, ~~Ricky Rubio~~ Taurean Prince, and ~~Jarret Culver~~ Pat Bev."
They're basically going to use him as a Ricky Rubio type this year and see what happens.
"I basically have came with the terms with the fact that they're going to use Marcus Smart as a Ricky Rubio-type this season and they'll just see what happens.  I still love the fit of Rubio on the Celtics but he's making 17M this year and isn't easy to trade for. He's an expiring though, so if the Celtics really want to they can just try to get him for something cheaper next off-season."
Whatever Ricky Rubio makes
"I didn't know that. Ricky Rubio, a true Thunder legend"
"their only other issue is they didn't grow up on the FIBA Rules and Courts like all of the guys outside North America, so they are less likely to have the guys like Patty Mills or Ricky Rubio that hit another level in FIBA competition. Most of the Canadian guys are brought into the AAU Circuit and playing with the American guys from a young age, so in some ways they are ""USA-lite"" with a big population disadvantage (although it only takes 5 on the court, so can't rule them out entirely, if they can get another guy that hits NBA MVP level like Steve Nash back in the day)."
Twolves passed on Curry twice for Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio.
Ricky Rubio if he only watched julian newman highlights for a year
Ricky Rubio
"Easy. LaMelo ball. Over hyped because BALL. Good playmaker , w inconsistent jumper. Hes a Ricky Rubio not magic or Isaiah. Solid not super star"
Ricky Rubio prime&gt; Lonzo Ball/ Mike Conley I might be biased since Rubio is my favorite NBA player of all time but I truly think he's good
I remember reading in the media about Ricky Rubio and how amazing he would be. And he is a great player! But he's not a perennial All-Star like some dudes.
"When Bill Simmons was doing the book of basketball redrafts about a year ago, one of the main things I remembered was him saying that if you replayed his career 20 times this was probably the worst version of Ricky Rubio we got. I can 100% believe that."
Ricky Rubio. I really thought he would be what Luka turned out to be.
"They should've kept Ricky Rubio instead of going with the PG version of Andre Drummond. They'll be out the playoffs unless ANT takes a huge leap, but him and KAT also have to stay healthy. Probably an 8-9th seed at best"
Ricky Rubio
Am I tripping if I can't find a colour pun in Ricky Rubio?
Steal are not a good measure of defense.   Ricky rubio used to be the steal leader for a few years
"KATs career goes a lot more similarly to those 2 guys if he’s tethered to Simmons or Murray instead of Wiggins IMO. Not to mention those FO’s did a significantly better job of building teams around those players, where even when we built a solid team it was built to make KAT into a low post offensive player and drop coverage defensive player, which is fucking insanity. Think he’s going to blow people away this season with his conditioning and having a scheme with a primary focus of maximizing KAT. Also people forget the most threatening offensive guard he’s played consistent minutes with is Ricky Rubio. These games with a healthy Dlo and KAT have looked pretty great so I’m beyond stoked moving forward"
"For me, personally, I don’t care which round it was. I don’t consider the Suns to be a finals caliber team in a normal season.   I’m not sure if you know this but a 5% difference in TS% is huge.   In regards to “significantly worse playmaking”, that’s a pretty big exaggeration i see that’s common with a lot of Bucks fans. Giannis is definitely an above average passer, but he’s nowhere near the Ricky Rubio you guys act like he is. He averaged 5 assists per game in the finals. Kawhi averaged 3.8. Thats not a massive difference. It’s marginally better, but definitely not by a significant amount."
"""Veteran Bigs like Nikola Vucevic, Al Horford, and Serge Ibaka may camp out on the perimeter, but defenses contest their outside shots less than 40 percent of the time. As a comparison, historically shaky three pointers like Russell Westbrook and Ricky Rubio are guarded at around the same rate. """
"Alternatively  'The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ricky Rubio, Cedi Osman, Dylan Windler, Damyean Dotson and their top-29 protected draft picks for 2030/32/34.'"
"I'll start:  **Westbrook's playoff career:**  2011 WCF: Westbrook averages 24 points on 36% shooting, including 20% from    three. In single digit losses in games 4 and 5, he shoots 7/22 and    11/28, leading or tied for his team lead in shots in both games. He also    has 24 turnovers to 24 assists in the series.  2012 Finals: Westbrook takes 16 more shots than Durant but scores 18    fewer points, including shooting 14% from three(TS of 50% to Durant's    65%.) In the closeout game 5, he shoots 4/20.  2014 WCF: Westbrook shoots 8/23 in the closeout game 6, including 4/15    in the 4th quarter and overtime. In the four losses, Westbrook shoots    9/21, 7/24, 8/23, and 6/12. Once AGAIN, he leads the Thunder in shots despite being less efficient than Durant.   2016 WCF: This is obviously also on Durant, but Westbrook's role in the    collapse sort of gets forgotten because of the other storylines at play.    Nevertheless, Westbrook was up to his old tricks again, shooting 11/28,    10/27, and 7/21 in the last three games, all single digit losses. In    game 6, he has four turnovers in the last two minutes and in game 7, he    has 7 turnovers.   2017: Not going to blame this on him, his team sucked  2018: Although playing better at the end of the series, Westbrook gets    outplayed by Ricky Rubio for the first part of the series as the Thunder    dig themselves a 3-1 deficit. The Thunder lose games 2, 3, and 4 as    Westbrook shoots 7/19, 5/17, and 7/18 while playing atrocious defense,    dooming them to the loss. Just like in 2016, his co-star having an awful game 6(this time Paul George) shields Westbrook from criticism.  2019: Westbrook has maybe his worst series yet. The Thunder, despite    being the lower seed, were widely considered slight favorites going into    this series. Once again, Westbrook choked, averaging a 46.6    TS(HORRIBLE) for the series, taking 10 more shots than PG to score 29    FEWER POINTS over 5 games. In game 4 at home, he shoots 5/21 to once    again put the Thunder in a 3-1 hole. Then in game 5, he misses TWENTY    shots which is more than the rest of the team missed COMBINED.  He    misses the last shot, and we all know what happened after that.  2020: I'll give him an excuse here because of COVID/injury, but that    doesn't explain some of the awful BBIQ turnovers(like the one he had in    game 6 vs the Thunder.)  2021: Not really playing for a great team, but the Sixers turned out to    be a paper tiger, meaning there isn't really an excuse for Westbrook    shooting under 40% from the field ONCE AGAIN in a 5 game loss."

"Devin Booker with an average starting PG(say, last year's Ricky Rubio) would have undisputably made the playoffs. Chris Paul with an average starting SG would be competing for the play-in.  It's just bizzare to me how a guy who *nobody* outside of Suns fandom believed he could be the #1 option on a championship contender is still underrated, despite proving that he is."
"High school thing was 90%, bluff 10%. Teams and scouts knew he wouldn't just give up the NBA entirely, even if he really did go to Italy.   Worst case he goes to Italy for a year or two then comes to the NBA. Which would've been the same as him going to college. Think Marc Gasol or Ricky Rubio.  But the GMs couldn't deal with their local medias bashing them for not picking xyz player over Kobe with whatever pick, because that draft class was considered to be one of the best even at the time with AI, Ray, and so on. No prior success except KG, and he is a big. That was the biggest factor."
"&gt;Get some great defenders and some pass first players and you'll have a great team  Like Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, and Jarred Vanderbilt? It was sure better than having DLo to have Ricky out on the floor with those guys. And yes, I am telling you he is just as good as those guys as a playmaker. In fact, he has better passing touch and a wider pick and roll vocabulary than those 4 minus Ja. When he was the sole focal point of the offense in Brooklyn (like Ja and Lillard are), he also averaged a couple more assists getting him to 7.0 apg and led them to a playoff berth. I'm not saying he's as good a player as those guys, because he isn't as good as them, but as a passer, he's undeniably gifted."
Carmelo Anthony (always felt like his name sounded like butter)   Deni Avdija   Saddiq Bey  Facundo Campazzo  Ricky Rubio
true but they are in desperate need of another ball handler. Ricky Rubio would evem be good. that's how desperately they need one
There have been like 2 or 3 of those in history lol. Was Ricky Rubio an MVP (or their version of MVP) in Spain? Not that he was every physically dominating.
"I do not want Ricky Rubio as my starting point guard. The guy is insanely overrated, just because he averages a bunch of assists doesn't mean he's actually a good playmaker."
"NBA players in general are massive humans  I met Ricky Rubio before he was traded to the Jazz years ago. I'm 6'1"" in shoes and about 185-200 lbs depending on the season and he was making me look like a child. He had slides on too"
Ricky Rubio
"Two days in a row of fake tough guys; yesterday it Marcus Morris now it’s Dudley.  At least with Morris, I think might actually throw a punch.  Dudley would never ever ever get in an actual fight.  He knows who to shove, case in point Ricky Rubio, he would not push James Jonson or jokic or someone who would punch him dead in the face if he tried that shit."
fuck Ricky Rubio 😉
fuck Jimmy Butler?  or fuck Ricky Rubio?
Ricky Rubio seems like such a great guy
Ricky Rubio
"He wouldn't be Ricky Rubio.  Seriously, this question could be applied to Giannis or Steph. (E.g. how good will they be if they have good passing and shooting)"
"As a former fan of this abysmal organization I respectfully disagree.  The fans deserve and have deserved better, and they have given their all and large amounts of money for…the worst franchise in American sports.  From endless 1st and high round picks leading nowhere. To the coaching carousel. To nepotism (Ryan Saunders) and “feel good vibes” (Tyus Jones, Ricky Rubio), literally every move the timberwolves have made has been flat out wrong or a horribly wasted opportunity. Even Garnett will go into the HOF as a Celtic.   https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-now-worst-franchise-major-163229407.html"
Yeah they literally had Ricky Rubio trying to defend Harden from behind to try and stop his step back
"""Giddey is 6'8 though while cooper is 6'1. Only major difference.""  Giddey is a decent positional defender, he shows up in the right spots and with his bbIQ its only time until he's a decent defender. his shot's floor is ricky rubio (bad but rubio is a 10+ year NBA vet. you can make some decent money doing everything but shooting.  And again, Giddey was one of the youngest kids in the draft, and as you pointed out he is 7 inches taller."
Ricky rubio on the pelicans would be so much fun to watch
"I wouldn’t compare him to Melo. As you said, totally different players for one. Second though, Kidd started almost every game that season and played like 33-34 minutes per game; Melo only started 3 last year on 24 minutes a game.   I’d feel more comfortable comparing him to maybe Mike Conley (though Conley definitely is a better scorer than a 37 year old Kidd). I’m not sure there really are a lot of great comparisons in the league right now. Ricky Rubio lines up a lot closer stat-wise."
"Mills/Rubio isn’t great, but you can do worse for your 4/5th options. Mills excels in off ball roles, though Rubio may be a little redundant with Luka. He’s a good defender though.   It might help if Gobert can punish line ups for going small, which I think he can do if Ricky and Luka are feeding him the ball."
Ricky Rubio would like to know why everyone is yelling
"i’m not talking about his point i’m talking about yours, i’m saying you talking about bridges and anunoby being better wing defenders when he was talking about ricky rubio makes no sense, never said i agreed with the other dude"
"Derrick Rose is the obvious answer. I'd say his playstyle was very susceptible to injuries from early on, so there's not too much of a point in playing the what-if game with him. Grant Hill was the obvious one before Rose, although maybe he got in for his college career?  In terms of guys just not panning out and not so much because of injuries, but more so because they never reached that higher level - Ricky Rubio and Andrew Wiggins."
48% from 3 wtf Ricky Rubio
"Player stats:  Luka Doncic: 23.8 points, 9.7 rebounds, 9.5 assists [45% FG, 30% 3PT, 71% FT]  Kevin Durant: 20.2 points, 4.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists [53% FG, 42% 3PT, 90% FT]  Patty Mills: 26.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, 6.5 assists [53% FG, 34% 3PT, 81% FT]  Ricky Rubio: 25.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists [52% FG, 48% 3PT, 83% FT]  Rudy Gobert: 10.2 points, 9.4 rebounds, 1.4 assists [58% FG, 52% FT]"
"Had a great year in Phx. Building to something really great in the bubble. Traded for Chris Paul.  The year before that he was finding his place with the Jazz. Started his Ricky Rubio Foundation there. Was replaced by Mike Conley.  Getting replaced by older vets while you're in your prime and looking to be a vital part of a team has to be doing things to your head. Ricky is all about mental health and head space. He obviously wasn't in the right place when he came back to Minny. By the time he settled in, it was clear that the Wolves weren't looking for a playoff spot and focused on building younger talent like Ant and Jaden McDaniels. So that's what Ricky's role came to be. He was shooting much better during the 2nd half of the season. Ant had been speaking highly of him as a vet."
Suns legend Ricky Rubio 🐐
Australia Patty Mills and Spain Ricky Rubio are the 2 greatest players of all time
"Jesus Christ I can see your boner for Tatum over the internet. Objectively Ricky Rubio was the better player. He led his team. You can simp over your man all year, but this olympics Ricky was the better player."
"Ricky Rubio in a winning team is top tier talent, but he has been very unlucky in the NBA being stuck in the worst Wolves.   If Wolves didn't ship him off to get fucking Jeff Teague, they might have fight for a chip during the Butler year.   He kinda turned around the Jazz and the Suns when he got there.   He got MVP in basketball worlds 2019 and is a top 4 guy in this Olympics. Can't wait to see him sign with a good team"
 Ricky rubio would have been a top superstar if he had not  injured his acl on his rookie year
"Ricky Rubio is interesting, he’s an old school pass first point guard. It seems like those types get more value in the playoffs today. I was listening to a podcast analyzing the 2009 draft and was shocked to hear he would have assuredly been a Top 3 pick and likely the 2nd pick but teams were afraid he wouldn’t come over for a couple years. They didn’t want to draft and stash a pick that high. One of the commentators even said he was considered a candidate for the top pick until Blake Griffin started getting a lot of traction."
"You guys got all the obvious ones. Wall, Arenas, Francis, DWill, Kemp, Spree, Tyreke.  Problem is almost every washed guy had some type of injury. No star was totally injury free and just decided to suck.  I'll add Elton Brand  Ricky Rubio was supposed to be a basketball phenom hall of famer.  Baron Davis (WOAT nickname ""Boom Dizzle"") was supposed to be a franchise guy  Abdur Rahim faded away  Andrew Bynum  I know Josh Howard got hurt, but he burned out quick."
"I was stacked with all the sleeper fantasy producers. Gerald Wallace, Ricky Rubio, Greivis Vasquez, Kris Humphries, etc"
Showing my love for my dude Ricky Rubio. If he is given the reigns to the offense the man controls the whole game. Example: 2021 Olympics
Olympics Ricky Rubio.
"What context does this provide? Do you even know what those words mean.   Fuck outta here, this is a Patty Mills thread. Go make a 6th place Ricky Rubio thread if you wanna post this shit"
"If it were Spain and Ricky Rubio were crying, this sub would start a Go Fund Me for him  No hate on Ricky though that's my fucking boy. Love that guy"
"i feel like its not even racist, with the NBA people are just so uncreative.  Tall Asian man? Yao Ming.  Tall Euro? Dirk.  Short Euro? Ricky Rubio.  Light skin shooter? Steph Curry.  Short Asian? Jeremy Lin."

Ricky Rubio out there challenging heterosexuality. .
"Ziaire is the most likely to bust, but I also think people will be disappointed by Giddey. The guy's shot is broken and he is really bad defensively. Ricky Rubio ceiling imo."
Hot take: Ricky Rubio is more handsome than Malika Andrews is beautiful.
Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio future reporter
"&gt;If Schroeder had a more solid and consistent 3 ball  He'd make at least $25M a season, probably more.  Check the list of veteran players who averaged more assists than Schroder last year.  The only two who made less than Schroder were TJ McConnell and Ricky Rubio. Rubio is one of the worst shooters in the league, and doesn't defend. McConnell is a 7ppg player.    The rest of that 6+ assist club? Westbrook, Young, Paul, Doncic, Draymond Green, Jokic, Lillard, Morant, Fox, Butler, DeRozen, Simmons, Sabonis, VanVleet, LaMelo Ball, Garland, Jrue Holiday, Conley, Irving, Randle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brogdon, and Stephen Curry.  Not many cheap players on that list.  Playmaking is one of the rarest and most-valuable skills in basketball."
"Julius Randle will be sent to Philly in a 3-team deal sending Ben Simmons to Minnesota. The Knicks will receive Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, and Ricky Rubio."
*Ricky Rubio  If anyone else on that team played even half decently on offense team USA would’ve had to try harder than usual.
What’s he good at ? Passing the ball ? Defense ? Is Lonzo a star is Ricky Rubio a star
Cavs legend Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio turns into a perennial all-star whenever he plays in the olympics.
You’re right he’s not terrible I was just judging him on his last game where he was just a turnover machine. He was their worst player last game and somehow become Ricky Rubio tonight.
No Ricky Rubio? Nephew
"Reminds me of Spain benching Ricky Rubio at the end of the 3rd quarter + beginning of the 4th while USA was on a big run.  Team USA could play like shit and be down the whole game, then all of a sudden they could be up 15 points before anyone blinks an eye.  These coaches didn't realize that."
"That's a big if though. I'm definitely rooting for Hayes, but I can totally see a world where he is the next Ricky Rubio if he doesn't get a shot. Which is still a really good player, but not what we were hoping for when he was drafted."
"I feel like you responded to the wrong person, as this was never *my* argument. I agree completely that the NBAPA would never go along with this, but rather than get that far into the weeds with refuting that guy I figured it was better to just point out that the owners as well wouldn't want that as a punishment.   But players have used the threat of going overseas to force teams' hands before. Danny Ferry in fact went to go play in Italy rather than play for the Clippers, and Ricky Rubio stayed in Europe when the Wolves ignored his pleas to not draft him. I can tell you that if Zion was suspended for years, as that other guy suggested (again, not my idea), then he would certainly just go play elsewhere in the meantime."
"&gt; His best teammates were Ricky Rubio, Corey Brewer and JJ Barea.  Pekovic was pretty good, for a couple seasons anyway. I remember when he signed a big contract, my Wolves-fan friend tried to convince me that Rubio-Love-Pek was a legit ""big 3"". Also Kirilenko was good."
"My guess is Yes, if they really put the effort into being a good General Manager + President of Basketball Operations. Also, having bad ownership might hold them back.  I'll give you an example. In 2009, the Timberwolves drafted Ricky Rubio #5 and Jonny Flynn at #6. The GSW take Steph Curry at #7. Blake Griffin, Hasheem Thabeet, James Harden, and Tyreke Evans were also taken ahead of Curry. I think the average hardcore NBA fan goes with Curry, a super good shooter and son of an NBA player over Flynn.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-scouting-report-davidson-2009-nba-draft-warriors/odgsfr1n0zs517flvxfb3lg5m"
"Not saying I disagree with KG being much more beloved and obviously he’s a much better player, but the playoff argument is pretty weak. Wally Szczerbiak, Sam Cassell or Latrell Sprewell all would’ve been Love’s best teammate by far.  KG obviously had some shit rosters but Love was playing with G-league guys. His best teammates were Ricky Rubio, Corey Brewer and JJ Barea.   Love dragging a hot garbage team to 40 wins and a positive point differential is as good as a playoff berth IMO, especially considering it was the toughest West we’ve seen and Phoenix missed the playoffs with 48 wins."
"How long has the dumpster been burning now? 20+ years??? Quick, are there any sons of former staff or players we can hire? Is Darko available for a return tour? Can we ‘Joe Smith’ under the table cash trade for Ben Simmons (who would be abysmal in the offense anyways)…wait. I know the answer…RICKY RUBIO (at one point statistically the single worst shooter in NBA history based on minutes played)."
"Ricky Rubio, although not a bust, could have had a rajon rondo type media profile to him if he did the same thing on a winning team. Everyone would be like that guy just wins. Instead this passing artist was passing to like Martell Webster instead of at least one all star"
whens the last time you heard a ricky rubio statement 😳
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"Avoid watching Anthony Edwards  He’s too athletic for 99.99% of people to replicate his game not just in the world, but he tested in the 99th percentile for vertical, acceleration, and decelerating in the NBA.  I’d tell them to watch Ricky Rubio, but learn to shoot."
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: Danny Green  SF: Robert Covington  PF: Draymond Green  C: Steven Adams
"Putting aside how overused the ""pass-first point guard"" cliche is (nearly every PG in the league these days is a combo guard, and the ones who aren't are guys like Rubio, who aren't good enough to start on good teams anyway), we *have* a pass-first PG. His name is Marcus Smart, he would've been top 30 in assists last year if he'd played enough to qualify, and the only reason he's been playing the two-guard is because we've had a star-level PG since his sophomore year. And don't give me that ""he takes too many bad shots to be a pass-first PG"" crap— the only guy who averaged *more* assists than him last year while taking *fewer* shots per game were Draymond Green, Ricky Rubio, Ben Simmons, and TJ McConnell."
Average starting PG. Ricky Rubio level I’d say
You also don't want Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio 4x5
[Ricky Rubio](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Little Ricky Rubio
"Grayson Allen with Ricky Rubio hair and maybe a sleeve, people won't hate him as much I'm unironically confident of this."
Ricky Rubio. I think good playmaking and below average shooting right?  How's his defense and stuff? I only know Olympic Rubio.
"Dragan Bender, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Dario Saric, Enes Kanter, Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, Ricky Rubio.  It's not that hard to understand. The hit rate on the top international guys leading up to Doncic was very poor, and Luka had worse physical tools than most of them. Ricky Rubio was billed as a can't miss guy in a similar vein to Luka, and then he missed."
"That isn’t just the Carmelo metric. They added some other stuff to it and tinkered and the article is actually supposed to be a projection of who might be the better player over *the next six years* from when the article was posted. So no, they didn’t say that Elfrid Payton was more valuable than prime Blake Griffin. They just projected him to be the better player over the next six years.  Still a terrible projection in hindsight tho, but if you actually read it they don’t seem to be very confident in the projection for Elfrid either. They say if he developed a shot, maybe that could be true. And if he didnt then he would be worse than ricky rubio"
"""I'mma shut that shit down"" - Russel Westbrook after Ricky Rubio scored 26 points in game 3 of Utah vs. Thunder.  One of my homies was a Thunder fan,, he said after that interview the Thunder subreddit was freaking out because they knew Russ was gonna face guard Rubio the next game, which would allow Donavan Mitchell to go off. Mitchell scored 33 the next game."
He’s a trashman Ricky Rubio
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"If we're talking NBA (or professional basketball in general) then broadly speaking yes:  Guards who are considered bad shooters generally still do okay in the mid range and from the FT line and will take open 3s if they have them. Think Rajon Rondo or Ricky Rubio. Or Russell Westbrook. I don't know a guard in the NBA who absolutely can't shoot at all. There are however a handful of wings in the league who are very poor shooters, most famously Ben Simmons.   In general shooting is **always** a plus, no matter the position. This used to be different, when nobody cared if their center could hit 3s, because a center wasn't supposed to be at the 3 point line a lot. The importance of shooting decreases with increasing height however. Guards need to shoot at least half decent, Wings better do so or they should be elite at something else and bigs can easily be non shooters if they provide something different on offense(vertical spacing for example) and/or are very good defenders.  If you're learning to play the game of basketball, shooting is definitely the skill you should work the most on. Regardless of position. After that it's other fundamentals (layup package with either hand, handles, footwork, defensive stances and lateral movement, passing)"
Baby faced Ricky Rubio glowed up into Bad boy Ricky Rubio.
I think Ricky Rubio is the reason Luka didn’t go first overall
Ricky Rubio probably. I followed him closet for about a year or 2 before he got drafted and I thought he would be close to what Luka is. I saw him as a 18-22 PPG 5-7 RPG and 8-10 APG player. He was the best teenage player I had ever seen up to that point and thought he was a sure fire future MVP.   OJ Mayo is another player I thought would be great. His rookie year pretty much guaranteed it for me that he would be the next great SG. That clearly didn’t happen.   Adam Morrison. Believe it or not I bought into the hype. The older guys at the barber shop talked about him being the next Bird and his college games kind of backed it up. I was wrong again  Josh Childress. I was a dumb kid that liked his Afro and play style. Dude was a good 6th man tho
Now post when Westbrook got embarrassed by Ricky Rubio and rookie Donovan Mitchell lmao
For context: Ricky Rubio was the first player born in the 90's to get drafted.
"Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio, wolves were so lucky they dodged that mid major weak ankle light skinned 3pt shooter"
I remember hearing Ricky Rubio being like a child prodigy in basketball over in Spain.  I’m must be ancient.
RICKY RUBIO CAN CURE KEVIN LOVE'S DEPRESSION
I remember the days when Rubio didn't immediately come over to the NBA and stayed overseas for a while longer. Seems just like yesterday.  Also hope that since Rkcky is on the team that he can light a fire under Kevin's ass so he can re energize himself as he prepares for his soon to be twilight years in the league. Would be a nice story seeing Ricky and Kevin lead this young Cavs team to a play-in upset and sneak into the playoffs. Anything is possible.
Wow. This takes me back. I just remembered that the two of them (Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio) used to be teammates.
"Its funny because Doncic ""eurobasketball Idol"" was Ricky Rubio.. https://youtu.be/Venc40ql7eA"
Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio. They were drafted before Steph. Jk. Sorry Wolves fans. Just wanted to rub this in lmao
Damn it seems like just yesterday Ricky Rubio was the first player born in the 90s to get drafted
Ricky Rubio  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZgU0cT_TfI
I don't follow the Sixers close enough to tell you for sure but to me he just looks disinterested/timid on offense randomly in the regular season and all the time in the playoffs.  There will be some games in the regular season that I watch where Ben Simmons is basically Lebron without shooting and some games where he's not even Ricky Rubio.  He's a very frustrating player in the sense that you feel like he can be doing a lot more but he doesn't want to for whatever reason.
So is Ricky Rubio also a superstar?
"Started playing basketball since I was 3 years old. Only tuned in to my local basketball league which was absolute blockbuster gold at that time. Now, its shitty.  2008-2009. My family had cable and the Lakers and Celtics were flashy teams. Ray Allen is my very first guy coz I love the 3 ball ever since. Kinda hated Kobe coz I thought he was cocky. LeBron was popular in the circle too. Kinda liked him but I just have a disdain for stars who are not good at shooting so he's meh to me at first impression.  2011, I got Facebook and got into NBA Memes (Pass? Just get the rebound). Hated LeBron coz that's what everybody did (I was young). Went to my cousin's house one day coz I have a potato computer that can't run Powerpoint and he had a reputable PC with a good CPU and GPU. He had 2k11 installed and playing it for the first time was heavenly. I even managed to get on the sliders. I was playing the Lakers at that time and just watching Steve Blake shoot 10 3s in a row decimating the Celtics was peak entertainment. I kept using him coz I don't know him. He's white and looks super unskilled compared to Kobe  Came back there like 2 weeks later and I decimated the Lakers using the GOAT Brian Scalabrine with 214 points. In my mind, I was like ""I gotta get a copy of this game coz I wanna try so many things""  Got the game and played it on a Netbook (its my only computer at that time). It wasn't a good experience so I had to put all settings on ultra low and use Cheat Engine speedhacks to slow the gameplay down increasing the fluidity of the game. Literally hyped when I saw Mike Miller dunk in the span of 10 seconds.   About one year later, mom decided to buy a brand new PC coz she doesn't want me visiting my cousin's house every time we had a big project. It was an i3 with no GPU whatsoever but it ran 2k11 well enough (with astonishing graphics in my eyes). It was the perfect time to milk the hell out of the game. It was summer and I got circumcised and my parents were totally ok with me playing with my brand new computer all summer. I even had the time to download mods (EG FIBA and Slam Dunk 2k11)  2013 forward, I started to follow NBA and pick a team. Before Stephen Curry's infamous 54 point explosion at MSG, my favorite players were Steve Nash and Ricky Rubio because other than the 3 ball, I like point guards who does flashy passing and outsmarting the opponents. When Steph Curry happened, I started to idolize him in 2013. It helps that his teammate is also a shooter in Klay Thompson. So I mained the Warriors in 2013. I actually thought the Warriors could beat the Miami Heat in the Finals during 2014. I was pissed off when Steph missed that Game 7 dagger when I knew that should've been a foul and we would've eliminated the Clipper's ass.   My investment in GSW was the one of the best things I ever did.  2015 to 2018 I was nutting all day coz Steph Curry GOATED. Sucked that they blew a 3-1 lead but hey 2nd best PG of all time baby.   TL;DR it all started in TV then it quickly developed in 2k then Reddit (which is probably my biggest mistake ever that I will never regret, never change r/nba)"
"I love Ricky Rubio because to me he shows the gap in quality for NBA to the Euroleague.  If you ever hear a european fan hyping up a euroleague guard saying things like “one of the best passers in the world” or “could definitely start on NBA teams”, theres like an 80% chance that guy plays like a worse Dallas Rondo, dribbling for an eternity before passing off and making a guy shoot.  Its always fun to see the difference in how the game is played when those guys play for the national team compared to when Rubio/Mills or even Satoransky play"
This bogan don't realize you can be a fan of whoever you want. I love me some ricky rubio and idgaf what anyone says.
They’re about to enter their second year.  Don’t you think it’s a little early to compare Lamelo Ball to Steph Curry and James Wiseman to Ricky Rubio/Jonny Flynn?
2009 NBA DRAFT ORDER  Clippers. Blake Griffin. PF.  Grizzlies. Hasheem Thabeet. C.  Thunder. James Harden. SG.  Kings. Tyreke Evans. PG.  TIMBERWOLVES. Ricky Rubio. PG.  TIMBERWOLVES. Jonny Flynn. PG.  Warriors. Stephen Curry. PG.  Knicks. Jordan Hill. PF.
"&gt;or just completely shit the bed like he did vs Houston a couple of years back  Lmao, it was his sophomore year and he was the only actual scoring threat as a significant underdog to the Rockets.   It was Mitch, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors, Jae Crowder, Rudy Gobert, Royce O'Neale, and Joe Ingles as the guys that played significant minutes."
"PG:Darius Garland SG:Collin Sexton SF:Isaac Okoro PF:Lauri Markannen(for now) C:Jarrett Allen Reserves: Dylan windler, Evan Mobley, damyean Dotson, Ricky Rubio"
"I couldn't disagree more.  How is it that guys like Damian Lillard, Patrick Beverly, and Ricky Rubio are all listed as PGs despite having almost nothing in common in terms of offensive role, but guys like Lillard, Harden, and Lebron are all listed at different positions, despite filling the same general roles on offense? Because position and offensive role don't correlate at all.  Given how fluid offensive roles are nowadays, with there being players described as ""point centers,"" If the traditional ""PG/SG/SF/PF/C"" position model is going to be useful *at all,* it *has* to be a short hand for defensive lineups and match ups. Not just who you guard, but who best guards you as well. If literally no PG can guard you, but SFs, can, then it sounds like you're more of an SF to me."
Ricky Rubio haunts your dreams like Baron Davis haunts mine?
yea I watched Ricky Rubio drop a 27 point triple double on him in the playoffs and Westbrook getting pissed lmao
"He is **not** good looking. Why you think Devin Booker, Ricky Rubio or JJ Reddick are so lusted after? I have seen broke ass dudes with hot women. Know why? They are good looking. I remember some women at work roasting some athletes and saying 'I don't care how rich he is ......."
"Jokic is a required pick essentially. The other pick kinda boils down to the rest of your roster, with there being (imo) three real choices.  First choice, which it seems like is most people's pick, is Dame. He's the best player available (besides maybe Iverson, but I personally don't think AI is a good pick here), and it would translate to elite offense immediately. You have two guys that are elite scorers from pretty much anywhere on the court, as well as elite playmakers/passers. The issue with this is that the defense would get absolutely steam rolled. It would rely heavily on elite wing defenders and ideally a solid defensive SG. Both of them also operate best with the ball in their hands, which is an overstated problem imo, but it's still there. They'd be very good together, but their skillsets aren't really complimentary.   Second pick is Klay. This situation would be less of a 1A/1B situation like with Dame, but would instead give Jokic one of the best 3&amp;D guys of all time. Jokic runs the offense on-ball while Klay provides elite off-ball scoring. He also gives the team elite defense and more length than you'd get from Dame. He's not as good as Dame, but he is a better direct compliment to Jokic. There would be less weaknesses to account for. The main piece to search for would be a good ball handling PG, like Ricky Rubio.  Third pick is Ben Wallace. He'd honestly be an excellent fit next to Jokic. Covers all of his weaknesses and is one of the best defenders of all time. He's my last pick of the three because he just doesn't provide enough on offense in the modern NBA. The remaining roster would have to have some decent scoring threats, or this team won't get it done."
"He's great in transition. So what. Andre Drummond is great under the basket. There's more to the game.   If Washington can take him out of his game, how he supposed to compete with contenders.   And it doesn't matter if you are  great passer when you defender can slack off on you because you can't and won't shoot.   &amp;#x200B;  Nobody is denying what he does well: It's what he doesn't do that holds him and his team back.   He's been in the league 4 years and he isn't even better than he was as a rookie.   That's a problem. When you see ZERO development in a player on four years?   The Sixers would have done better wit Lowry running the point than Simmons. They would have been better off with Ricky Rubio.   When you're set to pay a dude nearly 40 million to run the point, you expect him to at the very least have a jump shot."
Ricky Rubio
"&gt; I still think you have to be blind to not see how much Ben does for the team.  Well yeah, Philly has avoided competent ball handlers like the plague in their effort to build around Simmons. If they had Ricky Rubio or whatever off the bench, they wouldn't have nearly these issues without him."
Ricky Rubio: [Fuck Cancer](https://twitter.com/rickyrubio9/status/1051966553732734976?lang=en)  Curry: Has not made public statement against cancer (pro-cancer?)  This is why RubiGOAT owns Curfraud
"[well he is definitely making that if it’s against us](https://youtu.be/NApESoWOxm8) , man i fucking hate how many players had uncharacteristic moments/games against us this past season, i‘ll never forget Ricky Rubio turning into Steph Curry lol"
Blake Griffin in the beginning could only dunk and do lay ups but he changed his game and can shoot. Even Ricky Rubio has a respectable jumpshot now! Simmons needs to stop playing a victim and actually work on his offense.
Agreed. I don’t know why people are pushing this Minnesota trade as if that’s even the best offer that’s been discussed so far. One week ago CJ for Ben was the perfect trade to r/nba and I guarantee y’all wouldn’t take Naz Ried and Ricky Rubio for him
"I'll start,  Philly:  Malik Beasley   Wolves 1st 2024  Collin Sexton  Ricky Rubio  Cavaliers:  Jaden McDaniels  Patrick Beverley   Philly 1st 2022  Wolves 1st 2022  Minnesota  Ben Simmons"
So I don't think anyone disagrees that Ben Simmons is a floor raiser and can more or less carry a team to the playoffs. But his literal inability to shoot was a huge ass issue for why they lost in the playoffs. And something like developing a jumpshot like even a shitty Ricky Rubio level could've made them advance
As long as Maxey isn't in the deal then he'd be the starting PG.  If you told me we somehow ended up with somebody like Ricky Rubio I wouldn't be surprised though.
"&gt; I'd argue that the more impressive thing that shows more effort and care is to know when to back down, or let your teammates take over  This is going to be the hugest black mark on WB's career. He's played with some seriously amazing players in his time; like 5+ players that were easily better than him the season they played together. He's had some seriously amazing teammates, but always ends up being the guy who's got to take charge and win the games. 5 years from now who do you think will field the blame for OKC's 2018? PG who's led two teams to Conference Finals or Westbrook, who's never done more than the first round without an MVP caliber teammate. The Covid excuse will wear off eventually and people will admit that WB shot the Rockets out of the 2020 playoffs despite having the runner up MVP on the team.   I'm a hater, I'll say it loud and proud. The defining series of Westbrook's career will either be the 2017 Rockets series where he won MVP then got Shitfucked by Harden, or his 2018 series that was capped off with a loss because WB put up 46 points on 43 shots and made it a mission to shut down elite scorer Ricky Rubio."
Not Ricky Rubio tho :(
"B - is good!  We did excellently to get Horford, Schroeder, Kanter, Richardson, Dunn who will be key role players.  Very disappointed about us losing a draft pick in this very talented draft class and even more disappointed that we have not gotten a pass first floor general.  Our last good floor general was Rajon Rondo, and for some reason we persist not getting a real floor general despite this being the MAIN reason why we fail deep in the playoffs.  I wanted to move for Ricky Rubio."
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
"The ole’ Ricky Rubio or Rajon Rondo problem of pure passers, though both those guys managed to develop quality shots and decent touch so tbh Simmons is an outlier."
"People are *way* too invested in the concept of a ""pass-first point guard"". There's really no such thing anymore, players like Ricky Rubio or Lonzo Ball *just aren't very good playmakers* because of their inability to create their own shot."
Ricky Rubio deserves better. Period.
Ricky Rubio deserves better than Cleveland
How many times has Ricky Rubio been on the wolves? EDIT: just twice.
"Stockton? No, he’s passive asf and doesn’t create as many scoring opportunities as Kobe.  Rajon Rondo literally runs in circles looking for an opportunity to make a cheap assist instead of creating real opportunities. There’s a reason why the term “rondo assist” exists.  The fact you brought up Ricky Rubio…  Assists are not the “be all end all” of deciding who’s the best playmaker."
Billy Donovan using the double team against Ricky Rubio instead of Dame Lillard
No he's rated fine. And he's also being criticized justly by people.  If you have spent this much time in the league and have yet to be able to shoot free throws OR 3s. If your offense is so far removed that a person can stand off you and dare you to shoot?  You are Ricky Rubio status not Dame Lillard.  He is not a second string or a journeyman. But he's also not even top 10 in the guards in the NBA.  He keeps on making all star games based on what factor?   I put him as a player who is limited in his abilities but can do those things well.
Ricky Rubio -&gt; Rajon Rondo -&gt; Gary Payton  John Wall -&gt; Derrick Rose -&gt; Russell Westbrook
"Ricky Rubio, Dennis Schroeder, Chris Paul"
Wow this is kinda far off? Ricky Rubio doesn't seem like a walmart version of James Harden. Different skillset
I remember when this veteran presence set the lovely example of shoving Ricky Rubio in the backcourt followed by Marquese Chriss taking a cheapshot at Rubio right after.  This dude is a lame corny grifter and has been for years.
"""my favorite player is Ricky Rubio"""
"Anytime people act like Lonzo’s a ball dominant, pass first PG like Ricky Rubio or something.   Yes, he’s a fantastic passer, but it’s very clear that he can’t really access that passing in a half court setting. He’s really more of wing than a PG."
"Is that you, Ricky Rubio?"
"6'1"" Ricky Rubio without defense"
I'll try to use non-superstar examples  PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - CJ McCollum  SF - Khris Middleton  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Jonas Valanciunas
"Bro go look at the modern builds of nba players. Tell me dame Lillard, Karl Anthony towns, Joel embid, Dwyane wade, lebron james, Ricky Rubio, even my boy kristaps porzingus looks dapper as fuck.   Have you heard banana republic model Kevin Love?  Kd aside, Nba bodies have evolved a lot since Shawn Bradley monstar. It's the most stylish sports league in America hands down."
"Only 4 players in NBA history have posted equal or better numbers than 2014 Kevin Love (26/12.5/4.4). Those players are Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Billy Cunningham. I had to look up who the hell Billy Cunningham was too so don't feel bad. He was a ABA/NBA player who played on very fast pace 76ers teams while in the NBA; he was a 5x all star, 4x all NBA player, ABA MVP, and is in the HOF now.Back to Kevin Love, he was the only player to put up those numbers in 36 mpg, hell he was the only one who wasn't playing 40-47 mpg.  He is also the only player to post those numbers since 1976. It had nearly been 40 years since the last '14 Love statline!

He also has the second highest TS%, trailing only prime Wilt Chamberlain, often listed as the exception to every NBA stat.Needless to say, Love's 2014 season was nothing short of amazing. Solid efficiency, and ungodly averages. I realize his defense was pedestrian at best, and his team only won 40 games, but his teammates that year were hot garbage and the West was the hardest it had been in years and arguably ever. Love's Wolves would have made the playoffs in the East and likely been a 4th or 5th seed if you account for SRS. He had 50 games of Pekovic, Corey Brewer, 38 FG% Ricky Rubio and a 30 year old Kevin Martin starting alongside him. None of those teammates should be your second best player. It's especially sad when you realize this was them trying to contend for a playoff spot around Love. In 2014, all teams in the West that made the playoffs had 49 or more wins. The only time this has happened was in 2008 when all playoff teams had 50 wins."
"This isn't entirely true; Mitchell didn't have the green light from the start at all. There was a Ringer article that talked about how bad the Jazz offense was because Ricky Rubio was leading the team in points. Mitchell eventually surpassed him but it took a chunk of the season.  Remember, Mitchell wasn't even supposed to start when he got to the team; he only started in the season opener because Rodney Hood had nervous bowel syndrome."
There was someone in particular I saw do this and I was like wtf?! Was it Ricky rubio??
"Ever since I saw Westbrook lose his shit against Jazz Rubio, creating the most ridiculous beef I've ever seen, talking trash off the court against Ricky fucking Rubio, I knew Westbrook was weak as shit. Fakest tough guy in the league by a long shot."
"i mean maybe i’m crazy, but i have really been liking the DG/Rubio lineup. those two plus Mobley just make us such a tremendous passing team and i think that highlights mobley   sexton will always look to get his bucket first, while everybody else (DG to a fault) looks to get their teammates involved first   i think keeping ricky, signing Delon Wright, and then figuring something out for a wing in a Sexton trade (Reddish would be cool, but i also don’t want to pay him a lot).   imo if this team is ever going to be a real title contender, it’s because Mobley and Allen are elite on defense, Mobley and Garland are elite playmakers, and because it’s death by a thousand cuts   i don’t think Collin’s iso scoring fits with our two main cogs"
"It also depends on turnovers from passes vs. turnovers from trying to score. Guys like Westbrook and LeBron are going to have more turnovers than guys like Ricky Rubio because on top of throwing a lot of passes, they’re also constantly driving to the lane which creates more turnover opportunities"
Ricky Rubio had helped his morale so much and I love it
"He seems to be playing within the offense a lot better this year, which is dangerous for other teams. Ricky Rubio has been a godsend. If Collin was still pounding the ball as much as he was before this season then sixth man would make sense."
Just traded Ricky Rubio for SGA in my fantasy league.   Did not disappoint.
Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio have really come full circle
"He's basically coming in to play the role of Ricky Rubio so that's how I have been evaluating him.  Beverly is a much better fit alongside our other players.    On defense: PatBev &gt; Rubio by a lot.  Rubio is definitely a positive on defense, but not nearly as good as Bev there.  In playmaking: Rubio &gt; PatBev. Ricky still sets his teammates up better than Bev does.  But the kicker for me:  Leadership:  PatBev &gt; Rubio and it's basically not comparable.  Rubio is good at mentoring young players and getting them used to the NBA and he is always saying the right things that you want your leaders to say, but Bev backs up his talk in a way that Rubio's personality doesn't allow him to do.  Bev will go right up to the opponent's best player and do *anything* that he thinks will give him a slight advantage.  He stood in front of Valanciunas the other day when he was warming up to take free throws just to piss him off and try to light a spark for the team."
Ricky Rubio is the Mayor of Cleveland and King of all the Leons
"""ricky rubio is going to make us a playoff team"" is certainly not what i thought i'd be saying last year."
No shit lol people actually thought he magically started playing like Ricky Rubio?  Rule changes don't affect the number of shots you take
"Well it helps that Mobley isn't playing C. He's a PF. Doesn't have to bang down low or create his own shot. He's in a better situation than most of the ""upside"" guys.  Suggs and Green just don't have good offensive systems around them. They're not finding themselves in good spots, nor do they have a Ricky Rubio to set them up. Not to entirely excuse their issues, just to point out that I don't think its a bunch of homers moving the goalposts."
"Wizards got Randy Foye and Mike Miller for a season each for Ethan Thomas, Oleksiy Pecherov, Darius Songaila and a 2009 1st rounder. Minnesota used that pick on Ricky Rubio, and let Steph Curry on the board"
Ricky Rubio and a second got traded for Taurean Prince. You're right.
"Bout to fuck around and go .500, sneak into the play-in game, and unleash Playoff Ricky Rubio, known by his alter ego, Ricard Vives"
I have never met anybody named Ricky who wasn't a certified crackhead. I can pretty much guarantee that Rubio can box
&gt;Ricky Rubio has spent years throwing lobs to a lot of different players in Minnesota. Also his pick´n´roll with Nikola Pekovic was an automatic basket.
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
Ricky Rubio cause I had high hopes for him to be a leader in steals.
Why hasn’t anyone tried to pair Evan Fournier with Ricky Rubio or Patty Mills? FIBA/Olympic goats
Yup. Embiid can’t carry a team and they don’t have another NBA caliber PG. If they just had like a Ricky Rubio they would be so much better

Yeah but Ricky Rubio is a vet he's getting bodied by bigger dudes all the time and I think he's built a resistance. I think intangibles go to Facu but advanced stats support Rubio
"That was a classic Ricky Rubio ""Can't make a shot but still really effective"" game and also a classic Ricky Rubio ""Get flagrant fouled to rally your team"" game.  He sure does draw a lot of those for a guard that doesn't jump."
"Its about Ricky Rubio. Sexton and Garland duo were so bad at being point guard in last two years. In terms of organising the offense and feeding inside, Rubio seemed to elevated whole team."
Ricky Rubio
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
Harden’s been looking like fat Ricky Rubio this season so far   Hopefully he gets himself into shape soon
"Ricky Rubio will win the NBA Finals MVP, Mobley ROTY, Cavs in 4 against...  well who cares. :)"
"Ricky Rubio has had a great career in the NBA, but I’ve always felt like he could have been so much more if on the right team. Offensively, he has all the tools to have had made multiple all-star teams and possibly a few all-nba teams. But playing in Minnesota for the bulk of your career tends to limit your potential."
"Yeah, laughed at the nutmeg and then groaned when we couldn't convert. I don't think I can overstate how important Rubio is going to be for the development of Garland and Sexton. I think Sexton has always tried to pass but it was never in the flow of the offense, it was either outside the arc playing hot potato or drive and kick. Yesterday's game he was actually passing people open, making real plays, not just driving into the trees and getting stuck. I have a feeling that that can be attributed to Rubio. I'm still not one hundred percent in on Sexton, but if Ricky can unlock that part of his game? Sign me the fuck up"
"Just slightly, Tatum can hold his own on defense and wouldnt be getting burned by fucking Ricky Rubio."
Ricky Rubio always been solid at everything. he just never gets the green light.
"Ricky Rubio-clutch scorer is a heck of a development.  That stretch in the 4th when he went bucket, bucket, bucket, nutmeg was incredible"

People think the basketball hall of fame is like the nfl hall of fame.. it isn’t. Dino Radja is in the basketball hall of fame and he played 4 seasons. Ricky Rubio and Patty Mills will both probably be in the basketball hall of fame because of their international performances and reputations. We shouldn’t gatekeep who gets in like the nfl and mlb do.
You’re saying THE Ricky Rubio isn’t up to the task?
"Tyreke Evans, Ricky Rubio."
&gt; the Celtics need a true PG  Somebody's gonna come callin' for Ricky Rubio.
"1.TJ Warren  has always been known to be a ""random scorer"" i say this as someone who has followed His career since he was with the suns 2. PG has always been bad in the Playoffs post injury he hasn't done well except last postseason not to mention that Clippers team was simply outmatched by the Nuggets (you know what matchups are like yes?) Trez is an undersized Big both Murray and Jokic bullied not just PG but the whole clippers team including Kawhi last Playoofs PG had someone to bounce off him And take the pressure Reggie Jackson was an underrated signing that turned out well for them  and the addition of versatile players like Nic Batum And Ibaka did wonders for them   3. The Heat made the finals that year because they were one of the favourites everyone knew that any of the Bucks  Heat and maybe even The Celtics or  76ers would make a competitive run for the finals once the bucks was out of the Picture the east was wide open for the taking and once again this was a matchup advantage for the Heat Against the Bucks Bledsoe was unsurprisingly disappointing in the playoofs and  Giannis struggled against The Heat not to mention Middleton was the only legit shooter they had Everyone else struggled to shoot which meant Giannis struggled to Drive and kick the heat lost this year because The Bucks actually had a legit good player in Jrue Holiday and they revamped their roster not to mention the heat struggled with health issues through the season With a lot of their players catching Covid Butler was awful but that was only because the Bucks actually had a better roster similar to how the Clippers managed to make a Run to the WFC because of a better roster... It's not rocket science my dude 4.The suns  namely Booker Ayton and Bridges always had potential they only needed one missing piece and that piece was CP3 it's no coincidence CP3 wanted to be traded to the suns He saw what they had if  anything  that bubble run by the suns was foreshadowing of what They could do with a Veteran precence that could also playmake Ricky Rubio obviously wasn't gonna cut it... Not only that they also had Monty Williams they actually had a legit coach in the bubble and the suns this year we saw what they could With A legit coach in Monty Williams And a Vet precence in CP3 and Cp3 has always been one of the best PG's in the league so the bubble run was a foreshadowing of what Booker and Ayton could tho with a legit Point Guard lol and here i thought everyone already knew this"

Ricky Rubio has got the whole Mo Salah look going on there.  Was watching the play and I thought it was Rubio throwing a very Rubio’esque bounce pass but watching the replays I was thinking when did Mo Salah start playing ball?
"I got to watch LaMelo Ball throat punch Ricky Rubio and flop, Chris Paul and the Suns bitch about everything, and the Lakers play full contact basketball. Great day"
All lost by Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio and Collin sexton are guaranteed to hit all their shots against the hornets
"He’s still young, I still think he’ll have a role in the league, but my expectations have shifted immensely to more of a Ricky Rubio/ George hill than the borderline star I thought he was gonna be"
"usually white at pg? we had an all-time great pg who was white so he was around for a while, and then had one year of ricky rubio lol."
ive never been a fan of the warriors despite being from the bay and i wont say i am to this day but i was excited that curry got drafted to the warriors and even more happy he didnt go to the wolves or the knicks. the wolves made the biggest mistake in draft priority history by drafting back to back PGs but not steph.....i understood ricky rubio to some extent but the guy from Syracuse
"I think that a lot of it was scoring concerns that LaMelo seems to have worked out much much sooner than we thought. His shot looked bad in Australia, and he had bad percentages. His finishing looked inconsistent and one sided. His defense looked suspect. His passing and vision and height were really the only big pluses. Obviously those can be big pluses, but they're also the same pluses Ricky Rubio had. The fact that he seems to have dramatically improved in all those question areas is pretty remarkable and hard to predict.  Meanwhile Wiseman is a 7'1 athletic freak with physical measurements that rival Rudy Gobert. It's easy to see why the FO went with Wiseman."
Mobley really is a unicorn wow  Also I love Ricky Rubio
We had Barea of the bench that season. Or most used lineup was Rubio/Ridnour/Johnson/Love/Pek. When Ricky went down with his ACL we tried a bunch of lineups but landed on Ridnour/Webster/Johnson/Love/Williams.   Have to imagine the 2021-22 wolves come out ahead because so few of the lineups we used made sense due to injuries.
Ricky Rubio MVP year incoming
"Garland and Mobley are off limits. Sexton is seeking big money, but they'd be able to wait and match or trade him. The pick top 5 protected or unprotected would be a huge plus. Maybe add Ricky Rubio somehow."
Yeah with Ricky Rubio. He has elite touch around the rim so if he’s fed in position he will do well. He cannot create though.
Ricky rubio is the goat so yeah I see how it's easy to notice the difference between the goat and knockoff curry
I always laugh that the Timberwolves picked Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio directly ahead of Steph Curry and Derozon.
arguing that you can’t evaluate talent because of the team you support is so dumb. We haven’t had a great PG in years so does that mean I can’t tell the difference between Dame and Ricky Rubio
"You can't blame Phoenix for not drafting Luka Doncic #1. There was no way of knowing how good he'd be. He was of course a prodigy, but he wasn't the first prodigy from Europe to enter the draft. Ricky Rubio actually started in the pro's there at an even younger age, and Rubio's scouting report in many cases sounds exactly like Luka's, even saying he'd be a household name."
I cannot overstate how happy I've been to have Ricky Rubio on the cavaliers
"I completely understand saying Bam is better. But about that CP3 point, Ayton had the same net rating with Ricky Rubio compared to what he had with CP3. So I do think the CP3 argument is a little overblown.  Ayton averaged 18/11 with Rubio and the month before covid, he was averaging 21 or 22. I know it’s more than just stats but CP3 came and his shots decreased from 15 to 10 (ppg went from 18-&gt; 14). I don’t know too much about Bam but while CP3 has helped Ayton improve his fundamentals as a big man, he hasn’t really helped his growth with the ball. Ayton was really starting to find his groove before Covid."
Rubio also had to deal with a torn acl early in his career but I still think he was an above average PG for most of his career.  Also you act like Ricky went #1 and then immediately went Steph. Plenty of teams passed on Steph and nobody expected an MVP like him to materialise out of that pick. Ricky was a fine pick and I don't think anyone regrets it.
Ja is Russ Jr. without the fashion style. Lamelo is Ricky Rubio 3.0 without the defense. Take that how you will.
Who you got since? [Ricky Rubio](https://jazzteamstore.com/product_images/uploaded_images/ricky-rubio-style-hair.jpg) inspired me to grow my own hair out. God he's so pretty.

"I met Ricky Rubio at the Olympics; he was in street clothes and towered of everyone, next to Kevin Love \[when they were in Minny\] he looked scrawny."
Ricky Rubio sonned him lmao
I mean I'm sure rubio can dunk (and I mean out of game)  Regardless Ricky rubio is the goat
Ricky Rubio?
Ricky Rubio is taller than Spud Webb and can’t dunk.

"Ok, TJ McConnell.... his rookie year he had more assists and less turnovers per 100 possessions than LaMelo.   If you discount per 100 possessions, and prefer just totals per game balancing assists and turnovers:   Damian Lillard  Elfrid Payton  Ricky Rubio  Ben Simmons Trey Young  Lonzo Ball MCW   So not a ton, but certainly not groundbreaking/generational"
"His ast% (impact) is elite while his tov% (impact) is on the bad side of ""okay"" (~16% in OKC, ~18% in WAS - his quote claims teammates need time to gel, so I'm anticipating another 18% year) (Harden ran 15-19% in HOU, Steph tightened up from 16% to 13% in their Finals years, Lowry fluctuated from 13 to 18% in TOR)  His ast:to ratio (efficiency) of 2.4 is firmly on the right side of good for a starting PG. Tyus Jones is usually the best at this sitting at 5-7, and Chris Paul/Ricky Rubio are the [best starters](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/assist-to-turnover-ratio) (both ~4.0 last year). I personally call 3.0 elite, but I'd be happy with Brogdon (2.9), Derrick White (2.8), Lowry (2.7), Jokic (2.6), Simmons (2.5). The other side of that metric are DLo at 2.2, Trae at 2.3, Jamal Murray at 2.1.  His good efficiency in playmaking specifically compliments his unmatched ast% to paint a picture of a dominant playmaker. The value of stats oftentimes change at the edges, which tells me that his healthy 2.4 ast:to is even more impressive with the sheer volume of passes he's making  Those are the stats I like. If you want to get more in the weeds, you can check out the [NBA passing dashboard](nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;sort=AST_TO_PASS_PCT&amp;dir=1). Last year, WB was #2 on ""ast to pass %"" (what % of his passes result in an assist? - measuring the efficiency of any given pass WB makes) and topped the chart in ""ast to pass % adjusted"" (giving more value to assisted 3's). Westbrook also **received** the most passes, which gives some credence to the idea that he's in a system where the ball always comes back to him - you could consider this an additional knock on his raw numbers and even his ast%, but it gives him more opportunity to bolster his tov% and his ""ast to pass%"" isn't affected by this"

Who wins in a hair-off between Josh Giddey and Ricky Rubio?
"Rubio actually started as a pro younger than Doncic did, and the professional scouts said the same thing. Including that Rubio would be a household name and was far beyond anyone else his age. So if your goal is to take the Euro prodigy who is super hyped up and you call GM's a fool for not doing so, then you would've taken Ricky Rubio over Blake Griffin in 2009 and been fired shortly afterward. Arguing that Doncic won Trophy A instead of Trophy B, or you need to use the eye test isn't strong at all. These scouts use the eye test."
Ricky Rubio has a new team like every season and he is able to figure it out.  When youre a vet point guard that's what youre paid to do .
"That's going to sound ridiculous to some people, because he was so good early... but nothing he did in his first two seasons really prepared you for how good he was going to become.   He was picked at \#7, behind Ricky Rubio. It's exceptionally rare for someone picked that late to make their way into the top ten convo (though Kobe at \#13 would like a word)."
Ricky Rubio was also competing against men in Europe at 15. He did not turn into Luka.
"I kind of get it because I think people were comparing him to Ricky Rubio; played professionally at a young age and super hyped up pre draft, but never really became a star in the NBA.  Of course that was a stupid take because Luka even at that age &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ricky, but I get it."
Tbf Ricky Rubio has also been a Pro since he was 14. Always been hyped and was promoted as the next good European player. Now everyone is acting like Luka was a no brainer. Not saying scouts shouldn’t have seen the talent and picked him first
"Jerry West has more scouting ability than just about anyone. For normal GM's and viewers, there was no way of knowing how good Luka would be. Ricky Rubio was playing the pro level at an even younger age in Doncic and had almost the exact same scouting report going into the NBA draft. Like, I could take quotes from both and mix them up and without checking you'd have no way of knowing which one the line was about. In 2009, the correct choice was to take the super-athletic American big man who dunked all over everyone and had incredible upside. (Blake Griffin) over the super-skilled prodigy from Euroleague, in 2018, in the same situation, the prodigy turned out to be better than the American big man. But you can't blame any normal GM for not knowing beforehand."
"Nah, mate, you just either didn't watch the Euroleague, which is fine and you can admit it simply, or... there actually isn't an or. Nobody is that bad at watching basketball for not to have known.   At 18/19, Ricky Rubio was playing end of bench minutes for Joventut. He wasn't the Euroleague MVP and he wasn't the Euroleague Final Four MVP. Even in the subsequent season he was neither of those and he had half the PPG of Luka in his Euroleague MVP season."
"Hindsight, bro. Nothing is guaranteed. I remember thinking Ricky Rubio was going to be the next NBA superstar when I watched him at 17 competing against Kobe and LeBron in the 2008 Olympics Finals."
That's why he was drafted that high. He wasn't the consensus 1st pick. Also Ricky Rubio was competing in the olympics at 14. See how that turned out. Luka is still an exemption rqther than the norm for European players.

"100%. CP3 and Crowder both said that it was the Suns going 8-0 in the bubble that enticed them to play in Phoenix. Imagine if the Suns had just gone to play the role everyone had set for them, which was to make up the numbers. Ricky Rubio would still be our point guard and we’d have played in the Play-In instead of the Finals."
This changed a bit over the last couple of years but that still makes me think of Ricky Rubio.

you're acting like he said Ricky Rubio or something. Baron was a beast and in a modern game with better shot selection he'd be great.
So Ricky Rubio was also doing this at madison and know talked about it?
"Ricky Rubio was the second best player on the court behind Kobe in a 2008 Olympic game, at the age of 18.  He didn't have quite the run Luka had for Slovenia this summer. But imagine someone like that not being in the NBA and being available in the draft."
Ricky Rubio would still be top 5. There was so much hype surrounding him coming out of Europe
"Hmm... The top 5 guys were   1) Blake Griffin   2) Hasheem Thabeet   3) James Harden   4) Tyreke Evans   5) Ricky Rubio  I gotta think maybe he jumps to 3, but Blake was so electric as a prospect I don't see him losing that spot."
"you can actually see the difference in the way we lost to the cavaliers compared to how the mavericks lost to the cavaliers  against us ricky rubio popped off with like 11 3 pointers because our guards couldn't stick on him at the perimeter  against the mavericks it was markkanen and jarrett allen brutalizing their interior defense having career nights with a layup and lob line, scoring 60 points in the paint.   to contextualize the sacramento kings currently have the worst paint defense in the league and they are giving up 50 points per game in the paint  luka's their point guard, yeah he could be playing better defense but if you need your point guard to fix your abysmal paint defense then that's a big problem"
"Aight use ricky rubio then, guy is playing the best basketball of his career right now."
"Indubitably. Wigs will always be my man, but he wasn't the guy this team needed. Love seeing him thrive next to that Davidson kid who got drafted after Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio.  We drastically needed a modern PG, and D'lo seems to be fulfilling that role as of recently. Ant and KAT get most of the looks for the first 3, but lately D'lo has been icy in clutch time"
Not necessarily hate but he gets shitted on so much for not evolving his game but I absolutely love Ricky Rubio!
I drafted him on my fantasy team believing he'd have a revenge season as the starter PG of the Knicks... by the third bad game I cut my losses short and grabbed Ricky Rubio from the FA.
Ricky Rubio would look like MJ out there
"Ainge had a really weird boner for undersized, score-first guards. The team needs a Ricky Rubio-type player to set the table for them."
"There is this one video called War By Inches 2009 playoff edition, I don’t know if you play any sport atm, but if you do watch this before the game and I guarantee you will have a Ricky Rubio under 16s Olympic game where you drop 51,24,12 with 7 steals and the game tying shot to send it to OT from half court, then win the game.   https://youtu.be/ngrEI7VvaOw"
"Bev has been great for defense, but it would be better if we had a lead ball handler who could do a little of everything, but wouldn't mind being the 4th option. Someone like Ricky Rubio, for instance."
Most of the guys in here are well above average.  Someone said Ricky Rubio lol.  Someone did a post a few years ago and if I recall correctly it was Joe Johnson (based on various stats)
"Someone like Tristan Thompson maybe. A couple of the guys I mentioned like Luis Scola, Ricky Rubio, Drew Gooden etc.   An average player should be a starter on half the teams in the league and be able to get playing time on good teams, not just dumpster fires. Marvin Williams was a below average starter and only got playing time cause he was on the bobcats."
"Ricky Rubio, Drew Gooden, Luis Scola"
"Ayton literally averaged better stats on better efficiency with Ricky Rubio and Jamal Crawford. His stats have decreased on this team, because this team needs him to score considerably less than 99% of nba teams would need him to"
Ricky Rubio awkwardly there might be the funniest part.
I think the biggest problem for lakers is ego  Russ would have to play a Ricky Rubio role and lebron a Wiggins role or something
lol they chose ricky rubio and johnny flynn with the two picks immediately before the warriors drafted steph.
"I was at an exhibition game with Ricky Rubio playing at the first row. Rubio is hella slow and unathletic as compared to the average nba player , but hella fast as compared to us .."
The problem with Teague is they let Rubio leave under the guise of saving money and then gave Teague MORE money.  Rubio needed a new start but that’s our Ricky and we are very protective of him.
Well Ricky Rubio makes 17 million a year so that would be his starting point. 20 million feels about right assuming he doesn’t take a low ball offer to compete on a good team.
I feel Ricky Rubio would be less than ideal compensation for CJ..
As a Celtics fan I love Ricky Rubio. Think he’s exactly the type of PG that Tatum and Brown need.
"Ricky ""Russell Westbrook"" Rubio"
Ricky Rubio is going to be one of the most important players for the Cavs.
"Rubio has been huge for us - even with Mobley, we'd be among the worst teams without Ricky. And it's amazing to think we got him for a guy putting up 4/2/1 (and that only with rounding) on 33/24/75 splits. I doubt Boston ever explored it, but if they had traded for Rubio (even giving up Marcus Smart) they would likely be doing a lot better this year."
"Russ was also awful in games 1-4 that series as OKC went down 3-1, he got owned by Ricky Rubio   That game 6 was literally the only time that it was more on PG than on Russ lol"
Same reason why ricky rubio was an advanced stats god.
"So who after that? Danny green, Ricky Rubio, or someone else? Ironically Ricky may be the 6th best player of the draft - he just happened to get picked before curry. Lol"
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills
RIP Ricky Rubio.  I haven't seen a ghost impact a basketball game like that since Kadeem Hardison in the Sixth Man.
And that phantom's name?  Ricky Rubio
As soon as I saw Rubio shooting I knew it was over. Having flashbacks to every clutch game for us where it depended on him and it went poorly every time. Still miss him though. Love you Ricky
Ricky Rubio is a double agent for the Suns
ricky rubio still winning games for the suns u love to see it
i hope this comment section is full of fellow members of the ricky rubio fan club (and despite the ending i don't mean this sarcastically)
"Sit down and ask yourself honestly, are the Cavs contenders with a team of Jarrett Allen, Kevin Love, Lauri Markkanen, Darius Garland, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Mobley?  Just think about it please.  In no universe are they contenders, just like how the Hawks weren't contenders in 2015."
Thank the T Wolves for picking Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
Lol. I got my replies mixed up.  I actually think Ricky Rubio is pretty massively underrated by this sub. I bet he had a good hand in helping Booker become a better player.
"I guess, but I'd still rather have someone like Ricky Rubio instead of Smart creating half-court offense."
"Borders more on assholery than me being petty, but I lowkey get excited every time Anthony Edwards has a bad game. The ROY race last year really soured my opinion of him as a result of Timberwolve fans relentlessly shitting on LaMelo. One of the most egregious takes I saw was one of them claiming his peak was Ricky Rubio."
"Hasheem Thabeet went second overall in a draft that featured Blake Griffin, James Harden, Curry, Derozan, Brandon Jennings and Ricky Rubio within the first 10 picks.   It’s almost like teams misevaluate players constantly."
The Ricky Rubio disrespect

Evan Mobley Darius Garland Jarrett Allen Lauri Markannen Collin Sexton Isaac Okoro Ricky Rubio Cedi Osman
Ricky Rubio and Dean Wade busking on the street with their banjos after the game.
"Ay don't even diss ricky rubio he is the goat, man imagine how busted our team would he with a pg rotation of cp3, rubio, payne.  Man I want rubio back"
"Bingo. If any casuals think that you can just cheese the two man game for an entire playoff run, they’re in for a rude awakening. A healthy AD and LeBron are a formidable duo, but they’re going to need Russ to be a stellar 3rd option if they want to go deep and we all know what Russ is and isn’t capable of. Ricky Rubio got the best of him a few years back lol."
Lol right? Please find me a compilation of Mike Conley or Ricky Rubio pushing people in mid air or smacking them in the face?

Ricky Rubio
"Perhaps, but they also should have targeted a veteran leader like Ricky Rubio or TJ McConnel in the off-season.  They haven’t done Silas or the young guys any favors with their roster being devoid of mentors and leaders.  Edit:  they should definitely be looking to add those veteran leader type players now and in the next off-season imo."
Ricky Rubio
It’s Donovan’s fault that he decided to trap Ricky Rubio but not Damian Lillard. Also not going small against Houston twice was stupid
They should trade Westbrook to the Cavs for Ricky Rubio and Kevin Love.
In terms of pure passing I would go: Chris Paul Trae Young Ricky Rubio Nikola Jokic Josh Giddey - I know heaps biased but in terms of pure passing I genuinely reckon the man is very much up there. Watch some thunder games if U disagree.
"love me some Ricky Rubio, it's just so tough to crack that top tier and he doesn't go for it in the same way he used to.  If we were talking 2008 era Olympic Ricky Rubio he absolutely belongs."
"In Hindsight probably everyone chooses Steph. But looking at the actual picks, LAC, and  OKC, didn't mess up the pick. Sacto didn't either, Tyreke just fell off.  Steph probably doesn't become Steph at all those places either.  &amp;#x200B;  here is the picks to make it easier for everyone trying to discuss.  &amp;#x200B;  1. Blake Griffin - Los Angeles Clippers 2. Hasheem Thabeet - Memphis Grizzlies 3. James Harden - Oklahoma City Thunder 4. Tyreke Evans - Sacramento Kings 5. Ricky Rubio - Minnesota Timberwolves 6. Jonny Flynn - Minnesota Timberwolves 7. Stephen Curry - Golden State Warriors."
My defense would fall asleep too if I was near Ricky Rubio.
"Bro, they were down 13 after 3 to Darius Garland and... Ricky Rubio, I guess (I don't know who the Cavs second best player is with Sexton, Mobley and Allen out)? They're far from unbeatable."
Ricky Rubio? More like Rick(et)y Rubio
I have to thank Ricky Rubio for growing that beard now he's got his new hairstyle because without the beard my wife would think he was really really hot
"I think Monty is still more of a floor raiser as evidenced by how much improved the Suns were in his first season in 19-20 compared to 18-19, though I also think you can attribute a lot of the improvement to Ricky Rubio too, who is also an incredible floor-raiser as well.   Monty's a very good coach too for this team even if they have transcended ""upswing"" status to now ""contender"" status, so I guess he can be considered in both categories."
Somehow this game goes to quad OT and ends in a triple-bang by Ricky Rubio
"Dude, it's the same link and if i cared enough i'd record my screen and show how both links lead to the same place. But that's just a waste of my time.  Anyways. the reason i feel steph has more substance that lebron is because lebron has been hyped well before he was in the league, he was on the cover of SI while still in high school. They've been promoting him for years and years, because ultimately, the NBA is a business and it needs a face. Jordan was gone and the league had lost it's face. They made their bet on this young kid from Akron, OH, and for the most part he's lived up to it. He's an incredible, once-in-a-gerenation athlete, and a great basketball player. But then this skinny kid, all of 6'2"" mostly unhyped, drafted after the likes of Ricky Rubio (who is actually having a really nice season on CLE) and Tyreke Evans comes outta nowhere to completely change the way the game of basketball is played. Lebron didn't change the game, he's just really good at it. Steph changed everything. That's why i think he has more substance. He wasn't a part of the hype machine until he couldn't be denied. He went from not making the all-star team in 2013 to MVP of the league in 2015. His game re-invented the game. Heck even Dwade said just the other day that Steph is on the Mt. Rushmore of folks who have changed the game. Steph's hype all came about due to his play, i can't say the same about lebron. People have been told to like Lebron for a long time. No one was told to like stephen wardell curry, his play just demanded it.      Anyways that's just how i feel about it.      And i'm not flairing up because i don't work at Chotchkie's"
Ricky Rubio like 5 yrs ago would do a good job. Now days....uhh Fred Van Vleet? Dillon Brooks? Idk

In this case it's because he plays just like Ricky Rubio for 3 quarters. Rubio is also a common comparison because cp3 took his roster spot via trade so there's a connection.
Why do people keep using Ricky Rubio as a comparison to criticize a player or as a knock on them. Ricky Rubio is a good player. Lol. There are far worse guys you could use in this situation.
Chris Paul in the first 3 quarters: Ricky Rubio   Chris Paul in the 4th quarter: MJ
Chant it for Ricky Rubio.
Ricky Rubio
i think you’re forgetting about ricky rubio
Is James harden even better than Ricky Rubio currently
Magic shaq is quick asf. I think he would basically be a giannas or taller zion. The game changes base off generational players.   Shaq is one of the main reasons people started shooting jumpshots and not wanting to play center.   Defense just make him a on the best help defenders. Play a zone defense.   A modern day shaq team would be like.   Lonzo-  zach lavine - Robert covington-  Marcus Morris- Shaq   Ricky rubio- Paul George- Harrison Barnes- Bobby Portis- Shaq   Last Deaaron fox- Duncan Robinson- kawhi- joe ingles- Shaq
Rudy Gobert or Ricky Rubio
"Honestly, seems like a bunch of excuses. ""Ricky Rubio induced psychosis"" is a dead give away. How many other players had Ricky fucking Rubio induced psychosis to? If it was like Draymond Green, I would get it but Rubio?? Sounds like excuses."
"He was good to very good in the playoffs earlier in his career especially 2016, but let’s go year by year since KD left. It’s a mix of bad matchups, poor personal play, and poor teammate play when he actually gets it together.   2017: Garbage team vs a very well rounded team. Most comically lopsided on/off numbers I’ve ever seen. +15 while he was on the court, -58 when he was on the bench.   2018: Ricky Rubio induced psychosis and insanely bad tunnel vision until game 5 when he started playing very well. Paul George goes off for 4 points in the elimination game, but Westbrook simultaneously put them in that position but also was the only reason they won a second game.   2019: Shot like shit, tunnel vision on Dame. Team shot pretty badly as a whole, but Westbrook was the highest volume offender by far  2020: Torn quad and had covid, and went against probably the worst possible matchup for the small ball rockets. Turns out the team with Anthony Davis can do small ball better!  2021: Sixers a horribly matchup for the Wiz, but he also shot like shit against their elite defense. Not many bright spots for any Wiz players this series. Scott Brooks coaching made it all worse as the cherry on top, except for laying the blueprint for the Hawks to exploit Simmons a round later"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"Real talk I don't think there were a lot of secondary ball-handler options that the Lakers could've pursued outside of vet min guys like Ish Smith.  I still think that a Buddy Hield trade was the way to go, but other than that if they wanted another point guard they would've had to flip KCP for Ricky Rubio or something along those lines."
They have Ricky Rubio aka mini LeBron they’ll be fine

I'll just assume that's because he hasn't played many minutes with Ricky Rubio
I think their best player might be Ricky Rubio.  Team frequently looks like crap when he's on the bench.  +14.8 on/off seems to support my rubiobro take
This wolves team could use Ricky Rubio
"And the only reason you were in that game is because all the bullshit Rubio was throwing up fell in somehow. Plus the refs reverted back to last year when Tricky Ricky jumped into Al.   Plus, Jaylen is the best player by far of anyone out tonight."

Ricky Rubio: But He Has A Shot Now Edition is gonna do some real damage
Who needs Steph Curry when you have Ricky Rubio?
"Sengun was good, but the rockets have some issues for sure. I felt like the suns played great defense, but the rockets also helped us out by just giving us the ball over and over again. Is KPJ the answer long-term at point guard? If so he's going to have to turn a corner in terms of ball security at some point. Feels like a team that could really ebenfit from a game manager veteran type point guard ie Ricky Rubio tbh, right now just felt like a bunch of guys running around trying to do their own thing and being very loose with the ball."
The disrespect to timberwolves legend... idk anyone who has ever signed there willingly? Ricky Rubio/Jeff Teague?
Ricky Rubio type beat
"I don’t think they need an *elite* playmaker, but definitely do need someone who is looking to find his teammates open looks consistently.   Which is why it was so disappointing when the Celtics used their max cap space on Kemba. We needed a point guard who was a more natural playmaker, but can still go out there and score 14-18 a night. Not a volume shooter who, rather inconveniently, is also a defensive liability and has an extensive injury history.   We needed someone like Malcolm Brogdon, who was also available that summer and would have cost far less than Kemba too. Or even a guy like Ricky Rubio, who really focuses on finding his teammates quality looks. Maybe someone like Lonzo Ball becomes available, I think his fit is also good with the Celtics."
"We drafted Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio back to back instead of Curry. Life is meaningless, ask me anything."
"I think Ricky Rubio is definitely in this weird category. I’m not sure Blake is, we will have to see him play. I seriously doubt there’s any chance that Rubio went from having a career year internationally and in Phoenix last year(2 years ago? Idk)to whatever the fuck is happening in Minny. I hope he can get on a team that utilizes him properly."
Please release Ricky Rubio. He deserves better.
"Salvaging a top 3 pick, is the only way to win IMO. I'm not advocating that they need to tank. Bottom three teams gets the same percentage anyway. But maybe shuffling guys like Ricky Rubio and whoever they can move, just to get some cap heading into 2021 free agency.   Temple and Thad has been amazing for the Bulls."
"he was trash, by nba player standards. he was a white trash version of ricky rubio, with all due respect."
"I guess?  Honestly the Wolves are so garbage and I don't even like anyone on the team. I used to love Rubio but he's been so awful this season.   I've liked teams like Portland and Utah in the past but I wouldn't say I'm a fan of them. Mainly was a fan of Utah for Ricky, Don, and Gobert. Portland because of Dame and CJ.   Atm I wouldn't even know what my favorite team is. I guess Miami just because I love Jimmy and their whole culture in general but I wouldn't say I'm too invested anymore.   I'm not even ashamed of it. Call me a fairweather fan if you want but this garbage team has won 2 playoff series (both in 2004) in it's 32 years of existence. It completely squandered KG's prime and sold it's future for one first round exit in 2018. I'm sick of this shit."
idk if ryan saunders knew who ricky rubio was tbh
"jason williams will be the top answer in this thread, and i agree he was a highlight machine, but he wasn't good at basketball at all. ""underrated"" means he was better than we think he was. if anything, JWIll was overrated, because he had a bunch of highlights and wasn't good at basketball. somehow a worse shooting version of ricky rubio"
imagine having Ricky Rubio and not playing him as the primary ballhandler when he's on the court  What the fuck Wolves?
Jae Crowder and Ricky Rubio.
"Ricky Rubio came and went, but I miss him everyday"

I want to hear Giannis and Ricky Rubio have a podcast so I could fall asleep at night to their voices.
Ricky Rubio for sure.

Ricky Rubio has a weird ass score line (or is that a normal one for him?   I don’t watch much of him.
"His vision/passing ability is so fun to watch. The dude plays with a flair in his passing, too.  Honestly, he reminds me an upgraded Ricky Rubio that can actually shoot. Similar defensive instincts, but quicker and taller. Extremely crafty and willing passer. Not quite the handle, but makes up for it by taking and making open or contested shots.  After watching him so far this season, I'm pretty sure he could get my fat ass an open look on the PNR."
"agreed! also, UH OH, it's reactionary r/nba time!  he was better than Luka last week, is he Ricky Rubio without defense now? lol maybe I don't understand why every star having a bad game deserves a post. lol everyone has em."
"Great response, genuinely.   If you want to compare superlatives used about the two you should listen to Taylor’s semi recent podcasts about the playoffs/finals. He seems genuinely shocked at AD’s awareness and mobility and really goes heavy on the modern Bill Russell comparisons, which is basically the most superlative defensive compliment in Ben Taylor’s book:   I do agree that KG was the best perimeter defender of his era amongst bigs but AD is also arguably the best at that among bigs currently. The problem is you’re seeing more and more bigs with KG type mobility so it’s becoming less standout ish in a way. You have guys like Ben Simmons, Giannis, Bam, Jonathan Isaac as well, a collection of 6’11 hyper mobile defensive minded guys the likes we’ve never seen at one time.   Also for DRAPM, it is ultimately an all in one statistic. And clearly has its flaws. On that same list you linked, Jokic is top 20 in DRAPM, Eric Bledsoe has a higher DRAPM than Paul George or Kawhi, and Ricky Rubio is higher than Lebron. None of that makes sense, which puts into question how good of a metric it is at assessing overall defensive impact."
Good: Facundo Campazzo   Bad: Ricky Rubio
"Best scorer yes, but Ricky Rubio won the MVP of the WC  As an argentinian I still remember him singlehandedly keeping Serbia alive on that game against us"
Ricky Rubio made Oubre and Baynes look like legit..
"OP listed Eric Bledsoe and Ricky Rubio lol, I think Bynum fits right in. No one said all-timers only, just quality players."
Only Nash was drafted by the suns. Ricky Rubio is now considered a great PG?
"The only way those two would be elite at shorter heights is if we assumed they'd be more skilled, which clearly you're not assuming for giannis even though he arguably is a harder worker than both (although maybe not a smarter one). If we didn't assume that then Lebron and KD would be far from elite. Bron doesn't have the shot, footwork, or handle to survive as a 6'3 pg. At best hes athletic Ricky rubio. Not exactly sure what KDs height is but if he's not tall enough to be a SG then he would maybe be jamal murray"
"Sure, let's say our guys were soft, and they didn't play defense. But is it also their fault that he basically filled up the whole roster with old Bulls who he signed for too much, was involved in negotiating Wiggins' contract hamstringing the rest of the team, traded Ricky Rubio for Jeff fucking Teague, and traded away Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen for one half-healthy volatile season with Jimmy? Nah. Fuck Tom Thibodeau"
"Clearly Stephen Curry is washed, he is down 32 points, I think we should trade him for Ricky Rubio /s"
"This is a wild take to me.  Lebron has more gravity, and he obviously has a shit ton of experience on Jokic. But jokic’s court vision is second to none. He’s seriously a savant when it comes to being able to look at the floor and knowing what will happen 5 seconds into the future.  Just as an off the top of my head example, checkout this [no look assist from his game last night](https://twitter.com/msinger/status/1346182108524343296?s=21).  He knows the nuggets have (or should have) a guy in the far corner. He knows that faking towards Monte in the near corner and/or a cutting Gary Harris will cause a rotation from Rubio along the baseline, but he’s gotta sell it. So he stares down the area between Morris abs Harris, prompting Rubio to rotate, because he has to. Jokic then, without resetting or anything, flicks it cross court to Facu (a small target) **dead center** to allow him to smoothly catch and shoot. No having to corral a wild pass, reset his feet, then shoot. Just catch and shoot. Perfect pass.  I suspect as he’s doing this, he’s watching for Rubio from his peripheral vision (though probably can’t see facu) and if Ricky doesn’t rotate he just hits the cutting Gary Harris for the free 2 points.  That’s just one example of his court vision taken from a single play from his most recent game. And he’s been doing this same shit pretty routinely for 4-5 years now."
Team USA needs a steady vet presence with all the young guys. Ricky Rubio would be perfect with this group.
"Mike Conley, CP3, Ricky Rubio."
"Shaq says this kind of thing way more than most NBA analysts, which is weird, because everyone already knows he was a GOAT level player. Nobody is questioning Shaq's legacy, he doesn't need to do this. You don't see Kenny Smith talking shit when Ricky Rubio signs a contract"
Bro Ricky Rubio could punch my mom and I would go and make sure his hand was ok but even I know he wasn't the key to our success and that we're way better with Conley
Ricky “Imma always be behind Harden so he dont do a stepback 3” Rubio
"Yes, because Ricky Rubio is the one piece Utah is missing to get a ring lol"
"he’s had some nice dimes this game too, hope he finds his way to the opening lineup.  Rubio should be starting if DLo keeps stinking up the joint, the offense looks so much better w Ricky running the show"
"Highjacking ,sorry about it. But is this and american thing? Or all english speakers do the same? As a spaniard we never did this up until cristiano ronaldo. And he is a massive douche doing it for selling his brand, that's all. Also he is the only exception. i can think of Pau Gasol is not ""pe ge"" or ricky rubio ""erre erre""(that one hurts) I understand KD for instance cos it is catchy but calling Allen Iverson ""ei ai"" sounds as bad as his financial situation. So is this a historic thing for english speakers?pure curiosity."
"A lot of people who were low on him didn't seem to appreciate HOW good he was in Euroleague.  Most Euroleague prospects are either young and raw players who get picked for promising skillsets and athletic tools - e.g. Dragan Bender put up 2.1 ppg in 11 mpg for a sub-bar Maccabi Tel Aviv team before being picked #4. Or else they are more established players without much upside when get picked as win-now prospects, like Bogdan Bogdonavac who was drafted at 25.  Meanwhile Luka was the youngest ever Euroleague MVP during his 18 year old season en route to leading Real to a Euroleague title. He also led Slovenia - not exactly a traditional basketball powerhouse - to the Eurobasket title alongside Goran Dragic.  On top of his pedigree, there was no shortage of film of Doncic playing against legit NBA talents. In the Eurobasket tournament alone, he matched up against Porzingis' Latvia team, the French team with Boris Diaw and Evan Fournier and the Spanish team with both Gasol brothers, both Hernanogomez brothers, Ricky Rubio and Sergio Rodriguez.  That's a much more impressive track record than the level of talent that say, DeAndre Ayton, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young played against in the NCAA, and that's not even considering the fact that Doncic was playing against grown men while the NCAA prospects were playing against other kids their age. For comparison, Ayton's Wildcats got blown tf out by a Buffalo Bulls team with no future NBA players in the first round of the NCAA tournament."
Ricky Rubio  Zach Randolph  Tyson Chandler  Serge Ibaka  .  .  .  baby poo  .  .  .  Kevin Garnett
"Is he though? Suns and Wolves fans love Ricky, but I don’t think that would be the consensus across the league. Especially last year when DLo was coming off an all star bid and got a bag.  I still am very thankful we chose Rubio."
"I read this as ""which player under the age of 23 could the Wolves get to play NEXT to KAT"". If that was the case I'd suggest Aaron Gordon; he's over 23 but he'd be perfect as your guy who can guard wings and play around the rim.  Off note, the Clippers would like to offer you one slightly-used Marcus Morris for Ricky Rubio."
If Ricky Rubio is your second best player you’re lottery bound
"Ricky Rubio, the Utah Jazz's 2nd best player?"
They just need a guy to make plays and run defense. He sucked ass trying to score in the playoffs last season but he also averaged six assists.   He’d be surrounded by four scorers AND a stretch center. He can afford to be a non shooter since he’s not playing next to Giannis.  He’s also probably the only legit “playmaker” that the Clippers can afford with their lackluster assets right now. I’d love to see Ricky Rubio on the team but there’s nothing that the Clippers have that the Wolves would want
"Yeah, really too bad Towns can't win with guys like Ricky Rubio. Gobert couldn't do that."
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
"So weird to see Wiggins’ development. Back when he was playing with Rubio, Andrew looked elite at finding lanes to cut off-ball and finishing when Ricky feeds him. So different from his playing style now."

"This just in: CP3 is better than Ricky Rubio.  Lol just messing, but seriously, CP3s been in the league how many years now? This shit ain’t a surprise."
Why is Ricky Rubio playing off ball next to DLo
Wall is pretty much fast-twitch Ricky Rubio. Not quite as good at passing but pretty damn close. They have exactly the same strengths and weaknesses
Ben Simmons is really just down under Ricky Rubio.
"He was our draft pick... along with Maple Jordan Andrew Wiggins, and Spanish star Ricky Rubio....  Not to mention Townes and others... none of them ever lived up to KG's talent.  Probably why the T'wolves have always sucked."
You mean the guy who his teammates didn't like and just chased stats?   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/5/19/5730964/ricky-rubio-questions-kevin-love-leadership  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/5/19/5730964/ricky-rubio-questions-kevin-love-leadership  Feuded with the GM and the owner too.   https://www.si.com/nba/2012/12/11/kevin-love-minnesota-timberwolves-david-kahn-glen-taylor  The owner publicly called out his defense as well.
And to think they could have had Harden and Curry but they drafted Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio instead
They had Ricky Rubio who averaged 9ast and 13 points. Paul only had 3 more ppg this season granted he does shoot better than Rubio. None of the free agent PGs are as good of passers as CP3 and not many of them have that deadly midrange shot. They’ll be cheaper because they won’t help the team as much as he did.
They’ll get Ricky Rubio and they’ll like it
"Oversees selection. A player is currently with an international team, and cannot sign with the NBA team due to their current contract. (Ex: Ricky Rubio).   Look up Oscar Schmidt. Very talented player from Brazil. He never wanted to go to the NBA. You draft him anyway just in case he changes his mind."
So that is a defense of taking Ricky Rubio and Johnny Flynn ahead of him?
Yea I remember when people said Lamelo was taller Ricky Rubio and my first response was GREAT
You mean Tall Australian Ricky Rubio?
The Horford one I agree had mostly to do with years. With CP3 he legit rehabbed his value. He went from being considered John Wall level negative value to being a positive contract. I even forgot to mention he traded Ricky Rubio from that trade for another pick lol.
And I was getting pissed on for saying we didn’t need cp3 and would rather have Rubio on the suns earlier this year. Suns did Ricky wrong.  Hope he goes somewhere good.
If Ricky Rubio win Gold with Spain. He's a HOF   @me bitches
I love Ricky Rubio.  Want to see him get a ring
"Interesting factoid: a full third of all the male players in the Olympics have been through Spain's ACB. From Pau to Luka to Ingles, Scola, Deck, Campazzo, Mike Tobey, Prepelic, and Ricky Rubio, they all have the ACB in common.  Here's [**a picture of the current or former ACB players in the Olympics**](https://www.acb.com/Documentos/Static/369443scr-58820.jpg)."
"Ricky ""Spanish Patty"" Rubio"
Ricky Rubio with Spain transform into Steve Nash
Ricky Rubio!!!!!!
"Well Ricky Rubio was nowhere near as good as Luka at that age. Luka had a championship, league MVP, and finals MVP by 18. Rubio had none of those things."
"Ainge has a weird boner for score-first PGs I guess.  One has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  AND, if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match for mid-tier contracts (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core."
It so obvious that Ricky Rubio drives the Spanish offence. Without him running the point spain looks lost on offence - can't decide when or how to make the entry pass.
Ricky Rubio was the same but that fact didn’t make him great like Luka
Ricky Rubio was considered a promising player. he had a lot of European accolades when he was young. luka is on another level.
I….don’t know about that. I don’t know well Luka would have done against the Warriors. Or even Ricky Rubio guarding him from behind 😂 what were the Jazz thinking that round ahahahah
"Just the next ricky rubio, gonna light up the olympics but can he get it done for an 82 game season plus playoffs /s"
"on the right team with the right PG such as Ricky Rubio, Trez would be easily the #1 most dominant scorer in the NBA"
"But Ricky Rubio literally can’t shoot. At all. Jumpers, lay ups. Nothing. For being focussed on fundamentals, they may have missed one."
Traded for Ricky Rubio
They should try to get like a Teague or Ricky Rubio.
"&gt;“Over there in Europe, I’ve been at a lot of these camps, they’re sticking to the basic fundamentals and that’s why they are great shooters and great passers like (Spain’s) Ricky Rubio.""  If only we had someone in the US that was great at passing like Ricky Rubio. Like a Trae Young or Ja Morant-type player. Unlucky those guys are all from other countries."
Yea that doesn’t mean anything Ricky Rubio was playing in the olympics at 17
"FIBA Patty Mills, Pau Gasol, Ricky Rubio"
Ricky Rubio
"Ricky Rubio. I genuinely believe he's one of the 5 best passers in the league but doesn't usually make those lists.   His lack of offensive game holds him back since guys know he's just gonna pass, bit I routinely see passes from him where it's obvious he's just seeing 3 steps ahead of the defense."
Ricky Rubio
"Ricky Rubio. Such an amazing passer. I'm convinced that if he wasn't drafted by Minny, he would be a perennial All-star candidate."
Ricky Rubio
"&gt; And why someone like Ricky rubio isn't automatically in the top percentile of bball iq despite being unathletic and a good passer.  Why wouldn't Rubio be in top %, what else is that guy doing that keeps him on the court year after year?"
"Once again there are two sides of the ball. Giannis can see a breakdown happening and direct players while moving himself in order to prevent easy buckets. Meanwhile jokic gets blown by on multiple occasions and is infamous for frustration fouls in transition.  And also once again just because jokic is a good playmaker and can get 10 assists does not make him automatically smarter. Bball iq is more than just passing, which is why no one calls elite pure scoreres(kd) or bigs in general(hakeem) dumb even if they aren't the greatest playmaker. And why someone like Ricky rubio isn't automatically in the top percentile of bball iq despite being unathletic and a good passer. Using playmaking as their differentiator is also dumb bc giannis is prob the 4th best passer of all active bigs rn"
How is Ricky Rubio only 30….
"Ricky Rubio.   I still vividly remember being stoked that he's the first player to be drafter who was born in the 90s. I was 16 and was a freshman in college, so the draft was a great ice breaker and made friends."
Ricky Rubio getting drafted in 09 lol   Watching his Spain and Olympics highlights was my crack   Dirk got me really into ball in 11 since the city was so engaged but I started w Ricky
How about Ricky Rubio plus 2029 2nd round pick for Dame?
"I don’t really understand what you are even trying to say here... are you claiming that playing with Ricky Rubio would somehow cripple jayson Tatum and tank his growth?  You obviously wouldn’t want to have a team where you are relying on RR to be the offensive focal point and knock down shots from the perimeter, but I really don’t see what would be so bad about having him on a team like the Celtics where there are plenty of other guys who can get buckets and Rubio could just be a pure distributor.. he’s a great passer, a lot better than kemba at least and Tatum seemed to play fine with him..."
All star? I doubt it. I think his career is Ricky Rubio 2.0. Solid starting PG on a playoff team but that’s it. Lonzo sucks at driving to the basket.
"I'd argue that the one doing the revisionist history here is you.  The reason the Flynn pick was so bad wasn't just that Curry was on the board, it was also that the Wolves picked Ricky Rubio with the pick immediately preceding him. Picking 2 point guards back to back made zero sense at the time, and was *immediately* seen as terrible. If you don't believe me, here's what [Bill Simmons wrote about it](https://grantland.com/features/nba-draft-diary-2009-bill-simmons/) the night it happened:  &gt; So much for Minnesota doing the right thing. The Wolves just took Syracuse’s Jonny Flynn … whom I really like … but … well … he’s a point guard. Didn’t they just take Rubio? Did I black out? You’re going to have two young ball handlers playing together — one who’s 5-foot-11, the other who’s 18 years old and weighs 180 pounds (and 30 of that is his hair), and that’s your plan? Who’s guarding the Kobes and Vinces out of those two? Why didn’t they just take Curry? And why aren’t the ESPN guys wondering about a trade here or, at the very least, murdering this pick? THEY JUST TOOK TWO STRAIGHT POINT GUARDS!!!!!!!!!!"
"Before that trade happened, I though the Wizards had their eyes set on drafting Ricky Rubio."
"Westbrook far above anyone else. He cares too much not to have one. Besides him, Ricky Rubio, Mike Conley, Joe Ingles for obvious reasons, Wes Matthews."
"Assuming Kanye would be a PG, I compared that to the WAR for every PG in the league as per 538  One of the closest matches was T'Wolves legend Ricky Rubio"
I can’t believe that’s Ricky Rubio man.
"True Drexler and Barkley are no where near as athletic and skilled as Felipe Reyes and Juan Carlos Navarro. Imagine how out of place prime John Stockton would look compared to 17 year old Ricky Rubio. Or if Ewing and Robinson were as big and as good at rebounding as Pau and fat Marc Gasol. And Scottie Pippen if he could get the basketball evolution and defensive athleticism of Carlos Jimenez.   And then imagine if prime Michael Jordan could become the athletic equivalent with all the moves of Rudy Fernandez. Maybe then they could play the 2008 team down to the wire, make it fair.  Either team could win a single game obviously, anything can happen with that much talent. But the Dream Team would be favored in a 7 game series."
lol yeah.  must be a Rubio fan. I wonder what Rubio would look like in a Barca jersey.  [Would look weird probably](https://image.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/photos/71193067/display_1500/stock-photo-barcelona-spain-mar-ricky-rubio-regal-fc-barcelona-player-plays-acb-league-match-against-71193067.jpg)
"Pretty cool how far we've come. For awhile fans booed and complained when foreign players were drafted. Then the dream team went overseas and inspired a generation of foreign players. Then Dirk, Gasol, the illustrious Ricky Rubio, Jokic, Giannis and more. Gotta love it!"
Dame was getting cooked by Ricky Rubio bro
Need Ricky Rubio to steer the ship
I’m honestly still happy. We wouldn’t be here if we still had Ricky Rubio. He’s had a hell of a playoff and even though he isn’t playing amazing this finals he’s still playing good especially for someone at 36.
"Not sure if I’m the only one, but as a Wolves fan I always disliked Jennings because he talked bad about Ricky Rubio when they played in Euroleague."
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
Y’all will get Ricky Rubio and you will like it
"Yea the Cavs GM said “I don’t know who we’re going to pick” after the 03 lottery, while the Clippers organization said theres “no guarantees we’re taking Griffin” and said they wanted Ricky Rubio   It’s common practice, just GM speak."
"&gt;Honestly, your team was pretty trash, and people so under rate the value of a good team culture.  Monty Williams and Ricky Rubio definitely put them on an upward trajectory. If they ran it back with last year's team and stayed healthy, I bet they would have been 7th/8th seed. CP3 and Jae are big veteran presences to have on a young team to lead and stabilize it like you were saying. There's no way they make it this far without them. But to say that they were trash last year is an overstatement."
We don’t have Johnny Flynn or Ricky Rubio to take in front of them.
Did you watch the FIBA tournament? We got our shit pushed in and it definitely wasn't 6th men we had out there. Ricky Rubio busted everybody up.
As does ricky rubio.   Honorable mention: brandon knight
the Anthony Edwards and Ricky Rubio relationship is something I greatly enjoy
"A Ricky Rubio shoutout, unexpected but welcomed"
Ricky Rubio is only good against the Lakers.
He is like a worse big Ricky Rubio
"Dream would be CP3 if he really opts-out of his player option, but he has little to no reason to sign for the Bulls tbh lol.  I was also thinking of Ricky Rubio, but he's not a free agent until 2022 and Bulls don't exactly have many assets to play with after trading for Vucevic.  Don't really care where Simmons end up, his flaws are evident and honestly no roster in the NBA currently is gonna be able to fully mask his weaknesses."
"Someone who can pass the ball and defend, but doesnt take away the offense from the others, like Ricky Rubio, or a lights out shooter like Malik Beasley. Maybe a young up and coming prospect like Jarrett Culver"
Yo I just found the podcast look up Gary vee ricky Rubio on YouTube and it’s from Kilgallons pub podcast.
ricky rubio has spent tons of time working on his shot man. It just doesnt happen for some people
"What you think? He’s been partying and slaying putang every summer, same with Ricky Rubio bro parties every summer and shots been broke as a joke every year in the league"
He is a giant sized Ricky Rubio
"Ricky Rubio and a 2nd round pick, final offer."
"I still think it was Saunders  The dude tried playing KAT off ball to have the opposing team focus on him for better looks, but it only lead to guys like Ricky Rubio being expected to score  He took the ball out of KAT’s hands and did nothing with it"
I'd never insult Ricky Rubio like that
6'10 Ricky Rubio give or take
Ricky Rubio and Malik Beasley you say.
"They need some PG laeding the team, a solid, established court general, someone like maybe Ricky Rubio. They also need some surefire offense, which they heavily lacked outside of Embiid, so a good cheap lights out shooter, like Beasley would be really good.  And maybe a promising young aspect to carry on, like Jarrett Culver or Jaylen Nowell.   Huh, thats weird, they're all on the same team."
"Damn, he used to a less handsome Ricky Rubio and taller Lonzo Ball but those 2 actually can shoot 3s now"
Ey 6ers fans you want ricky rubio and malik beasley?
Championship Point Guard Ricky Rubio lol
sixers probably winning with ricky rubio in his current form running the point
Ben Simmons is a 6’11 Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio died for this
"It was a wash in the injury sense comparing what he had in Rubio, then, cuz Ricky was never consistently healthy either. Conley was a better alternative, because he would raise the ceiling more."
Having Ricky Rubio during this series would have been nice.
If you say so. I'm sure you'd be a playoff team if you had Ricky Rubio still /s
Honestly trade him for Ricky Rubio and someone else to make the salaries match
"Ppl heating kemba for not hitting shot , imagine Ricky Rubio lol"
Idk Ricky Rubio shot under 40% fg% and Pritchard is a promising backup that can actually shoot. Rubio is pretty ball dominant when they already have Tatum and Brown that can handle the ball besides smart.  I’d rather keep a quality piece in Tristan Thompson and promise in nesmith
"I’m just saying I think any perimeter lockdown defender is far more important in the playoffs.   Switchable wings are far far far more valuable than interior guys in today’s game. They’re too easy to scheme around in the playoffs when the best threats aren’t Ricky Rubio and Anthony Edwards (sorry Twolves bros).   His defensive capabilities are able to be schemed around unlike Kawhi, Giannis, Draymond, and other wings."
"&gt;Simmons has had putrid performances in the playoffs. Idk how anyone could watch Simmons over the last few years in the playoffs and think he's improved tremendously. He still putting up &lt;10 ppg. That's atrocious.   Never said he had improved tremendously. And there's more to the game than ppg.    &gt;Your original premise was that'd you'd pay $35m for a 7ft Ricky Rubio. However, Simmons is worse than that as Rubio is more aggressive and a terrific ft shooter  Simmons isn't worse. He's better. He's everything Rubio was minus the free throw shooting and average 3pt shooting but he's much better defensively. He's already one of the top 5 defensive players at his position.  &gt;Simmons is meant to be a budding superstar  He is. He's an all star.  And just because someone isn't a superstar doesn't mean they aren't great players."
"&gt;So you think you're better at evaluating talent than the actual guys who are professionally paid to do so? Got it  There's plenty of people that believe Simmons is an overvalued player. I don't think Simmons is that great whereas you and others do.  &gt;As can Simmons. I watched him play on multiple occasions. Yes, I'd prefer a player that can play during the last 5 minutes of elimination games and actually win them as well. McCollum is streaky, but he is playable.   Simmons has had putrid performances in the playoffs. Idk how anyone could watch Simmons over the last few years in the playoffs and think he's improved tremendously. He still putting up &lt;10 ppg. That's atrocious.   Your original premise was that'd you'd pay $35m for a 7ft Ricky Rubio. However, Simmons is worse than that as Rubio is more aggressive and a terrific ft shooter. Simmons is meant to be a budding superstar instead he's sitting on the bench during crunch time."
Would you pay a 7ft Ricky Rubio that has no interest in improving his offensive skillset $35 million?
Idk why people are hating on him so much. If someone told me my team could draft a 7ft Ricky Rubio I'd be ecstatic.  Not every great player is a bucket getter.
The Harden-CP3 Rockets teams of 2018 and 2019 made the Jazz look foolish in the playoffs.  I was at Game 1 of the 2019 series and I remember the Jazz were so desperate to stop Harden they had Ricky Rubio guard him from behind?!?  The Rockets copied the blueprint for beating Gobert from the Warrior series of 2017 and took it to another level.
"Here is Ricky Rubio, a notoriously bad shooter, breaking the world record for shots behind the backboard in 1 minute.  Ben Simmons is a Shaq level shooter.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7nJX2zq9As"
"&gt;  It turned me around on LeBron in 2008.  Kobe, too. Mamba wasn't about to get shown up by teenage Ricky Rubio."
I'd rather have ricky rubio
bean simmons is taller ricky rubio that doesnt look half as handsome
Poor man's Ricky Rubio/Kareem
"Yup, hot take: Ricky Rubio or patty mills would be enough to be better than last year. Maybe not 1-3 good, but 4-6.  Now..  can we find space for one of them (maybe move tt?)  And that's assuming no other big moves."
"I’d also love to see Ricky on the Celtics I think he’d thrive there. Unfortunately I think the only Celtics player the wolves would be really interested in is Smart, and I’m assuming that wouldn’t be an option for Rubio."
"What? A 35-year old earning +40MM per year (2 years) for Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre, an okay-ish young PG project (Jerome) and a FRP? It was an excellent trade."
"Very willing distributor. Once we recoverd some health, with rotations his two main outlets outside of crunch time were Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio the way our sets run. The kid made that functional.  Also as much as Ricky bricking Ants assists drove me nuts he clearly has his ear and Ant listens to his basketball wisdom intently."
This solidifies ricky rubio &gt; john stockton
Did you accidentally create Ricky Rubio?
Harden playing like glorified Ricky Rubio
They forgot about Ricky Rubio too
"i'd also say westbrook luka lowry and ricky rubio are better playmakers than trae, which would put him 11th at best  those first six I listed are just inarguable and you'd have to be a lunatic to say trae is better than any of them"
"Dallas, Goofy Hardworking Euro Bigs With Non Traditional Skillsets And Loyal to a Fault:   C: Nikola Jokić / Boban Marjanovic  PF: Dirk Nowitzki / Kristaps Porziņģis   SF:  Giannis Antetokounmpo / Maxi Kleber  SG:  Goran Dragić / Tomáš Satoranský  PG: Luka Dončić / Ricky Rubio"
"&gt;His playmaking ability at his age is incredible.  IDK if you've seen the younger version of Ricky Rubio...but Trae is definitely better, at least for me, because of his superior shooting, which is kinda nonexistent on Rubio."
Ricky Rubio can at least hit ft's
really good playmaker. but that basically makes him a taller ricky rubio. hardly a no. 2 or even no. 3 on a championship team
This team badly misses Ricky Rubio.
Ricky Rubio gotta score more.

"Ricky Rubio with the team-high +11 on 0-7 shooting, while Collin Sexton has the team-low -11 on 8-12 shooting, is really the story of this Cavs team, lol"
Did motherfuckin' Ricky Rubio just go 0/7 for a game best +11?
have you heard about our lord and savior Ricky Rubio?
Ricky Rubio leads the team in +\- with +11 off the bench and 0 points
Honestly. Ricky Rubio would look good. Though Cleveland getting another guard wouldn't help them much.
Lmao all you need is a playmaker Point guard that will set the pace and keep the ball moving.  Extra plus if that PG is a lockerroom leader and great teammate  I literally just described Ricky Rubio  Teams tank for a Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum.. the notion that you have to trade 1 because they are really good but the team sucks is just stupid. It’s not a Ben Simmons situation where he sucks and that affected the team
They need Ricky Rubio but they're much more likely to just wait for Rubio's contract to expire so they can sign him outright. At 18M/year he's not worth trying to match that salary.
They need to grab Ricky Rubio
"What could a Rubio package look like? Richardson, one of the young guys, and a 2nd?    Feels like it isn’t enough considering how well Ricky has played but he also doesn’t fit Cleveland’s timeline"
"It’s too bad they don’t really have a way to match salaries for Ricky Rubio, cause I feel like he’d be perfect for them. The shooting of a Rubio + Smart backcourt might be a bit of an issue, but I feel like The Jays are good enough to overcome that."
Do I need to? He’s a 33% 3 point shooter. That’s right on par with what he’s done previously. 33% puts him behind noted 3 point sniper Ricky Rubio
These are Ricky Rubio #s.   BTW you should be comparing players based on TS%.    Smart compare to other 2nd tier guards on his pay tier takes most of his shots from 3
"You don’t trade either unless you’re getting a bonafide star… I wouldn’t trade for depth. The Celtics need playmakers. Both Tatum and Brown need to improve their playmaking but they need a couple of players who know how to run an NBA offense. They don’t have to be All Star caliber. Someone like Ricky Rubio would be great there, Monte Morris off the bench. They just need a couple of players to break up the iso ball so that it’s a last resort rather than a first resort."
"That’s wonderful but he’s not some top notch distributor. If they want to actually do something like that they need to bring in a true pass first point guard, and it doesn’t have to be some elite guy it can be TJ McConnell or Ricky Rubio. Smart doesn’t score enough to put any strain on a defense in the P&amp;R and he’s not a good enough of a pure passer to set the table for his teammates. We’re talking about a guy that’s averaged a hair over 4 assists a game in his career, he’s not going to double that and unlock an offense overnight. He’s best suited as a spot up shooter on offense that can occasionally run the offense and play elite defense."
"Luka isn't even one of the more attractive white guys in the in the NBA.  Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love, Ricky Rubio, Steven Adams, and Chandler Parsons wash him easy."
Feels like he plays like how everyone thought Ricky Rubio would coming into the league
It's so weird to me that he's such a poor shooter now. I remember in like 2015-16 be was taking and making 3s pretty regularly. He definitely wasn't just being left open behind the line. Now he's being treated like young Ricky Rubio from 3pt range.
"You guys don't even need a PG that can get buckets or whatever. Tatum and Brown can do all of that - you just need a savvy playmaker who can control the offense and direct traffic, a Ricky Rubio-type guy who's unselfish and is happy to just distribute the ball and make it easier for the Jays to get buckets"
Ricky Rubio was 1 point and two steals away like what??
"It’s a good problem to have, but the Cavs need to get to the bottom of why they get a big lead and then just lose it.  They’re doing the right things early, consistently.  Suddenly the other team is right back in it.  One problem is that we used to have guys who could just go get a bucket.  Collin Sexton is struggling with that right now.  I think the lanes are clogged up and I know he’s not shooting well from 3.  Ricky Rubio has a huge impact right now but he’s not really someone you want to depend on long term.  A lot of Cavs fans point at poor rotations and it seems like JB Bickerstaff never calls a timeout when he desperately needs one.  I’m having fun watching this though and if we’re being honest, there’s a world where this Cavs team is utter shit, can’t score and doesn’t play any defense.  I’m excited that’s not what we’re seeing right now."

Y’all had Ricky Rubio and Wiggins and still couldn’t win anything
"Haha, honestly, I think you guys should get Ricky Rubio. Not an all star and not going to score as much as CJ would but he would be a great PG for you guys."
Feels like Celtics need a floor general pace setter like Ricky Rubio..  Marcus Smart is not a starting PG for them
I just watched a play where Rubio threw the ball to Garland after dribbling the clock down and Garland dribbled like 4 times and hit a fadeaway almost out of bounds on the baseline and on the PA I heard assist Ricky Rubio. It's wildly inflated.
Cade himself isn’t all that. Looks like a taller Ricky Rubio
Exhibit A: Ricky Rubio signing with the Suns.
"In all seriousness, both the Celtics and the Clippers potentially create a case that if you're getting 2-stars that they should be at different positions so they can bring a different skillset to the table. There is a clear redundancy with star wing duos.  That all being said, I really think what both teams need is a Ricky Rubio type player (old school table-setting PG)."
It's still early in the season and we can blame a lot of it on a new coach and potentially lack of a leader.  I personally think that a lack of a floor general hurts too. I love the idea of Ricky Rubio on the team but they'll ride out this season seeing if Marcus Smart can be their version of Ricky Rubio.
"You can blame Danny because at the end of the day his mismanagement of Assets has caused the Celtics to backpedal for a few consecutive seasons now. Stevens was right to make the Jays the face of the franchise but that transition was very, very ugly.  But it's still early in the season and we can blame a lot of it on a new coach and potentially lack of a leader. I personally think that a lack of a floor general hurts too. I love the idea of Ricky Rubio on the team but they'll ride out this season seeing if Marcus Smart can be their version of Ricky Rubio."
It was specifically so we had enough to sign Ricky Rubio. In that context it's not as bad
Drafting Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio  over Steph Curry
Where’s Ricky Rubio when you need him
Without a doubt the coolest and most disrespectful one is the Harden shimmy after crossing over Ricky Rubio. Crowd went nuts too.   https://youtu.be/1tDvSCmSzFc
"Read my comment again. Sexton fits well next to Rubio and plays well/better next to Rubio versus SexLand. Sexton plays and looks BETTER with Rubio versus Sexton with Garland. Not Garland and Rubio.  I think Garland's potential is overhyped and overrated. This seems like the same hype people had for Kyrie but Kyrie was a better rookie. I don't think any Garland led team will ever make it deep in the playoffs.  I could say the same about build around Garland. Garland looks worse in our offense than Ricky Rubio who has been traded or let walk by his last four teams. Our other promising young players look much better next to Rubio than Garland but that's ignored.  Unless Garland makes a giant leap this season, I don't foresee him being our PG of the future. He'll be an Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic(with a better start to their career) type who could be a part of a championship team but not be the reason they ever got there."
Taller Ricky Rubio who shoots 40% from 3 on high volume
"Man I'm not gonna lie, I miss Ricky Rubio"
"Taller Ricky Rubio is still good, that’s what Giddey is right now.   But yeah it’d be disappointing if that’s what Cade becomes"
I see him as a taller Ricky Rubio. For his hype that’s a bust.
Josh Selby and Ricky Rubio for me.
Compensates for Ricky Rubio going Lillard mode earlier as he ALWAYS DOES AGAINST THE LAKERS FOR SOME REASON
I love Ricky Rubio so much
Ricky Rubio heat check got me feeling some type of way
Ricky Rubio 6moty
"I love Ricky Rubio. Therefore, I love the Cavs"
wait they got Ricky Rubio for Taurean prince and 2nd round pick?  What the fuck???
Ricky rubio is kinda nice. He torched us a few days ago
Ricky Rubio is our best non-draft acquisition since LeBron
Ricky Rubio was such a good get for our team my goodness.
ricky rubio has worked wonders for us alleviating ball handling duties from sexton and allowing him to play offball even when garland is sitting/out
"I mean is saying that present day Ricky Rubio is a better player in 2021 than 1957 Bob Cousy in 2021, the same as saying Ricky Rubio &gt; Bob Cousy? You intentionally stripped the context out of my statement  &gt;And, yes, we’re saying 100/100 current teams take ‘83 Bird, obviously.  Cool. So to the question I asked you...teleport 84 Bird to 2021...how many players are you slotting ahead of him in terms of better players at that point in time?"
USA Basketball game plan:  1. Forget to play defense early and go down double digits  2. Players realize they are about to get ~~blown out by Satoransky~~ ~~blown out by Ricky Rubio~~ **Jingled**  3. ???  4. Comeback by halftime and cruise to the dub
At least Mills can get hot and put up big scoring numbers in the NBA. How does Ricky Rubio able to make lots of baskets in the Olympics and not at all in the NBA?
Australia doesn’t have Ricky Rubio to keep them in it
"It’s so weird. I know we talk about roster construction but the honest truth is the Damian lillard, Tatum, etc are being outplayed by guys like patty mills, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Fournier. I have no idea why international players seem to get way better in fiba while USA players seem to play much worse!"
Ricky rubio is a good playmaker
"Yesterday it was future Cavs legend Ricky Rubio, now it's already Cavs legend Matthew Dellavedova"
"Nah, I think Ricky Rubio is on that list for sure"
+100% skill for Ricky Rubio though
Based on this olympics I think we can say that Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio are top 5 players next season in the NBA
"We've come close a few times.  Draymond was the closest, just didn't get the points.  Michael Carter Williams and Ricky Rubio were close too."
"I'm starting to wonder if Luka will start to influence young US high schoolers to go overseas to Europe and forego college again  I think Brandon Jennings was the last one to really do it (the Ball boys were a publicity stunt while playing in a low-tier league) but even he didn't play for a Euroleague contender  Idk, if I was an up and coming sophmore/junior in HS I would love to go sign up for a potential Euroleague contender and get that more rugged developmental experience than the AAU circuit. Luka is 1 of 1, but there is no doubt that he earned his stripes as a teen and it made his transition to the NBA so much easier.  Even Ricky Rubio was yet again busting asses in this year's olympics while going back to playing FIBA style rules/gameplans. I don't think that it will completely prepare you for the NBA, but it will absolutely help round out your game as a professional even if you average 4 PPG for a Euroleague team"
Ricky Rubio has the best damn eyelashes in the NBA.
"well of course, Trae learned from the best. Not every gets to train with ricky rubio"
"I think it's become increasingly clear that Simmons playing for the sixers led to him being overrated. He made the all star team this year averaging 14 ppg and 7 assists with a blatant inability to shoot. Those are Ricky Rubio numbers. I don't care how good you are defensively, if you can only muster 14/7 surrounded by 3x 40% 3p shooters and Embiid at C, you are not better than Jamal Murray who averages 24/4.5/6 on 47/40/90 in 33 career playoff games including multiple 40+ pt games carrying the team."
"You know about FIBA Patty Mills, FIBA Frank and FIBA Ricky Rubio... but while those players rank in the NBA from very bad to solidly average... you have Luka Doncic who is an NBA MVP caliber player. And the thing is, he came up via EuroLeague where he was MVP before getting drafted. He has that same ""next gear"" as those other things when it comes to international play.   FIBA Luka is a thing.. and it's terrifying for everyone."
"&gt;Lol  So no rebuttal at all?  Didn't think so.  Check the salaries of veterans who averaged 6+ assists last year.  The only two who made less than Schroder were TJ McConnell and Ricky Rubio.  And Rubio is one of the worst shooters in the league, and doesn't defend.  McConnell is a 7ppg player.  The rest of that 6+ assist club?  Westbrook, Paul, Draymond Green, Jokic, Lillard, Morant, Fox, Butler, DeRozen, Simmons, Sabonis, VanVleet, Jrue Holiday, Randle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brogdon, and Curry."
Spurs should grab Rubio from Cavs man. Ricky under Pop is a dream.
He is Ricky Rubio

l o fucking l  patty mills and ricky rubio are role players in the nba because that's as good as their skill level dictates  the rules have nothing to do with it  good lord you fiba purists have gone absolutely insane these past few weeks
Except Ricky Rubio (sarcasm)
LeBron leaves the east only for KD and Ricky Rubio to show up smh
Ricky Rubio always steps up in big games. He did the same thing in the Playoffs. It's fucking sad he's only been on 2 playoff teams. In both times his Playoff Numbers were better than his Regular Season numbers.   2018 he went 7 TRB 7 AST 14 PTS  2019 he went 3 TRB 8 AST 15 PTS 2.4 STL  Now he's going to CLE and probably wont see post season yet again...
"Team USA has been on the rise since their first loss in the opening game against France.  Kevin Durant is in MVP mode and he led this team to victory against a Spanish team that is too dependent on Ricky Rubio.  He had a huge game with 38 points, but in the end, he was all alone.  The scoring was more evenly distributed for the Americans and that made the difference.  I got a better look at Garuba in this game. He is really frustrated on offense. There will be a lot of development work to do with him so he can really establish himself in the NBA as a role player."
"I mean, he was also guarding Ricky Rubio"
"Ricky Rubio is in good company. Butch Lee was a problem at Marquette. NCAA Champ, Most Outstanding Player, All American, AP POY, Naismith POY, Aduph Rupp Trophy, and UPI POY."
"People forget how much hype there was for Ricky Rubio coming over from Spain. Wasn't quite Luka levels but there was serious buzz   if not for injuries he could've been special. He's a sleeper ""what if"" story"
"People forget how much hype there was for Ricky Rubio coming over from Spain. Wasn't quite Luka levels but there was serious buzz   if not for injuries he could've been special. He's a sleeper ""what if"" story"
"Ricky Rubio played amazingly like he has done the whole tournament, but the rest of the team didn’t really keep up that much, of course that says something good about USA’s attack and defence, but we needed everyone to perform at their 100% to be able to contest this game."
How tf can BAMONTE ADEBAYO get blocked by Ricky rubio on a point blank dunk attempt!
FIBA Patty Mills FIBA Ricky Rubio FIBA Luka Doncic FIBA Evan Fournier FIBA Luis Scola  I don't think anyone's beating this team smh
Ricky Rubio can't be a backup pg
Imagine if Ricky Rubio could play with Booker defending him every game
"I’ve always said Ricky Rubio was a modern day, better Butch Lee"
"Ricky Rubio reminding everyone he's Ricky fuckin Rubio. What game for him, and unfortunate that Spain won't medal. Loved seeing old man Pau too, dude will always be one of my favorite Lakers.  First half was a struggle for the US, getting outhustled for rebounds and throwing up weak attacks against Spain's  pesky defense. Great second half adjustments though to really stretch Spain's defense and guys just got into much better rhythm. They really have to capitalize on the growing chemistry, especially defensively (they got some really key deflections in the passing lanes). Gotta play strong and rebound when going small, and they gotta keep finding ways to put pressure and attack the rim. Sometimes the shooting will be inconsistent, and so being able to generate points in spite of that is supremely important. Gotta be physical when attacking."
Cavs legend Ricky Rubio
&gt; Ricky Rubio has 36 points. &gt;  &gt; It's the best scoring mark EVER against Team USA at the Olympic Games.   https://twitter.com/hoopshype/status/1422441312117215347

"Death, taxes, and Ricky fucking Rubio ballin out in the Olympics."
Ricky “Steph Curry” Rubio
"Ricky Rubio can't win with these cats  But also, Team USA leans on Dray on defense even more than it leans on KD on offense.  They have to figure out something to do about that, or else Draymond is gonna have to play 40 minutes every night"
"I know there were a couple of folks griping about Spain sitting Rubio for certain spans but damn fam, Ricky ain't no spring chicken no more. He needed those breathers.  That being said, throughout these games it's been fairly obvious that Spain's offense runs through him. It was incredibly frustrating watching the US team slack off him during the first half and not lock him down. He pretty much carried the offensive load for Spain the entire game."
38 points from Cleveland Cavaliers Legend Ricky Rubio just wasn't enough
What a game from Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio is like God in FIBA rules wow
Imagine if a team like the Timberwolves had a high scoring vet like Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio looked like prime Steve Nash out there with good defense.

"Russ is 9x All NBA and has killer mentality..  im seriously tired of r/nba hating on this dude. so tiring and lame.  i disagree with Shaq here, but lets not pretend like Russ is Ricky Rubio lol"
Lonzo is a taller version of Ricky Rubio offensively and better on defense for sure.  He is a starter on a pretender (Pelicans) or rebuilding team and a bench player on a contender.
" Rubio is a horrendous defender, he gets steals if that's what you mean, but he cannot stay in front of his man and can't defend shots. He's not a horrible liability defender, but he can't play defense. It's always been a thing with Ricky in the NBA  Again with the euroleague? In what way is that relevant to an NBA discussion.  I honest to god, don't understand how you could say Ricky Rubio is a good defender, he's known for being awful...."
How would you describe Ricky Rubio?
Apparently you shouldn’t close games with Ricky Rubio and Josh Okogie if you need offense. Who knew?
Ricky rubio needs to look to score man. I forget he's on the floor half the time
"DUH....  Ask ya boy Ricky Rubio... they go a lil harder overseas because they wanna be in America, and most importantly they want American USD while playing professionally.  So yes, they go hard in the paint as they know what’s at stake."
They need to bring Ricky Rubio back
The only thing the jazz need is Ricky Rubio back! Bring that boy back!!
"&gt;Ricky ""My Husband"" Rubio"
"The one thing Minnesota does have though, is the missing key to my heart. Ricky ""My Husband"" Rubio. I wish we had him coming off this bench, team would be unstoppable."
Probably a bit early to tell for sure either way. Lamelo is turning out nice. I wanted him in the draft and then later draft night was contented by us trading for ricky rubio again. Ricky hasn't turned out like we hoped but im still happy that we got edwards.
"&gt; just saying that Harden isn't exactly a Ricky Rubio type player with hit ahead passes and pushing the pace.  He doesn't push the pace often but he absolutely does throw passes ahead in transition.  We see it a lot with him and Jeff Green, as an example."

last season the Spurs were starting and playing Bryn fucking Forbes for 30 minutes a game. not every player that starts should start. idk how you guys don't see the difference between an ish smith type of player and a Ricky Rubio type of player.
"To be clear, I don't think Beverley is a good leader either. I was just responding to your narrative that Rubio could be the leader the Clippers need, which I think is laughable. Kawhi and PG ain't gonna take inspiration from Ricky Rubio and follow his lead 😂"
"which time?? In the last 12 years they've had the up and coming spooky teams of:   * 2007-2009: Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Corey Brewer * 2010-2014: Kevin Love, Derrick Williams and Ricky Rubio * 2015-2019: Andrew Wiggins, KAT, Zach Lavine * 2020-Present: KAT, D'lo Russell, Anthony Edwards"
"He is one of those players that are kind of frustrating because he could be so much better.   In college as a freshmen he was a 20/11 player with 65% TS. That is rare company and has the potential to be a 25 point scorer in the NBA. He supposedly has a [43.5 inch vert](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664?lang=en) with elite length. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is Chris Paul. How isn't he a 20+ scorer by now? We can't use the excuse that he hasn't had pg's that can pass. By the time Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Joel Embiid, Kevin Garnett, and Giannis were 22 years old they were all 20 ppg+ scorers already. Many of us were hoping he would turn into them and his first two years he had a trajectory that he might but then going back down to 14 ppg is a little disappointing. However, the Suns play a super slow pace with Chris Paul and have bottom 5 lowest possessions per game in the NBA when last year they were top 10 so everyone's stats is going to go down a little bit. Additionally, the Suns have a lot of mouths to feed with 7 players scoring in double digits (6 players if you don't count Dario who only played 6 games)."
Teague might be my most hated player in the league. A few years ago he body checked Ricky Rubio into the first row for no reason and I’ve really hated the dude ever since
"as bad as ricky rubio has been, I really don't want patrick beverley instead"
If they could get Ricky Rubio the clippers would look insanely dangerous
ricky rubio averaged 14/7/7 on 35/31/78 splits. funny that you bring up Russ TS when Rubio had a 47% TS. in no fucking world did ricky rubio outplay russ. dont embarrass yourself dude
Ricky Rubio was 14 when he debuted professionally.
"Dude, Thanasis locked him down in a Euroleague game when he was 18! Too slow and unathletic for this league. Ricky Rubio 2.0 ^/s"
London seems to be the move or CP3 if he actually opts-out which I doubt. Maybe a deal for Ricky Rubio. Otherwise gotta try to find a trade.
"forget about the jumper Ben is clearly more engaged in interviews whenever he talks about defense and what he has to do on that end than it is playing through contact or being aggressive on offense.  Holds himself to Ben Wallace type standards defensively ""Well I am one of the best but there were those few plays fuck I wish I could have back"" while holding himself to Ricky Rubio standards offensively despite being 6'11 ""I do so many other things Im not worried about scoring""."
If you’re talking about that Jazz series Westbrook was fucking terrible??? Dude targeted Ricky Rubio bc of his own ego.   Curry has shown up in huge playoff games and won 3 rings. Maybe that’s why he’s not as slandered as Westbrook??
Timberwolves fan: thinks about it for a second--yep.   Nice blank spot where Ricky Rubio hangs out on the left wing behind the 3 point line.
Ricky Rubio?
"He was NOT great in 2018, what is this revisionist history shit? He got embarrassed by Ricky Rubio and a rookie Mitchell"
Everybody out here forgetting Ricky Rubio smh
"I miss rubio so much.  Come back to your second home, ricky."
"It's definitely a stat that needs context and &lt;gasp&gt; game-watching to provide that context. Look at some other names in the ""top"" 30 for players with highest TOV% and we see: Ben Simmons, Facundo Campazzo, Ricky Rubio, LaMelo Ball, Goran Dragic, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Ja Morant, LeBron James. What these guys all have in common is that they don't take many shots ***relative*** to how much ball handling they do. For sure a couple guys (Trae and LeBron especially) shoot and score a lot, but they do *even more* ball handling relative to their teammates."
"They don’t need an all star PG, they just need someone who can set the table and doesn’t bleed too much value elsewhere. Lonzo is probably the best and most acquirable of these players, but even a guy like Ricky Rubio would really help them."
"He's a terrible shooter yet jacks up a ton of shots. In the modern NBA, that's extremely exploitable. He doesn't play defense or move well off the ball. He's extremely predictable, which makes him easier to scheme for. Wb isn't a dude who can beat you in a million different ways. The things he's really good at aren't necessarily the things that win NBA championships. His efficiency is bad, yet he shoots a lot. The simple fact is that he's overrated. Sorry wb fans but he's not incredible. He's a very good player with some glaring holes that plays like he's an MVP. People's expectations of him are too high. Defense and shot making win championships. High BBIQ wins championships. Patience and emotional control win championships. Wb doesn't do any of those things. This happens literally every year, where people are blinded by the fact he's putting up triple doubles and forget that he can't shoot and doesn't play hard when he doesn't have the ball. Then every year the playoffs come, and he doesn't only disappoint, he's bad. The thing that really kills him is that he doesn't know how to step back and play in a way that covers up his weaknesses. Forget the time that he literally laughed at the idea that it was hard to guard Steph and then got absolutely roasted, what about the time he did the same to Ricky Rubio? Or Damian Lillard? Wb would be a really, really useful guy if he shot the ball less and tried harder on defense, and not just at the end of games. But he won't do those things, and then you've got a walking brick who's shooting like he's a walking bucket instead. But everyone gives him a pass because he's sassy and confident and plays through injuries, and that's admirable. But he's simply not a winner. Now, we can debate what that means for his legacy, but the truth of the matter is he's just overrated. He's a regular season star who plays in a way that just gets exposed when it actually matters. Every year, we go through the same damn cycle. I was getting blasted with downvotes yesterday because I had the temerity to suggest that he wasn't one of the greatest scorers and playmakers of all time. I'll say it again, if you're below average efficiency-wise and take a lot of shots, you're gonna lose against above average teams. Maybe not every night, but enough to kill you when it counts. He's just not that good.  The best metaphor I ever saw for Russ was this: watching him is like watching a guy eat ten cheeseburgers. Is it healthy? No. But God, do I want to watch a guy eat ten cheeseburgers."
He had a 48% TS against the jazz and was outplayed by Ricky Rubio. 51% TS in 2017. 2020 17 and 4 on 40% TS. He is garbage. Play in 2021 6-18
You lost to Ricky Rubio and enes kanter lmao  And we beat your ass in 17 and 20
I remember when Ricky Rubio shot 42% from three post ASB. I suppose it’s a little different for rookies but I wouldn’t read too much into it.
&gt;	 Curry’s skill set is and suddenly being surprised that he is basically Ricky Rubio with better defense outside of being an all time great shooter.  **THIS IS AN ALL TIME TAKE**
I think he’ll be Ricky Rubio with slightly better shot creation
Killian Hayes floor would still be an average starter with his good playmaking skill and defense.. similar mold as Ricky Rubio or Lonzo Ball  His offense is leaving a lot to be desired tho. He never looks to score and his lay up drive game is bad despite him having some floater touch and good handle to get to where he wants.. he should be  able to figure it out
Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio
"It was used to pay for Ricky Rubio who was traded for CP3. So essentially: my man Cash + 32nd pick + Oubre for CP3 + Craig + Nader, with a Rubio rental that turned decent for team development.      Don't question my math, it's bulletproof."
"He had a negative +/- in 5 of the 6 games.  He had 7-19, 5-17, 7-18 on 3 straight games, getting embarrassed by Ricky Rubio in game 3, and blown out in game 4.  He got outplayed by a rookie. But you just look at stats without any context."

Reminds me of Ricky Rubio especially when his shot isn't falling."

NBA Ricky Rubio: 😴   España Ricky Rubio: 🤩
"1st Quarter takeaways:  - USA defense looks really good, except when it doesn't  - Spain, especially Ricky Rubio, has hit a toooon of tough shots, ones which seemed close to impossible  - Kevin Durant is such a black hole on offense that it appears he thinks he's back on the Nets during the Bucks series  - USA has missed quite a few wide open, completely open, shots, and when they're missing, they look beatable. Results best when they're moving towards the hoop, but this is a perimeter-oriented team."

and also the stupidst play to make in clutch time. Throwing a high speed alley oop? Lol.  But it's Ricky Rubio. Passes ain't nothin'.
Ricky Rubio is probably THE number 1 wasted international talent because he never could get on a decent team. He was soooo good on the Jazz. What could have been man…
"After the Cleveland Cavaliers vs New York Knicks game where Ricky Rubio made 8-9 three point shots, the Cavs showed their trust on his offensive game. Ricky Rubio wasnt known as a scoring threat esp from three. Early start to this season, the coaching staff clearly giving him the green light and hopefully this will continue moving forward."
"I personally felt that Hayward was way better than what many gave him credit for on the Celtics team.  He could score on his own while playing off ball and defend nicely, but he really was the only real person who could make the right pass and decisions to help the iso heavy style Boston has/had. I wish we would have put more of an emphasis on trying to keep him this off-season, but glad that he’s doing well with charlotte and helping the young guys. He is in my opinion a better Ricky Rubio in the sense that they help teams even when they have bad days."
"Dejounte Murray, but he's not available.  I've been screaming for ages to get Ricky Rubio on the Celtics, but Brad Stevens is using this season to see if Marcus Smart can play a Ricky Rubio role (he can't).  Rubio's a free agent this offseason and they'll try to get him there."
"Just some advice, you should probably relax a bit if you’re trying to discuss what happened objectively lol. Somebody saying your team would be better if they made different moves shouldn’t be something that upsets you.   For starters, I personally count LeBron as guard depth in terms of offence. He starts at PG, is the team’s main facilitator and has the ball in his hands more often than not. He’s really only a wing on the defensive end.  In terms of the actual guard “positions” I’m perfectly comfortable with Lowry and Caruso getting 30 mpg each. The other 12 mpg should be pretty easy to fill up.   I’m not sure why you’re acting like the team is incapable of making subsequent moves after trading for Lowry. They don’t *have* to stop being active after acquiring him. The Cavs got Ricky Rubio for a single second round pick.  And like I said before, the Lakers clearly don’t care about depth very much considering they traded their depth for Westbrook."
How can you not just love Ricky Rubio. Dude just operates.
At least he’s giving Ricky Rubio valuable minutes.
i mean ricky rubio impact on the jazz and suns was also very high... he is great at unlocking teammates potential
"Let's see..Evan Mobley is the real deal, Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley as a back court means that literally 75% of the League don't even have the bigs to guard both of them. Ricky Rubio and Darius Garland mean that they have a consistent floor general almost every minute of the game, Stevens is an underrated defender and they have serious depth too. Cedi, Okoro, Markkanen, Kevin Love, oh and Colin Sexton who's not even healthy.   I'd view this team as a first round exit but a legit playoff team via the play-in tournament. Maybe they play in the tourney and get knocked out or maybe they make the first round, that's probably their ceiling right now but in 2-3 years once the right roster gets built up and Evan Mobley really gets into his bag, it's going to be disgusting."
Yeah I would take brown for the long term if I had to decide but they are both solid stars. I don't think they need a scorer. I think if you were to add a Ricky Rubio I think that would be a good trade if you don't have to give up too much. Of course if you could get dame or beal then you might have to consider giving up on one of the j's which i believe would be Tatum but who knows who they value more.
At least Ricky rubio has been playing good the past couple.years
Cavs legend Ricky Rubio will carry them to a threepeat.
How about teams stop trying to throw dirt on my man Ricky Rubio. I'm so glad this Cavs team is fun and competitive.
"Both Marcus Smart and Ricky Rubio have amazing basketball IQ and are elite defenders with three point making capabilities. On this play, Rubio outsmarts Smart. Rubio looks at the post where Schroeder was already defending and Smart anticipates a pass there and goes to double or possibly intercept the pass but Rubio then throws a relatively no look lob to Allen. Great awareness by Rubio."
Rubio is a speciality type of player. Let him play his role and maximize what he's best at and you can have good Rubio. Try to make him something he's not and get him out of his comfort zone and you'll get bad Ricky Rubio as has been the case in a couple of his last stops. He looks comfortable again.
 And Ricky Rubio didn’t even go off today
"Our schedule has been brutal, too.  It’s pretty awesome what they’re doing. Shoutout Ricky Rubio."
"Ricky Rubio's impact on this team upon acquisition wasn't expected. Most ppl are only accounting the potential improvements of the young guys. Rubio and Garland helped unlock Jarrett Allen's potential as well. Also nobody thought Mobley could be THIS impactful in a game, on both sides of the floor, he was touted to be good but not this good this early."
Great rookie campaigns from a Ricky Rubio team:  Wiggins  KAT  Donovan Mitchell  Cam Johnson  Ant Edwards  Evan Mobley
Ricky Rubio is good at basketball
This is the first year I am following a team with Ricky Rubio on it.   I now understand why people always call him severely underrated.
Holy Fuck I love this team.  And Ricky Rubio for 6MOTY
Is Ricky Rubio having a career season or is this all pretty typical?
Ricky Rubio looks like a Charlie Day character
"I'm on record saying Ricky Rubio is very overrated, one of the most overrated players of this generation! But also, free Ricky Rubio!"
Not to mention the T-Wolves drafting 2 point guards before the warriors and taking Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio.
"I haven’t watched the Pistons at all this year. Last year watched Killian and thought his moves look really smooth, like he has some touch of a floater, shot mechanics look fine, he’s good at driving left, has a step back 3 in the bag with the way how it looks fluidly but overall his shots just not falling.  His best traits are defense and playmaking. So more or less if he can either improve some off the dribble play in PnR he can be somewhat like Ricky Rubio or if he improve his off ball spot up shooting he can be somewhat like Lonzo Ball.  His offensive movement and size and just overall package kinda looks like DLo at times but he’s obvi better athlete and defender than D’Lo, although his athleticism better than DLo doesn’t exactly make him a better slasher or finisher I don’t think. Just piss poor offense showcase so far. There still a route for him to become a starter in the league but he’s more likely be a secondary ball handler, connective tissue, filling the gap type of combo guard rather than an actual lead guard"
"Ricky Rubio a couple nights ago scored 37 on 8-9 from three. No joke, that would be ho-hum for Steph."
"RJ usually guards the best Wing not best Guard. So if you look at our games, guys like Tatum and DeRozan had rough games due to RJ guarding them but Ricky Rubio and Cole Anthony looked like Steph and Kobe with Evan and Kemba guarding them"
Ricky Rubio and the cavs  Just looking at the roster at the start of the season and weird lineups you'd think they'd never win a game

"Team USA also got cooked by Evan Fournier and Ricky Rubio in the Olympics, and other guards like Nando De Colo, Patty Mills, and Tomas Satorasky played reasonably well against them too. Was Jrue really stopping them?"
it’s cause we had Kyrie and Semih Erden out there haha   we have real NBA players out there now. Ricky Rubio is what Jarret Jack was supposed to be
"I would have to say either the warriors or the cavs. Since I'm a cavs fan, I'll be biased and tip my hat towards the cavs. Here are my reasons;   1) Evan Mobley has come out of this draft playing at least a year ahead of where I could have believed he would be. He has yet to come into his full potential, but I didn't think he would have been as much of an impact as he has.  2) Darius Garland has improved in all aspects of his game; and seems a lot more confident on the court.   3) Jarret Allen has been a pleasure to watch. I feel like a good center that can play defense is hard to find, and the cavs found him.  4) Ricky Rubio has been playing with a vigor that I've never seen before. His veteran presence has had a huge impact on the team. He's been present for so many clutch plays.   5) Their defense is on a whole new level, and they have been playing so well considering the misfortune they have had with injuries so far. Last year, this team looked lethargic and unmotivated. This year's team is the complete opposite."
"rubio is, but he plays the 2 and he moves the ball and it’s why we’ve set our high assists in the last 3 years a couple times already  plus Ricky has been an elite defender for year, the opposite of our normal 2"
Ricky Rubio
This was obvious with Ricky Rubio on the cavs this year.
"I knew a dude who was like 5’5” at MOST and could windmill and shit. The guy looked like bearded long haired Ricky Rubio and wasn’t a good player, but could fucking JUMP  I’m like 6’5” and can reasonably dunk but it’s legit scary"
"&gt;the defence could just zero in on him as a shooter leaving AD to have to carry the entire offence on his own  What? Why would AD be carrying the entire offence on his own in this scenario? There are still other players on the team. Buddy Hield at this point in time is a more effective complimentary player than Westbrook is by a decent margin.  I’m also not sure why you’re turning one of Buddy’s positives into a negative. The idea that Hield is drawing that much attention from the defence can only be interpreted as a positive thing. Hield drawing attention means defences will be *less* focused on AD (and the rest of the team), not more. It’s a concept called spacing, something that Hield provides a ton of and Westbrook provides none of.  You’re right in saying Westbrook has put pressure on defences in the past with his driving game. But AD is a player who primarily operates in the paint. As of right now defences are more more than willing to sag off Russ at the 3 point line to double up on AD. Russ is a talented passer. He isn’t effective enough of a scorer to take advantage of that court vision, hence the 5 TO’s per game.  Not to mention the defence would be better as they would still have KCP in this scenario.  Not to mention it isn’t really that difficult to find a decent playmaking point guard. The Cavs got Ricky Rubio for a single second round pick and salary filler. Westbrook’s skill set is a good bit more replaceable and a good bit less effective to winning than Hield’s."
"I mean look at the bubble suns with Ricky Rubio. A guy that most people didn’t really think of as a big move but helped change the culture. I know he didn’t necessarily work out last year with the wolves, but I feel with some better team construction he could have made a bigger impact."

You're not wrong. Remember when you guys could have drafted Steph but you took Ricky Rubio and some other point guard whose name I don't remember?  [Good times](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/).
"westbrook is so good in the playoffs, that's why he's been outplayed by mario chalmers, ricky rubio, rookie donovan mitchell, rajon rondo's little brother, and ben simmons one week before a historic collapse  how long will it take you guys to realize his triple doubles are less than meaningless? there is no player in the history of this league that has had a greater negative impact on their own teams in the playoffs"
\*Ricky Rubio
"Oh yeah no doubt, that’s why you guys are so successful because it really is a pick your poison and on most nights I’d be okay with this outcome for that very reason. Coming off the heels of guys like Ricky Rubio and Myles Turner shooting over 70% against you from behind the arc though and I’m at the point where I’m throwing my hands up and saying that eventually the law of averages has to come into affect here."
Jonny Flynn has it. Or maybe Ricky Rubio?  (Sorry)
That’s Cleveland Cavaliers legend Ricky Rubio to you
"Pat Connaughton, Ricky Rubio, Miles Turner.  Playing like Reggie Miller"
"Ricky Rubio, Deni Avdija, Bradley Beal, Kuzma, Raul Neto, and Kevin Love? Nah this gotta be the cutest game of all time."
"Apparently one of the FIBA rules is ""Ricky Rubio is allowed to make jump shots""."
"you're right that if they're your _best_ player, you want d'lo   but if you had the choice between the two in free agency, ricky makes all of his teammates better. he fits in on basically every team except the sixers, and that's just because they already have a player who specializes in playmaking and defense without the ability to create his own shot.   hell, look at wiggins's efficiency. improved every year until 2017-2018 when rubio was replaced with teague. wasn't good again until he got paired with steph, another guard who makes his teammates better. wonder why"
"Nah im biased cause i love ricky Rubio is all, I would make a terrible executive."
Ricky Rubio is not better than D’Lo
"I've been beating the Ricky Rubio drum for a season &amp; a half, he's the kind of PG who's passing &amp; playmaking can be contagious.  Cavs probably don't want to let him go now but that's the kind of guard the Celtics desperately need."
"I begged the Celtics during the offseason to be the team that backslid the most. I do think a lack of a playmaker is hitting them hard.  Ricky Rubio would be a great fit on the team, but they're trying to see if Marcus Smart can be Ricky Rubio. Since Rubio himself is an expiring this season they'll probably wait to sign him during the offseason."
"They're a young team and they haven't had any vets I can think of to teach the younger guys and help them win.  Like these are their ""vets"" after looking them up:  21-22: Pat Bev  20-21: Ed Davis, Ricky Rubio  19-20: James Johnson, Jeff Teague, (Dieng and Cov if they count)"
Ricky Rubio
Butler has always been supportive of his teammates to a fault. And I emphasize the fault. Jeff Teague tackled Ricky Rubio out of bounds when Butler was on the Wolves and was tweeting from his couch that he was super happy Teague did that.  Butler's a good teammate but also a scumbag.
"Just saying, the Cavs have two literal male models in Cedi Osman and Kevin Love, plus Ricky Rubio who’s a beautiful man, and then Jarrett Allen looks like the lead in a 70s detective movie about a murder at a disco. Honestly Mobley and Markkanen aren’t too bad either, it’s just DG and Collin kinda letting the side down there."
I think you’re forgetting about Evan Mobley and Ricky Rubio . Cavs are a lock.
&gt;0 points as a key starter is never good  Nobody tell Ricky Rubio with his +11 the other day.
steph curry decided to turn into ricky rubio today I see
Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio
"Did anyone see this coming? It feels like only yesterday the Cavs picked Evan Mobley, traded for Rubio, brought in Markannen, and then we all heard that the roster was going to start with three near 7-footers and thought to ourselves ""no way that'll work."" The [preseason power ranker predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qcvtja/202122_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) did not. No one thought Mobley would be a ROY candidate, JA might be a MIP candidate given the way things are going, and no one put them down for most surprising team. They're definitely surprising us now.  Tricky Ricky's playing better than ever (having so many roll threats must be a dream scenario for him), Mobley was amazing right out of the gate, Jarrett Allen has exceeded expectations, and Lauri provides spacing (I guess).  I do worry a little about depth. Sexton's about to be out, which could be withstood by moving up Ricky or playing D. Wade. Love has only played a little. Markannen is also temporarily out. Windler, the other D. Wade, and Lamar Stevens seem like decent depth, and JA/Mobley are more than enough to cover for Markannen's temporary absence. However, losing either JA or Mobley would be huge hit to the rim protection and defense, kind of like if we lost Rudy, so I'm going to hope they both stay healthy for the whole season."
Ricky Rubio SZN. Hope he gets better soon
Is Ricky Rubio the greatest Cav to ever play?🤔
Ricky Rubio has a higher raptor and ts than lebron did in his prime season
in the last week I saw myles turner go 7/10 and then ricky rubio go 8/9 from deep
Could have said Rubio but as we all saw last night Ricky is one of the elite shooters in the NBA today.
"Ainge was constantly swinging for the fences when all he needed was a couple of singles to build around Tatum/Brown.  Like had he gone for a Ricky Rubio type instead of Kemba, spent the rest of that money on another solid vet, and drafted more high floor guys instead of constantly going for the high ceiling - well things would be looking very different for the Celtics right now."
"Yeah he's fine if he knows his role.....Off the bench scorer...like another guy we shouldn't have gotten rid of, Jordan Clarkson.  His play style doesnt mesh with Garland, not because both are too short to be a playoff-starting backcourt, but doesnt fit into the flow of moving the ball around and execution.   Looking at Sexton's number he's been extremely inefficient, forcing things, esp like the end of last game. He was getting locked down and playing out of control. In that case he should be playing off the ball not with it and move with the flow of the offense. So yeah can he score in bunches, thats a good trait. But he needs to be able to do that in the flow of the game and execute. If Cavs want to make the playoffs and actually have a chance, they get Sexton to move to the bench (which he wont, he wants that money) or more likely package and trade him for more starting wing help, since if you dont have a solid two way 3 in this league you will be sunk with all the point forwards like Giannis, Lebron, Kawhi, etc all around. Seriously even Ben Simmons would fit this team better than Sexton because Ben passes and plays defense very well. As far as his shooting inadequacies, the Cavs are loaded with shooters now that Windler decided to stop being injured and Ricky Rubio is shooting 3's at a higher clip than Steph Curry! I like Sexton too, his heart and hustle, but if you want to see team success in the playoffs, you have to build your team that way and get in the right pieces. Just like the Bucks did last year, everyone on that team is extremely selfless (Getting rid of selfish Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday was masterful) and passes the ball....that's how you win championships. Sexton=OBJ right now"
"I know no one seriously thinks Ricky is a better shooter than Steph. But I think this stat is a perfect example of how sometimes folks in this sub look at stats without context.    Aside from the fact that Steph has had twice as many 3FGA as Rubio, that it matters where each is on the teams offensive options. Most teams structure their defense to stop Steph *first*... whereas Rubio is not a focus on the other team's D at all.    So in that context, Steph's 37.5% is better than Rubio's 42.9%."
"i don't think simmons had a problem with them picking rubio first, the issue was flynn  https://grantland.com/features/nba-draft-diary-2009-bill-simmons/  &gt;It took 21 minutes before someone (Fran Fraschilla) gushed about Rubio’s once-in-a-generation passing, two-steps-ahead-of-everyone timing and incredible career (playing professionally since age 14). Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is going to regret not being more excited about Ricky Rubio on June 25, 2009. More on this in a second.  &gt;4:51 — I have to come clean: If the Zombie Sonics take Rubio or Curry, they will be employing my favorite college player of the decade (Kevin Durant); my favorite international player of the decade (Rubio) OR my favorite college player of the past two years (Curry)  &gt;4:57 — In desperate need of a point guard, Sacramento takes … Tyreke Evans. It’s as if these GMs are trying to hurt me. I feel physically ill.  &gt;5:01 — The T-Wolves are on the clock with two straight; hopefully, they’re smart enough to take Rubio, or I’m going to pull out a can of whipped cream and do whip-its until I pass out.  &gt;5:03 — Phew. Sota took him. The best part: Stern going into “I’m gonna be extra gregarious right now because they’ll be replaying this in Europe!” mode as he announced the pick. Gotta say, I can’t kill Kahn for turning Randy Foye and Mike Miller into Rubio. Nice work. An orgasmic Fraschilla says Rubio is “the best passer in the last decade of drafts” and he’s “got a Gretzky-like feel, he sees the game two and three plays ahead.” Totally agree.  and then....  &gt;5:10 — So much for Minnesota doing the right thing. The Wolves just took Syracuse’s Jonny Flynn … whom I really like … but … well … he’s a point guard. Didn’t they just take Rubio? Did I black out? You’re going to have two young ball handlers playing together — one who’s 5-foot-11, the other who’s 18 years old and weighs 180 pounds (and 30 of that is his hair), and that’s your plan? Who’s guarding the Kobes and Vinces out of those two? Why didn’t they just take Curry? And why aren’t the ESPN guys wondering about a trade here or, at the very least, murdering this pick? THEY JUST TOOK TWO STRAIGHT POINT GUARDS!!!!!!!!!!"
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Evan Mobley and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Ricky Rubio gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Mobley hit the locker room door, former NBA great LeBron James hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"As someone who has closely followed Ricky Rubio... (I even have a signed ball), the joy of watching Ricky is that sometimes he goes mental... While other times (eg two games ago) he'll go 0-7 for 0 points. Great times."

God I love Ricky Rubio
It was a good trade for both fanbases.  Cavs fans get to watch Rubio and Wolves fans don't have to watch Ricky be wasted on the timberwolves
"imagining ricky rubio trying a horse bounce shot 7 times in one game is the hardest i’ve laughed in a minute, thanks homie"
"Is Ricky Rubio even Spanish? Well yes, but actually no"
"I think Rubio is better starting and working through Garland and Mobley, and Sexton comes off the bench and tears up second units… plus he finishes the game instead of Ricky.   Dude would never be okay with that role but I think the Cavs are better"
How dare you leave Ricky Rubio off this list
Bing Bong fill de puta\* - Ricky Rubio
"Yep for me I tend to follow teams that play a way that I like, rather than just following a team.   Being from Australia I had no geographical ties, so I went: Jordans bulls as a kid, then a bit of a hiatus... then D-Wade's heat, until Lebron joined... then kinda the heat but not really... then I started watching Ricky Rubio and his stunning passing and beautiful if ultimately average play, so followed him from Minny to the Jazz to the Suns...   But my first live NBA game was in 2013 when I was in Oakland to see GSW v OKC. Curry went off in a comeback win. And I was hooked.  So I found myself watching more and more of their games (though Rubio's jazz were great to watch), and now I probably watch more of their games than anyone else. Curry is something else - a genuine contender for a top 10 or 5 player of all time.   Thats a long ramble. TLDR Basketball good."

"It's look like Olympic Rubio never left... I love Ricky man always got some games like that, hey Pelinka I know you miss on Lowry but how about you send mini-Lebron to Cleveland for the great Rubio lol"
Never thought I'd say this but...  Ricky Rubio is the greatest Ricky to ever play for the Cleveland cavaliers. Move over Ricky Davis! Maybe if they would counted that rebound you shot off your own hoop!
"Love and Rubio was the 8th seed before Ricky gets injured while their rotation has HOFers like Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Beasley playing in the low20 minutes per a game."
"who is the better playmaker, lebron or ricky rubio"

Ricky Rubio is my sleeper pick for this. Does everything well enough but doesn’t do anything the best.
Dante Exum being only 26 and Ricky Rubio only being 30 always fuck with me.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"It's a phenomenon I feel like I see quite a bit - Player A gets rated too highly, then a few people realize this and start rating him lower than the rest of the crowd and calling him overrated.  Then more people realize it, then more, until so many people have lowered their rating of that player that the ""crowd"" rating itself has dropped significantly - but people still call him overrated even though at this point you could argue he's underrated now.  I think Kuzma fits that pattern. Dwight Howard was a like that for a little while a few years back. I think DeRozen was another good example. Maybe Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio. Examples from outside of basketball: Tony Romo, Coldplay, Leonardo Di Caprio who arguably had the same effect in the opposite direction too and went from overrated to underrated back to overrated, Erwin Rommel, Thomas Edison."
Ricky Rubio. If I could meet any NBA player I think I’d meet Ricky.
Facundo Campazzo is older than Derrick Favors and only 5 months younger than Ricky Rubio.
Ricky Rubio has entered the game.
"Conversely though, he was doubted even in his draft. Sure he was a lottery pick but I remember seeing talk at the time that Ricky Rubio had much more upside in comparison."
Ricky Rubio to Mike Conley is a lateral move? lmao
"What? The Jazz have gone from a two big starting lineup with Ricky Rubio at point guard and turned that into a three point shooting juggernaut, and you think those two teams are relatively the same?"
He's a good lookin dude. Who else is up there? Kevin Love? Kelly Oubre?  Chris Paul Alex Caruso in a Ricky Rubio mask/wig combo?
"I think the last time I was honestly excited for the Twolves was when it looked liked Ricky Rubio was actually coming to the NBA. Klove, Al Jefferson, they looked ready for a new era.   That was in 2009."
"They missed a golden opportunity to call the play ""Dame Time."" Second video sounds like ""James Harden... Ricky Rubio."""
Ben Simmons.  More serious answer- Ricky Rubio  Under the radar pick- KJ McDaniels
"OJ Mayo, Ricky Rubio, Brandon Jennings.  I'm going to add Patty Mills as well. I watched him ages ago in the Olympics just ball out on the top USA talent."

"Not the biggest but still interesting to me - Ricky Rubio. Dude showed flashes of being a more handsome Jason Kidd in his first four years in the league, before the effects of multiple injuries over that time span caught up to him. [Here’s an article from 2015 talking about his already concerning injury history at that point](https://www.minnpost.com/sports/2015/11/wounded-career-ricky-rubio/):  &gt;&gt; During the 6,611 minutes Rubio has logged as a Timberwolf, …you’ve got Rubio improving the Wolves by a net 9.8 points per 100 possessions thus far over the course of his career.   &gt;&gt;…the lone season he was healthy enough to play every game, in 2013-14, he finished second in total assists with 704 and pilfered at least ten percent more steals than anyone else in the NBA — 191 versus the next-best player at 167. Those kinds of stats usually confer All-Star status."
"Tools help, but he gambles a lot, he doesn't focus, and he doesn't work off ball  When he does put in a lot of work, like against the Jazz, he ends up shutting down someone like Ricky Rubio. But does so by gambling a lot, fouling a lot, and not helping on other players"
"Man...I just love watching LaMelo's game.    The way he passes, fakes and just gets everyone involved is beautiful.    He's who I thought Ricky Rubio would be."

"There were also a number of solid players they could have chosen over Hasheem. Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Patty Mills, Brandon Jennings, and Patrick Beverley to name a few. Hell, even Ricky Rubio would have been a better pick."
"PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - Marcus Smart  SF - Doug McDermott   PF - Thaddeus Young  C - Enes Kanter    There's no one on the team that can take over and be the main scorer on a night-to-night basis, neither Rubio or Smart are so deadly or consistent from 3 that I think opposing teams would be content with letting them both shoot the amount it'd take for them to create positive offense, McDermott and Young are both role players that'll give you 10-15ish points a game, and Kanter even if he has a god game like he did recently, could still be abused defensively."
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
Paul George played better than his regular season averages that series while Westbrook put up 40 points on 40 shots multiple times and got personally humiliated by Ricky Rubio. The games the Thunder won that series were both when PG had good games where Russ was consistently bad across the entire series. PG isn't without fault that year but the amount of shit he caught in comparison to how he played was absolutely ridiculous.
OP is full of shit. Ricky Rubio scored over 20 hella times.
"For a while, Ricky Rubio had a knack for defending Steph. Not sure if he still does, but my memory is that it seemed like Steph could never shake him.  FVV did a good job in the box-and-one as well. Not that he was per se shutting Steph down, but he was sticking with him and making things difficult."
"Edwards was the #1 pick. KAT was the #1 pick. Wiggins was the #1 pick. Culver was the 6th pick. Dunn was the 5th pick. Derrick Williams was the 2nd pick. Wesley Johnson was the 4th pick. Ricky Rubio was the 5th pick. Jonny Flynn was the 6th pick.  That's 9 top 6 picks over the past 12 drafts, so yes constantly. Nobody to blame for the Timberwolves being bad other than the team itself for their abysmal draft history outside of KAT and potentially Edwards."
"Ricky Rubio, which is surprising cause he's not even that short"
"I think a few things happened.   First, the Suns actually had Ayton on the floor for a stretch of competitive games. The suspension and injuries last year pre-bubble killed the team.  Second, Oubre being out meant Mikal Bridges could start. His smart, unselfish play on both sides of the floor is invaluable to the Suns. Oubre is fun to watch, but he’s a black hole for ball movement and he’s not quite as good on D as Bridges.  The bench showed a ton of improvement, headlined by the late signing of Cam Payne giving the Suns a real backup PG.  Ricky Rubio showed the league just how much real point guard could help Devin Booker and the young Suns core.  And Booker showed the world what Playoff Book really looks like."
JR Smith and Ricky Rubio? Rubio is a good defender and very good point guard/distributor with a high IQ.   Smith was super athletic at his peak and got hot scoring and shooting. You’ve got a 6’5 elite point guard who is athletic as hell and can shoot lights out
"He’s who we were told Ricky Rubio would be. S/O Ricky tho, he’s no Luka. This kid is insane."
"Fuck me.  Ricky, Naz and Nowell have been god awful these last two games.  I'm especially pissed at Naz. He's had a golden opportunity to prove himself as a legit player and has completely shit the bed.  Look, i'm not expecting us to compete with the Bucks when we dont have KAT. But some of these players just havent been good enough and cant be defended.  Once again Vando got more assists than Ricky Rubio. How embarassing is that? Ricky is supposed to be a god tier passer, and i know our shooting was pathetic but 2 assists from him does not cut it. Thanasis Antetokounmpo got more  JO and Juancho looked good so I guess there's that"
I was CONVINCED Ricky Rubio was going to run the league.  The way he played in the Olympics vs. team USA and his skillset/basketball IQ had me thinking he was going to be a top 5-10 player in the NBA.
"An older one, but I have been on the Ricky Rubio bandwagon since the beginning. I thought he'd end up so much better than he did. Watching 17yo Rubio play in the gold medal game against the US was kinda crazy. His passing was so insane.   If he could have learned to finish at the rim better, and keep improving his shooting, his ceiling was crazy."
What’d he say about Ricky Rubio?
But he can do it for Ricky Rubio!
Ricky Rubio for Marcus Smart. Who says no?
&gt;Ricky Rubio is miles ahead of Ben Simmons offensively.  lmfaooooo..
&gt;Ricky Rubio is miles ahead of Ben Simmons offensively   You can’t actually believe this.
People say this and ignore the fact that him being so terrible on offense especially as a point guard nearly outweighs his defensive skillset. Ricky Rubio is miles ahead of Ben Simmons offensively.
"The jazz have been “taking next step” since like 2012 lmao I’ve been seeing people claiming Hayward, Ricky Rubio, and more are the next big piece the jazz needed."
Ricky Rubio. The 18 year old phenom.
the one where Westbrook randomly vowed to shut down Ricky Rubio and then Rubio dropped a 26 point triple double on him?
Trade him for Ricky Rubio you cowards
Point guard market has been inflated for years if a player is adequate enough that “terrible” for them is 3 20 point games in a series then they are good enough that they are the kind of guy who’ll get near that range. It’s Ricky Rubio/Terry Rozier money
I don't know - I think ideally they'd like more of an actual point guard.  Still wishing for a Ricky Rubio trade - I think a table-setting point guard would do wonders next to both of the Jays and ideally Al Horford can cover for Rubio's iffy 3-point shot.
"My personal take on the infamous former Laker core that got traded to NO is that all of them are inconsistent players. They have potential but they won’t  be top stars. They are in the Demar DeRozan tier. Good but not good enough.   Trae, Luka, Ja, Booker are consistent and that’s why they are leaders. When Lebron went down they had their best chance to prove what they were made of and they choked hard. They got traded to a team with Zion and much talent around them, and still choke hard especially at the end of the games. I can’t remember a team with 2 All stars that misses the 10th seed. ! It’s not on Lonzo, but if he was the second coming of Jason Kidd as many claim he would have led them to a winning record. If he is the second coming of Ricky Rubio well he can’t.   That said his biggest flaw is driving which can be fixed by improving the free throws. A guard that can’t drive is not a threat at all for serious defenses. He can’t even run a pick n roll due to this deficiency. He just hangs around and waits for a catch and shoot as he can’t hit out of a dribble either. Even that catch n shoot is way too inconsistent to be considered a threat. So actually his team is forced to play 4vs 5 on offense. Good luck with anyone that invests on him to be their starting PG."
Why? Then you just trade him. Like we’ve seen the “untradable” contracts of Westbrook and CP3 moved how many times already?   Like how many times have we seen Ricky Rubio moved around?
I remember when Ricky Rubio was the first player born in the 1990s drafted me being born in 92 that’s the one that did it for me.
Cavs legend Ricky Rubio.
Who else are we getting? We had Ricky Rubio (who is about as good as anyone we could get this offseason) and didnt make the playoffs. CP3 is way better than any FA currently
"The officiating was garbage tier. It wasn't biased for Slovenia or Spain; it was just inconsistent as hell. The most obvious example was when Ricky Rubio drew two early charges against Luka. Fine, that's a 50/50 call. Then he tried it again several more times and it was a block every time after that despite his position being even more set than when it got called a charge (except once later when he was obviously moving).  There were several makeup calls, late whistles...etc stuff you'd normally see in a badly reffed NBA game."
"Lol then we would have to hear you cry even more when cade, Jalen and suggs all signed with the Lakers or nets or contenders like the bucks or sun's.  It's literally not a problem. If teams really wanted the player they would draft him and own his rights even if he left and devoloped his game in Europe like Ricky Rubio did(or stayed in Europe*)  People just want to cry because it's the lakers"
"Last time I played in China, the people at the park were most interested in knocking your ass to the ground (think Raja Bell and Pat Bev types). They play hard, for sure, but that's basically channeled into fouls. Playing good help defense and recovering to your man after getting screened is non-existent because you can just deck someone to stop a possession. Can't get embarrassed by a crossover or blow by if you don't even get a shot up.  The basketball culture is just every man for himself, dribble 18 times like Harden and T-Mac before him (Rockets are the #1 team in China, at least pre-Morey controversy) and put up a Kobe-esque fadeaway. There is no AAU, and there's no youth level teams like Real Madrid/Barcelona to farm talent a la Ricky Rubio and Luka Doncic. It's a shame because there are kids out there with hops but are just so undisciplined that they would get benched immediately for dumb fouls/poor shot selections if they played overseas.  And yes, I'm a Rockets fan for exactly this reason and I modeled my game after Kobe/T-Mac."
ricky rubio stans in shambles
"I agree with you, and Ricky Rubio as the first option is just..."
"They almost lost against Ricky Rubio and Spain. You think THJ, KP, Brunson can’t replicate Rubios offense?? Remember Rubio can’t even shoot the ball and he was cooking Luka Doncic. All you classy fans don’t understand basketball a lick."
"Sergio Lull, Usman Garuba, Rudy Fernandez and Abalde are on the same Real Madrid team. Pau and Albrines are on the same Barcelona team   Ricky Rubio has been playing on the Spain team since he was 17 along with Luoll, Gasol brothers, Rudy &amp; Sergio Rodriguez.   So basically they’ve been together as kids with a few younger talent that play together professional.   They have more chemistry then the USA"
"Then tell me who fouled in fourth  quarter if you watched the game. Argue with facts. Spain fouls in 4th quarter.  1. Rudy Fernandez,  2. Victor Claver,  3. Ricky Rubio,  4. Ricky Rubio,  5. Rudy Fernandez (5th foul, Prepelic shot 2 FTs),  6. Abalde (6th foul, Dragic shot 2 FTS)  There was also tehnical foul on Spain for 6 players on court which resulted with tehnical FT, which is noted as Spain foul in ESPN boxscore, but its not actually team foul."
"Cant wait for Spain to draw USA so our national hero Ricky Rubio can score 28 points on 10/30.  Jokes apart, fun game and close one. I think we went for a plan but we didnt expect it to work and Scariolo got confused."
As a fake Slovenian and nationalized Spanish by my dead grandfather. Fuck Spain and Ricky Rubio with his shitty ass charges
Ricky Rubio really took 23 shots in 24 minutes of play..
As a Slovenian; i really like Ricky Rubio and I love our fake Slovenian.
Watch Ricky Rubio become prime Ray Allen vs USA
Olympic patty mills&gt; Olympic Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio being on the bench still is a crime.
Yo mean Ricky Rubio? Just a joke
ricky rubio 5/18 wtf lmao
Ricky Rubio is sexy ngl
"Better PG duo, Steph Curry and Damian Lollards or Olympic Patty Mills and Ricky Rubio"
"Ricky ""Steph Paella"" Rubio"
Does Ricky Rubio post a lot of Yoga selfies on his van life travel blog?
"Okay, lemme explain why Spain doesn't have any chances against Slovenia:  Their best players are role player Ricky Rubio, who's their first scoring option which says alot, aged Pau and Marc who are already too old for this shit, Willy Hermanboobiez, whose defense is non-existent and Rudy Fernandez, who was out of NBA after 4 years. And worst of all they all don't fit each other, they defense is ok, but offense sucks too much, if your first option is Ricky Rubio.(Only scored 88 against Japan and 81 against Argentine).  Meanwhile Slovenia has MVP candidate Luka Doncic, who ain't even at his prime yet, and Vlatko Cancar, who's better offensive player than Rubio. Rest of the players are elite shooters who fit with Luka well, even more than in Dallas. They scored 118 against Argentine and 116 against Japan which says a lot about their offensive power. But their defense is so-so.  So it's basically Slovenia's offense vs Spain's defense. If Spain clamp Luka hard, they'll leave open their shooters, and if they'll have 1v1 defense, Luka will feast on ISOing.  IMO final score will be 102:90 in favour to Slovenia."
staying up til 4am to watch ricky rubio let's goo
"Remind me what changed when he got PG13 and Anthony for a supposed big three? Did anything change? Oh yeah, they improved their season wins by 1 LOL.  Also, what happened to Oladipo that year after leaving Thunder? Did he not become an all-star with the pacers?  Also, wasn't WB the same guy that got smoked by a non-shooting Ben Simmons, an average starting PG Ricky Rubio, and a rookie Donovan Mitchell? LOLOLOL  Russ is not perfect because he's more of a liability than an asset. Only casuals are impressed with his ""effort"" when he doesn't play defense consistently and off-ball properly."
Ricky Rubio?
Ricky Rubio or Jason Kidd?
"&gt;July 29 CLE Ricky Rubio, 2022 2nd MIN Taurean Prince   we got the 2nd"
kryie is king of unnecessary fancy dribbles. Ricky Rubio (current rank #3 in Olympics PPG) could achieve the same thing without the fancy dribbles.
"He actually fits very nicely as a pass-first slasher who can defend at a high level #1 through #3. Dunn, Smart, Brown, Tatum, and Horford could be an elite defensive lineup with good balance on offense. It depends on how well he recovered, but I'd rather take fliers on him and Richardson and add some extra depth than pay for say Ricky Rubio."
"Because they've been playing in that system for years. They may play in the NBA now, but growing up in their country they all played together in different age groups up to the national team for years. For example patty Mills has played for Australia since 2007, and Ricky Rubio with Spain since he was 17. They all know each other and their roles/system. Unlike the USA who puts a new squad out every couple of years with less than a month to figure it out."
"&gt;Ricky Rubio with improving shooting, driving,  The problem is those two are his weaknesses, and they are pretty serious weaknesses in the NBA today. Rubio also never developed in either of these two areas.  In my opinion, the odds that a bad shooter can become a good shooter is as good as the odds that a bad playmaker can become a good playmaker. It's a crapshoot, but a bad playmaker doesn't hurt a team as much as a bad shooter does."
"I had Giddey as high as 4 on my board sometimes. I can definitely see the appeal, jumbo playmakers are always valuable. A 6'8 Ricky Rubio with improving shooting, driving, finishing, and defensive skills is a pretty damn good player. Would say it was probably the right pick"
"I don't feel bad for him because he moved to Atlanta. It's because it feels like even with his talent, he seems to not have found a permanent home aka Ricky Rubio.      He'd be great in Atlanta"
Preview of the rest of the lakers target list for this summer:  Markelle Fultz   Bismack biyombo  Dwight Howard  Elfrid payton  Josh jackson  Tony Allen  Ricky rubio
"Westbrook carried OKC to what? 3 straight losses to the Jazz in G2-4 and owned by Ricky Rubio  G2-4: 19 PPG, 5.3 turnovers/game, 35/30/79 shooting"
ricky rubio made sense. but flynn idk man
The Wolves need a point guard. They had two lottery picks.   5\. Ricky Rubio   6\. Jonny Flynn   7\. Wardell Curry Jr.
I dont think Giddey is a bad move. Maybe a bit early and Kuminga could be worth it but at worst you get a 6'8 Ricky Rubio at best he develops into an actual offensive player
"People are trying to talk themselves into it and telling themselves to trust Presti, but in general people were shocked by it and are unsure about it overall. I'm a bit negative about it too. Maybe Presti thinks he's the BPA and has star potential, but I don't see it with him and don't like his fit with our current guard rotation (we need shooting, scoring, and shot creation. Giddey seems like just a big dude who can pass but not score by himself. A tall Aussie version of Ricky Rubio). And I can't believe we took another guard at 18 to pair with our overstuffed guard rotation."
"I can’t stress enough how much I hate drafting redundancy. You gotta be a soecial kinda special to draft redundant players in a positionless game! Like all you gotta do is not draft 2 centers or 2 point guards!  Orlando is essentially giving away a pick/player bc you are 100% gonna have to trade one of the guards.  I’ve been around enough to know the comments without even reading: ‘Anthony and Suggs duel PGs watch out!’ It NEVER works. Ask Colin Sexton and Garland, ask Ricky Rubio and Johnny Flynn, the 96 Suns, ask Marbury and Francis, etc.  I really dislike this move. On 1 hand Anthony is a no wingspan guy so he’s strictly a 1 offensively and defensively.  But then you have Suggs who is a pure PG who if you take that away and play him at the 2 he’s not overly explosive and he’s not a scorer. Bad move  Edit: and now sacrament does the same with Mitchell! 😭 WTF. So you drafted your 6th man with the 8th pick ?!"
"Terrible pick. BPA at the point guard position, or with 2 small guards,  is almost always a bad move. You’re essentially giving away a pick/player bc you are 100% gonna have to trade one of the guards.   I’ve been around enough to know the comments without even reading ‘Anthony and Suggs duel PGs watch out!’ It NEVER works. Ask Colin Sexton, ask Ricky Rubio and Johnny Flynn, the 96 Suns, ask Marbury and Francis.   I really dislike this move. On 1 hand Anthony is a no wingspan guy so he’s strictly a 1, and then you have Suggs who is a pure PG who if you take that away and play him at the 2 he’s n out overly expositor and he’s not a scorer. Bad move"
Ricky Rubio?
"please do  kind of hilarious that you think they can even beat the USA running 2 washed up gasol brothers and ricky rubio  you clearly don't understand what they are dealing with, luka is a lebron james level talent  yeah spain has been good for almost 2 decades on the back of pau gasol, but he's 41"
Ricky Rubio we didn’t deserve him.  Traded his ass twice.
why is russ the competitive player of his era? cuz he dunks really hard? cuz he takes himself out of a series trying to outplay Ricky Rubio?
How is Ricky Rubio only 30? Thought he was like 38 by now
"Change this face, be happy, enjoy it. - Ricky Rubio, Timberwolves Legend!"
"if the cavs dropped colin sexton and replaced him with ricky rubio, they are the dumbest team to ever exist.  This has nothing to do with Sexton."
ricky rubio tricked a team into acquiring him using FIBA rules lmaoooo
"Cool to see that Mobley will be getting mentored by the best center of this generation, Ricky Rubio"
??? yea we went and got Ricky Rubio to replace colin sexton
"TRADE: The Cleveland Cavaliers are acquiring Minnesota Timberwolves G Ricky Rubio, a 2022 second-round pick and cash for F Taurean Prince, sources tell ESPN."
man Ricky in Tokyo gets traded to the damn Cavs   Rubio been tossed around like crazy past 5 years
"He’s usually used as a point guard in transition, where he runs down the court and finishes or creates for teammates. You’d want him to be used as a hyper-athletic point guard in the half court, like a Fox, Westbrook, or Wall, but he hates taking shots so he can’t really create much. Therefore he’s like a Ricky Rubio with the ball, and a normal dunking big man without the ball. On defense he’s most similar to peak Kawhi Leonard, a guy who shuts down ball handlers from 1-4 but doesn’t provide quite enough strength or rim protection to be a 5 like Draymond Green."
Ricky Rubio in international competitions is ridiculous.
Like if Nico Mannion and Ricky Rubio had a child together
Ricky Rubio is averaging 20 a game in the Olympics maybe seven been wrong about him this whole time
"Fair. If only we could merge Beasley and Okogie into one player…  All that said, I’d rather have Rubio than KCP for the simple fact Ant and Rubio are great friends. Ant loves Ricky…it would be a bummer to lose him as a teammate."
Ricky Rubio: prettiest eyelashes in the NBA.
International Ricky Rubio &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NBA Ricky Rubio
" Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and two timberwolves FRPs  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
" Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and a timberwolves FRP  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
Ricky Rubio belongs there. He looked like a Hobbit in his younger days.
"Right before the draft starts there is a three team trade between the sixers raptors and the timerwolves.  Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and the timberwolves FRP  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
You’ll get Ricky Rubio and you’ll like it
"As a Spaniard I am biased, but I think Spanish team in Beijing 2008 has been the best not USA team, with a lot of NBA players: Pau Gasol (Lakers), Marc Gasol (Grizzlies), Ricky Rubio (still playing in Spain), Calderon (Raptors), Garbajosa (former Raptors player), Raul Lopez (former Jazz player), Rudy Fernandez (Blazers).  Not only the roster was great, they played as a real team as they had done two years before when they won the World Championship at Japan."
I feel like basketball fans who only watch NBA basketball don’t recognize that the skill gap between NBA-level talent and the talent outside of the NBA is closing more and more every year. Just appreciate how good (great) Ricky Rubio and other foreign players have been during these Olympics so far and stop trying to diminish it.
Ricky Rubio. That’s the whole comment
"Ricky ""Jesús"" Rubio"
"Ricky ""Steph Paella"" Rubio"
"Ricky ""Steph Curry"" Rubio will be back soon. Don't worry"
"RICKY ""PATTY"" RUBIO"
Doncic? I dont know him. Only i know Ricky Rubio
Ricky 'Stephen Curry' Rubio
"Dude Chris Paul, with one year left on his deal, was worth Kelly oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque, and a late first at his age 36 season. Chris Paul is significantly better than Lowry ever has or will be. Why would Lowry be worth so much more than that on a sign and trade?? I mean cmon no need to break the bank when the market value in a similar scenario was established. Also, Father Time is unbeaten and a championship from 3 seasons ago doesn’t meant anything today. Even Lebron is showing signs of slowing down massively at 36 years old. Don’t let the fact that Lowry is one of your favorite players cloud the obvious here."
They didn't have a point guard without him. If you replace him with Ricky Rubio sixers are like a 5 or 6 seed
Ricky Rubio and a second
Rondo is closer to Ricky Rubio than any of those guys
"This is an amazing quote and very much sums up how I feel. He seems like a really great guy and a good teammate but he was really in a no-win situation AND performed very poorly in Minny. He was asked to replace Rubio, there was a short stretch after that trade where we thought we were getting Lowry, and then he shows up. So he’s not Lowry, he’s not Ricky (and he was something like $5M more a year) and his play made fans long for the days of Barea (ok maybe too harsh). His quote here had me laughing and I’m glad he’s taken this approach."
That's fair. Maybe Ricky Rubio would be a better comp. I feel that the hype that Doncic got before the draft was about on par with what Rubio got when he was first drafted. Obviously the two are in different stratospheres as NBA players but pre-draft many saw Rubio's ceiling as a multi-year all star PG.
"The other day I was thinking about, back when Ricky Rubio was a hyped up rookie, I saw some Knicks fan saying they couldn't wait to watch him drop dimes in Madison Square Garden (implying he'd be a future Knick). I'm going to convince myself this memory resurfacing is what brought this game on."
Ricky Rubio has an Empire State sized dong
Ricky Rubio
Hopefully Ricky Rubio wins a championship someday. One of my favorite players
Alright fine what about Mike Conley or Ricky Rubio
Ricky Rubio is beautiful and perfect and my best friend
"Ricky ""Steph Curry"" Rubio"
I love watching #1 option Ricky Rubio
Cavaliers demand to be taken seriously. This was a good win on the Knicks. But on the real though who expected ricky Rubio to be a secret weapon for the Cavaliers?  It’s hard to beat a team that was shooting like they were. Wasn’t even bad defense imo just solid offense.
Ricky Rubio. I think you mean Spanish Steph
I just saw Ricky Rubio put up 37 and 10 in the Garden 😔

"brad doherty, ricky rubio, lebron"
Ricky Rubio is a treasure and it pains me to this day that he had such a brutal injury so early in his mba career
This dude nearly dropped 40.  Ricky Rubio almost scored 40.  10 dimes too? This dude went off? Wtf!
When you hold ~~Steph Curry~~ Ricky Rubio to under 40 points that's a W in my book
Ricky Rubio is a hybrid of MJ and curry

"I mean this is awesome, but RICKY RUBIO"
Really does feel like you could have put Gary Payton on Ricky Rubio tonight and it wouldn’t of mattered  Fuckin end me
Was that Ricky Rubio or Steve Nash
So...Ricky Rubio was/is the Cavaliers secret weapon.   8/9 from 3 for 37 points.
"My teams biggest strength is star guard Ricky Rubio  (Actually our defense is generally strong enough that we survive poor shooting nights) the cavs actually look pretty deep right now but I would be really surprised if that lasts.  Cedi Osman and Ricky Rubio have been incredibly strong…. I would be surprised if that lasts.  Our weakness is that when our offense breaks down, it really breaks down.  The Cavs have had several occasions where they score a handful of points while an opponent scores like 20."
knicks really got dropped off by ricky rubio lmao
Bing Bong motherfucker - Ricky Rubio
I didn't watch this.  Is Ricky Rubio the second coming? 8/8 from 3 and 10 assists? the fuck?
Quickley thought he was Ricky Rubio for a minute.
Someone must've told Ricky this was for a world cup game or something because FIBA Rubio is showing up tonight.
Noted sharpshooter Ricky Rubio
Stupid sexy Ricky Rubio
RICKY RUBIO WHAT THE FUCKKKKK???
Really tough to game plan against Steph Curry….  Wait what do you mean that’s Ricky Rubio?
That’s Future MVP Ricky Rubio to you sir
Ricky Rubio watched Curry's masterclass on shooting last night.
Lmaooo ya right we’re watching Ricky fuckin Rubio go 7/7 from 3
"Ricky Rubio demolishing from deep, just as everybody expected."
"Ricky ""Steph Curry"" Rubio"
"You’re right, I don’t understand getting so emotional about Ricky Rubio smoking you that you pick 4 fouls in the first half of a playoff game including one that is 75 feet from the basket.  Personally I think that’s pretty fucking stupid. But maybe I just don’t understand the hidden genius there."
I was going to start watching Cavs games this year and rooting for you guys until you acquired Ricky Rubio who is a terrible player that I cannot force myself to watch.
"I think the core issue is that most playmakers arent stars. If you can get two STARS with well rounded games then yea, it’d be worth it.   But you usually have to give something up when dealing with roleplayers or non-stars. Pairing someone like Bron with Ricky Rubio, or Lonzo pre-three point shooting wouldn’t be ideal. Or imagine a Rondo + Simmons lineup, it’d be kinda meh."
"Agreed, and I think this is going to reach a head quicker than people realize because all the veterans (age wise) who are mostly the core of this team do not really bring veteran intangibles and in some cases bring negative ones. I just don't see the Wolves gaining any traction with this current roster because of this. It seems to me that something significant needs to happen, bringing in vets like Taj Gibson, Ricky Rubio, Pat Bev clearly hasn't worked."
Ricky Rubio
