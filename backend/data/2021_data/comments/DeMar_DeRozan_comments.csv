&gt;DeMar DeRozan congratulates FVV and roasts Kyle Lowry  How many Raptors legends can you fit in one sentence?
DeMar DeRaptor DeRozan
"little selfish, but demar derozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Keldon Johnson, dame, chris Paul"
I fucking love Demar Derozan lmao
no  1. FVV - 54  2. Demar Derozan - 52  3. VC and T. Ross - 51
"Losing vassell and a potential lottery pick so we can add Vucevic to a team that has no guarantee of making the playoffs is a complete waste of assets. This team is going in the direction of the DJM, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker timeline. Not the DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay timeline. That trade does nothing for us"
"I'd like to trade DeMar at the deadline if we can get a pick and expiring for him or offer him like 20M/year at most. Let him walk if he doesn't take it.   Dejounte - Derrick - Keldon - Free Agent - Poeltl  Mills - Walker - Vassell - Samanic/Lyles if we re-sign him - Free Agent  Is what I imagine our rotation being like next season if we don't keep Aldridge, Gay, or DeRozan. Realistically one of Dejounte or Derrick should be on court basically the whole game and Lonnie might start instead of Derrick. I see no issue with keeping all of our young players. Dejounte and Derrick are combo guards. Walker and Vassell are swingmen and Keldon can play 3 or small ball 4."

"CJ won't get in because of the injury. Bam won't get in because of the record. Hayward, Derozan, Vucevic won't get in because they are ""old"" and not that market able. Maybe only Demar can snuck in if San Antonio are still top 5. Brogdon is not a household name and doesn't play that good. Same for Randle. Wood is great but unless Rockets went on a 15 game winning strike, he would be like many other young greats who would need to back it up with another year. Like Curry in 2013. Mitchel and Zion are locks 99%. The only potential snubs I can see which will deserve the voting are Conley, CP3 and Ingram.  Jazz are difficult with Rudy, Donovan and Conley. I just don't see how wil the NBA allow them to have more than 2"
"Can we talk about how Demar DeRozan backed down Dillon Brooks and scored, then shoved Ja and talked shit to DB, getting a tech.  And then he proceeded *not to score again the entire game* lmao."
"Demar derozan is like 6'7"" with way better footwork and more variety of shots in the mid range. The guy is playing the 4. Westbrook can't do all that.   If anyone Westbrook should look at it's Derrick Rose imo."
1. Demar Derozan  2. Demar Derozan 3. Demar Derozan
"I already loved his game when he was with you guys - when we got him I thought if we were getting 2016-2018 raptors demar derozan that's awesome!   But he's actually gotten better, maybe his raw scoring numbers aren't as high but overall I love the player he's become I already knew the fanbase would love him as a person and teammate. Him growing his game even more is gravy."

"We got the Melvin Capital of DeMar DeRozan hate, here.  Keep doubling down and doubting, the man will keep coming back with fire and add to his game"
"I used to be one of the ""DeRozan is a choker"" people but yeah, after seeing what Bron can do to teams even after 17 years, I really dont think there's much more DeMar could've done. Probably one of the best SGs/SFs of the 00's-20s, I think he'll go down remembered similar to Carmelo with a better attitude. Number 10 will never be worn by another Raptor again and rightfully so."
"Spurs and Derozan fan here, Jamal definitely had a solid case for being better than Demar after last season's playoffs. Man was pure fire in the Bubble."
"When he first came he had a similar role as he did in Toronto, he did have more leeway to create because the Spurs didn’t have anyone nearly close to Lowry, but he had a fair share of ISO under Pop, specially late game and ball movement simply died out. Demar got plenty of flak fron our fan base for it, but it was just a matter of personnel and coaching decisions.  Things really changed on the bubble, because of injuries the Spurs were forced to play smaller and faster, Derozan flourished."

DeMar “All-Star Voting Has Begun” DeRozan
Michael Jordan is just DeMar DeRozan  Magic Johnson is just flashy Ben Simmons    you dont have to disrespect legends to make todays game look better. get outta here lmao
"I’m all for demar being an all star, but starters are decided using 50% fan vote so derozan has no chance to be a starter, and coaches determine the reserves.   So unfortunately voting for derozan honestly won’t help at all."
First time I'd seen him play was tonight. I'd bet money he'll be an all-nba player. He really stood out and he hardly got the ball. Also DeMar derozan looks like a top 20 player. Lol at 82 or whatever he got ranked
Demar derozan literally sounds like a jedi
"It's not so much he's washed, he's a good player and still athletic, he just doesn't play winning basketball (see also demar derozan, andre drummond)."
Nah just Demar Derozan
Can a raptors fan explain why Derozan ranks above Bosh as the second greatest Raptor? No disrespect to DeMar I just didn't think he was the loved from Toronto.
How can you forget DeMar DeRozan? That alliteration!
"Good win, but really no excuse for Derozan taking the 6th most shots in the team. No one's development is being stalled if Demar takes 13 shots and everyone shoots 1 shot less.  Would not have been this close."
DeMar DeRozan
"Lol yeah saying ""Demar Derozan is a good player"" is a way hotter take"
"It's close, but 40% FTr keeps DeRozan on top. No reason to think Mitchell can't get there or better though.

"I don't hate VC for how he left, I actually am in favour of retiring his jersey. After our first and second greatest players Lowry and DeRozan. If you knew about the Raptors fanbase and how we feel about VC you'd know that, instead you make it seem like everyone loves the dude when that is not the case. And there are people who don't like Kawhi for talking shit bout the Raptors as he left as well. And no one really cares about Bosh leaving cause the team was absolutely ass and who wouldn't want to leave.  It doesn't matter what VC did, he has been surpassed by Lowry and DeRozan on the greatest Raptors list. Vince Carter said Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time, Masai did, the founder of the Raptors franchise John Bitove did, our announced trio of Devlin/Armstrong/Rautins did, DeMar DeRozan did.  Kyle Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time. Go argue about Jeezy vs Gucci or question why your franchise has been a failure for 70 years or something and let the grown not ignorant not idiotic folks talk."
DeMar DeRozan -2.0
"Lowry was a top 15 player in the league and if you use impact stats a top 5-10 player in the league through his Raptors career. OK is being a replacement level player, Lowry is a 6 time consecutive All Star and best player on a top team in the conference for his entire run with the team. Tell me, name one other player who has made the All Star team for back to back to back to back to back to back seasons but only played OK? For someone who claims to be a fan of the NBA you sure seem to not know shit bout ball.  Lowry is the greatest Raptor of all time because of what he did for the team as a whole. Our greatest run in franchise history starts with him becoming the defacto starting point guard over Jose Calderon, in which he took us from 34-48 &amp; 10th in the East to 48-34 &amp; 3rd in the east, and then never dropping below 4th in the East and 48 wins up until now. He   Oh, and Kobe &amp; KD are not defacto greatest Laker or Thunder. Magic + Russ are also regarded as the GOATs for their respective teams. It isn't basically consensus within their fanbase like it is with Lowry. Oh, and Vince Carter the third greatest Raptor of all time himself has said Kyle Lowry is the greatest Raptor. So even the player you are ignorantly and incorrectly trying to call our franchise GOAT. DeMar DeRozan, the second greatest Raptor said Lowry is the GROAT. Masai Ujiri called him the GROAT. Matt Devlin, Leo Rautins, Jack Armstrong and Sam Mitchell have called Lowry the GROAT. Lowry is the Greatest Raptor Of All Time without a shadow of the doubt.  Being the catalyst, the centrepiece, the engine of the best period of Raptors basketball is greatness. Also, VC is pretty disliked by Raptors fans old enough to have grown up with him due to how he left. To the point of him getting booed for YEARS up until just a few years ago. Even to this day, there are a large amount of Raptor fans who don't think he should have his jersey retired because of how he forced his way out. And there are absolutely people who are currently growing up wanting to play like Lowry and DeRozan. The current generation of kids don't know Vince Carter, he's just some old dude who warmed the bench for the Hawks. They only know and grew up with the Lowry and DeRozan Raptors. So not only do you not know basketball, Raptors history, basic attendence figures but you also don't know how time works."
"&gt; I never lied you idiot. The Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998, the franchise set league-attendance records. So easily debunked huh? Apparently not, because clearly you had no fucking idea.  You 100% are lying. I literally looked at the NBA attendence rankings and I provided you the highest average attendence for VC and Lowry+DeRozan, which one was higher? Lowry and DeRozans. It is actually the highest average attendence in Raptors franchise history. What was that about not setting attendence records?  You also claim the Raptors struggled in their early years. Simply not true.  Here are try Raptors average attendence for each season from the inaugural thru Vince Carters last full season with us.  Season | Rank | AVG :--|:--:|--: 95-96 | 3 | 23,178 96-97 | 8 | 18,266 97-98 | 18 | 16,468 98-99 (VC Drafted + ACC opening) | 10 | 17,567 99-00 | 9 | 18,451 00-01 | 6 | 19,347 01-02 | 4 | 19,783 02-03 | 10 | 18,963 03-04 | 8 | 18,307  Outside of a single outlier in 97-98, attendance has been stable before, during and after Vince Carter. The Raptors didn't struggle with attendence in our early years. We also didn't even set league attendence records, we were 10th in attendance during his rookie season. In the 1st and 2nd season of the Raptors existence we were 3rd and 8th.  &gt; I never said he was making HOF solely because of his raptors career. Hes making it because he's an icon of basketball and that started at Toronto, vinsanity was Toronto and Toronto basketball started with Vince Carter.  Toronto Basketball started with Mighty Mouse Damon Stoudemire, not Vince Carter. For someone who acts like they know so much about the Raptors, it's odd you forgot about Mighty Mouse, someone that fans haven't forgotten nor has the franchise.  And as a Raptor, he has been long surpassed by Lowry and DeMar. What VC did after leaving the Raptors strengthens his hall of fame case especially with his longevity and his willingness to take a step back, something other star players have has trouble with as well so hats off for VC for that. But he is not the greatest or second greatest Raptor.  &gt; Hawks supporter* NBA fan. Imagine thinking because you support a team it means you know nothing about the rest of the NBA...  Hawks fan who doesn't know nothing bout the Raptors or basic attendence figures*  &gt; Clearly you're just butthurt because Vince wanted out after putting the raptors on the map and not getting any supporting cast until it was too late.  Actually, I'm not. I actually think Vince Carter should get his jersey retired by us (after Lowry and DeRozan) and regularly go back and forth with other Raptors fans about it. Vince Carter got fucked over by how trash our ownership and front office was (and so was Chris Bosh). I have no issue with Vince Carter leaving and I understand why he would want to leave. I have no issue with Bosh, Kawhi, Mighty Mouse, Canby and McGrady but the issue I have with VC is how he went about it. He basically pulled a Harden except he added on just completely not giving a fuck on the court basically just purposefully playing beneath himself to hurt the team. There was also talk of him telling opposing teams our plays, not sure if it is true or just a rumour, but it matches up with how he was actually playing on the court.  &gt; Even kawhi and Bosh didn't want to stay in Toronto. Maybe if you idiots actually had an eye for greatness you'd retain actual *great* players. Peak Lowry and Peak Derozan don't even come close to peak VC.  Are we talking about Greatest Raptors or Best Raptors? Cause you do know there is a difference right? Kawhi is the single best player to wear a Raptors uniform. But he isn't the greatest, he doesn't have the longevity nor accomplishments to hold that title, Lowry does. What you seem to be arguing is, LeBron is the greatest Laker because he is the best player to ever put on the Lakers Purple And Gold over Kobe/Magic, or that Kevin Durant is the greatest Net of all time cause he is a better player than Dr. J. Or that LeBron is the greatest Heat player cause he is the best player to wear the jersey even though we all know the greatest Heat is D Wade.  Also, you're a Hawks fan. Get a chip in the modern era before talking about retaining great players. Maybe if idiots such as you weren't Hawks fans or stopped being idiots who don't understand the difference between greatest and best or basic attendence figures maybe y'all will do something with Trae instead of wasting him away like you've done with Hawks stars of the past."
"Vince is not making the Hall Of Fame solely on his Raptors career. A Raptors career in which is individual AND team accomplishments have been matched and surpassed by both Lowry and DeRozan. Lowry will most likely eventually make it into the Hall Of Fame seeing he has an 86% HoF probability according to BBRef and all his accomplishments come from his Raptors career, one that has more individual and team accomplishments than Vince Carter. DeMar matches Raptors VC in All NBA's (both have one second and one third) and only one less All Star appearances (4 vs 5) but completely dwarfs Vince Carter in team accomplishments. We actually made it farther in the playoffs with DeMar and Lowry than VC.  Kyle and DeMar never set attendence records you say? Let's compare the highest attendence record for Vince Carter Raptors vs the Lowry and DeRozan Raptors.  Vince Carter 2002. 19,783 average attendence, 4th in the league.  Lowry and DeRozan 2018. 19,839 average attendence, 4th in the league. That is actually the franchise record for average attendence, including the championship season and #RunItBack season.  Lowry and DeRozan have three seasons with a higher average attendence than the highest average Vince Carter's Raptors peaked at.  If you're gonna lie about something, don't make it something easy to debunk like attendence.  Imagine being a Hawks fan trying to lecture a Raptors fan about who our greatest player is (it's Lowry not by an centimetre, but by a kilometre) and where VC ranks (clearly behind DeMar)."
"I like Derozan, and I know Aldridge has been pretty bad. However, he isn’t in great shape yet this season, and there’s a chance he can get hot and get in rhythm. Maybe not a big chance, but with a player like him, if he slims down and gets determined he can flip a switch. We’ve seen him be bad in a Spurs jersey before, just to end the season strong.   Demar however, while I love him, his ISO heavy offensive nature can at time create open looks, but IMO, it for the most part just stagnates an offense that should be fast paced and motion based for these young players to really get going. Also, his defense is absolutely putrid. Aldridge hasn’t been much better on that end this season, but I’ve really seen some terrible defense from Derozan this season. He is so uninspired on that end of the floor."
Guys we’re in a thread about LaMarcus Aldridge and Demar Derozan. I know it’s dumb but you clearly know who they’re talking about
"VC was not playing like the best player in the league even in his best season of 2000-01. He only made two All NBA teams, one second and one third. That's not just as a Raptor, that is his entire career. The exact same as DeMar DeRozan actually, who has one second and one third as well. He was clearly behind Allen Iverson who won MVP in VCs best season, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber, Tracy McGrady, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe, and in a tier with players like Ray Allen and Jason Kidd.  We overrate Vince Carter actual ability on the court. He was a superstar not in play, seeing as he was clearly a step behind the actual best players in the league, but was in ability to bring in fans. He was a great player"
Literally Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan.
That happened to the spurs one game. We did a challenge because DeMar clearly got hit in the face and it ended up giving the rockets free throws because they weren't allowed to look at the no call on the hit to DeRozan.
one day Luka will get the superstar calls Demar fucking Derozan gets
"Demar DeRozan. Most slept on, every year"
"It is bigger than basketball. DeMar's off court impact alone is enough to warrant a retirement. His work in the community, breaking the mental health barrier in the NBA. People don't realize how big that was. NBA teams now have a mental health professional on every training staff, because of what DeMar started. They retire announcer jerseys, DeRozan has saved lives and had a greater impact throughout the country, and worldwide in other ways."
No mention of Demar DeRozan?  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/8/22220471/demar-derozan-spurs-trade-free-agency
"Demar DeRozan. He puts up numbers that you might assume would indicate his team thrives when he is on the floor, which could not be further from the truth."
DeMar DeRozan
"Raptors fans will always remember DeRozan. The face of the franchise during its most successful run won't be forgotten.  DeRozans accomplishments alone put him in the rafters forget the team success and being on the marque.  Raptors leader in points, games played and minutes played. Third in assists and steals. Tied for most All NBA appearances with Vince Carter. Most players of the month and week. 4 all star appearances as a Raptor behind only Lowry and Vince Carter.  Tell me, what team doesn't retire the jersey of their franchise leading scorer, franchise leader in minutes, games, All NBA appearances, Player Of The Week+Month and third in All Star appearances?  This is why I'm tired of Americans talking about the Raptors. Y'all have no clue what y'all talking about or what DeMar DeRozan meant to the team, to the fanbase and to the city.  [You smoke crack don't? Look at me boy, don't you smoke crack?](https://youtu.be/4yAFupGGl_g)"
The Demar Derozan signature move.
"Let's not act like Kyrie hasn't had a history of being kind of a douche.  DeMar DeRozan missed a few games for ""personal reasons"" to deal with his ill father and no one made a peep...in fact, people were overwhelmingly supportive. DeMar didn't have to issue a public statement or anything...he just went about his business in a professional manner and the Spurs gave him his space.  Meanwhile, Kyrie misses a few games for reasons that are still undisclosed, didn't communicate with his coach or GM during his absense, and was seen out partying without a mask while he was gone. It's a completely different scenario at that point.  People will be judged by their actions. That's life. Social media just gives everybody a microphone."
Look at the vote breakdown during those years.    KD finished around 7-9 each year.    Players like John Wall Paul George Joel Embiid Jokic and Damian Lillard all finished above him. And he finished slightly above Demar DeRozan.
"Come on. Is depth valuable? Yes. Did that Warriors team have strong depth? For sure. But the Warriors didn't win the title in 2015 with depth. They won it with high end talent and the best back court in the NBA - arguably one of the best backcourts ever. Steph was top 5 in almost every statistical offensive category, the most efficient offensive producer, 6th in points and played alongside a shooting guard who was 10th in PPG that season. The following season Steph won the MVP, led the league in points, and win share.  Here's an exercise, lets swap out the Klay/Steph backcourt in 2015 for Chris Paul and DeMar DeRozan. Are the Warriors winning that championship? No way.  If your focus is to win basketball games, you're better off improving your best 1/2 talent than your 7-10."
DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry.  My squad is solely in my imagination. 😔💔
That return was guaranteed to get you nothing.  Ingram(whoever else the Spurs wanted) and at least one pick is far far far more valuable than getting DeMar Derozan.  Every single GM in the league would have taken the Ingram trade over the DeMar one.  The only reason the Spurs didn’t was because it was the Lakers.
"Then how about how the organisations treat the players? IT played through injury to help his team in the playoffs and lost out on a big payday, got traded and is out of the league now.  Demar Derozan took less money, stayed in Toronto when no one else wanted to, worked with the rest of the team and Masai didn't even have the balls to inform him that he was being traded.  Since 2018, the Rockets have gotten worse year by year because Fertitta wanted to cut salary and get out of the luxury tax. Harden gave Houston 3 years, and it got worse each year, why wouldn't he want out?"
"&gt; with derozan and mills being huge this season  When the play-offs come and everyone is home but no one acknowledges the fact that DeMar, Aldridge, Mills - all bad in the play-offs.  Don't wanna let you down but it is a miracle if we even make it to the play-offs."
Wow so you're saying Simmons is akin to Demar Derozan... whew.
DeMar DeRozan at the 4?
Eh some people are big fans of certain players. I wanted to keep Demar even if it wasn’t the best basketball move. Even if it means we don’t win the title without Kawhi I just really miss the Lowry/Derozan duo
Demar derozan lol
"Thank you for including “82nd best player” demar derozan there, it’s criminal how he is overlooked"

DeMar DeRozan.
Bro just stop it. Demar Derozan gave the Raptors everything he had and they treated him like a rag doll. It's clear Rockets weren't making no effort to try to build a contender for Harden as evidenced by the teams trajectory the past 3 seasons after 17-18 season with 65 wins and they aren't making moves that scream that either. Harden had to get out.
Demar Derozan is up there. Footwork mastery
And DeMar DeRozan
"Dame Lillard, James Harden, Demar Derozan, Giannis, what Kobe said before blowing 3-1 lead in 2007, Rudy Gobert. And hey guess who else? Lebron in 2011 after “Not one, not two, not three.” There’s seven right there  Now tell me why it bothers you so much every little thing PG says?"

"pretty much. this applies to a few players to varying degrees. i think some casual fans would be under the impression a guy like westbrook is a top five player when healthy but shot selection kills his value imo. on the end of the spectrum, no one knows who the fuck derrick White is as a casual but he's genuinely literally our best player when healthy.   andre drummond has some monster box scores, he must be great, but you miss all the things he doesn't do right that way. bu then again, KCP was 20 spots ahead of demar derozan on the ESPN list so who the fuck knows what consensus actually is on anyone. lol"
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."

"Jakob has basically been the same player since the 2018 season. He managed to get worse at free throws and grow more passive on offense over the offseason though. I said after the bubble the most I would want to pay him was 8M/year and we ended up paying a little more than that. I think LaMarcus is definitely better than Jakob and Eubanks.  Aldridge fits terribly on defense with our team because we have DeRozan who can't guard guards well, Mills who gets destroyed by physical guards, and Dejounte gets pushed around by most players that aren't point guards and we're missing White who is definitely our best defender. That wouldn't be a huge deal if we had someone like Draymond to help him at the 4 but we basically mostly play DeMar/Keldon and Gay at 4 and none of them are going to provide substantial help to Aldridge defensively."
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Dončić, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
ah the demar derozan october special.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
Ah grats bro you just proved you know literally nothing about basketball. Look up DeMar DeRozan highlights. He’s got one of the wettest mid range jumpers in the league with 21 ppg
I’m looking at the top guys that are going to get dealt is....  1. Kyle Lowry  2. DeMar DeRozan  3. Andre Drummond  4. John Collins  5. Victor Oladipo
"Ok, fine. How about this:  * Luka is an elite interior finisher for a guard and is already a drastically more efficient player inside the arc than DeRozan--who has literally made a career on his ability to shoot twos--ever has been. At 20, Luka shot 57.4% on twos. This year, he's shooting 57.0%. DeRozan literally never had a 2p% above 50% in any season that he was a primary option until he was 30. * As much as you want to clown Luka's three point percentage, Luka is a better three point shooter than DeMar, both in terms of career % and factoring in Luka's penchant for taking tough threes at high volume. * Luka's a better ball handler and can navigate through traffic in the paint, which enables him to slow the game down and either wait for a clean look or find open teammates. * Luka's a better passer and playmaker and is asked to initiate offense for the Mavs on essentially every possession. DeMar never had to carry the role of both first-option scorer *and* primary playmaker. It a pretty physically demanding role that leads to more fatigue and injuries and (I would think) might have an effect on efficiency. * Luka's doing all of this on higher volume/usg rate than DeMar has really ever had to carry. * Luka is 21 years old and should continue to improve his game through his 20s, as evidenced by the fact that he's a better defender and midrange shooter this year.  DeMar is not a bad player at all. But Luka is already clearly and significantly better at 21."
"This falls flat for me.  I have a lot of respect for guys like Kevin Love and Demar Derozan.  They acknowledged that they were fighting some demons, they confronted them openly, and they advocate for better mental healthcare for those who face similar battles every day.  That's the mature, courageous, admirable way to handle it.  Kyrie has yet to come forward about any such issue.  He hasn't shown that courage.  To admit that he's vulnerable... that he's struggling... that he's human.  That he's relatable.  Instead, dude does the opposite.  He treats others as if they're beneath him.  He disrespects his teammates, his coaches, and his fans - not to mention the people who pay him $35M to play - by not showing up to work.  He gets caught on camera at a party with no mask, mocking the struggle that has touched almost everybody else in the world at this point.  Maybe he does have some demons.  And if he feels like he needs to talk about them at a future date, I'll listen at that time.  But until then, I'm gonna treat him as if he is exactly what he appears to be - an arrogant, entitled asshole."
"Tbf 3 seasons ago DeMar DeRozan and Boogie Cousines were all-star starters, things can change fast in the NBA. That being said, I think still think Harden is a championship caliber dude, especially next to Embiid, just saying that things can change really fast  Edit: Or next to Kevin Durant, lol, just saw the news"
Demar Derozan went extinct for this
It turns out that swapping Demar DeRozan for Trey Lyles makes us a much worse team. Hope we can get a little more of an offense together before the next couple games.
WE GOT A NATIONAL TELEVISED GAME LETS GOOOOOOO  not sure why TNT wants to show a spurs game without DeMar DeRozan vs the rockets BUT IT DONT MATTER
I think it's not fair because there is no stated criteria for what is a good dunk vs an okay dunk vs a bad dunk. It's inconsistent from one judge to the next and from one dunk to the next as to what score a dunk gets. Nothing particularly stuck out to me this year as unfair outside of that fundamental issue I have with the contest. I mean maybe the goal isn't to make the contest fair but I think a fair contest goes a long way towards getting the bigger names involved. Demar Derozan and Aaron Grodon both got hosed in multiple contests and decided never to compete again because of this. now we hear that some guys aren't into the idea because they've seen how others got robbed. Make a rubric and stick to it like in gymnastics or figure skating. Then maybe it'll entice some of the guys to get off the sidelines and into the show. Somebody else mentioned ranked choice voting instead of a scoring system. If you're not going to have a stated grading rubric I think this is the next best solution.
No I’d hate it lol.   Though it would be nice to see DeMar Derozan turn into MJ 🐐

"Yeah, I would say so, or maybe not stunted his potential but he definitely underutilized him. Casey’s time in Toronto he was famous for expecting Lowry/DeRozan to ride him off to the promised land without much of a backup plan that it seemed like he completely forgot the beast that he had down low.   You could really see JV come into his own in his final years as a Raptor when we would get to the playoffs and DeMar/Kyle had their fair share of struggles, but JV was basically an automatic bucket whenever you threw the ball down to him."
"You’re telling me the Warriors, who are already so massively over the cap and into the luxury tax, are dying to trade for Demar Derozan who really does not fit their team at all?"
"&gt; but Demar is like TJW on steroids  Demar is certainly a better playmaker, but I would actually disagree about scoring. Warren is more efficient than DeRozan on similar volume, and Warren is a legit 3 pt. threat. Hopefully LaVert gets the ball out of Brogon's hands, and Warren can add in that scoring punch when he gets back."
That's the **82nd** best player in the league DeMar DeRozan for you
Okay if we're going to say not all top nine records are equal then we can also say not all statistical accumulations are equal to right? If you're not going to reward a guy for being by far the best player on one of the record-wise best teams in the NBA why should we reward someone like Zach LaVine or Zion for putting up awesome numbers on a struggling team (these guys have been great I'm not taking a shot of them I'm just arguing towards the validity of an all-star birth in conjunction with the concept of that it's supposed to also be related to team success as well). If you say the Spurs not blowing guys out should take away from their record then I could equally argue that some of the guys putting up awesome numbers but their teams losing should not be given as much credence as guys putting up awesome numbers and their teams winning. In regards to demars plus and minus he assured the floor a lot with two of the spurs most promising young prospects in Johnson and Walker. Both of them are also currently a huge work in progress defensively but pop has for the most part allowed them to play through a lot of their mistakes with the idea of the end result being worth the growing pains. It feels really weird that this subreddit always turns me into a huge DeMar DeRozan defender because I could have never imagined that a year or two ago. And I respect where you're coming from man No hard feelings or anything. But I truly believe he has become quite frankly the most underappreciated player in the NBA.
"Usage rate is just how often a possession ends with you shooting it, being fouled, or turning it over. DeRozan averages way more assists and way less turnovers than Booker. Obviously DeMar has a lower usage rate but that doesn't mean he handles the ball way less."
"Oh I value how special Demar has been but the West has been insane this year with quality star play. The one guy I would maybe give DD the edge over is Zion due to team success but Zion has been a monster of late. It just sucks, I do wish there was more Derozan talk in the media"
He does. He also plays with Chris Paul. The Spurs second best player is dejounte Murray... This isn't to take any shots at DJ. He's an up-and-coming point guard for sure. The whole point he's making is DeMar DeRozan is by far the best player on the team with the ninth best record in the NBA and in some cases he's not even showing up on snublists let alone getting the All-Star recognition he rightfully deserved this year. I personally think Booker deserves it You guys have been great this year. I just don't personally think you guys should get two all-stars while the Spurs get zero based off expectations performance and roster construction.
"“According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Spurs are taking calls on LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Trey Lyles and Patty Mills ahead of the March 25 trade deadline.”"
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust. Not like the guy that went to Golden State at Pick Number 11: KLAY THOMPSON. They also missed out on Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard. Woof."
Malcolm Brogdon - the president  DeMar DeRozan - the CEO  Who is the CFO?

I think Demar Derozan and Jakob Poeltl have both been better than people bought they were at the time which is why I said it looks better now than then. It's just that it also looked like an awful return at the time.
What about Demar Derozan?
"DeRozan and Thompson? Klay is a pure shooter and tough defender who rarely draws fouls or creates for others, Demar is a slasher and poor defender who often draws fouls and is great at creating for others."
"As a corollary, the return the Spurs got for Kawhi leonard of Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson looks horrible by comparison even if it looks better than it did at the time of the trade."
Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala but that's kind of a copout so I'll say Demar Derozan
Demar Derozan is a better offensive player than Kawhi Leonard. Someone on Twitter with a decent following was trying to say this right after the Trade in 2018.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Of course they would do that trade, they weren't giving up Jaylen Brown, they were giving up DeMar DeRozan."
"Magic Johnson would at least reach a Demar Derozan level stroke in today's league, that's still really fucking good.  Simmons is a poor man's Magic."
Tatum is the next Demar Derozan
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, DeMar DeRozan and Mike Conley deserved to make the All-Star Game over Devin Booker."
2019-20: 2.8  2018-19: 2.9  Don't give me this Demar Derozan crap when I only have to go back 1 season to the last time he had a positive. Sometimes when I go looking for Demars last positive season my mouse clicking finger gets sore and I give up.  This is not a pattern.
"&gt; Except Derozan has a negative on/off long before the Raptors bench were even good.  Thats because he developed as a player. He really only become an impact player until 2014, which is when Masai Ujiri had really started to shake up the roster and build a really good bench.   The Raptors strength for most of Masai's tenure has always been the depth of the roster and the fact the benches have always been very high +/- units.   The Raptors starting lineup with DeMar since '14 was always a positive +/- unit but had a worse on/off compared to the bench units which were consistently Top 5 bench units in the league"
"Sabonis is the big man version of Raptors era DeMar DeRozan, to the nth degree. A look at his historically bad On/Off RAPTOR.  Worst RAPTOR On/Off numbers for [2013-14 thru 2019-20 PLUS 2020-21](https://imgur.com/a/9rALolo)  DeMar DeRozan on those 16 &amp; 17 Raptors teams became maligned by many for his bad On/Off numbers. He put up counting stats on a winning team, but most of that winning was driven by what the Raptors did with DeRozan on the bench.  A similar phenomenon is occurring this season with Sabonis &amp; the Pacers. Sabonis' -12.3 On/Off is 250th/250 qualifying players (minutes).  DeMar's worst years were -4.7 &amp; -4.6  This is a truly historic number for an All-Star, in Sabonis. No one in the tracking years (since 13-14) has been an All-Star and been anywhere close to Sabonis in this stat.  What do we make of this? How do we value players that put up counting stats on good efficiency to kinda keep even, but then have their teams win because of a killer bench?"

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"It was one opinion in a larger conversation (check the fucking title). This is only a result of Suns fans not accepting the truth: They may love him, but the national audience doesn’t give one fuck about his feelings of being disrespected.  If you want to cherry pick, I made a comment about Demar Derozan and ***it didn’t derail the conversation***..."
"yeah, obviously. I'm saying that this joke furthers stigma against people with mental illness, and it's a bad look. I cited DeMar specifically because he's a Raptors legend and I figured a Raptors fan would get that this is insensitive and with DeRozan has done work to normalize mental illness."
"&gt;We don’t respect Demar Derozan  i certainly do.  &gt;why should we (nationally) respect a player that hasn’t won?  because good players can be playing good basketball on bad teams, and the best player on a bad team isn't always padding or putting up empty stats, sometimes they are just a really good player on a bad team.  &gt;And what actually constitutes as disrespect to you?  calling a super efficient score with all-star numbers who can't win because he's given a g-league roster a stat-padder certainly fits.   would it be disrespectful to say that trae doesn't deserve respect and that he's putting up empty stats?"
"What I said proves nothing you’ve said. You’re a Suns fan, obviously you’re closer to the situation than most here. We don’t respect Demar Derozan, why should we (nationally) ***respect*** a player that hasn’t won? And what actually constitutes as disrespect to you?"
"I hate saying things like this because they’re so annoying to hear but I would’ve tried to package the picks and make a play at a guys like Myles Turner, DeMar Derozan, Steven Adams, Bogdan Bogdonvic, Jrue Holiday, Harrison Barnes. Or if I was really confident in my draft skills I wouldve made more of an effort to move up in the draft in either 2019 or 2020"
"Wait what? I’m playing victim because DeMar freakin DeRozan got COVID? Dog, look at our schedule and look at the games we missed. Those are easy teams. Those were easy wins. And we only lost to OKC cause we literally G-league team trot out there. There no victim complex here buddy, I’m just tired of people saying we won’t make the playoffs. Evidence suggests otherwise"
"I'd personally put Kawhi over DeMar. People look at the one year stint at the be all/end all. Kawhi did more in one year that DeMar couldn't accomplish in 9. DeRozan in the playoffs was hard to watch and people called Vince quitting bad. DeRozan going to a podium and publicly stating ""I'll pay anyone $100  to stop LeBron"" after being swept and only to be swept the next year.   He was getting benched for Norman Powell and OG as rookies in the playoffs. And his final moment as a Raptor was getting tossed for freaking clotheslining Jordan Clarkson down 30 on route to a second straight year being swept. I'll take Kawhi winning a championship in one of the most impressive individual performances in the last 30 years."
Presumably also DeMar DeRozan.
"I'll copy my comment from [Per Lord Zach Lowe - If you are going to complain about a snub, you have to also indicate who they would replace. Feel free to do so below.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lrglig/per_lord_zach_lowe_if_you_are_going_to_complain/) I also added in the RAPTOR and WAR rating from 538 into this table, and could have edited the body of this argument when considering those, but I have not.  -  DeMar is the clear number 1 on the team with a worse starting unit, although a far better bench. He's playing more efficient than DBook (but less than Zion), and I believe his assist numbers make up for the difference in scoring. If you look at pretty much every major advanced statistic beyond TS%, DeMar is far better than Booker.  In the past I've found coaches have used 3 main criteria to vote in players:  1. Individual performance.  2. Team performance.  3. Teammates that are already all stars.  There are of course exceptions to the above, but with 2 similarly ranked teams in playoff spots we rarely get 2 players from 1 team and 0 from the other. Coaches have typically used some combination of the above and then obviously compared them to the level of competition within the conference (which is why Booker has had a harder time the last few years before WB and Harden left). I suppose this example is not great when just in the East this year the Raptors and Pacers have 0 to the Nets 3 and Celtics 2.  I'll list the main box scores/advanced stats (from basketball-reference.com) below for all 3 players. I've included assist points created (from NBA.com - although these all seem too high and I couldn't find a good definition on the site) and points responsible for because so many people are overlooking DeMar's extra assists.    Player | Pts | Reb | Ast | Stl | Blk | TOv | PER | TS% | WS/48 | BPM | VORP | APC | PRF | RAPTOR | WAR ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- DeRozan | 19.8 | 5.0 | 6.9 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 1.6 | 21.7 | .603 | .199 | 3.8 | 1.2 | 17.9 | 37.7 | +0.9 | 1.5 Booker | 24.7 | 3.8 | 4.3 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 3.5 | 18.3 | .607 | .102 | -0.4 | 0.4 | 11.0 | 35.7 | +2.2 | 2.2 Williamson | 25.1 | 6.8 | 3.1 | 1.0 | 0.7 | 2.4 | 26.6 | .656 | .205 | 4.3 | 1.5 | 8.8 | 33.9 | +1.3 | 2.0  I'm not using statistics in a vacuum with my argument, they're just here to help. I think DeMar is heavily contributing to winning basketball with great efficiency and therefore he should get the nod ahead of the other two.  Happy for others to provide a counter a I've likely included too many stats favouring DeMar."

"I just don't see how you could ever say he would *clearly* be the best player on the team when there's not much special about his game.   Especially when we have DeMar DeRozan that's still a walking bucket and should've been an All Star, Dejounte Murray whose still lockup on defense and finally a consistent offensive option, Keldon Johnson who is just an absolute monster, Derrick White, another extremely solid player on both ends and our best passer. Devin Vassell is a rookie and I think he has a bigger impact on both ends than Poetl.   Like yeah these advanced stats make him seem like he's top tier defensively but the eye test of watching him for the past 3 seasons doesn't really impress me."

Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."

"i'd rather see Demar Derozan make it, Book just doesn't make Phoenix win to the same degree as CP3"
"DeRozan splits 48/33/89 vs Booker 50/38/85  Also the Suns are better than the spurs. You're really underrating Dejounte also.  I dont think Demar is bad or undeserving, I just dont think he'll get it over Booker this season."
"Alright tell me honestly, would you rather have demar derozan taking the last shot over MJ?"
DeMar Derozan
he's only a year off of DeMar DeRozan and Demar came in with Steph. pretty crazy to me
Demar Derozan has an equal all star case to Coby White.  Zero percent
"No. Luka simply had bad streak and wasn't prepared to NBA early in season. Because there was no off season.  Literally from same period take even someone like Trae Young numbers. Early on Luka shoot bricks while Trae hit crazy amount of 3s. Then it changed, Luka got into it rhythm and Trae had terrible streak.   This cherry picking must stop. It doesn't help anyone. It creates fake narratives. But media loves them because it creates good clickbait titles.   The same thing is with ""clutch shooting players"". As example. Take Michael Jordan and DeMar DeRozan. MJ is considered best clutch shooter even meanwhile DeRozan considered one of biggest choker. But when you look at statistics, they are clutch with same hit %. Even Jimy created video about this ""clutch shooting myth""."
"As a fan i'd like to see some of these guys play. The All NBA / All Defense Teams are about awarding people. All Star Game is more about being fun.   Some guys left off, that definitely could be fun if they were involved. And Conley constantly getting left off through his career.  * Trae Young * DeMar Derozan * Domantas Sabonis * Tobias Harris * Devin Booker * Mike Conley * De’Aaron Fox"
I don't. Nobody wants to see less Zion and more DeMar DeRozan.
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
DeMar Derozan might get it
"I think they have similar impacts in different ways if that makes sense. Rudy is a defensive anchor and DeMar is the best playmaker on offense, both teams would suffer a lot of any of them goes down but again in my biased opinion DeRozan should be here in his place given he's putting better numbers across the board (yes I totally understand different positions, but my point is DeRozan is putting numbers that should put him in the ASG ahead of others like Gobert)"
"Well Devin Booker is the second all-star on Phoenix, so I'm not sure having 4 less wins is much of a factor. Worse stats are only if points are the only stats. Demar is averaging an amazing 7 assists to 2 turnovers per game. He's been great in the clutch and is unexpectedly leading his team to a 16-11 record.  The efficiency difference is also 60.3%TS for Derozan and 60.7%TS for Booker, so that's not much at all. Advanced Stats also favor Demar."
Devin Booker 25/4/4 on 50/38/85 61% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/5 on 43/39/83 56% TS  Chris Paul 17/5/9 on 49/40/97 59% TS  Mike Conley 16/3/6 on 44/41/82 59% TS  Demar DeRozan 20/5/7 on 49/33/89 60% TS  Three of these players should be all-stars. Tell me there is no world in which Booker deserves it.

"You ""lost"" Demar Derozan for fucking Kawhi AND Green and won the championship, how dare you complain lmao"
Demar Derozan essentially running their offense next to the Jays would be a nice fit IMO  Derozan/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Theis   Pretty good. Don’t see Demar being shipped out though
"81st, right above the 82nd best player in the league, DeMar DeRozan."
"Kenny is funny, and I wish he did a little more quality over quantity on YT. He’s got like 3 channels or something. I appreciate the variety, it just feels like so much rn. On his 2k rebuild videos, I always want to see more details. Like he never shows the cap situation for the teams he builds. Does it matter for the purpose of the video? No, but it’s a fun detail. When we’re living in the fantasy world of the rebuild, I want to see the big numbers, the unusual details, and the weird stuff. He always breezes through things like there’s nothing fun to see. Like, how fun would it be if he tracked the ORTG and DRTG of every team he ever built for the challenges? It would be fun to see which teams set new personal records in the KOT4Q universe. It would also be fun to track how many times he had a player on his team win MVP. He could calculate what % of seasons he simmed that he had a player win MVP.   He also doesn’t show stats for the playoffs hardly ever. At the end of every season, he shows his players’ stats (super briefly) but then he never does an update on the stats once his team is up 3-1 in the Finals or something. Again, it’s fun to live in the universe of the rebuild. I want to see when random stuff happens in his rebuild and DeMar DeRozan averages 10 assists per game. Does that kind of thing happen often? No, but as someone who’s simmed plenty of 2k in my day, I know that interesting stuff happens every year if you scroll through stats. You just gotta look.   I know it’s a long comment. Don’t get many opportunities to talk about KOT4Q outside of YT and doing it on there is impossible. YT comment sections have gotten better over the years, but they’re still pretty whack."
DeMar DeRozan
"Another one that's similar is back around 2015-2018 when people said ""Michael Jordan in today's game would just be Demar Derozan with better defence""."
"Ah yes, DeMar DeRozan vs Rodney McGrudeR, showdown for the ages"

Not that clutch. I'd go on to say DeMar DeRozan is more clutch than Ray Allen. That one shot is an utter anomaly and that misses 93 times out of 100.
1. *Stephen Curry (Golden State) 2. *Luka Dončić (Dallas) 3. Damian Lillard (Portland) 4. Donovan Mitchell (Utah) 5. Devin Booker (Phoenix) 6. Ja Morant (Memphis) 7. Chris Paul (Phoenix) 8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City) 9. CJ McCollum (Portland) 10. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio) Sorry for format it was copypasted
Actually most people thought the spurs were a sure thing playoff team in 2019. Considering we were basically replacing Danny Green with DeMar DeRozan who was an all NBA player and Kawhi didn't play in 2018.
"Ja shouldn't be close. If we assume Dame, Mitchell, and Booker have the 3-5 guard spots and there is one left, it should come down to these players:  SGA, CP3, DeMar, Fox, Conley, McCollum, Ja.  * SGA has had the best statistical season of these five, pretty clearly. His team is 14th in the West, but they've also exceeded expectations (and Beal and Luka are starting for teams with terrible, underperforming records).  * CP3's stats are the least sexy of these seven but he's had the biggest on-court contribution to winning games and he still has good numbers and he's got the biggest name.  * DeRozan has maybe the best combination of good stats + a winning team.  * Fox has been very good but SGA has him beat on stats and their records are 1 game apart from each other. And Fox's defensive rating is one of the worst in the league. Any argument Fox has, SGA has a better one.  * Conley has been good but Utah isn't getting 3 All Stars, and his numbers aren't good enough.  * McCollum was awesome and would easily be in but he's missed way too much time/played far too few games.  * Ja is great. He's gonna make All Star games in the future. But he doesn't have the numbers nor the team record to make it this year.  It should come down to SGA, CP3 or DeRozan."
"Mr. and Mrs. DeRozan are honestly heroes, man. Raised their son in Compton and did everything they could to make sure that he stayed the course in one of the most tumultuous, violent environments imaginable, especially for a young black man.   DeMar was lucky, he had a dad, and a damn good one at that. Reading about his parent’s health issues over the past while has been seriously dejecting and sad. They are the standard do what every parent should shoot to be. Yes, they raised a boy who had god given athletic ability and potential to be a professional athlete, but I have zero doubts that DeMar wouldn’t have been successful elsewhere with the amount of hard work and dedication that they instilled in their son.   RIP Mr. DeRozan."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are a couple recent ones:  DeMar DeRozan: [https://basketballbeacon.com/demar-derozan-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/demar-derozan-player-profile-stats/)  Joe Harris: [https://basketballbeacon.com/joe-harris-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/joe-harris-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks!"
"The team success is benefited by the play of our young guys but it’s dependent on DeMar. If DeMar DeRozan is not on this team, or is not playing the way he is, this team would be at the bottom of the conference. Solely attributing the overall success we are having to our young players is just false. Deciding to not credit DeRozan whatsoever to this success is false."
Seeing as we’re talking about the Olympics can we just take a minute to appreciate how close DeMar DeRozan came to completely ending one Chinese man’s career in a single play.
"Tough break for DeMar. I lost my dad 13 years ago and if you have a close relationship with them (it appears they did), it rocks you to the core. I know it took me years to shake off, and the grief still hits from time to time.  Even worse is the fact that DeMar was exposed to COVID within the last 14 days, so he probably wasn't able to be there. I believe the team is still quarantined in Charlotte, and with everything going on, he may not even be able to give his dad a proper funeral.  My condolences go out to him and the entire DeRozan family. Spurs family got your back!"
What eye test does he pass? He had one good game so that’s the eye test to you?  Is he going to shoot at an elite level? Create for others at an elite level? He’s a bargain basement demar Derozan
"RIP Mr DeRozan. You raised a real well in your son. A man of his word, loyal to the core and one of the hardest worked I’ve ever seen. I’m sure you were proud of him like we all were to see him become who he is now.   My heart goes out to DeMar and his family. Hope he’s got people on his side to help the mourning. I don’t doubt Kyle has already reached out because that’s the kind of friends DeMar makes with his genuineness."
Who are you taking off to put Demar Derozan on? Who are you taking Bradley Beal off to put on?
"Yeah but compare their other players' stats. LMA is def washed, way more than last season, but the rest of the Spurs' young core has stepped up massively (I especially fw Dejounte Murray). DeMar has become a way better playmaker though and hes actually a solid defender now? I still think the spurs would be an 8/9 seed if you replaced DeRozan with an average 2-way guard. Although he is playing great"
Demar Derozan? He never proved himself
Going for the deepest team cuz I’m building the team on 2k with no injuries and gonna see how it goes!

"&gt; The Trail Blazers star leads the NBA with the most game-tying, go-ahead field goals in the final 20 seconds since 2012-13. Joining Lillard is Westbrook with 21 and DeMar DeRozan with 17.  I would not have guessed 2 &amp; 3"

Demar Derozan and Jakob Poetl. Or fat Victor Oladipo and rookie Sabonis. Or Al Jefferson and Theo Ratliff's expiring contract. Or Vin Baker.
"I'm gonna say it...this kind of play happens every single game.  Demar DeRozan or Keldon Johnson do this probably once or twice a night...but that doesn't get a highlight spot on the front page.  But oh yeah...because it's Zion, this is supposed to be more impressive."
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
"I’ve been thinking about how important having a team of role players on the jazz is. Like if I were the gm, and San Antonio offered me demar derozan for joe Ingles or even Royce, I don’t know if I could do that. Maybe I should clarify here, that I am not, in fact, a gm in the nba."
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
"Well i didnt say he's already all star level. I said he probably has a case, hence i said ""borderline"". He's not yet on that level, but close to it  Also I didnt mean the all-star roster, what i mean is the caliber. For example, regardless if Butler or Derozan is in the all-star roster this year, we know they're all-star caliber players. So in doesnt matter if Butler/Derozan is an all-star this year, they're ""all-stars"" in quality.  With Dejounte, im aware there's no way he's getting in the all-star line up this year. If Demar himself is struggling to get in, then for DJ there's just no way. What i said about DJ being a ""borderline all-star"" is his caliber. Yes, he's not yet on all-star level, that's why i said ""borderline"". He's just below the bar of an all-star level player, but he's close to the line. Given his steady improvement through his first 5 years, i'd say he's an all-star level either next year or the year after that. If he goes mad insane maybe by the end of this season, but that's unlikely.  His game is still not complete. He's really good right now but some things still needs work. But I said he's borderline all-star at this point because if you watch the games, he is 2nd to Demar when it comes to the impact in our games. It's not true that he's partly responsible for Spur's mediocrity (and no, we're not mediocre, we arent an excellent team yes, but we're at least good...not very good, but good). Most of our wins are either because of DJ's or Demar's performance. Demar is sure. DJ already got his all-nba defense team when he was in his 2nd year, and his defense this year is way better than his 2nd year.  So yeah, not yet an all-star level player. But if you watch his impact to our games, he's about to get there"
"It’s different, but sorta the same thing as DeRozan. I know he was flawed, but that’s my fuckin dude. I don’t accept Demar slander."
"Gang Signs John Wall and Gang Sign Demar Derozan deserve shout outs , no?"
i think Tatum is basically going to be tall Demar Derozan....but we all hoped he would be Dr J.
"Tyler Herro. Demar Derozan.   If the 76ers had a quicker player who can get his own shot at any time i think that would put em above the lakers, Easily."
Kawhi wasn't viewed as an MVP level player being traded at the time though. He had mysterious injures and sat out for a year. If he was viewed as a player with MVP value they would've gotten more than DeMar DeRozan and a 1st.  They asked us for Ben Simmons at the time and we said no lol.
"Yeah look at Pop. He changed his entire scheme to fit Derozan and Gay while still holding onto some of the motion/triangle stuff that they won their last championship with. He know Demar and Rudy aren’t going to just run around like JJ Reddick all night and it’s not what they excel at. He’s figure out a nice middle ground between iso five out ball and his traditional motion offense.  I would say Kerr should do this too but this team is so bad idk if it even matters. They need to minute restrict Steph and try and really work on wiseman’s game. This year is a wash at this point. I thought if they flipped Wiggins or Oubre for somebody they might have a chance to win a playoff round but it’s not worth potentially seriously injuring Steph just to play the play in tournament. I think Bob Meyers deserves some blame for bringing in Oubre when they already had shooting problems. I don’t blame him for the wiseman pick because Klay was healthy at that point and they didn’t necessarily need Halliburton or Lamelo. But man, imagine one of those two with Curry out there. They’d be so much better."
"I dont think its fair to call a 20 year old a not really star. We dont know how good rj can be. His most common comparisons are Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, Demar Derozan. Look at those guys at 20 years old. Of course situations are different but I think RJs production at 20 years old is way to much for him to be writen off over near 25 year olds who haven't even been close to making an allstar game. 18-22 is perfectly fine for RJ and might even be a little too high"
"You could blame Derozan for the Spurs not being a contender, it's not like they sent him to some trash tanking team in rebuild mode with a rookie coach. He went to play with Aldridge and a pretty decent supporting cast with a legendary coach on a team that had been contending for titles for the last 2 decades. Derozan was getting paid like a superstar. And they were still making the playoffs. I don't think anyone was expecting Demar to make them title contenders and everyone kind of knew they weren't going far in the playoffs, but Demar's being paid like a guy that's supposed to be a difference maker."
Yes. Michael Jordan was basically a bald Demar Derozan with a gambling addiction.
Demar Derozan. If someone would play him in an appropriate role - he would be the best.
"Demar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker superteam coming to the Pistons, look out."
LOL Demar Derozan -6.3  You should have done each teams best players instead of their biggest names.
Steph Curry  Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Durant  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  DeMar DeRozan  Dirk Nowitzki  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Andre Iguodala
2009:  Steph Curry  James Harden  Demar DeRozan  Blake Griffin  Taj Gibson  6th man: Jrue Holiday
"Going from DeRozan to Kawhi made me realize this in 2018-2019.  DeMar had one of the most aesthetic games I'd seen, but he struggled to impact winning (at the time). Meanwhile Kawhi was the opposite, his game was a lot more robotic to watch but way more impactful."

Can you think of some options?   DeMar DeRozan must be in play.
Demar Derozan is basically known as a Compton crip  He also chased that guy who broke into his house   Go to 2:51 in this video: https://youtu.be/0X57NI-MoWQ
Is he that great in regular season? Would a team built around Ben Simmons as the best player even be better than a team around someone like DeMar DeRozan?                 Ben Simmons plays at a Draymond level in regular season and slightly above Andre Roberson/Dort level in playoffs.             That’s obviously still a very valuable player but frankly not as highly as Simmons was touted to be.
He’s just not that skilled  Derozan is another guy that is gifted athletically but played a more grounded style. It worked for him cause demar is extremely skilled.
DeMar is actually the opposite case of what you are suggesting to some degree bscause he doesn’t get assists at all at the rim for teammates. % of assists that come at the rim is horrible. A ton of his assists come off mid range. The reason why isn’t hard to gauge this is also try of guys like Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler. You can spot the commonality   In general outside of this year it’s been the same trend for years with DeRozan. His teams take a lot fewer shots at the rim when he’s on the court and his teams 3 point rate plummets when he’s on the court

"while I agree it usually doesn't matter, I think there's something to be said for the fact DeMars assists come largely via 3s. I imagine his 7 assists might be worth more than some other players' 7 assists. or to focus more on the spirit of the post, I'm not sure where the stats are now, but we can compare DeMar and Devin Booker.   DeMar was scoring 20 points to Booker's 24 but he averaged twice the assists on half the turnovers.  if we call each assist worth 2.5 points and say it's 50/50  that the assists come from 2s and 3s, that would mean DeMar is creating 37.5 ppg compared to Booker's 34.5, but DeMar was averaging 1.7 to Booker's 3.5 turnovers. most people consider DeRozan a top 40ish player and Booker in that 20ish range, and they're both similar defenders.    then who would you think is the more valuable offensive player with that context? if DeMar is generating more points on half the turnovers and both of them get their value from offense, one would think DeMar is better, even though realistically he's probably not. I don't think DeMar necessarily deserved the all star over Booker, it's just an interesting thing to talk about. there was such a huge public outcry about Booker not getting in at first but much less about DeMar, even though you could argue the numbers show he has more value. it's just weird how assists aren't thought of the same way because the passer didn't get the bucket."
"TJ ""fun sized DeMar DeRozan"" McConnell"
"Damn I guess that article was right. DeMar Derozan is the #91st best player in the league according to RAPTOR. They were right all along. The Spurs shouldve traded for Fred VanVleet, the #3 player in the league. But then again, with that Deozan trade, the spurs also got Poeltl who is 15th best in the league, so I guess the trade was pretty even."
Fox thinks he’s demar derozan with all these mid rangers. Don’t mind it though.
Demar Derozan would be more of an impact player in a 6th man role where you can put him on the floor more often with good defenders and leave him off with weak defensive personnel.
It's really funny that paying attention to Demar Derozan is such a central feature of your character and that you can go on insulting people based on that.
I have a job mate I will get some highlights in and maybe pay attention to my girlfriens but don't expect me to pay attention to Demar fucking Derozan
"People said the Spurs got fleeced in the Kawhi trade, but they got Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and a pick which turned out to be Keldon Johnson. That's one year of Kawhi for *three* of their current starters.  This a rare case where both teams won the trade. Toronto got their chip, and Spurs got something from almost nothing because Kawhi would've walked anyway."
I think every team except for the Nets would love for their third option to become prime multiple time All Star Demar DeRozan

There are so many incredible players and future hall of famers and we really gotta be paying attention to Demar Derozan on the Spurs
"&gt; The Athletic’s NBA insider Shams Charania reported Aldridge gave back $7.25 million of his remaining deal, which allows San Antonio to possibly add another player to its roster and stay under the luxury tax line.  https://www.ksat.com/sports/2021/03/25/nba-trade-deadline-tracker-latest-lamarcus-aldridge-demar-derozan-and-other-spurs-trade-rumors/  I don’t know exactly how many games he had left, but that’s over half the salary he was still owed.  And let’s them dip under the Lux and sign someone else."
"It's like that with almost every industry.  Like if you just dropped a young Michael Jordan into today's NBA (and nobody knew who he was). You more or less got a athletic wing with a good fadeaway but below average 3 point% (and mind you, back then when he was below average, that was the non-extended 3 point line). Athletic wings these days are a dime a dozen.   He's at best a Demar Derozan with better defense. That's assuming he can even adjust to modern defensive schemes. They didn't have zone defense and a gazillion screens/switches back in his days."
DeMar DeRozan is having probably the best season anyone is talking about.
"Exactly, the looks the Nets got in this video would be taken by 3 point snipers DeMar Derozan and Dejounte Murray. LMA just doesn’t fit when you have two starters who can’t shoot from the 3 point line"
A couple years ago I never thought I would ever see this comment on a video about DeMar DeRozan.  Makes me so proud
I think the majority that said hes washed was because they didnt watch the Spurs  Dude was great offensively but the balance of average/good/great shooters on the Nets squad compared to 3 point snipers DeMar Derozan and Dejounte Murray and its just obvious why LMA wasn't great for the Spurs. His defense will still be bad but dude will score and create opportunities for others.
"Star =/= all-star, I find DeMar DeRozan a star this season and he wasn't an all-star. By your definition ""future star"", players who haven't made an all-star team yet but will most likely make it some day: Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball and who else?"
"Every time there's cap penalties it just locks out smaller markets. I feel like this lesson needs to be learned over and over again, but NBA fans don't get it.   Teams like the Clippers, Lakers, Warriors, Nets, Knicks, Heat and sometimes Boston won't even blink. If they can add let's say DeMar DeRozan without sacrificing anything but money, they will. Every time.   Even draft picks aren't worth legislating because a guy getting a buyout is almost never worth an unprotected 1st round pick (the only pick that has real value). AND again, they hurt the small markets because if you enforce picks to be given up, Small Markets end up without draft picks AND without the ability to draw winning players to losing teams with limited budgets.   The best way to make it fair is what's been suggested:   * Buyout Market happens before the deadline * Teams below the cap get first pick * Teams above the cap then get their chance * Teams in the luxury get last chance - (blind bidding is definitely ideal here)  If you want to, you should also make it so teams cannot trade Bought out players. This would discourage teams from messing with a player just to see if they can acquire them and trade them for assets before the deadline expires.   This *needs* to be coupled with allowing teams to Franchise Tag a player so that at least 1 player's salary doesn't count against the cap once the team salary exceeds the cap. Maybe allow for a 2nd designation to only count for 50%.   I feel like any time you take a look at altering the rules around team building, and the question of fairness to small market comes up, just use OKC as the North Star e.g.:   * If we do multi-year luxury tax penalties does that help or hurt OKC keeping Durant/Harden/Westbrook/Ibaka together?   What you actually want to reward? Winning. It should always be, REWARD WINNING.   Don't reward being cheap, don't punish spending, don't reward draft pick stockpiling, don't reward tanking, don't punish trying to get better.   Reward winning, punish losing.   When every team is in the hunt it makes the 82-Game Regular Season make sense. When every team is involved in buyouts, trades, free agency, and the draft that's the best. When every team, every year's goal is to actually improve, that is the best."
"I think Russ mainly gets flak because many people believe that Harden clearly outplayed him that year, and that he shot roughly the same efficiency as DeMar DeRozan, and there's the perception that his rebounds were somewhat empty. This year, Jokic's competition got injured, and Jokic is hella efficient, and honestly he is more valuable on both sides of the ball than Russ was in 2017."

Can you tell which team employs demar derozan?
Was curious about clutch minutes. This is the list:  1. Damian Lillard - 135 (77.7% TS) 2. Zach LaVine - 116 (58.4% TS) 3. De'Aaron Fox - 106 (56.9% TS) 4. James Harden - 98 (69.8% TS) 5. Nikola Jokic - 94 (59.2% TS) 6. Chris Paul - 87 (59.0% TS) 7. Jerami Grant - 83 (57.2% TS) 8. Joel Embiid - 80 (65.3% TS) 9. DeMar DeRozan - 74 (61.0% TS) 10. LeBron James - 74 (55.6% TS)
"Kyle Lowry, John Collins, Robert Williams III, Anthony Edwards, Demar Derozan.  Defence blows so we're probably a first round exit."
"Pg: Kyle Lowry  Sg: Demar Derozan  Sf: Vince Carter  Pf: Kawhi Leonard   C: Chris Bosh   Possible bench: calderon, jv, fvv, siakam, ibaka"
"This is incredibly emotional - love it, and so grateful to Norm (and the others for all the memories). Vital to the ring, vital to the Raptors for half a decade really.  Also love how he highlighted how key Demar was - the championship team, they'll always get their props, but Derozan can get lost in the narrative apart from being the guy who had to go to make us win. This shows why he and Kyle are 1A/1B in my book of Raptors GOATs though - just the mentoring of the players and the care for the city to go along with the all nba level play. Norm, FVV, Siakam, OG - all super tight with both those guys, Jakob too. Bosh and Carter did a ton for the franchise, but they didn't leave that sort of legacy in the team culturally (Vince obviously did in the city in general).  That matters, contributes to a positive culture that leads to winning (as did Casey)."
"PG: Kyle Lowry - Obvious choice, greatest raptor of all time.  SG: Vince Carter - The OG franchise player, contributed to making the raptors good for the first time.  SF: Kawhi Leonard - Led the team to its first and only championship.  PF: DeMar DeRozan - Was the franchise player for years before the championship. He represents one of the best stretches of raptors basketball.  C: Chris Bosh - Was the franchise player after Carter."
Yeah they need to get an older vet on their team like DeMar DeRozan
"Wall missed half the season but when he played he was better. DeRozan got an all NBA team because of his teams record. If Beal and DeRozan swap rosters that year, DeRozan doesn't sniff the all NBA team. Beal being a threat from 3 makes him more dangerous than DeMar."
Timberwolves drafting Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio when they could have had Steph Curry and DeMar DeRozan.
"So the reason that Randle is all-nba over Zion is that Randle's team has a better record than Zion's, despite Zion's team playing more difficult opponents and all-nba being an individual award not a team one  Why isn't Middleton therefore on the team over Randle? How about Demar Derozan, Tobias Harris?"
"Demar Derozan with a better 3 ball. Needs to improve his playmaking/vision on the court.  Derozan has become a better passer these last couple of years, Ingram could possibly make this jump as well."
DeMar DeRozan
"Don't I know it, man.   I have been a huge advocate for getting whatever we could for DeMar DeRozan and Rudy Gay and Patty Mills (and even, before the extension, Derrick White if it was enough value) and hitting the reset button.  This team stinks, none of the young guys have the ceiling to actually be *the guy* and we're either going to overpay aging players this summer to keep them around, or we're going to lose them for nothing because we wanted to go 37-35.  All because our coach is 72 years old and doesn't feel like resetting the roster."

"I didn't consider this, so if that's the reason, then it makes sense, although one could argue that if it was about maintaining the same routine then we should see players do this when they shoot a FT on a technical (like Demar Derozan). But then, the rebuttal to that could be that with no other players around it doesn't enter into the player's mind so it doesn't mess with the routine."
"&gt;Do GMs really have to purposely underplay their hand and selectively not win trades too much to not alienate their peers ?  Spurs traded Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and the Raptors’ 2018 1st round pick"
Casey won coach of the year before being fired and DeMar was a dumpster fire. Not a knock on him just how it is. What do you think was wrong with Casey's coaching considering how well Derozan did all year long?
"Right but who is going to be sitting there 15 years from now saying ""Well, LaMarcus Aldridge is the 362nd best player of all time and I have DeMar DeRozan at 363. I liked Deebo's game more but Aldridge had that big ring at 35 years old where he averaged 6 points in 10 minutes on the KD/Harden/Kyrie Nets so I gotta give him the edge."""
I mean Poetl is a top 10 center **defensively** lol. They don't need LMA who can't really play defense and has fallen off a cliff offensively as well. Especially considering they have Demar DeRozan playing PF and have Rudy Gay off the bench.
"Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry"
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
Damian Lillard  Demar Derozan  Kawhi Leonard  KG  Dwight Howard
Jimmy butler and demar derozan. Their game puts me to sleep
Yeah my thoughts exactly. Flipping Demar Derozan for Kawhi is an unreal basketball move. Signing Kevin love to this $120 million dollar contract only for him to severely underperform and rarely play is most certainly not a winning basketball move. They aren’t even remotely comparable decisions
"&gt;Vince with hair runs a little different  Guys like Vince go crazy in the Olympics because the international players just can't stop them. If you watch any of those games, something like that was going to happen because he realized that they were barbecued chicken and was just going for ridiculous and scary stuff constantly. Demar Derozan was similar in the Olympics when he almost hit that 360 on that guy on the fast break."
"Memphis could have had James Harden, Steph Curry or DeMar DeRozan if they hadn't drafted Hasheem Thabeet"
"Demar Derozan, KD, Iguodala"
"I feel like Danny Ainge is going to be all over DeMar DeRozan.   Between his love for Kanter types and no-defense PGs like Isaiah Thomas, DeMar feels like a match made in heaven.   And the Celtics badly need a PF."
DeMar DeRozan MVP confirmed
"Even though 3&gt;2, a sweet midrange game is still the most beautiful thing in basketball. I love watching demar derozan, KD, Chris Paul great midrange players. Shaun Livingston was really nice too, and Harden before he played Moreyball"
"Matthew Dellavedova.  Why? Idk, he’s just kinda cool, I guess.  Realistically: Kevin Love or DeMar DeRozan (under appreciated and also outspoken on mental health issues)."
DeMar DeRozan
"Drake saying ""I'm like DeMar DeRozan, when I shoot it it goes in"" pretty much ruined him as a player for me"

Lakers: Bradley Beal  Nets: Bam Adebayo and Demar Derozan
"&gt; You know who else should be clowned for not trading for Kawhi? Every team that could match an offer of Demar Derozan.  Well, every *Eastern* team anyway, as Pop was extremely adamant that he would not trade Kawhi to the West. But this is my point with Ainge: just look at what the trade packages were for Paul George in Indy, Jimmy Butler in Chicago or Minnesota and Kawhi in San Antonio. The Celtics could have *easily* beaten every one of those and still had a shitload of assets/players left over. The fact that they didn't get even one of those guys is a huge red flag, don't you think?"
"&gt; You need to remember that it wasn't long ago that they had Kyrie, Hayward and Horford as well. Swap Brown and some of their picks for Kawhi and add him to that group and that's a title team. Kawhi, Kyrie, Tatum, Hayward and Horford as your starting 5 with Smart, Theis etc off the bench?  This is the one i'll concede on, had they traded for Kawhi, then yes they would have had a chance at the title, a really good one - but a few things  1) That team was a chemistry nightmare, they would have looked great on paper, but hey, that celtics team already looked great on paper and flamed out massively. There the team people thought were East favourites, but they lost to the Bucks in a pathetic display, they were a far cry from the slick operation the Raptors were that year, and there's every chance that adding Kawhi (not exactly a culture repairer) wouldn't have solved that.  2) You know who else should be clowned for not trading for Kawhi? Every team that could match an offer of Demar Derozan.   Clowning Ainge for not trading for Kawhi has some merit i guess, but then that's where it should stop, his reputation as a guy who flubbed ever moving the core pieces for a star is unwarranted, as a trade for Butler, Harden, AD, George would have left them worse off than they are now, he also DID move for a big star when they got Kyrie.   &gt; Right now I don't know what their path to a title is.   They have two all-stars who are under 24, and locked up, their path to the title is to let that situation develop OR, pull the trigger on a trade that wouldn't leave them worse off, much like a trade for Harden, AD, George or Butler would have. The narrative around the Celtics is that they're like the 2015 Thunder, a team that's on the precipice, but really, they should be talked about like the 2009 Thunder, a team that has a bright future, and doesn't need to violently shift gear in to win now mode.  Essentially, all i'm saying is this - Had the Celtics traded for any of the all-stars they apparently 'should have' according to this sub, they would be in a even worse position than the one you describe, except for Kawhi, but you no who else didn't trade for Kawhi? Everyone not called Masai Ujiri, so therefore Danny Ainge doesn't desevre this reputation of someone too scared to make the obvious blockbuster move that would have got the Celtics a title."
Demar Derozan
"pffft who needs demar derozan!?     we do, we do very badly"
"Closest approximation I can find is DeRozan and Lowry. Demar was the best scorer when he was here, even had a 27ppg season one time, but Kyle did literally everything else better. If an MVP award had to go to our team for any season the two were together it would always be Kyle.   That's the same situation I am seeing here. Booker is clearly the better scorer, but Paul does everything else better and his overall contributions lead towards winning basketball more than Booker solely scoring does.   As seen by the dramatic change from a perennial lottery team to a  home seed in the playoffs team."
City love me like Demar Derozan
"I would describe Michael Jordan as a ""Demar Derozan"" type."
"Here's a better D-centric squad with a little spacing for the Nets:  * PG: Derrick Rose (Bulls), Lonzo Ball (Lakers), Raymond Felton (Thunder)  * SG: DeMar Derozan (Spurs), Pat Beverly (Clippers), Tony Allen (Grizzlies),  * SF: Bruce Bowen (Spurs), Andre Roberson (Thunder), Kyle Korver (Bucks)  * PF: Dennis Rodman (Pistons), Shawn Marion (Mavericks), Nicolas Batum (Hornets)  * C: Joakim Noah (Bulls), Kevon Looney (Warriors), Larry Sanders (Bucks)  Outside of Derozan the above team is utterly lockdown on defense."
I don't know if this is a league problem or reporters thing but they seem to cover negative aspects and tragedies that happen DeMar DeRozan life very well. Almost never a bit of positive news about him or Kevin Love for that matter. I only read about Love's engagement through his own tweet.
"This guy has been taking care of his gamily and intermittently balling out this year, without emitting an inkling of drama.   The sheer disrespect that was his All-Star snub because Conley is old and Brown had a hot streak is a fucking disgrace. Demar Derozan is a class act and his eyes make me wish I were a better person."
"DeMar DeRozan is expected to miss the Spurs' game against Orlando tomorrow. He is en route to Los Angeles...  What?! We're trading DeRozan-   ...to attend a private funeral service for his father Frank.  Damn, rip."
"Yes he’s a negative on defense, but on a team like the Lakers who are a top 10 defensive team and when he would be covered by LeBron James and Anthony Davis instead of Lonnie Walker and DeMar DeRozan I highly doubt his defense would negate his offensive value at all.    Do I think the Lakers would be better giving lamarcus Aldridge touches in comparison to giving them to Wesley matthews, markieff Morris, Marc gasol etc.? Yes, without a doubt yes.   You can argue he’s a worse fit for y’all if you’re only valuing defense, but he’s without a doubt a better player than gasol"
My city loves me like demar derozan
"According to cleaning the glass, DeRozan has played 75% of his time at sf. Granted, positions are kind of ambiguous so maybe that exact number isn’t right, but I don’t think anyone should take issue with demar being in a ranking of small forwards."
"What could they trade him for that would make sense? I don't think Luka wants to be surrounded with less talented players just so they can have a late draft pick or have more space to sign some middling veteran this off-season or DeMar Derozan.  I get that he won't stay healthy, but I think 60 games of him a year is better than whatever the alternative would be."
"Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, probably could get some guys from the Rockets(Gordon, Tucker, Oladipo, maybe Wood would be available), Pacers(Brogdon &amp; Myles Turner), Demar Derozan, Aaron Gordon, John Collins, Kevin Love &amp; another piece from Cavs. Lotta help out there."

What I guess happened is Carlisle told them to switch after the pick, but Luka's positioning was way off after the bump on DeRozan, no way he would have made it back to the switch.  At that point, they shouldn't have forced the switch though.   Good job disrupting the passing lanes though lol, DeMar was making great passes on the roll earlier."

Demar Derozan slander
"in terms of their peak with the team and considering tenure on the Spurs, I don't think you can dispute this list very much.  Tim Duncan  David Robinson  George Gervin  Kawhi Leonard  Tony Parker  LaMarcus Aldridge  DeMar DeRozan  Manu Ginobili  Sean Elliott  James Silas  Alvin Robertson  Bruce Bowen"
"Before this thread gets too hot, let me remind you, NO DEMAR DEROZAN SLANDER WILL BE TOLERATED"
"You can take a paycut for a team and still watch your ass get traded if they think they can win without you. Look at Demar Derozan with the Raptors.  I would never do anything like that unless I was a veteran franchise player with a no-trade clause (ala Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki).. a rising star in their 20s is the last player who should consider anything like that. My 2 cents"
"The definition of superstar changes all the time here to let in whoever is playing well at the time.   For me, the line is basically at Jimmy Butler and Demar Derozan. They play at the star level. Jimmy showed he can raise his game and play as a superstar. Dame is an offensive superstar but how much are you valuing defense here?   AD, for example, is a DPOY-caliber player who is a top 10 offensive player too - how do you rank that?   LeBron is a good example - he plays with the higher floor but he has showed he has the ability to play as one of the best players in the league."
"There were 2 lists.  First one was for the team.  Hakeem would not make that list.  Second one was all time players for the franchise. Hakeem is near the top of that one. DeMar DeRozan makes the first, but maybe not the second. Tmac, Vince and Bosh might make both.   Similarly, Moses Malone would be one of those guys for the Bucks.   He played 90 games for them at the end of his career. But his is also one of the best of all time."
"Honestly Raptors could get a nice squad: Damon Stoudamire, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Antonio Davis Andrea Bargnani, Jonas Valanciunas"
So go after guys that can still go for several years like Demar DeRozan
"He likely won’t get the primary ball handler or PG designation though.  It’s all pretty much pointless, but even DeMar DeRozan isn’t considered a point guard"

"Here's my list:  * DeMar DeRozan - It feels like he has fallen off a crater since being traded away from Toronto. I think he's obviously good, but if he's your best player or two your team doesn't go anywhere. I predict he'll have a sneaky great back-end of his career if he takes a steep pay-cut (maybe can take up the Rudy Gay role in some outside contender back East?)  * Andrew Wiggins - I thought Wiggins sucked in Minnesota and was a volume scorer. Now it looks like his efficiency numbers have gone up with the Warriors. What's there plan with him? Do Warriors fans like him? How does his role change with Klay back?  * Collin Sexton - He's a guard I loved out of college at Alabama but I don't know what to make of his scoring numbers on Cleveland, and I can't imagine the ""I'm the #1 on this team"" mentality can be good for a young player given some of the stories Russillo has told about his shoot-first game.   Any team fans that can provide insight would be much obliged"
"Fair points, but I'll give you my point of view, from someone who watched nearly every game from the casey era.  He had a poor system was a big part of it. It was almost entirely an isolated system with derozan and lowry always handling the ball. They would both take 20 shots whether they were hot or cold, and also if the others were having a hot game. Most players stood around and watched because there was no ball movement. They were near the bottom of the league in assists every year.  He used jv and Ross to their weaknesses. He would play ross as an undersized 3 to benefit derozan as an oversized 2 for a size advantage. He used ross as a defensive stopped when thats not his strength especially vs guys 20-30 lbs bigger than him. I dont need to say the jv stuff since you acknowledged it but he used jv as a defensive anchor in a fast trapping style defensive which exposed his lack of speed.  There was no room for growth for any player not named derozan or lowry because every other player was used in a role whether it fit their skill set or not. He also used a super fast hook if any young player made a mistake. This system was bad because demar and lowry are b level stars and you cant revolve a team around that in the playoffs and they were exposed many times for that"
Man it's really pretty sad how many Raptors fans come out of the woodwork to trash Casey for his time there.  Apparently his failure to beat Lebron with Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan is basketball's greatest crime.
C- Draymond Green  PF- Demar Derozan  SF- Jimmy Butler   SG- Brad Wannamaker  PG- TJ McConnell   The playmaking/3pt mason union lineup from hell. Imagine game after game being watching beautiful passes end in wide open bricks from 3.
"It’s not like he’s not an all star? Plus he’s getting paid at a super max. Obviously the Jazz could not afford to lose him. And rn, the Jazz are doing great bcuz bogdanovic has been on an absolute rampage.   I have guys like Jrue holiday/Mikal bridges/ Tobias Harris/ demar Derozan as much more underrated."
"I mean, he kind of already did play like that on offense: [KG’s shooting splits](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garneke01.html#all_shooting-playoffs_shooting).  He shot more often from 16+ ft than any other distance, and made a higher percentage of them than either 3-10 ft or 10-16 ft.  Specifically, KG’s career average on 16+ ft 2-pointers is 45.4%.  For comparison, [Steph Curry](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html#all_shooting-playoffs_shooting)’s average from that range is 46.6%, and [DeMar DeRozan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01.html#all_shooting-playoffs_shooting), famous for his midrange game, only has a 39.0% average there.  Obviously I’m not suggesting KG would shoot 3s nearly as well as Steph, but with an 11-foot high release point his shot is already unblockable, and he can clearly aim and gauge distance accurately, so I don’t think 40% on 3s would be out of the question if he grew up focusing on that distance."
"Okay let's do this! Hahah  First of all, this stat has nothing to do with how many passes he receives. Literally nothing to do with it.   Secondly, let's use Westbrook to compare.   Russ has passed the ball 4,053 times this season. DeMar has passed 1964 times.   Now let's look at potential assists. Russ has 1340. DeMar has 731.  Do the math there and you can see the potential assist ratios. Russ is 33%. DeMar is 37%.  Looking at these numbers, Russell Westbrook who is one of the most ball dominant players in the league makes more passes that are not potential assists than DeRozan.  Think about that. Westbrook passes more without expecting a shot than DeRozan..  Last point, Reggie Jackson has more hockey assists this season than DeMar and he's only thrown 1500 passes total..  EDIT: TJ McConnell has more hockey assists than DeRozan"
DeMar DeRozan is the choice for this he’ll be a folk lord in Canada though.
Demar Derozan. There's going to be too many great players that will surpass him.
Demar Derozan is the worst offender. At lesat Joe Harris and KD can say they are trying to keep their 3pt% up
"There's always player movement. Even if some big under contract guy wants to force his way there, the Knicks flexibility will allow them more avenues to do that.   But since you're asking about big name free agents this summer, your own team happens to have one in DeMar DeRozan."
"Agreed, the NBA/Wizards/his agent don't do a good enough job marketing him. I feel like even guys like Booker (pre-Suns being good), DeMar DeRozan, Lavine, and Ja Morant get more attention for doing less. It's no wonder Beal went on First Take to discuss his beef with Bazemore and advertise Hotels.com - he barely gets any attention as it currently stands.  Edit: Added Lavine"
"Anyone whos career just kind of fizzles out or they don't really do much. Obviously not generational talents like Giannis, Harden, and Russ if they don't go on to win championships but the lower all star guys. Demar Derozan comes to mind for me"
Steve Francis Jamaal Murray  Demar Derozan
"PF’s have been shifting more and more to wings as well. DeMar DeRozan has been playing the 4 this year, and he is smaller than Luka."
"Sure. But sometimes players also consistently step up their games or choke in the playoffs. I hate to say it but DeMar DeRozan consistently struggled in the playoffs in Toronto over five years. It was not a small sample size, and I love DeMar.        Blaming narratives, recency bias, and sample sizes is often correct but it’s also sometimes a way for this sub to feel smarter than the stupid sheeple. Jimmy Butler is a great playoff performer and saying he’s overrated by adding up his W-L record is ridiculous."

"Yeah but this is a problem in basketball discourse, most talented player isn't necessarily best player.   KD was absolutely the most talented player on those Warriors teams, but that doesn't mean he was the best player.  The best player on a team is the most important player, the one that the team can't stomach their loss or they drastically suffer in terms of W/L record, the player that impacts winning the most. There was never a point in time where DeMar DeRozan was better than Kyle Lowry despite being more talented and putting up superior stats. There was never a point in time where Blake Griffin was better than Chris Paul despite being more talented and putting up superior stats, similar story with Devin Booker this year. Donovan Mitchell is not better than Mike Conley this season, despite being more talented and putting up superior stats.   KD has never impacted wins/losses as much as his reputation has suggested he has, the reason why nobody ever talks about it, is his most glaring weakness (playmaking and creating for others on offense) has been covered up by the fact that he's played with an MVP point guard for the entirety of his career who has fulfilled that role."

"It’s been a few years, but Demar Derozan was done dirty and should have been a lifer"
"I can see what you are getting at but DeMar DeRozan has been a beast in his NBA career.  The Raptors were consistently good because of him, and now he is leading the Spurs to a play-in spot in the West. He has been great for so long, but unfortunately, he had to play LeBron in the playoffs for most of his career. It is hard putting Andre Iguodala in the 100-150 spot, but because of his finals MVP, it's kind of a must for me. If Curry were to have won it, which he 100% should have, Andre Igoudala is nowhere near my top 150 players of all time."

All time rankings are hard and after the top 100 its basically impossible but some of these guys like DeMar DeRozan I have a hard time seeing being top 100-150 players in NBA history. Someone like Andre Iguodala I can get why some might argue it but even that gets tough.

"their young talent is ok but they are really missing someone to be the main star of their franchise. Derozan is good but you're not going anywhere if hes the best player on your team.   Trading Demar gives you the ability to get a higher enough draft pick to get a Zion, Edwards, Morant, Lamelo, Luka, Trae, etc. Thats something they are never going to get if they don't rebuild properly and just fight for the 8th seed every year."
RIP DeMar DeRozan
Demar Derozan has a Heath Ledger Joker tat. gross
"I think they should just go with a S&amp;T of Myles Turner for DeMar DeRozan, seems fair to me"
"Absolutely. Russell Westbrook. Demar Derozan. There are more but these 2 just come to mind immediately.  They are the guys people fawn over but as soon as they come available half the teams would pass for ""fit""."
Cant leave out John Wall and Demar Derozan
You sound a lot like Demar Derozan fans in Toronto. And Rudy Gay fans in Memphis.
This articles says Spurs is better with Derozan (on/off numbers inside):  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-demar-derozan-has-kept-a-young-spurs-squad-afloat/  What gives?
I'll go with the homer pick and say Demar Derozan. Was viewed as not being able to get past Lebron like Lebron is some scrub or something. Then listed at the 82nd best player in the league this year. I'll take Demar over Jrue any day. Demar is a scoring assassin and can playmake just as good as Jrue
I think DeMar DeRozan is a possibility.

Maybe but definitely not Jordan. Dude played against plumbers and milkmen. He would just be Demar Derozan in today's game.
Then you guys just need to draft Steph Curry and Demar Derozan instead of Jonny Flynn and Ricky Rubio and everybody wins.
"DeMar Derozan maybe?   I personally don't think he is HOF-worthy but unless he falls off a cliff in production, he will likely finish with over 20,000 career points.   Then add in 1 Olympic Gold Medal, 2x All-NBA, 4x All-Star selections and he might get some consideration."
"There's nothing about the franchise name on the jersey that makes the Raptors any more vulnerable to LeBron than anyone else.  No one legitimately expected a rookie (which OG was in our last playoff series with LeBron) to clamp up LeBron, especially when LeBron loves to hunt mismatches (like Demar).  We have some of the best wing defence in the league nowadays, with one of the best defensive coaches in the league. The fact that the jersey says Raptors does not make our guys automatically start defending like Demar Derozan when LeBron shows up."
*DeMar Derozan in shambles*
"We had 4 starters out. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, DeMar DeRozan, and Jakob Poeltl. I'd say they're our 4 most important players too"
"I thought Ant might be in the vein of rj barrett/andrew wiggins/demar derozan with good but not great upside.  Watching him the past month, I don't know anymore.  He wont be better than Lamelo this year or next or the year after, but he has such physical tools that when his proprioception catches up to his explosiveness in his mid 20s he might be worth his draft position."
Prime Ray Allen - age 30 and 31 - had a TS% of .578  Prime Demar Derozan -age 30 and 31 - has a TS% of .597  Demar has really re-invented himself under the coaching of Pop.  He’s become a very efficient player

"“I’m just like DeRozan, when I shoot it goes in.” Like you, KYLE also believe in DeMar."
DeMar DeRozan and Charles Oliveira (UFC).
"Depends on how patient the Knicks are. The Knicks reputation is at an all time high within the past five years, so it’s probably easier to land free agents like DeMar DeRozan (maybe even Kawhi if he declines his player option). If they can land a star in free agency, then might as well go all in.   Always thought someone like D’Lo could be a good fit for the Knicks and wouldn’t have to trade too much for him either."
DeMar DeRozan from San Antonio
I think it would be a throwback player like Demar Derozan or Andre Drummond
"Underrated by analysts: demar derozan. Analysts act like it’s just straight up impossible to build a good team with him on it but I just don’t see why. Yes he’s not an ideal spacer or defender, but he’s an above average playmaker, takes care of the ball, is a very good scorer, and honestly it’s not like defenses treat him like Ben Simmons.  Underrated by counting stats: Jakob Poeltl (homer take but I do believe this), Dorian finney smith, Zubac  Underrated by casuals: Paul George. He does say some things that make him unlikable at times but casuals also treat him like he isn’t a top 15 player at worst.   Underrated season: Terry Rozier, Paul George again, Robert Williams (I think he’s shown promise as a long term starting center), kinda TJ McConnell."
"The other awards are asking who is the ""best at doing X"".. This award is who is pretty good at basketball and stuff but isnt too good"".. Its alot easier to clarify who is the best at something.  like... why did you in your OP disqualify DeMar DeRozan who would pretty clearly be the most impactful non All Star ""Veteran"""
I don’t think any of those guys are over/underrated.   I.e. I think they get the proper amount of love and attention.   Westbrook is Westbrook. He’s had a stellar past few games but has been inconsistent this year and the early part of the year wasn’t doing so hot.  Kleber has intangibles but it doesn’t matter what you provide if it doesn’t show up on a stat sheet.. his 3p% is great on decent attempts per game. His defensive rating is ok-ish and his offensive rating is alright. His per 36 is worse this year than last year so take that for what you will.  Rudy Gobert is neither over or underrated. He’s a prototypical big that puts up DPOY level interior defense... that’s what he does not much else to say about it.   Demar Derozan.. if he added a 3 pointer to his repertoire he would be a killer. His draw foul on the drive game is incredible and he’s got the mid range down. But he’s not all nba.. yet.. he is too small and not a tank like Zion so he has to be crafty to get to the rim.. it would help him to be able to hit a 3 on 35% 3-4 attempts a game.   I agree with Tobias harris...  I think the most under appreciated players are almost always role players or borderline all star players on small market teams...  I.e. Brandon Ingram put up all star numbers this year but didn’t make the all star game. Same with de Aaron fox who got snubbed for all star reserves this year.
"Demar Derozan is this years most overrated player. Last year we ignored him because the Spurs sucked. This year the Spurs don't suck - but the difference is the growth of the young guys around him. His numbers are largely the same, his defense is still just as bad, everything is the same right down to the annual negative on/off numbers. Except instead of talking about the growth of guys like White, Poeltl, Murray and Johnson the Derozan stans want everyone to know how Derozan needs respect. Or put him in the all-star game where he clearly does not belong."
Was that really a thing?? I’m like 2 years old in this sub and all I’ve seen are Kyle Lowry and Demar DeRozan wholesome posts.
DeRozan is playing a lot of time with 3 other guards on the floor. I don't know who would be considered what position in SAS but bb ref has him listed at PF.  If Jimmy isn't a SG neither is DeMar.
Statistically it's Demar Derozan

"The day he was traded, every Toronto fan on r/NBA was insisting he would have a statue in front of their arena. Toronto fans want every player to get a tribute video, they'd retire 30 jerseys, they'd bronze Kawhi, DeRozan, Lowry, &amp; VanVleet. NOBODY covets awards like Raptor fans.

"When facing the hoop: Kyrie Irving or Steph Curry  When back to the hoop: Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan"
I won't ever forget reading a Lakers fan say Jordan Clarkson would be better than DeMar DeRozan.

Demar DeRozan is 31 years old how is that “wrong side of 30” lmao
*DeMar DeRozan and the Spurs have entered the chat*
I LOVE DEMAR DEROZAN
"You're right I don't remember ""all of this shit"". I was 10 years old when they lost the double OT game to the spurs.  But from a quick search about it, it didn't seem as big an issue as you suggest, Ed Davis seemed perfectly fine with it  [https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors-ed-davis-thinks-dwane-casey-was-right-to-stick-with-andrea-bargnani](https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors-ed-davis-thinks-dwane-casey-was-right-to-stick-with-andrea-bargnani)  It speaks to a larger point in which I do think Casey who was respected and well liked by the players, and who motivated the players to play with maximum effort. In many ways I see similarities (and shortcomings) with him and Thibs (and the difference in results between the knicks and pistons this year is mainly due to roster construction).  As to your points, while there was probably so tension between kyle and casey after losing again in the playoffs but at the same time both have said publicly that they've maintained a good relationship.  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2775591-kyle-lowry-calls-dwane-casey-1-of-the-best-coaches-ive-ever-had-after-firing](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2775591-kyle-lowry-calls-dwane-casey-1-of-the-best-coaches-ive-ever-had-after-firing)  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2774975-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry-support-raptors-hc-dwane-casey-amid-hot-seat-rumors](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2774975-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry-support-raptors-hc-dwane-casey-amid-hot-seat-rumors)  Many other raptors players have said how much they've liked casey and how he's improved as a coach.  As for playoffs series you're right for the most part (though I do remember a fairly easy series against the wizards a second time around when they played in 2018). I honestly didn't mind the fact that they were difficult because they were always exciting and we won against everyone except the cavs in the last 3 years.  And lastly JV did play some fourth quarter minutes. I think most raptors fans remember his missed buzzer beater against the cavs in game 1 2017/2018. And while he did improve his defense while on the raptors and is still improving he did seem to get exposed constantly the playoffs. (see the massive difference in field goal rating). I think this would still be true today despite his improvements.  [https://www.raptorscage.ca/raptors-projection-2018-19-the-tragic-tale-of-jonas-valanciunas/](https://www.raptorscage.ca/raptors-projection-2018-19-the-tragic-tale-of-jonas-valanciunas/)  [https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/4/21/22381808/the-defensively-misunderstood-jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-nba](https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/4/21/22381808/the-defensively-misunderstood-jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-nba)  Altogether I think while there was shortcomings with Casey that you clearly remember, there is some revisionist history going on by raptors fans to paint him as a largely net negative coach when judging from the players and the record of the team, it isn't at all the case."
Billups= Jrue Holiday RIP= Demar Derozan Prince= Kyle Anderson Rasheed = Paul Milsap Wallace =  Rudy Gobert?
"Gus, don't be Demar Derozan in the playoffs"
"You’re probably right Zion and Adams are preventing him from getting to the rim more. He did it better in LA for sure.   He is a much better 3 pt shooter than Derozan but he also doesn’t have Derozan’s foul drawing game. Demar was more efficient on average. Both are around the same level of passer. I could see BI surpassing derozan but not by a huge amount.   Kristaps is such a wildcard health-wise I certainly wouldn’t trade Ingram for him. Ingram has proven he can stay healthy. But I don’t think Ingram is far better as a player. I think both top out as the third best guy on a title team, but Porzingis can fill that role better due to his defense and utility as a screener and roll man. If it weren’t for health concerns I’d probably have Zinger over BI. Zinger can be that Chris Bosh type third option. Ingram to me due to not being a great passer and not having a super efficient shot profile won’t be a great enough offensive player to differentiate him IMO.   I’d love to have more great players in the league so I hope he proves me wrong!"
Demar Derozan is in a sense making people aware of the good probability of making an opponent pay for percieved disrespect.

"Overheard in The Krusty Krab after lunch:   “He got me,” Spongebob said of Derozan taking his home. ""That (dolphin noises) Demar boomed me.""   Spongebob added, “He’s so fast,” repeating it four times.   Spongebob then said he wanted to add Derozan to the list of people he sends to the future this summer."
"id you ever hear the tragedy of DeMar DeRozan The Skilled? I thought not. It's not a story the Knicks would tell you. It's a North legend. DeMar was a Dark Lord of the North, so powerful and so wise he could use his skills to influence defenders to leap at whispers of a word… He had such a knowledge of the midrange that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being traded. The midrange is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he showed the King everything he knew, then his team kept getting Lebrontoed. Ironic. He could save others from trades, but not himself.  All I'm saying is, wait until you see your team in the playoffs before you get too caught up in it."
Coach Popovich training Demar Derozan 1-on-1: https://youtu.be/hQ872mwg-_g  Coach Pop might also be a big part of his improvement
TIL if I'm stranded with DeMar DeRozan I will starve to death.
"HOOPLA - DeMar DeRozan, probably"
Demar DeRozan spreads happiness like no NBA player I have seen. Had the hard road and fought through it and now he can literally just smile and it becomes contagious like no other. Not to mention he is hilarious.
"&gt;Why does team seeding affect the individual MVP Award? This is a genuine question, no one explains why it does only say it does.   it's almost like winning = good  &gt;Currently I believe Steph Curry is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Warriors from being the worst team in the league. (Source 1-7 with him injured).  Currently I believe DeMar DeRozan is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Spurs from being the worst team in the league.  Wait, no... that doesn't work. I forgot you have to score more ppg to be eligible and 21 aint gonna cut it.  &gt;Everytime his name arises everyone shoots it down because 9th seed.. Why?  because they are the 9th seed.   Bradley Beal is averaging virtually the same stats and is sitting at the same seed and nobody is bringing his name up in MVP conversation.  I wonder why?  &gt;Leading the conversation however is Nikola Jokić who is putting up amazing stats but is also on a better team.  hmm... almost like Jokic is giving a very compelling reason to be at the top of MVP conversation.  &gt;This leads to another question, why is there no Offensive Player Of the Year Award when there's a DPOY award?  there is. it's called the MVP (or 6MOTY if you're on the bench).  it's not that Curry isn't valuable to his team, it's that other players are having a more impressive season and largely the reason they are in the seeding position they're in.  the Warriors are in the position they're in and aren't a better seed because Klay is injured, and if Steph was as valuable as you say he is, the Warriors should still be comfortably in the Playoffs.  i didn't see LaMarcus Aldridge be given an MVP in 2018 for carrying the Spurs to the Playoffs was Kawhi was out essentially the entire season."
Are you referring to future Knicks legend Demar Derozan? I agree
lol something tells me dudes like Demar Derozan who grew up in Compton got more responsibilities and people who’s lives they can improve than you
Demar Derozan
Demar Derozan.
Luis Scola Bismack Biyombo Norman Powell Demar Derozan
DeMar DeRozan used to be the king of this stat in Toronto. He's really developed since.
"btw, what's your opinion of Demar Derozan?"
Giannis saying this is a bad look. It reminds me of when DeMar DeRozan conceded LBJ just kept getting the better of him. Both KG and Perkins had choice words for DeRozan. And they were right.  https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-garnett-time-break-toronto/
Who do you guys have on your all nba playoff team? I got: James harden Demar derozan  CJ McCollum Paul George  Julius Randle   Top that fire roster
You mean Demar “caused another international incident” DeRozan. Dude’s trying to start wars the way he dunks in international events.
"I remember back when the DeMar DeRozan Raptors were in the ECF against the Cavs, after all the taxes, the Cavs were paying close to double what the Raptors were for their roster.   I don’t overly get why the NBA doesn’t have a hard cap, because the teams that can spend as much as they want definitely have an advantage."
DeMar DeRozan is a better basketball player than CJ McCollum.
Gary Trent and Demar Derozan. The Raptors will be pressured to pay Trent way more than he is worth and one of the perpetually drunk orgs like NY or Orlando will inexplicably throw the bag at DD.
"DeMar “DeMar I say it, de less I like it” Derozan"
I dont hate demar derozan
demar derozan
"DeMar DeRozan special, did it in 2018 ECSF Game 4"
Jonas “Big Science” Valanciunas  Kyle “The Bulldog” Lowry  DeMar “Deebo” Derozan or Comp10  PJ “The Lebron stopper” Tucker  Demarre “Junkyard Dog 2.0” Carroll  Pascal “ Spicy P” Siakam  Fred “VanFleek” Vanvleet   Malachi “Red Vanvleet” Flynn  Stormin Norman   CJ “Kilometres” Miles
The best player Lebron faced during those runs was Demar Derozan get out of here lmao
The most overrated role player isn't even on your list: Demar Derozan. If he's playing his role your ceiling is about as high as a Hobbits house - unless you put a championship caliber team from 2-12 around him.
"Ben Taylor, the creator of Thinking Basketball, has a metric called PlayVal, which is described as ""Playmaking value, an estimate of a player’s points per 100 impact from playmaking only.""  According to this metric for the 2020-21 season (regular season), the top 10 players for this stat are:  1. James Harden 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Trae Young 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damian Lillard 6. Chris Paul 7. LeBron James 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Jimmy Butler 10. DeMar DeRozan"
Would DeRozan work with them? He plays as a forward so Bron could just play PG and put DeMar at the SF. He’s a weak shooter but other than that he’s not bad
"jamal murray, demar derozan, isiah thomas all tweeted about him after his game 6 vs the mavs"
Keep telling yourself that and I'll keep telling myself ya totally we would have won the championship if we had just beaten LeBron! DeMar DeRozan... What a player.
Chris Paul    Russell Westbrook    James Harden (but not on the Nets)    Damian Lillard   DeMar DeRozan
They call me DeMar DeRozan because I only bang twos.
DeMar Derozan too lol
He landed Indiana Oladipo and Sabonis. He landed OKC Shai and picks.   This time around? Maybe DeMar Derozan sign and trade? CJ McCollum? Middleton?
Seriously what the fuck? Imagine DeMar DeRozan call up Compton homies mid game because someone touched him
"This is hard because of the 1st team SF line up....I wanted to put LeBron, but then there's KD. But LeBron can play any position basically, so imma just put him at PF.   **1st team:**  PG: Steph Curry  SG: James Harden   SF: Kevin Durant  PF: LeBron James  C: Dwight Howard   **2nd team:**  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kawhii Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Marc Gasol  **3rd team:**  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Paul George  PF: Giannis  C: Joel Embiid"

DeMar Derozan is the biggest fake good player ever in my book. Terrible in the playoffs and his team is always better with him on the bench.      He can get some numbers by dominating the ball but it doesn't help the teams offence flow and isn't conductive to winning at a high level.
"DeMar DeRozan? Giroux was fourth in points in the last decade behind Ovechkin, Crosby and Kane. People literally debated over whether he’s a hall of famer (he’s not, but there was legitimate debate)."
"It’s basically the equivalent of saying LeBron handed the baton to someone like DeMar DeRozan.  DeMar is great, was the star of Toronto, All-Star caliber, great regular seasons... hasn’t won a championship, not even a finals appearance, and has no major accomplishments like other ringless greats like Barkley. He’ll likely be forgotten about outside of his team fan bases many years after he retires. That’s basically Giroux.  Crosby is the greatest player of his generation. Depending on who you ask, he ranges anywhere in the top 5 of top 10 on the All-Time lists. This tweet was in 2012, Crosby also went on to get 2 more cups and a lot of other hardware while Giroux isn’t even close."
"Nah man, Derrick White is definitely better than DeMar DeRozan because his +/- is higher."
There is absolutely no chance we could get DeRozan and Lowry. DeMar wouldn't be a good fit either to be honest.
DeMar DeRozan ain’t afraid of Luka lol
Demar Derozan had a 33% TS in that series and you think he would've stopped Luka? Lol
"You'll get a midrange hoister, an overcommitting gambler on D, and someone you can ""Contact AthleteSpeakers today at 800-916-6008 to book DeMar DeRozan for a keynote speech""  I'd take any third"
"I heard kemba wants out, so him if you consider him a star  Demar Derozan might join a contender maybe? Again, if you consider him a star.   Other than that, Kawhi might leave if he gets eliminated. He is not currently in the most profitable market, joining Golden state or Miami would make him tonnes of cash in improved marketability. Also, the clippers kind of aren’t good enough to be a contender, but Miami or golden state with Kawhi would be, probably"
I can give you a lightly used sign and traded DeMar Derozan for Myles Turner.
What are your thoughts on DeMar DeRozan to Portland? I believe he's a free agent.
"The best player they can get in FA is... Demar Derozan. Or Chris Paul but they don’t have the money to afford him. Neither are good enough to beat the Nets. LeBron’s only hope for title number 5 is to join the Warriors with Steph, Klay, and Draymond."
DeMar Derozan
What DD are you talking about? The DD I know is DeMar Darnell DeRozan
He's DeMar Derozan
Demar Derozan
A slightly realistic option would be signing Demar DeRozan. He put up an all star season last year and would be a perfect 2 that’s attainable.
Would much rather be a fringe 10 seed wondering if overpaying DeMar DeRozan is the only way to stay relevant through the end of Pop's coaching career tbh
what do you think about demar derozan?
Only way we do it is if it's a DeRozan sign and trade and us getting a first or something. DeMar has to agree to that though and I see no reason why DeMar would want to stay in the west.
DeRozan is good friend with Dame. Maybe POR keeps Powell and we get a CJ for DeMar sign and trade?
"Sixers should trade Ben Simmons at all cost and just sign Demar Derozan, guarantee better results in the playoff."
get u a demar derozan
"Paul George- probably   Kyrie Irving- 100%, you can’t tell the story of the NBA without mentioning him  Jimmy Butler- Probably, if he declines further his chances go down. He’s not a HOFer right now   DeMar DeRozan- No, sadly  Rudy Gobert- Needs more. It took Ben Wallace a while and he had a ring against a great team. Defense isn’t valued as much clearly"
All of the players listed will probably end up being HoFers - except DeMar DeRozan.
"Personally I think RJ is going to grow to be a Demar Derozan level player. The 3 of him, IQ and Mitch are a pretty good young core to build around and along with some first round picks would probably be an acceptable offer for dame.  About the Knicks only being good because of other teams injuries, I’d disagree with you there. We came out on top in some pretty tough matchups and played like a well oiled machine, always defending and always hustling, which did help us punch above our weight. Anyways, I like what we’re doing with the team and I think a trade for dame would rush our timeline so it just doesn’t make much sense anyway."
"&gt; Just look at the playoffs  Just look at the some of the players who aren't in the playoffs; Curry, Draymond, Zion, Sabonis, Demar Derozan, Lavine, Vucevic, FVV and Lowry, KAT and many others."

Spurs really traded this man for a late 1st DeMar Derozan and Jakob fucking poeltl lmao
"Hey Chris! Bit of a longer question, but as a Toronto fan my whole life I've always wondered:   Your time in Toronto briefly overlapped with both Vince Carter and Demar DeRozan. Is there any part of you that looks back and just wonders out of curiosity what a sustained run would've looked like with both of those guys? Obviously your career was fantastic either way, but as a Toronto guy I've always wondered about that."
carried bums to beat up Demar Derozan and a 18 year old Tatum smh. that's some GOAT shit
"Your defense would be awful with LaVine, DeRozan, and Vucevic plus DeMar is probably looking for a big payday that would be an overpay for Markkanen."
A team with cap space and shooters. For DeMar to thrive you need shooters to space the floor. Likewise when he drives and the defense collapses he'll have options to kick it out to the perimeter for open looks.  Imagine DeRozan + Curry &amp; Klay combo in GS
"&gt;	maintaining the same ratio other PGs do at lower volumes isnt impressive   russ does it on higher volume though which is impressive  &gt;	all three of the guy you mentioned are around the top in the league in turnovers themself  this proves my point lmao. good playmakers are almost always near the top in TO as well. harden/luka/trae are way ahead of FVV/Rubio/etc. as playmakers. the fact that you’re using ast/to in a vacuum to declare those latter 3 guys ahead of the elite playmakers i mentioned is kinda embarrassing tbh  &gt;	i would also caution against any metric that suggests demar derozan is one of the best passers in the nba  no, he’s not. but he is one of the most efficient playmakers in the league at the moment, which is reflected accurately with those stats. you can’t worship ast/to as this all-seeing metric of playmaking and then completely overlook other metrics like ast/pass ratio"
"maintaining the same ratio other PGs do at lower volumes isnt impressive and all three of the guy you mentioned are around the top in the league in turnovers themself. Chris paul, Ricky rubio, FVV, Mike conley...those guys are elite playmakers and they crush westbrook in ast/to.  i would also caution against any metric that suggests demar derozan is one of the best passers in the nba. hes really good but i think situation counts for a lot on both cases. westbrook has a ton of weapons at his disposal."
"&gt; Its a circumstance completely out of their control  You really can’t see how it matters which teams you went up against when talking about conference finals appearances for a player?   Even for lebrons 8 straight finals people always mention how much weaker the east is compared to the west. It’s just obviously tougher in 1 conference.   &gt; Not sure about you, but I'm I'm favouring the Eastern teams to take it all this year.  Top teams in the east are better (just like it was in 2019), but the west is still obviously stronger from overall. Just look at the play in tournament from both sides.   &gt; CP3 also gets more praise (perhaps deservedly so).  There you go, you answered it to yourself. Cp3 gets more praise cause he’s way better. Demar continuously sucks in the playoffs when it matters most, what exactly should they praise him for?   I love demar as a person and his work ethic but he just isn’t on the same level as a guy like cp3. If you know that then it shouldn’t be a surprise to see one guy have higher expectations and get more praise. He also definitely gets slandered way more than Lowry and derozan."
"&gt;Obviously it’s not on them for playing in a weaker conference lol. But it’s not the same as injuries, that can happen to anyone on any team   It's a circumstance completely out of their control. What are they supposed to do? Demand a trade to the West? And even then, this year, the West was arguably stronger. And then the trade deadline hit. Not sure about you, but I'm I'm favouring the Eastern teams to take it all this year.   &gt;You can’t just say demar has the same amount of conference finals appearances as cp3 with no context  Why not? We're discussing a fact. They both have equal appearances in conference finals.  &gt;Yes cp has better teams but he’s also the much better playoff performer against much better opponents   Never said he wasn't a better performer. I'd agree, CP3 is the better player.  &gt;Also idk where you’ve been if you think cp3 doesn’t get any criticism lol. People always shit on him for his lack of playoff success, that’s cause he has way higher expectations than demar and Lowry   Maybe. It was hyperbole on my part to be sure. But, at the same time, CP3 also gets more praise (perhaps deservedly so). Even here, I was responding to a guy who was trashing Lowry and DeRozan. All things considered, DeRozan and Lowry, especially DeRozan, gets trashed a lot more than he gets praised."
Jus napkin math on some trades I'd like to see.   CJ &amp; Little for JJJ &amp; JV. Nurk for DeMar Derozan (S&amp;T) Simons for Oubre
"so we're supposed to treat derozan like he's an all timer and someone that won rings just because? For no reason? Even tho he plays poorly every year in the playoffs?    Demar and wade were equally important to their franchise according to you.   If this how you wanna justify pissing off a dude that won 3 rings and is the 3rd greatest SG ever, go ahead lol. You've seen some of the greatest players of this era play for your team cause of wade, and cause he brought bron."
"Demar or lowry were never our GOAT in 2018. They hadn't won shit. They would just be some of the best to play for our team.   There wasn't a Wade for durant trade anyways lol. He was a free agent you guys wanted and didn't get. Wade won 3 rings in Miami  You're salty so you're trying to bring up the raps, but it's completely different  acting like we need to treat derozan like he's an all timer lol"
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"realistically they could sign demar derozan and nerlens noel, that would make them better.   probably best to let THJ walk"
Yea and cp3 continuously faced better teams than what demar and Lowry faced.   Cp3 also is a much better playoff performer than both of them.   Saying cp3 has as many conference finals appearances as derozan without any context is Twitter level analysis.   Not sure what raps facing injured warriors has to do with anything. Playing the team in front of you despite injuries has nothing to do with what we’re talking about. We’re talking about the major difference in the quality of teams in the west and east.
"You should want Demar Derozan, he’s basically a point guard now in SA, and can still play as a wing player when he’s in with Doncic. He’s also available this off-season."
"And all the Clippers get in return is Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and no draft compensation lol?"
"Definitely either DeMar DeRozan or Kyle Lowry. I’d take DeMar simply because he’s younger, but Lowry is a better playmaker than DeRozan for sure (although DeRozan is no scrub either). There’s really not much else enticing unrestricted free agents hitting the market this offseason."
Demar Derozan is a free agent next season

"I mean they asked the Celtics for tatum and brown, who are stars.  They asked the raptors for demar derozan, who is a mediocre player.  The raptors also lucked out hard because of the warriors injuries. I think they get swept by a healthy warriors.  I don’t think you can blame ainge for not predicting that KD and Klay would tear their Achilles."
"[Classic](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/7/17326080/brad-stevens-celtics-sixers).  &gt; There’s not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He’s undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I’d take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he’s ahead of high lottery picks. I’d take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range. I’d take Stevens over aging stars like Chris Paul and injured ones like DeMarcus Cousins. &gt;  &gt; Obviously, players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant would be selected first. And rising stars like Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Simmons would go ahead of Stevens, too. But are you really taking DeMar DeRozan ahead of Stevens? I don’t think so. &gt;  &gt; It’s tough to know where to draw the line, but there’s no doubt Stevens has proved himself to be one of the most valuable commodities in the NBA."
do yall want a demar derozan? just pay him dollars and he can be all yours.
"Kevin Garnett, Rondo, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen. He beat IT who has fallen off but was in the Top 5 MVP rankings back then. Demar derozan deserves to be on this list. Jimmy butler as well."
Portland DeMar Derozan
"Never made an all star game, and disappears in the clutch, man is Portland DeMar Derozan, can’t win with him"
"He scored as many points as AUSTIN RIVERS tonight and was out scored by an off the bench Monte by near 10. He might not even score 15 with how he’s playing in game 6, out right bottling it. Dudes is the Portland Demar Derozan  holding back Dame"
"Will only applies to the likes of Paul George because he's ""deflecting the issue"" so that people will stop bullying him.  However, this sub will have open arms on Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan because they're so wholesome."
Demar derozan but more athletic.
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Jahlil Okafor  C: Enes Kanter
They should’ve made a package and traded him for Bradley Beal this year. Then next year try to add one more piece like Demar Derozan in free agency.
Demar Derozan the mid range king
PG: Patrick Beverly  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Domantas Sabonis  C:  Derrick Favors or Andre Drummond
"Probably D Wade tbh, who he played with. Then maybe.... Bosh?  Paul George? John Wall? Demar Derozan?  You're not wrong."
Back in the Lowry-DeRozan days our best lineups were always Lowry + the bench with DeMar off the court. It’s weird how that happens with some teams.
"Lol it's not rocket science man.  6 years and the best the East puts out is teams led by Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, Paul George and Roy Hibbert, or uh Paul Milsap and Al Horford.  That's really all that needs to be said."
"Lebron didnt face strong opposition in the east. In his heat days the best team he had to go against was the pacers of a young Paul George.   Later in his cavs days? i dont even know. Lebronto Raptors of demar derozan? There wasnt a single team in the east, any year that could be considered a conteder if they were in the west."
"I doubted RJ a lot, but if you watch him play you know he is going to be good real soon. He does everything well and has basically elevated every facet of his game to the NBA level in one offseason. RJ is a bit conservative on offense because he is trying to perfect his craft without hurting the team. His strength is driving to the hoop, but the Knicks lack of shooters has resulted in RJ having to shoot a lot more. I think he will put it all together and he averages at least 20/5/5 next season. In my eyes, his floor is Demar Derozan and ceiling is RJ Barrett."
this aint the East where his toughest opponent is Demar Derozan
1. Demar Derozan Went Derozan raptor on Chris Boucher  2. Lebron James with no regard for human life  3. Here comes Mc Grady oh he just sucked the gravity right out of the building   Basically anything with Kevin Harlan
Demar DeRozan is definitely up there
"JJ Reddong out the league, Duncan't Robinson GONE, Demar Derozan MVP Candidate."
"Hahaha yeah I think that's the best part, cuz if we didn't win that season y'all know Toronto gambled away DeMar DeRozan for a whole lotta nothin"
Demar Derozan with a 3-point shot.
Nowhere near as athletic as most of his peers. About as good as DeMar DeRozan. The guy was one of the great overachievers of all time.
Head Coach: Mike Budenholzer  PG: Eric Bledsoe  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Julius Randle  C: Rudy Gobert
"What do you expect from players? Players get traded at the drop of a hat. Look at demar derozan, isaih thomas, blake griffin. Loyalty and contracts don't mean shit to GMs, they're literally just ""pieces"" or ""assets"". Why should it be any different for the players?"
"disagree, that's just as good as the current finals contenders suns and bucks so idk how you say they couldn't compete. Suns may have more star power but Dame is better than anyone on the suns which should count for something. Derozan is also right up there with those guys, maybe a hair worse.  And the bucks...Giannis is a touch better than Dame. Middleton and Derozan are similar. Jrue and Powell are similar. Covington and Lopez are similar. Nurkic is better than Connaughton. Is it really that much of a disparity? I think you're underrating how good Dame, Demar, Powell, Covington are. For example even Powell or Covington would be the 3rd best player on the lakers. Sure the blazers wouldn't be the favorites to win it but I don't see how they're not a contender if you surround Dame, one of the greatest scorers ever, with great 2-way players."

"This is an interesting take. I like it. I also see you’re a Raptors fan. Kyle Lowry was all about DeMar DeRozan for years and years. They had a famously good rapport. But you see where I’m going with this. Now maybe Masai Ujiri was able to make that particular trade work with SAS, and nothing of the sort has presented itself to the Blazers since Aldridge left.  Maybe.  But I could imagine Dame getting frustrated with the FO not at least building assets for trade even if nothing happened. It’s cliche because every team did, but we know they passed on Jokić in the draft because he was 2nd round. I bet Dame has looked at a lot of closer examples of a better player at the same or similar position falling in a draft for a guy who didn’t even play year four in Portland.  I also don’t think guys like Lillard are in the self-reflection business. I think you’ve got a good point, that if he’s blocking a trade for CJ they could only really trade or add starting front court players to affect real change. But that sounds like something Dame will reflect on later in life.  Right now, the team isn’t one move away, and even if they took those moves it would hobble the team’s future to take a chance at Win Now with maybe one new star and most of the pieces already around him. Meanwhile he could go to Philly, Milwaukee, maybe Toronto, or a half dozen teams in the west, and at least be better positioned immediately."
"Gonna focus on the UFAs here because they're the ones I feel that I have the best bead on  1. Kyle Lowry - I know the Heat and the 76ers are the most commonly linked teams here, and I can definitely see that. However, I'm gonna go a little different here and suggest that **Portland** will end up working a sign-and-trade for him (maybe in a 3 team trade, since they'd likely need to trade CJ in order to make this happen). With all the rumblings that Dame is unhappy coming out, I think it's a foregone conclusion that they're going to try and make *something* happen, and I think this is probably one of the bigger ones that they could realistically swing. While this definitely still leaves the Trailblazers small at guard, this now gives them someone that they can reliably put on elite guards on defense, which I think has shown to be pretty critical at this point.   2. DeMar DeRozan - DeMar's the hardest one here to pinpoint, IMO. He's still a great player, but his skillset isn't something a lot of teams are looking for at his contract expectations, and I'd imagine he wants to go to a legit contender (or as close to a real contender as he can). For here, I think he ends up going to **Dallas**. The Mavs biggest problem (IMO) this playoffs was how much their offense stagnated when Luka wasn't on the floor. No one else was consistently creating their own shot, and no one else really looked great running the offense. DeMar fixes both of those problems, and lets Luka maybe not be on-ball quite so much when they're on the floor together so that he can conserve his energy a bit more.   3. Richaun Holmes - I think Holmes either ends up in **Charlotte** or in **Atlanta** (but if and only if they don't re-sign Collins). Both of those teams have plenty of cap, likely won't be in contention for the tippy-top of the FA class, and (again, presuming Atlanta lets Collins walk) would have great setups with a player like him given how great Ball and Young are at playmaking while having a hole that would certainly need filling.  4. Dennis Schroeder - I don't know why, but I have a distinct feeling that **New York** ends up signing him. I hope I'm wrong because I think their fans have suffered enough and because I like the foundation for the team they have, but overpaying a mediocre player like Schroeder because you have the cap to do so and feel the need to ""improve"" your playoff team is very much something that sounds like a Dolan thing to push for. They also likely need to go for a PG in either the draft or FA, so there's an actual need there as well.   5. Kelly Oubre - Last and arguably least on this list, I think Oubre signs with a team that's willing to make him a focal point on their offense, who in turn will be angling to trade him at the deadline for assets a la Marcus Morris in his stint with the Knicks. Simply put, after how he played with the Warriors this season, I don't see a legitimately good team wanting him at his pricetag now, but that definitely changes if he looks like he did in Phoenix when he was used as a major part of their offense. That being the case, I'm looking for a team with the cap space, no one that's really a clear-cut top option on offense, and most importantly is in full rebuild mode. To that end, I think **Orlando** makes sense as a destination. They have the cap space to sign him, would likely have the possessions to give him to rehabilitate his perception a bit, and would certainly be willing to part with him for draft assets later on in the season if he lives up to that role.   A little unconventional in parts, I admit, but I wanted to avoid going too milquetoast with my predictions here."

"I think the point is you keep making statements acting like you know them to be true, when you don't.  Before this year everyone would have laughed at Suns fans for saying they would make the finals.  Before the Kawhi trade everyone would have laughed at Raptors fans for saying they could get him for Demar Derozan.  Lakers fans would've laughed if you said they'd lose in the 1st round at the start of this year.  Philly fans would laugh if you said the Hawks would knock them out of the playoffs. Unexpected shit happens constantly.  If the demar derozan raptors gave up on competiting(where this whole sub said there was no way for them to improve and to blow it up) they'd be out a title.    I don't think it's likely there's a move we can get to be contenders, but you certainly try and I have been shocked before.  And idiots on this sub always think they know how things are going to work until they don't."
" ... would these 'other teams' have been the pelicans/whoever theoretically would be dealing us talent?  Dude, every team is trying to win, themself. There goal is not to fuck over LA, or to ensure anyone but LA wins, it's to win themself. Ergo, they should act as best sets them up to win. If you're a team looking to contend now, and dealing with the Lakers creates a superteam in LA, I get it, don't deal with us. If you're building for the future, like &gt; 90% of teams dealing superstars, why the fuck would you care about how good the Lakers might be?  All I'm saying, if you're trade ideology's this ridiculous, we're clearly in your head lol. Next time you get to choose between BI + Lonzo vs Demar Derozan, let's hope for your team's sake your gm is more reasonable than u are lol"
That Kyrie should've been finals MVP  DeMar DeRozan is a superstar
He averaged 15/7/5 WITH DeRozan. I definitely think he makes another leap if Demar leaves.
&gt;	which is factually correct  “Looking at season stats on bk-ref = factual evidence of who is a better playmaker.”  The comments in this sub are always hilarious. TIL DeMar DeRozan is a significantly better playmaker than Steph Curry because he averages more APG.
This. This reminds me of the Ben Simmons and Demar Derozan shooting 3pt shot videos.
"Basically all their first round picks, and a couple of Bucks draft picks. Cavs would probably want at least Top 4 protection on any of their firsts. If the 76ers really like DeRozan (assuming this is who you were looking at sending back) maybe they can add some picks as well, but not sure on that, as they are already giving up Ben Simmons.  Their roster with Colin Sexton and DeMar in place of Simmons would be interesting.   From Spurs perspective, if you are losing DeRozan anyway, you could do worse than Love and picks if you are finally officially blowing it up."
"&gt; that MIGHT be a hint that he belongs on the team because of how good he was!  See, you keep missing my point entirely. I've not once said that Carmelo was bad. Or that he didn't deserve to be on the Olympic Team. He deserved to be on the team then the same way Bradley Beal deserves to be on the team now. Or how Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry deserved to be on the team in 2016."

"Well my take is that he is better with historical takes than current ones.   I can show you countless takes he has made in the last 2-3 years to basically show you that his bar for content has drastically reduced since his days in grantland.   And again, you just said “he has confirmation bias” something I didn’t disagree with, but his knowledge of Russel-Wilt, the teams they were on, how the teams performed, the perception of the players on a year by year basis is way better than someone on r/nba.   He doesn’t really flip flop on his historical takes too, as he contradicts himself on the same player in the same season. The guys opinion of DeMar DeRozan over the last 3-4 years is a prime example of that."
Book is a glorified Demar Derozan bro relax
"Lets be honest, Booker is really not that fucking good. He’s nice but dude is absolute dogwater from 3 for a modern 2 guard, mid as a passer, being flashy Demar DeRozan doesn’t make you a future MVP candidate like some would suggest"
"His career is really only his dunking. He has about the same level of achievements as DeMar Derozan. 2x all NBA (1 2nd team, 1 3rd team). Won 1 playoff series in his prime in Toronto. Had like a 3 year peak.  Good argument for worst HoFer if he makes it."
"Marvin Bagley, DeMar DeRozan"
demar derozan *  he resigned as a free agent
Difference making playmakers...  Kyle Lowry? Demar Derozan?
"That's everyone.  The players who were in 2016 and are still at least fringe all-stars but chose not to play are:  Paul George, Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozan, Harrison Barnes, and Jimmy Butler.   I think this team could have used those wing's defense."
Oh yeah didn’t I even realise it said demar derozan Los Angeles lakers you’re right
"&gt;F: DeMar DeRozan, Los Angeles Lakers  Definitely a troll"
DeMar DeRozan being a great example of someone who might have been able to but never did. He shoots 83% from the line for his career but has always been terrible from 3.

Demar Derozan is an All-Star-caliber player...sort of...right?
"On the one hand yes, but on the other hand some of the trade suggestions even in this thread are absolutely ridiculous.  Dejounte Murray and Demar Derozan sign and trade? Lol yeah right"
May I offer you one demar DeRozan sign and trade and a guard of your choosing mr morey?
"&gt;Weird without that ""lucky"" player you guys arent even in the playoffs  If by lucky player, you mean:  Kawhi Leonard Danny Green  Marc Gasol Serge Ibaka  Sure. And post-Leonard we were still one of the most successful teams in the East. Even went on our longest winning streak in team history. It's only after our team lost both centres that we went to seed.   &gt;When Demar Derozan is your ""franchise player"" you know your not a good franchise.   Pre-Leonard, the Raptors were a successful team in the East. Despite all the hate DeRozan is getting in this thread, he lead us to our first ECF. Something Embiid, so far, hasn't managed.  &gt;Upgrading from Derozan to arguably the best player in the league, ""risky"".  Lol. The revisionism is amazing. And didn't Morey pass on a perfectly healthy Harden for Simmons? Seems like it was more than just luck to pull that trigger on a superstar who hadn't played in a year, disgruntled and coming off major injury."
"Weird without that ""lucky"" player you guys arent even in the playoffs....Nice.  Oh man Im glad you won the quarters Klay played in but there was someone else hurt too right?    When Demar Derozan is your ""franchise player"" you know your not a good franchise.  Upgrading from Derozan to arguably the best player in the league, ""risky"".  Good video lol   Edit :  Also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q18Ar_dDz7E"
"And that the US fields a sampler platter of whoever is free after the playoffs that season. For a lot of countries, players good enough to play pro ball in the NBA or even in other major international leagues are hard to come by, so it almost pencils those guys in for a decade on the squad.  For the US, it’s almost like, “Who’s had a good playoffs and doesn’t have anything lined up? Can we get DeAndre Ayton out here?”  I know it’s not really as haphazard as all that, but Team USA ought to recognize that it really does need a higher degree of continuity and commitment. Assorted US/NBA talent might still be good enough to beat most/all(?) other national squads, but it’s clearly not good enough to win in a walk. And considering the gargantuan target Team USA has on its back in international tournament play, I’d appreciate if there were at least 4 guys who were 27-34 year-old NBA players who had made this commitment two years ago.  Not necessarily “For Old Glory, KD and Steph need to —“ blah blah, but Team USA should know they have a baseline of guys who’ve all been multiple time all-stars who can serve as starters in a pinch if not a reliable third rotation. Line up multi-year commits well in advance from, say, Paul George, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler. Easier said than done, I know, but I could see it being marketable to being a backbone of Team USA. Hell, if KD wins a third gold this year, I bet he’s back in three years to try for a fourth. But maybe it’s better for the squad overall if guys like Butler and Green had been vocal about returning from ‘16 once the 44 man finalist list was announced last February. Something."
"&gt; Is it Demar Derozan?  or  &gt; Superstar  Choose one  Unless these are two separate questions, in which case the ring chaser could literally be any veteran."
"The original comment was:   &gt; Kawhi was traded for DeMar Derozan who at the time was better than Wiggins, Wiseman, or some rookies.  And then you said:   &gt; And what exactly did Demar do for the Spurs besides keep them in NBA purgatory?  Your comment doesn't make sense, the original comment is implying Demar was an attempt to keep them competitive (which he was), and had nothing to do with long term assets. Spurs did not make that trade for long term value."
"Yes they won’t have Derozan, but they’ll have a ton of cap space to go after free agents though. It’s not like it’ll just be the exact same team minus Demar  They probably won’t be able to get a strong scorer, but a few solid free agents to fill out the roster and they’ll at least be above the basement dwellers"
"The Harden trade was pretty convoluted. A lot of teams involved.   Kawhi was traded for DeMar Derozan who at the time was better than Wiggins, Wiseman, or some rookies."
"I mean, DeMar has 4 all-stars and 2 all-nba selections. Booker has 2 all-stars, *both* as an injury replacement, and 0 all-nba selections. You can make the argument that all-star is easier for guards in the east but that doesn't discount the all-nba teams.  Booker is not quite as good as peak DeRozan right now, but that's not a big demerit, as Booker is 24 and peak DeRozan was 27-28. But it is quite fair to say DeRozan is a good comparison to Booker in a general sense - high volume guards with good iso scoring and a penchant for mid-rangers who are defensive liabilities. DeRozan is a better iso scorer, Booker has a 3pt shot and is a better defender, DeRozan is (now) a better playmaker.  Where did this idea that Booker is a top echelon guard come from (I mean, clearly from this playoff publicity, but)? He is in the upper end of a Fox/SGA/Murray tier of guards but gets the credit of being there with Beal/Mitchell and even Luka/Dame. Never seen a guy's shortcomings swept under the rug as much as Booker honestly. We need to wait until he actually hits his prime!"
Would you consider Demar Derozan an MVP candidate? That's basically the tier Booker is on right now
"He was also incredibly un-clutch. Everyone remembers the Spurs game in the regular season, but no one remembers all the 4th quarters in the playoffs where he shot like shit and actively made it harder for his team to win. He was a regular season player, point blank. Demar Derozan with more sizzle and better PR."
"You can succeed without a three ball now, look at Butler  DeMar DeRozan needed to do what he's done in San Antonio earlier, improve his playmaking, efficiency and play more in control"
I be seeing people on twitter say that Demar Derozan is the example of MJ if he played today which is the most smoothbrain take I have ever seen tho
"Just to make the playoffs? DeMar DeRozan would get them over that line, if that’s just the target"
So DeMar DeRozan?
DeMar DeRozan S&amp;T for things that would be huge overpays considering it's DeRozan
DeMar DeRozan for sure
DeMar DeRozan
Terry Mills. He'd be a perfect fit for today's NBA with his shooting.   Demar Derozan would probably be an absolute stud in the 90s.
"Huerter does everything DeRozan does at the fraction of the price while being a better distributor, Demar running the offense would just be like having a bigger Lou. Bogi isn't injury prone and playing 3 rounds of intense playoff basketball as a starter will make any injury hard to fully recover from. John and DeRozan is not comparable at all, you can't replace a gap in the offense like that with Gallo or Demar and not get blown out in the paint."
It's not like he was super efficient at the rim though. His size really hurts him. He would probably be like a DeMar DeRozan or Westbrook without the assists and rebounds
DeMar Derozan
"For arguments sake, it’s not that he had no faith in him, it’s just that Kawhi fucking Leonard became available.  I genuinely believe he told Demar that he wouldn’t be traded because he didn’t want to blow up the team and he was certain that the Spurs would be more interested in other teams that would have been able to offer more draft picks and young stars like the Celtics or the Sixers.  Kawhi being available for Derozan was just a lightning in a bottle moment Masai couldn’t pass up."
"Yea, like does he think a team with demar derozan and role players is gonna get them far?"
Demar Derozan is not a bad team player... he's a phenomenal mentor and teammate to have for a young team.
"The chance is little to none, because I dont think DeMars family/friends would/should let him trust Masai again. But, its important to remeber that they had a moment in the bubble where they seemed to have made up similar to Pat Riley and Wade.  From Taylor Rooks bubble article:  &gt;Meanwhile, a few players used the new proximity to let go of old grudges. Raptors president Masai Ujiri said his favourite moment off the court happened while he was on the sidelines, watching his team play the Lakers, and one of his former players came up to him. “I’m sitting down there, and I see this person walking straight to me with a blue tracksuit,” says Ujiri. It was DeMar DeRozan, who had spent nine seasons with the Raptors before he was traded to the Spurs for Kawhi Leonard. The trade had left DeRozan feeling “extremely hurt” and betrayed but earned the Raptors the franchise’s first championship. “And he walks up to me,” Ujiri continues, “and he gives me a big, big hug. This was really the first time that we’ve really had that kind of contact since the trade. I left the game and I felt that we had crossed a certain… we’d reached a new place.”"
"Dont know why youre getting downvoted, they literally hugged and made up in the bubble.

I've been saying this for ever since his first season with us. Kawhi goes and helps Raptors win their only championship in first and only season with them. Something Derozan never did in his entire time there. Meanwhile Spurs barely make the playoffs with a first round exit during Demar's first season. Then the 20+ year playoff streak gets broken the very next season. Demar is a complimentary player you put on a team to compliment some All Stars. Not a guy who can carry a team by himself.
"I think it was viewed by some as a bad breakup because DeRozan took it to heart. I don't think Masai ever screwed DeMar over. Who gets traded to the Spurs to get screwed over?  Kawhi was available and at that point we've had multiple playoff appearances w/ DeMar performing subpar, two straight years of Cleveland sweeps. It was time to move on. DeMar had enough chances to prove himself."
"I really don't know. The knicks have cap space but I don't know if you can count on their roster to keep shooting 3s well plus Randle and DeRozan both need the ball in their hands a lot. Maybe the hawks if for some reason they'd rather have DeMar than Collins but I doubt it. Maybe the lakers if he'd like to play in LA, the spurs have thought highly of Kuzma who would almost certainly be included in a trade there. The mavs can sign him outright but that would probably mean letting Tim Hardaway walk and I don't think they do that. The thunder have cap space but I doubt they'd want him. The spurs can sign him but there's a reason they signed Derrick, Jakob, and Dejounte to extensions and never came to an agreement with DeMar.  Overall I think people will be surprised when DeMar signs for noticeably less money than Hayward did. And if a team does give him that type of money, they will certainly regret it."
"So you agree that demar derozan is the 82nd best player in the nba, because an “nba expert” told you so? Good grief my guy."
"&gt;	Plus 2 1sts, I forgot who they drafted. Maybe one of them was Randy Foye? Also considered like a can’t miss prospect. Just didn’t work out. Rashad McCants maybe, really can’t remember how those picks shook out.  One of them ended up being Wayne Ellington with the 28th pick. Whatever, not really an asset.   But the other pick was returning Minnesota’s 1st rounder to them, which ended up being the 6th overall pick only 3 years later. That Wolves infamously took Jonny Flynn with Steph Curry still on the board. (DeMar DeRozan was two picks after that.) And if a few ping pong balls bounced differently then that pick could have been Blake Griffin or James Harden."
DeMar DeRozan ♥️
"This was the last reply I was expecting, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. I said it tongue-in-cheek but I don’t think it would happen for a couple reasons. I think the foremost reason is their difference in value. I think Murray is very underrated by NBA fans. He’s one of my favorite players in the NBA, I love his game. That being said, I think there are better offers SA could get if Murray was available. Murray is at least 1 tier above Kuz in terms of talent and value, you could even make an argument for him being 2 levels above Kuz. This leads into my second point.  My second point is I think it would take someone putting a gun to Pops head to trade with the Lakers. Pop isn’t going to do anything to make a rival better, much less the Lakers. I remember when Kawhi demanded a trade to the Lakers and Pop basically said over my dead body is Kawhi going to the Lakers. That may be the bigger hurdle honestly, would be getting Pop to deal with the Lakers.  Regarding Kuz, his game really isn’t that bad. He’s actually right when he’s talking about his role. Do I believe he can be an all-star level player? Maybe he has 1-2 great seasons and gets in as a reserve, but I don’t think he’s going to be a perennial all-star at any point in his career. His role has changed pretty much every single year he’s been on the Lakers. He’s gone from starter to bench player to somewhere in between over the course of his young career. He was an iso scorer mostly with the baby Lakers who had a solid post game. He got a lot of minutes when the Lakers were bad and showed the ability to score, but he was a black hole on defense. Now, he’s become a much improved (dare I say good) defender. He has the ability to guard 2-4 and be OK. If he was on a team like SA and they gave him starter minutes for a season with him as one of the focal points on offense, I really do not think it’s out of the question for him to average around 17-18 PPG.   Me personally, I would trade anyone not named LeBron or AD for Murray. I would hesitate on THT. I am by no means a THT stan like some Laker fans are (I was all in on them shipping THT/Dennis/KCP for Lowry at the deadline) but THT+Kuz+22 would make me pause for a second. He has really flashed and then there are moments he looks absolutely lost on the court, such is life when you’re 20 years old and in the NBA. I’ve internally gone back and forth on whether or not I want Demar on the Lakers. I do not believe he is a great fit for their team and what they’re trying to do, but he should, in theory, provide offense, especially during minutes when Bron/AD are out. Derozans playmaking has been a revelation over the last couple years. It would be an interesting move, but my fear is that it would be sort-of similar to the Lakers getting Schroder to be that secondary ball handler and provide a punch when Bron and AD rest (lol) and that was not the case.   If Murray is truly available, I hope the Lakers jump all over it. He is the player I would want the most out of anyone on SA, but I can’t see them giving up what looks to be a key part of their future. I would be meh on White, and Derozan would scare and excite me at the same time. Yet knowing the Spurs, they’ll make a trade where they get a second rounder or two and find another Manu lmao. I think both those guys (Murray and White) will stay put, but if SA moves either of them, my money is on White going. Will be very interesting to see how this plays out!"
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"Not really. I'd rather have done the clippers or lakers deals instead for sure. I'm not even sure if having DeRozan on his contract is a good thing. Even the sixers deal of Covington, Saric, and picks might have been better. Losing Green is a big thing that hardly anyone brings up but it made the raptors trade go from terrible to one of the worst trades of the 2000s. We probably make the playoffs as many times as we did with DeMar if we do any of those trades."
That would definitely make the hawks worse. They rely on Trae too much offensively right now and DeMar would alleviate that some but their defense and rebounding would take a big hit swapping Collins for DeRozan. Also Collins is a better floor spacer than DeRozan.
"Well there's that, but I was looking at Simmons and thinking about DeRozan and how FTs were his bread and butter. Imagine if his FTs were like his 3s. I don't even want to think about what hack a demar would've been like."
"3 best shooting guards of most recent times are Klay Thompson (more of a catch and shoot guy), Demar Derozan (who's more of a 3-4 now, and is the poorest man's Kobe who doesn't shoot 3s), and James Harden (who is more of a PG).  Booker can't be compared to those guys (maybe Derozan, but he shoots 3s), and he doesn't play like Dwyane Wade. So it's hard not to do the Kobe comparison."
Demar Derozan
"I disagree with you on the down-bench guys as well, but I don’t know how you can possibly say a team with Zion, Ingram, Lonzo as their best players, or a team with De’Aaron Fox and Haliburton or even Barnes has less talent than a team with Demar Derozan? Dejounte Murray? The Spurs have NO top level talent right now."
"I would implore you to dig more into shot types as well. Not every drive is created equal. Harden isn’t afraid of driving into a crowded paint, and he’s always looking to get off a layup (he’s recently added more of a floater game though).   For example, I believe one of those years, DeMar Derozan was near the top — that’s a guy that’s pulling up from midrange on his drives MUCH more often. Trae Young is another one who has been up there, and he uses his floater much more, thus avoiding contact and potential fouls."
Demar Derozan is the GOAT he just doesn't have the help he needs in SA!!!!!!
"Nah.  You traded **for** Demar Derozan and paired him with Aldridge like they were going to be some powerful 1-2 punch...only to miss the playoffs.  Lol. The player you picked to be the future...that Timmy passed the torch to...bailed on you and won a championship with another team.  Too bad Pop was so spiteful.  I can only imagine what Popovich would do with a group of players and picks like Zo, Ingram, Kuz, and Hart.  But, y'all turned that down for DeRozan.  But silver lining, NO liked our offer and saved us from the Kawhi headache and we got another championship out of it."
"When Demar Derozan is your first option, the fuck do you expect? Our team is booty cheeks and we are stuck on in the middle, it’s a tough place to be. Try appreciating greatness while it’s still there instead of being a wee pickle baby"
"From what I remember, Lakers refused to include Ingram which was kinda the deal breaker.  And the Spurs had no interest in Lonzo, since we have a ton of young guards already and didn't want to deal with Lavar's craziness.  So even a package of Randle+Kuzma+picks is probably not as good as what SA got from Toronto (DeMar+Poeltl+the pick that became Keldon Johnson)...and I say that knowing full well that DeRozan is no Kawhi and is probably leaving this summer."
"DeRozan gets a lot of shit for not being a three-point shooter, but I think he would thrive under LeBron. He had one of his most efficient years last season (despite not shooting threes) because he focused on driving to the hoop and getting to the line.  If they doubled off of DeMar, he'd be getting all he could eat in the midrange or going to the hoop."
"Lmao their team lacks 3-point shooting and spacing and they want to add DeMar DeRozan? I know that they need another creator, but my god, could their *be* a worse fit next to LeBron?"
Demar derozan and Jeff Teague
"I hear you, that's basically the doubt I had about what I said. I just really like DeMar DeRozan and so when I inserted myself as Kings GM I engaged in a bit of magical thinking to get him :)"
Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan didn't purposely derail their teams and destroy peoples dreams for their narcissist ego complexes.
The same courtesy we extend to Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan for publicizing the toll life has on their mental health should be extended for Kyrie. Mental health doesn't always manifest itself in a predictable way that's palatable for us to digest.
"Yer being both exceedingly harsh on his athletic ability and absurdly shortsighted, for some reason, on his developing skill set.  We don't rate prospects as high ceiling because they have 40% shooting and the footwork of DeMar DeRozan in iso coming out of school.  He's 20, and he was raw coming out.  He's been playing for the pistons.  At minimum he's flashed enough that you keep him for 2-3 more seasons next to cade to see whats up."
"No, I just think he's overrated. He constantly underperformed come playoff time. When the pressure was at it's highest he crumbled repeatedly. His team was the favourite in multiple series that he embarrassingly lost in his years with minnesota. Even his Celtics team should of won more than 1 title and he often talks as if they did. Damian Lillard has already done far more in the playoffs than Garnett did before his single Celtics title, so has Demar Derozan. So has Paul George. So have a bunch of others. It ain't just about LeBron I was just using him as an example because Garnett and Pierce have both made their media careers by shitting on LeBron."
I run into Horace Grant around town every couple of months. Met Kobe at his basketball camp. Ridiculously lucky that I knew the layout of UCSB and knew where the different gyms were at. Met Michael Jordan as an attendee of his basketball camp. Play against DeMar DeRozan and Javale McGee at that same camp.
Demar derozan? lol this article lost credibility the moment that happened
demar (derozan) is a great player
"Greatest in what sense? Best player to don a Raptors jersey? Because that’s Kawhi. But in the sense of best Raptor, I’d say DeRozan. Like when we talk about greatest Laker of all time, automatically it should be narrowed down to Kobe, Magic and Jerry West. Obviously so many other great Lakers who did great things for the Lakers but those three were drafted by and played their whole careers with the Lakers so they automatically beat Shaq, Wilt, LeBron, even Kareem. I know DeRozan got traded but he’s the first star in the franchise’s history who wanted to be a Raptor for life. The only one who didn’t steal away in the dead of night for greener pastures. THEY traded HIM and in many ways it was everything he built that opened the door for their title. Obviously he wasn’t good enough to win it himself but having him, and building that team around him, is what allowed the upgrade from him to Kawhi to make them a championship team. DeMar also played the longest in Toronto of any of their stars, has all the records, etc. So I truly believe he’s the GOAT Raptor, while Kawhi’s the best basketball player to wear a Raptor jersey. Vince is neither."
"You’re not.  According to you, making deep playoff runs with Hall of Famers aren’t reasons why a coach is an elite coach. Therefore, their accomplishments (according to your logic, not mine) are as follows:   Kerr: none  Pop: making DeMar Derozan a slightly better player  And that’s it.  Also, why does Kerr not get credit for his hand in the improvement of Steph, Klay *and* Draymond?  Also, why does Kerr not get credit for coaching a team to the finals before Steph became what he is?  Your logic is just inconsistent."
&gt; and Pop has had recent seasons where he’s turned Demar Derozan into the best version of himself yet with the increased playmaking  Doesn't this seem like a pretty low bar? Couldn't someone credit a portion of Curry's recent season to Kerr's system?
"He turned Demar Derozan into the best version of himself yet with his increased playmaking. That’s the kind of thing I want to see Kerr do, maximize a minimal amount of talent."
"Spoelstra has had recent seasons without Hall of Fame talent (unless you’re super high on Jimmy Buckets) and made a finals, the years without MJ in between dynasty’s were successful (Pippen’s a hall of famer but not for being the main guy, which is what he was forced to do then), and Pop has had recent seasons where he’s turned Demar Derozan into the best version of himself yet with the increased playmaking."
"Be me, 23-year-old Raptor fan, eh.      Wake up, get out of DeMar DeRozan jersey.      Get ready to Do My Job.      Put on DeRozan jersey.      Head to the Tim Hortons next to my apartment.      One down the road sucks, eh.      Order is wrong, whatever, DeMar says coffee is poison anyway.      Shoot the cup into the trash and yell “DEMARRRRRRR”.      Hop on the subway.      See a Cavs fan in the front car.      Yell “LeBron is leaving” as whole train chants “We the North”.      Tweet “LeBum is trash” on my iPhone 2.      Get to work, head into Tim Hortons.      Time to get to work, see someone wrote DeFrozen on the freezer door.      Just me, my co-worker and DeMar DeFrozen.      Most beautiful girl from York walks in. Solid 3/10, eh?      She's wearing a Vince Carter jersey and some strained yoga pants.      Ask to myself, who the fuck is that.      Realize I’ve only been a fan since 2014.      Fucking God’s Plan.      Get off work, take the subway home.      Stop into the ACC for a drink or twelve.      Fucking vendor cut me off after six beers. $108 dollars wasted.      Whatever, not even buzzed. Brampton blood.      Get to apartment, check messages.      Mom calls me and says three of my cousins were shot in Etobicoke today.      Less than usual, a good day.      Get out of DeMar jersey, put on 6 God jammies.      Check under bed for Paul Pierce      What the fuck, he's there.      Run to the kitchen, see dad sent me a cheque.      Go to open envelope.      Run to bank, teller says it’s fake and this is bank fraud.      Cops show up and ask how it all went down.      I call my dad and he picks up and says…      Hello this is LeBron James."
"I don't think the comment was that outlandish.  The level of skill, strategy, and athleticism was so much lower back then that it really is hard to consider guys who dominated back then on par with guys who dominate now.  I think 2000 is too recent a cut-off, but like, if you put a DeMar DeRozan-level player on some random team in 1982, he's probably going to win some MVPs."
So demar derozan?
"Chicago still is able to bring in all star caliber players. That's more than most other teams can say. Even if they aren't the LeBron/Durant tier players, they consistently have brought in All Star level guys since Jordan retired, despite being a middling franchise.  Anyone of Pau Gasol, Carlos Boozer, Rajon Rondo, Dwyane Wade, DeMar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic (trade) and Ben Wallace were all coming off of all star seasons and/or were still all stars in Chicago. They aren't the premier FAs but they are still star players and anyone of these FAs would be one of the biggest FA signings for probably 15 other franchises. These guys are all within a \~10 year span too. Chicago is definitely in the tier 2 of FA destinations, alongside the Knicks and maybe the Celtics &amp; Rockets. With tier 1 being Miami, LA, Brooklyn, Golden State.  IMO:  * Tier 1: Team location is a major driving force to signing there * Tier 2: Team location helps, but current team status is also important * Tier 3: Team location doesn't help or hurt FA signing (i.e. Atlanta, Denver, Dallas etc...) * Tier 4: Team location hurts, but team success can negate it (i.e. San Antonio, Milwaukee) * Tier 5: Team location is a big detractor for FAs (Utah, OKC)"
DeMar DeRozan
"The media literally voted him 3rd team, behind DeMar DeRozan *as a guard* in 2018. They only stopped with the *blatant* disrespect after the 2019 run when KD went down.  &gt; more than any star ever.  Babe Ruth, Ali, and MJ?"
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?  Top (potential) free agents were:         Kawhi (doesn't count; wasn't leaving)   CP3 (old)   John Collins   Kyle Lowry (old)   Mike Conley   Demar DeRozan   Devonte Graham       Other names:   Duncan Robinson   Lonzo Ball   Danny Green"
"&gt; I doubt that the bulls will be able to trade DeMar for similar value as what they traded away for him.  Yes. AKME and Donovan needs to do a lot of work to get DeRozan's value afloat. I'm not saying it's a guarantee they can do it. I'm just saying this is the best case scenario. And hoping there's a slightest chance they can sell DeRozan and get back at least a first rounder, after Zach inks his extension.   At least that's one of their goal IMO. They can't just let DeRozan walk away with them paying two firsts and two seconds."
"&gt; and keep LaVine  Yes!   This was the main reason why AKME throw everything they could. And very few people realize this. To be coming from a Spurs fan(and not a Bulls fan) is something I was surprised at.   I keep saying that Bulls give up two firsts and two seconds, because Thad Young is a walking late first round pick. Every contender would pay a late first for him. And I agree that's hell expensive just to acquire DeMar in free agency.   The plan was indeed to extend Zach. But they need to achieve it while building DeRozan's value. Because I expect AKME to sell DeRozan, right after Zach inks his extension. Donovan will have that challenge on how he uses DeRozan to succeed. Because the only way Bulls can get out of that DeRozan signing, is to build DeRozan's value and get back what they lost in that S&amp;T for him."
"DeRozan is not a floor spacer either though. If you want to run post ups for Vucevic, having DeMar on the floor won't help any more."
"IDK why so many people think the spurs have a chance at being the worst team in the league. We went 6-5 without DeMar this year, Patty played bad in the second half of last season, and we replaced Rudy Gay with Thad Young. I expect us to be only a few wins worse than last year.  We basically replaced Patty Mills with Bryn Forbes, Rudy Gay with Thad Young, and DeMar DeRozan with Doug McDermott. The biggest drop there is McDermott but he fits better with our roster, plus Derrick White missed half the season last year and he probably would've been our second best player last season if he was healthy."
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
"Masai Ujiri as Toronto GM: “You won’t be traded Demar.”  Demar DeRozan weeks after: ""I definitely was extremely hurt. I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't. I always made it clear that Toronto was where I wanted to retire.”  Lol. Clearly you’re not a lawyer. There’s a reason why there are land titles, employee contracts, and business contracts. Please don’t brandish substandard education."
Yeah cause Smart is the reason Boston didnt win a ring. And Fred carried the Raptors. Does that also mean that McCaw is better than DeMar DeRozan? Cause one got multiple rings

Most don't probably. These are people who have been the best of the best since they were kids and all the way til college. No way they think any differently... unless you're Demar Derozan in Toronto talking about Lebron
"Yeah there was a lot of justified skepticism around Wiggins' game once he actually got to Kansas that has kinda gotten lost over time. Never had a good enough handle where  you could just put the ball in his hands and have him get to the rim at will like purported, never really flashed much court vision, had clear defensive tools but never consistently got in a stance, never really played with much physicality or ""fuck you"" outside of that 42-point game. Because he was touted as a once-in-a-generation player at one point observers just kinda handwaved all these flaws and indicators that he was more DeMar DeRozan than some all-around talent. Sure if Wiggins was a gym rat he'd be a better player now but I agree with your point that he had a ceiling.  I feel the same way when people say injuries derailed Jabari's career. They certainly didn't help but at Duke people genuinely thought at one point he could just walk into the NBA putting up 20 a night as this Carmelo/Pierce-type iso player. I'm adamant that he never had that transcendent scorer upside to begin with (although I honestly didn't think his D would be as big of an issue as it was so not like I'm that good at talent eval either lol)"
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
"cause KD had to play against Dirk, Kobe, Duncan, Kawhi, Curry, CP3, Harden in the West while Lebron got to play Demar Derozan and Kyle Korver in the East"
"i've said it once and i'll say it again. the bulls aren't winning this year's championship. every player in their new core is unsuccessful in the playoffs and not known as a winning player, the most notable of them being demar derozan. as much as you'd like to think of demar as the key to your next title, i really doubt he can bring you there.   with that being said, good luck and i hope he can eventually help you to success. meanwhile i'll go back to my corner and root for a top 4 pick again."
Around demar derozan level (no bias and not hinting at anything)
"Not necessarily. When it becomes a regular thing for a player the team looks to move away, see: Ben Simmons, DeMar DeRozan in Toronto"
"So you want to lock in to the take that Fischer was the first one to report on all of the following:  - CP3 back to Suns  - Lowry S&amp;T to MIA - Dinwiddie to Washington  - Lakers want to S&amp;T Schroder to SAC for Hield  - Linking Richaurd Holmes, Demar Derozan, and Schroder to Chicago - Framework of Lonzo S&amp;T   And about 15 other reports? Because I don’t think he was the first to report at least 75% of those — his article is from 8/2 and most of these reports/rumors pre-date that. He may have confirmed those reports with his own sources, but giving him credit as the guy to break all of those reports seems a bit disingenuous."
"But dude, it’s not like DeRozan was a slightly below average performer that needed a small boost. He was genuinely putrid *all the time*. Career 50 TS% in the postseason.   The teammates argument also doesn’t make sense because demar isn’t a good off ball player. Having better teammates to take attention away doesn’t really benefit much when a player isn’t even capable of taking advantage of the decreased attention."
Mine is kind of the opposite:  I used to not like Demar Derozan but for some reason I feel like now he’s a player capable of leading a franchise to 4 straight champions and will finish as a top 20 player of all time
"I hate the eras argument. Honestly. It's low hanging fruit and at most half right.  The league had seen efficient perimeter offense exist in these slow, grimy, slugfest eras the league went through. The problem was people just didn't believe in it nowhere near as much as they should have. Larry Bird, Mitch Richmond, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Steve Nash even all were efficient perimeter shooters that had grown up and been coached away from the most efficient shot in their arsenal instead of being told to lean into it. There was an aura of purity to the game for the longest time, a rigid approach ""play the game the right way,"" so on and so forth. But these guys were prototypical modern superstars coached into decreased efficiency. I think it's fair to hold it against the prior generations that they just didn't do math. Because that's what it boils down to. They didn't like the math telling them to play the game a different way than what felt *correct*. We didnt fundamentally change how we measured efficiency in basketball. We figured out how to quantify it more thoroughly, but basketball has more or less the same baseline metrics for efficiency that it always has.  Do we have a higher volume of efficient perimeter superstars than weve ever had in our league? Sure. But I'd argue we're at a better understanding of the game for that to help inform who (and what) we should be looking for to set the baseline of efficiency. There are still guys with older games in the league today that fit that older ideation of the game, guys like DeMar DeRozan, DeAaron Fox, Russ is a great one for this category, Embiid without a doubt (though he's retrofit his game to live up to a modern standard of efficiency himself) all would be killing it if we were as rigid on our view of basketball in this age as we were in the 2000s.  I mean hell, look at guys like Kyle Korver, or Peja Stojakovic, or Chauncey Billups (even though he won a ring and is one of the most obvious Hall of Fame cases among retired players. I just learned that hes the only player in NBA history with a winning record against MJ, Kobe *and* LeBron). In their time they fulfilled very desired archetypes that exist today that I can directly correlate to a player currently playing that is seen as signficantly better than they were seen as when they were at their peaks. (Chauncey &lt;-&gt; Dame ; Peak Peja (I'm talkin '03-'04 Peja who put up 25 ppg on 48/40/92 splits)&lt;-&gt; Paul George, but mean of his prime Peja was probably more Tobias Harris; Korver &lt;-&gt; Duncan Robinson).  The variety of talent has always been there. And the fact that preferences have changed from the 2000s to today isn't some kind of counterweight that should devalue today's production and efficiency to spot older generations some slack. If they believed the game could be played the way it is today they'd have leaned just as hard into it in the mid 90s as they lean into it in this day and age. Hell, David Stern spent most of the 2000s praying for the league to produce a level of offense we see as routine today"
DeMar Derozan is not better than Zach Lavine.
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
"1. Steph has been more or less the same player since forever. He always knew his shot, motor, and handle were what he was best at and always predicated his game around those. He added some bulk, his execution has gotten sharper, but at the most basic level, he's the same player he was in college.  2. Mark Jackson's outdated ""offense"" had ""Steph do your thing"" in a priority somewhere below ""Harrison Barnes high post isolation"" and ""Iguodala/David Lee in-out game"". He was way too old-school to utilize Steph and Klay properly. Steph was just so good that he scored a ton anyways.  3. Popovich is one of the best coaches, in any sport, at using the talent at his disposal effectively (the latest example being DeMar DeRozan). He'd figure things out."
yo Pascal if you're reading this google Demar Derozan
[A quick Google search and the Oladipo story I came across first](https://thunderousintentions.com/2019/05/07/woj-bomb-shocker-okc-thunder-almost-traded-demar-derozan-instead-paul-george/)  *Edit [And here is a story on DDR for George](https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/raptors-approached-thunder-about-demar-derozan-paul-george-trade-last-season/b522kc5c3xjf1bmt1mw2lv6zr)
"I mean, given the context of this all being about trade value, Siakam today doesn't have to better than prime Demar to have more value than Demar did when he was traded. A) Demar was arguably not quite prime by the time he was traded, B) even if Siakam's not as good, he might have more trade value because he still has more potential for growth and development, and C) there's a fair argument to be made that they're comparable. While DeRozan was great, Siakam's defense just puts him to shame, and his tendency to always drop to complete isoball and pull up deep 2s whenever the pressure hit was imho overall detrimental to the team as a whole in a way that doesn't reflect neatly on a box score."
"Not OP but I feel like those kind of people who have potential but waste it always have a teammate they were just as good as who ends up making it. I know two like this, one was a football player whose teammate ended up making it as a WR in the NFL. Another played basketball and started on an AAU team that had Demar Derozan on it but got lazy and never even ended up going to college. At this level, they probably would have had a 5-10% of making it whereas average people like us would be closer to 1 in 500,000 or so."
Demar DeRozan calling Siakam right about now ....
Lebron winning the East is overrated when he stacked superteams in a weak conference where guys like Kyle Korver and Jeff Teague were All-Stars. the toughest opponent he had for several years was Demar Derozan
DeMar Derozan.
"he's in that demar derozan zone where he's probably around good enough to deserve a max salary, at least a few years back when he was younger.. but you're probably not gonna be happy about giving him one"
Demar derozan
My dude DeMar DeRozan :(
Demar Derozan
When Drake said my city love me like DeMar DeRozan he wasn’t lying
"We also have enough talent to stagger them.  Lonzo complements Lavine.  Derozan and Vucevic seem like a very natural fit, almost like Derozan and LMA on steroids.  All will likely close games, in which case Demar is probably our best playmaker.  I can see Lavine getting the ball in those situations as well."
DeMar DeRozan is a pretty good choice. He is THE current mid-range king imo
Demar Derozan will be more valuable to the Bulls than Lonzo.
Their streak ended because they had to trade Kawhi Leonard for freaking DeMar DeRozan lmao
Pascal siakam averages a triple double and the Raptors become the one seed and then crash losing in the first round to the 8 seed Bulls behind Demar Derozan averaging 36 ppg on 70% ts. He even hits six threes in the close out game.
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
"Wouldn't DeRozan in the half court be prioritized over Zo ?  For ball handling.  Zo is better in open court, transition and scrambled situations.  It seems demar took a couple of steps in playmaking recently with spurs ?"
"In 2021 does Compton mean anything anymore, seriously?  Does Demar DeRozan?.  Does Lonzo Ball?"
"DeMar DeRozan was and is my Kobe Bryant, my fucking idol"
That low center of gravity. Crazy how he's miles better defender then Toronto DeRozan despite DeMar being 6'7 long and athletic.
"I'm near Chino Hills (where Lonzo grew up) and also Lonzo's age, this is a bunch of BS lmao. Nobody I ever knew said they looked up to demar derozan, ever."
[Let's ask Long beach legend Vincent Staples](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vince+staples+demar+derozan)
He will for sure. Lavine will be amazing off ball with this team. Can't wait to see Derozan ball handling giving it off to Lonzo for a quick pass to either vooch for a 3 or a cutting lavine.   Lonzo will still be great for his passing but until his handles get better Demar should def be the main ball handler. Lonzo can be the guy to make snap decisions while Demar slows the game down.

Wasn’t Demar on Master P’s AAU team or something? I vaguely remember a Nickelodeon show with Lil Romeo and DeRozan on a travel team together.
God damn Wizards fan are haters. How were Lavine and Vucevic terrible together? And our third option went from Coby White to DeMar DeRozan. You think we’re going to get worse?
So are we just going to ignore the entire “Lonzo isn’t even an nba  level player” rant followed by him doubling down later in the thread to make the dumb claim that demar derozan and vuc are trash “empty stat players”.
"One thing that might factor in is that Harden didn’t go to high school in Compton, but in Artesia.  DeMar DeRozan not only grew up in Compton but went to Compton HS."
Man...kind of weird to think that Lonzo grew up watching DeRozan. I don't really think of DeMar as some wily old vet.
"He got a big contract from a team that has staked its future on empty-stats losers like Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and DeMar DeRozan. Plus Lonzo Ball, who doesn't even have the empty stats.  Believe me, the sadness is real. I'm from Chicago and I care about the Bulls as much as the Pelicans. This offseason I was overjoyed at the thought of the Pels getting rid of Ball so their good young guards would get to play.  But then Ball went to the other team I care about. Major bummer."

You say that like they don't have a 5 year window with this core. If they're really pushing for a ring Embiid is around the age most players start to peak (late 20s).  Five more seasons. At which point the injury prone Embiid will the same age Demar DeRozan is rn.  Granted. The options aren't great atm. I reckon they keep Simmons atm but trade him sooner rather than later in this 5 year stretch of what will likely be Embiids prime.

"Stockton, Nick Anderson, Demar Derozan, Chris Webber, Patrick Ewing"
"Tim Duncan and Robinson are probably the all time respectful duo. Timmy was just born like this and Robinson was really classy and has the military background to respect authority and only act within the rules. The way he carried himself he looks like a really friendly guy with a great smile you'd never wanna mess with.  Another current guy that comes to mind is DeMar DeRozan. Idk he's just really humble and friendly, helps opposing team's players up and discusses issues with the officiating calmly. Jokic is another guy I think is really respectful and doesn't swear etc. He's emotional with the refs but never in an aggressive or disrespectful manner."
"teams rarely win without a defensive anchor though. That quality of being able to be on the floor and dictate a top 10 defense is needed. The reality is lots of teams do have shooters (not nearly as good as Klay) but having glaring playmaking or defensive holes.  Denver with Murray, Porter, Jokic have tons of scoring but they really need someone to hold down the defense and help guard the elite wings since Porter is so bad defensively.  In Dallas, we have lots of shooters and if I was starting a team, I’d pick Klay in a heartbeat. But given what we have, Draymond elevates our team way more. Secondary playmaker and defensive anchor are our two glaring flaws.  Clippers would definitely take Draymond as they have like 5 40% 3 point shooters and no high level playmaker. They frequently play small as well and Draymond would be a perfect fit in what would become a dominant defensive lineup.  Chicago with a shooting 5 In Vucevic and 3 really poor defenders in Vuc, Lavine, DeMar could also take Dray, but I’d understand Klay because of the fit with Derozan.  Boston should also take Draymond since they struggle with late game iso ball and don’t have a playmaker. while they have good individual defenders, they aren’t great with team defense outside of Smart.  Minnesota has a logjam of all offense no defense players. Draymond is a perfect front court partner with KAT and they have solid spacing with their main players. They take Draymond for sure.  Some others are arguable as well including Phoenix and Indiana,but Clippers, Wolves, Nuggets, without a doubt would benefit more from Dray"
Chris Paul  James Harden  DeMar DeRozan  Karl Malone  DeAndre Jordan? Idk for this one
"Very interesting. I had this other unpopular opinion take on the trade, and that is I cannot fucking believe the raptors not only got Kawhi for derozan straight up in this trade, but that they ALSO landed Danny green in the deal and raptors only had to include jakob fuckin poetl.   Now of course there’s so many factors to consider, especially Kawhi’s value after he basically sat out all season and was on an expiring deal AND likely to leave after one season unless he was specifically traded to LA but I still feel like I can’t believe the raptors got him for so cheap. Kawhi is this all time great talent and while yeah Demar is a hell of a player is straight up not even close in comparison to Kawhi, and then you also get the Spurs 3 &amp; D ace in Danny green? that is just not a fair trade for me and I understand that the Spurs probably got the best deal they could I just felt like Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green is a LOT to give up for Derozan &amp; poetl"
"Jersey numbers shouldn’t be retired. Honor players in the same way by putting their Jersey in the rafters but let the players/fans determine whether they’re worthy to wear a number. If Demar Derozan wanted to wear 23 for the Bulls, let him, but he never would because the city would never let him live it down. But if he wanted to wear 10 because that’s obviously been his number, would Bulls fans go crazy over him wearing Bob Love’s number? Unlikely. Same reason nobody has wore 1 in Chicago. Likely paying respect to D.Rose but I’d imagine there will come a day when D.Rose is no longer playing that someone will wear 1 again… except for MCW who [learned his lesson](https://pippenainteasy.com/2016/10/18/michael-carter-williams-picked-no-1-didnt/ ) the hard way."
Demar Derozan has a True Shooting % of 49.7 during his playoff time with Toronto
DeMar DeRozan. He consistently placed last on his team in playoff plus minus for like 4 years despite being the best player.
If Dwayne Wade played in this Era he’d be Demar Derozan. It’s very clear Harden is the 3rd best SG all time even though he hasn’t won a championship.
I genuinely think there is zero chance if they had Casey and Kawhi they win. Casey was genuinely a very bad coach especially in the postseason and Nurse coached up that defense incredibly well. JJ Redick said it was the best defense in terms of rotation he'd ever played against it was like they all knew where to be at all times and I don't think Casey ever gets them to that point. Nurse and Demar probably looks more competitive in the postseason but Derozan was bad defensively and didn't stretch the floor and often underperformed in the playoffs I just don't see them going anywhere.
If Jamison makes it that definitely opens the bar for my man Demar Derozan since they will have very similar statistical profiles.
"No they didn't feel it because they were not nearly as good during Demars tenure when he was on the floor as they were when he was off. They were 19-4 that year or something similar without Demar or Kawhi that season, and won at a 60 win pace once Kawhi left. In other words he was quite replaceable. And of he was a difference maker he surely wouldn't have continued his trend of negative on/offs all 3 years in SA. The guy has a value over replacement player number of 19 in 22 NBA seasons. I challenge you to try and find another player you think of as highly as Derozan with a worse or similar career total who isn't in his 8th year in the league or less."
"&gt;You think lowry was celebrating when Masai called him to tell him derozan was packing his shit?   I think he was disappointed his friend was leaving but also happy that his chances of winning a championship increased dramatically. People aren’t black and white, they can be happy and disappointed at different aspects of a situation. I absolutely don’t believe that he regretted the trade.  It’s also not an accurate comparison considering Blake and his teammates weren’t as close as Lowry and DeMar.  &gt;I swear none of this sub has ever played a team sport, you supposed to die for your brothers on the court  I’ve played competitive sports my entire life you dork lol. I guarantee you none of your teammates would even consider dying for you."

How does adding Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball make this team that much better. They jump from the 11th to the 7th seed.
Ofcourse he is not untouchable. But to act like you are doing us a favour by taking Murray plus our upcoming future assets is bull crap. Nor is it a fair trade. In fact you guys have to package additional assets with Simmons if you want dejounte.  He was not known to be a lead ball handler when he was drafted but he was our 1B option after demar derozan and he did a fine job. That tells a lot about his development. And that's after losing a year to acl and another recovering from it.  He was I think around 7th or 8th overall in midrange FG % last season and that's not how you even begin to describe inefficiency.  So please.
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"That’s crazy, something similar happened with me for DeMar DeRozan"
"people generally use a lesser player with a similar playstyle. Instead of saying kobe, people will say ""demar derozan with better defense"" because it's a way safer comparison."
"DeMar DeRozan got a 2nd team *as a guard*, over Steph Curry no less. The media is sometimes just so full of ~~shit~~narrative when it comes to ~~the All NBA~~ voting."
"You’re not dreaming, during those years we couldn’t even get a FA meeting with Demar DeRozan"

"Their FO *was* so bad. This is an objectively wrong statement since they now have in trades and Free Agency gotten Lonzo Ball, Nikola Vucevic, &amp; Demar DeRozan plus others. People have clearly chosen to go there."
"That's a problem, yes Vucevic provides spacing, but Derrick Jones is an absolutely horrendous fit with Derozan. And I know Demar has played some 4 in San Antonio but you can't really do that against all the teams"
Demar derozan
Coaches *help win playoff series. They definitely deserve some credit. But the players are the biggest reason by far. I’d take a team of LeBron and AD coached by Luke Walton over a team of DeMar derozan and Tobias Harris coached by Greg Popovich.
Bro the bulls really paying demar derozan 25 mil to be a sixth seed first round exit to the sixers next year
&gt; 264) Demar DeRozan  😭
"You skipped right over the real mistake— kawhi was going to leave no matter what, but they shouldn’t have traded for Derozan.  And I love Derozan, but if you’re trading Kawhi freaking Leonard, you need multiple legit high upside, already rock solid young players. You need Jaylen Brown and lots of picks. You need Ben Simmons. You can’t just settle for demar Derozan."
"Probably the Celtics, in your head you might say the Raptors because they had the number one seed but I never bought and to DeMar DeRozan as that guy, with him it just comes off as if LeBron wasn't the boogeyman to him it would have just been somebody else"
"&gt; Except they’re only overrated by a specific set of criteria that most people, players and often front offices don’t share  Uhhh a lack of defense and floor spacing is exactly why there wasn't a ton of interest in a guy who's as good onball as derozan is.  &gt; But either way you can’t just move players down without as a result putting players over them. So what players do you think should be above guys like Demar Sabonis Ja fox etc  I mean I think sabonis and demar are pretty correctly rated. Maybe derozan should be rated a bit better but they're both in the correct range.  For ja and fox I'd just straight up moving them down (literally up) the list. Unless you're asking me specifically what I think about this list and which specific guys I'd have above and below them. Cuz that would take a lot of thinking."
"&gt; I’m not saying Demar should be excused. I’m saying this logic needs to be consistent.   ok fair  &gt; If Demar is the one player that’s ranked low because of it, it seems more logical to bust him up than boost everyone else down.  It absolutely does not lol, they should all be judged based off their actual ability/impact/scalability. If those guys are all overrated then that should be fixed, don't overrated derozan too."
Lmao at this getting downvoted  You know it's r/nba when people think that KD would lose to a team with DeMar DeRozan as their first scoring option
"The Spurs were the worst 3 point shooting team lol, and their best shooter came off the bench  I believe he’ll be the primary ball handler and with his playmaking ability that’s more than fine. The team will shoot better with him on the floor because of the gravity that comes with his offensive game  I don’t have the energy rn to get into the advanced advanced analytics to argue this  https://ontapsportsnet.com/2021/08/25/scouting-report-demar-derozan-fixes-the-chicago-bulls/ ^ here’s the article where I got the stat from earlier from, your concerns are answered here if you decide to read it"
"Forget 3s, if Simmons could just be like Demar Derozan and knock down consistent Jumpers in the MID RANGE, dude would be DANGEROUS. Kids (below 30) these days are obsessed with Curry and Dame's sharpshooting without realizing those 2 r EXCEPTIONS to the Rule!"

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
My point is that him sweeping the series should be expected if he's even close to the GOAT  DeMar DeRozan is literally the WORST high volume playoff performer of all time.....
"No, my point is just that there are probably like 5-6 players who could have won in the East if you gave them literally anything except the Process Sixers  The number 1 seed was led by DEMAR FREAKING DEROZAN, that's strong competition?"
"I just don't get the whole narrative around it  Shouldn't the second best player of all time BE EXPECTED to beat a team led by Victor Oladipo, DeMar DeRozan, or 19 year old Jayson Tatum who averaged 14 PPG that season, providing that his supporting cast isn't literally the Process Sixers(which they weren't?)  I've literally seen people bring his run up to say ""LeBron would have beat the Bucks this year/qualified from the playoffs in the West"" as a way to bash Durant or Curry but WHEN did LeBron beat a guy as good as Giannis all on his own, OR make the playoffs in the West with a horrible supporting cast(he tried to and failed in 2019?)"
I’m even more upset by the disrespect to Derozan. Dubious starter? How many teams would Demar not be at least the 5th best player on? And how does he go from a consistent 4 wins above replacement the past 3 years to suddenly less than one?
"Calling him an average playmaker and average defender is a bit.  He is basically the same level of playmaker as a Kent Bazemore type, and statistically he is the worst defender on the Warriors.   Despite being on a good defensive team he has a -3.0 DRaptor (Lou Williams, DeMar DeRozan, DLo Russell territory), a -1.4 DBPM (same as CJ McCullom, Joe Harris).  He is a promising young player with potential to improve, but he isn’t average at playmaking or defence yet"
For a star level player:   Demar Derozan  For a superstar level player:  Russell Westbrook or Patrick Ewing  For a top 20ish type player:  Karl Malone
"Jimmy Butler was homeless after his mother kicked him out at the age of 13. It is amazing that he survived, let alone play in the NBA.  Carmelo Anthony grew up in the projects in Brooklyn with a single mother and had a rough upbringing.  DeMar Derozan grew up in Compton and definitely saw/went through some wild shit."
"The Chicago Bulls may have recently brought in a lot of elite new talent (DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso) to the already promising squad of Zach LaVine, Patrick Williams and Nikola Vučevič, but I think it will take some time for them to establish chemistry and flow well together. Also, we need a good Center. I wanna be hopeful for their upcoming season but I also have to be realistic."
"&gt;It says people who shoot a low percentage on 2pt shots shouldn’t shoot them.  I'm cool with that. Because it focuses on players who spend too much time shooting 3ptrs, so they lost touch with the essence of the game/forgot how to make 2pt shots. Nonetheless your correct statement is independent of and, irrelevent to, the fact that MIL PHX LAC all had great midrange games during the 2021 playoffs. The Bucks won a chip off of their players' midrange game, and not their 3pt game.  That success was saw from them, is going to cause other teams to look more to midrange masters for their success. Just like CHI did, by signing Demar Derozan.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Morey was more than happy to have CP3 shoot midrange shots because he shoots them at a high percentage  That has nothing to do with your praise of advanced stat guys, who oft frown upon players like CP3 putting the midrange game before the 3pt shot."
Demar &gt;&gt; Bosh   It's not just about their skill as a player. Demar embraced the city more than Bosh Ever did.  I think only Lowry/Derozan get retired though
"Demar DeRozan executed a very similar dunk in 2011. [Can see it here. Kenny even gives it the nod of approval.](https://youtu.be/8HPvkBGtHPc)  Edit: on another view, it's basically the same dunk except he attacked from a higher angle. [Here it is in slow motion.](https://youtu.be/Lyab8xaTlzg) One of my favorite dunks of all time."
Don't forget [Blue Santa suit DeMar Derozan](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRqinh0XcAAt5oE.jpg:large) and [Gang Sign John Wall](https://youtu.be/lalTJ5XJRW8)
"We are only two seasons removed from 2018 (considering he missed 19) where Cam threw for 3400 yards, 24 touchdowns, 13 INTs on 68% completion, and rushed for an additional 500 with 4 TDs. That's basically Baker Mayfield from last year, with 300 yards more rushing and a better completion percentage.  That was Cam's highest completion % for his career, tied for 2nd most TDs in his career, lower than average INTs, and his second highest QBR (icky). and probably his best overall year of his career except for his MVP year which just looks like an insane outlier in comparison.   I think maybe the issue is that people are looking at that 2015 year and assuming that was kind of how he was playing for a few years there, but he wasn't. That year Cam had 11 TDs more than his next best year, tied for the lowest INTs, the most yards he threw for since his first 2 years in the league, and the second most rushing TDs he ever had.   If you take out that year from the equation then his ""prime"" lasted until he got to NE which was a terrible fit for him. Every year was wildly similar to each other. The only thing that was different in Carolina year by year was the team around him, not really Cam at all when healthy.   I think we are both overrating how good Cam was outside of that 2015 year, and underrating the consistency he had up until he got knocked out in 2019.   I think the best comp for Cam might be DeMar DeRozan in that sense. Had that stellar 2018 year and then everything else around it is just, like, the same. Other guys in that same mold are Arenas (though his career was entirely derailed due to injury, not the teams around him or anything else), Jermaine O'Neal (3rd in MVP in 04-05), Bob McAdoo, and Willis Reed.  If that Panthers team stays together, Olsen is healthy, Peanut is healthy, O-line stays healthy, running backs stay healthy, Benjamin doesn't eat himself out of the NFL, I think we would probably have a much different view on Cam. He would probably still be in Carolina too. Though, the injuries may have caught up to him by now because a guy in his 30s who took some of the most insane hits during the year probably isn't recovering like he used to. Still, I wonder how he would have done if he went anywhere other than NE considering the last healthy Cam we saw, again, had his 2nd best season of his career individually with a pretty shitty team.  * Also there exists the rumor that the Denver Broncos in 2015 broke Cam Newton mentally and he didn't recover from that. Not sure if there's any validity to that but if that's the case maybe Cam is Paul George or a supercharged Nick Anderson."
"That's not true at all. When DeMar DeRozan came into the league his biggest weakness was ball handling. He would constantly dribble the ball off his foot and because of that, had a super limited offensive game. Fast forward years later and he has one of the best footwork and midrange game in the league."
Anthony “a guy that got dunked on by Demar Derozan and Amare Stoudamire” Tolliver
If we had maxed him this offseason then we don't get DeRozan. Instead of extending his contract we decided to sign DeRozan and then just re-sign LaVine at the end of this year when he's an actual free agent because we get his deal on top of the DeMar one
So the demar derozan led raptors wouldn’t be relevant here either
"I think that everyone loves Boban. So it makes sense that Luka wants to feed him the ball to help him make more money.  I think they’ll eventually buy out dragic because dragic doesn’t want to play there. It’s not like Simmons where he has 4 years on his deal. It’s expiring. They’ll try to trade him, and either someone else will buy him out, or Toronto will buy him out. Then he will maybe sign with y’all or really chase the chip.  I was surprised that coaches didn’t blitz Luka more during the olympics. Force the other dragic to beat them. They had some other good shooters, but I feel that it wouldn’t be a big deal.  Keldon will be another year bigger, stronger, smarter, and confident. I hope he’s worked on his defense tho. If he can be a decent defender then he’ll be amazing this year.  Primo seems to be a legit pick. I think everyone was worried at first, but apparently primo had a really great combine and that helped his stock a lot. Primo sacrificed for his team at Alabama, and that probably hurt his stock some. But primos shot is pure. That seemed to immediately translate in summer league. Primo also didn’t look totally lost on D, but that’s against summer league players. Pop prob won’t play him for at least 2 years unless he’s averaging 30 in the g league or something crazy. So really next year we will see how he does. The story I heard from an agent interview that primo noticeably improved from the end of the college season. Hopefully primo continues to improve his pg skills and learns the spurs offense. In that same interview primos agent said that primos bones showed they might still grow, so he could get taller. If primo gets to be 6’8 even then he’s an amazing pick. We want to “tank” this year, so maybe primo gets some run with us in garbage time. I hope we go back to our 2014 offense with demar and Aldridge gone, but Dejounte may have picked up some bad habits from derozan.  My hope is that all the young guys take a leap with demar and Aldridge gone and they finally stop being afraid to miss or make a mistake. Pop will still hold them accountable, but they will be able to do whatever they want offensively. I think that this will help Lonnie and white the most. They always seemed to be afraid of upsetting demar, or were in awe of demar. They just gave the ball to demar at the end of games and ran away. I hate that offense. Too easy to read and defend. Demar was not that great at hitting those “Jordan/hero ball” shots. I’d have rather he drove in the lane and kicked it out for a 3. Lonnie is actually really good at that and hopefully he can find his finishing too. He lives up to his sky Walker nick name. For whatever reason he just doesn’t have that killer instinct to finish at the rim/ destroy people. Keldon and Dejounte have a little too much of that and I worry that they’ll be dominating the ball and taking shots from Lonnie/white/ vassell. We have so many players that might take a leap. Samanic, our Luka, has the size, handles, confidence, and shot. He just needs to get minutes to see if it translates all the way. He’s my sleeper for you to watch that many ppl haven’t seen play. This year, especially if we trade Thad young, samanic will get some good pt. And I’d like to trade Thad for a pick, but we do need a reliable 4. The fit next to the non-shooting Poeltl will be tough tho.  Which hidden gems should I watch for on the mavs?"
"Hot take, but I think DeRozan will be better on the Bulls than LaVine this year.  Lonzo and DeMar is actually a pretty nasty duo and I think adding so many big players is going to take the ball out of LaVine's hands.  I'm really excited to watch how this Bulls team goes!"
Lmao. No offense but 32 year old Demar Derozan isn’t  a star free agent.  And like you said PG resigned after being traded which is completely different. He also bailed after a year. It kind of says it all when that’s the best two examples you have.
"did they really, when they could have not given him that contract and then tried to use that cap space then to find better help for Beal? of course they didn't expect him to tear his shit up at fuckin home lol   also as bad as the Rockets were last year, I still feel like John Wall has great vision and will be very important to the development of KPJ and Jalen Green. both of those guys are lead guards who are primarily bucket getters. he'll both elevate their shots with his transition passing and I think at this stage of his career he's open to being a good vet for them.   despite what people think of, say DeRozan, he's been really huge for the development of a guy like DeJounte Murray, who went from a zero offense defense first guard to one of the five most efficient mid range iso scorers in the league last year. largely using moves I can clearly see he developed with DeMar. same goes for his passing, because he never looked much good at that before last season either. I think John Wall might be more beneficial to keep around while they're bad than some realize."
Harrison Barnes &gt; Demar Derozan
"I interpret this list as players who you feel obligated to pay because you don’t want to lose them for nothing, rather than players on obviously bad contracts like John Wall.  G: Ben Simmons G: Chris Paul F: Demar Derozan F: John Collins C: Jonas Valenciunas"
"I feel confident the Bulls will be a playoff team this year. My only concern is that they sacrificed draft picks and cap flexibility to win now with 32-year-old DeMar DeRozan and 30-year-old Nikola Vucevic, who are fine players but aren’t LeBron and AD or Durant and Harden.   They are gambling hard on major improvements from 26-year-old Zach LaVine, 23-year-old Lonzo Ball and 20-year-old Patrick Williams. It sounds to me like a playoff team, maybe even a second round playoff team, but not an Eastern Conference Finals team."

There's a bigger gap between Jordan and Kobe than there is between Kobe and DeMar DeRozan.
Says the guy comparing Michael Jordan to Demar Derozan lol...
"You know how they got Tim Duncan, right? Plus, they had All-Star LMA and All-Star DeMar DeRozan after Kawhi left"
"I'd enjoy watching a dude break 100 pts in a game, especially Dame, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, or De'Aaron Fox (last one is definitely bias on my part). Maybe Steph, but that's a lot of 3s. I wanna see a 3 level scorer who will utilize all 3 levels to get past 100"
Yes. If Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan can knock on the door of an NBA finals then a deep team around Tatum and Brown should be able to compete for a title. The problem for Boston is that it is very very hard to accumulate 10 solid rotation caliber players.
"It would be Booker, but the game has changed.  Kobe’s style isn’t a thing anymore, only DeMar DeRozan is stubborn enough to try.  If Kobe were coming up now, he’d be raining 3’s hitting close to 40% on high volume."

"The league has plenty of players that out up similar numbers to BI: Gordon Haywood, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, caris lavert, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavigne, Tobais Harris..."
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, supported by Evan Turner, Steven Adams, and Robin Lopez"
"A MJ type player in today’s NBA would be a rich man’s version of prime Demar Derozan. A Steph type player in MJ’s era would be more in the mold of Steve Nash, they’d still be All Star level but they wouldn’t have nowhere near the freedom on offense that they have in today’s NBA. I think both players would be successful in the others era but they wouldn’t become as iconic as they are in their own era"
Easily Demar Derozan with league average 3pt shooting.
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Masai Ujiri doesn’t give an eff about Toronto, traded city favourite derozan, homegrown valenciunas and Poetl to win one chip and claim his legacy…Toronto fans would’ve loved him even more if he’d been patient, kept the team together and let pascal/oG/Fred/norm develop with Demar and Kyle and serge and JV and Jakub…oh shit that’s a potential juggernaut for years to come, perfect team, would compete for championships for years, a lot of drafted talent, the city would adore them   Instead you get a one off chip lead by a guy who didn’t love the city and peace’s with barely a goodbye, a chip where the finals mvp won’t have his number retired, I’d almost call it meaningless and lightly embarrassing for the city   Eff Masai, he doin’ the tdot dirtier than VC"
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
Isaiah Thomas with League Average Height  Demar Derozan with a league average 3
"I have a few  If Jordan played today he’d be a bald Demar Derozan who played great defense  Harden is the most skilled SG of all time and in my eyes is better than Wade all time  Draymond Green is a generational talent  The 2016/2017 Warriors would destroy any team you put in front of them in a 7 game series   Any version of the Warriors from 2016-2018 would run the 90s Bulls off the court  Ivesson was overrated   Tim Duncan is a Top 7 player all time and should be rated higher than Kobe.   Durant would beat any player ever 1 on 1  Prime Westbrook is better than Prime Rose  Any team Lebron played in the Finals was tougher than any team Jordan faced and Jordan wouldn’t have won any Finals series on any of Lebrons teams that lost except that Mavs series in 2011. Jordan would have lost in 2016, and I believe only Lebron could have pulled off the win given the circumstances.   Many if not most of Wilts feats are exaggerated or fake"
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"Man, if Demar Derozan had a decent 3 point shot and actually took some 3s he would be amazing."
"Except he is a threat to shoot. He’s not a 3pt shooter but Markelle does have a mid range shot and a pull-up game that he can and has shown the ability to easily get to. At this point it’s just a matter of getting reps and consistency to raise his %’s from there. His last healthy season in 2019-2020 nearly 50% of Markelle’s shots came from floater range to the deep mid range. He shot ~42% from floater range, shot 49% from deep 2 and 40% from 10-14 feet. On top of that on NON pull up 3-pt attempts he shot 45%. He doesn’t have to work hard to get to his spots he gets there pretty easily on the contrary due to his ball control and ability to change pace whether it be off a standstill, on the move, in transition or off a pick.    &gt;theres a reason why he barely scores and on such bad efficiency.  His last fully healthy season he averaged ~12ppg which is slightly higher than league average. He wasn’t averaging more simply because he can’t score it’s due to his FGA ( Orlando has FOUR other players averaging 12+ FGA/g) and his lack of 3pt and FTr which I mentioned before. Markelle Futlz can score. His efficiency isn’t bad, the advanced efficiency stats where the 3pt shot is heavily skewed in favor of is where his stats look bad. He’s a great finisher at the rim and can get there at ease, serviceable in the floater range and a good pull up shooter, if he took the DeMar DeRozan or Ben Simmons route and ONLY shot in spots where he felt comfortable he’d be posting splits of like 51/0/73 on like 58 TS%.   &gt;The change of pace style he plays with only works if you’re a threat to pull up, and he just isn’t.  That’s the thing, he is a threat to do that and there’s numbers and tracking data to back it up."
Demar spoke about it in the Toronto Star and Love was soon after in the players' tribune  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22672925/demar-derozan-grateful-inspired-kevin-love-discuss-mental-health
How you stop there. DeMar Derozan was the next player taken and then it drops off.
"It was just one of the very first instances I can remember of a high profile athlete(a man no less) speaking out about mental health and people actually taking it seriously, then I think Demar Derozan opened up not too long after? I think I’m remembering that correctly. Love is undoubtedly, in my mind at least, a trailblazer for mental health in sports."
&gt; Jordan in today's league would be just like demar derozan  found Stephen A Smith's new First Take partner
So people who shoot 84% from the line and are good mid range shooters will then be great 3 point shooters if they grew up in this era....like Demar Derozan right?
Now if they can get him to perform the fusion dance with Demar Derozan they'll have one complete wing player
If the Kings developed him properly I feel like he would have been able to attain a level and role akin to DeMar Derozan on the Spurs. A big guard who can score and be the primary playmaker when his team needed him to.   Kings could’ve been low level contenders if we just developed everyone properly. From 2009 to 2011 Kings drafted what could’ve been a nasty starting 5.   PG: Isaiah Thomas  SG: Tyreke Evans  SF: Omri Casspi  PF: Demarcus Cousins  C: Hassan Whiteside
I think he was always getting injured once the playoffs came around. Derozan shitting the bed in the playoffs also made things worse for Lowry. Raptors were failing year after year in the playoffs because demar was getting locked down by guys like Otto porter and Jr smith lol. Also Lebronto.
"Simmons starts with Embiid + 3x 40% 3p shooters and managed to only average 6.9 assists per game last year, which was 15th in the league tied with Demar DeRozan, a predominantly iso scorer with no strong scoring options around him. That is so bad dude.  Half court offense is the most valuable thing, transition is basically just a regular season concept. The game slows down so much in the playoffs and especially in the 4th quarter, the reason why the sixers are so bad in 4th quarters is because he is useless when the game slows down."
"I think he's overrated, but I'm happy to admit I am probably underrating him.  He's a very good scorer (but not quite elite), who doesnt provide much else offensively or defensively, and has quite the injury history. He's also getting paid 100M over the next 3 years.   A lot of people thinks the Bulls overpaid Derozan for 85/3yrs, but even with him being 3 years older, I would much prefer Demar on that contract than CJ on his.  Can CJ be the 2nd offensive option on a championship team- maybe. But he can't be your 2nd best player (including defence). It would very much be situation specific. We've seen that you cant be a contender with him alongside an elite PG if you're not getting defence from either. He would probably work really well alongside an elite 2-way wing or big man, but you would need to make up the defence and playmaking from elsewhere on the court"
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"Demar Derozan is a career 28% (which is awful) 3pt shooter, and has never shot higher than 33% (still below average) in any season of his career, so I'm not sure why you're using him as an example of a midrange specialist developing a three point shot. If anything, he's a clear example that being good at midrange shooting does not guarantee that a player will also be able to develop a serviceable three point shot, and he kinda represents a scenario where MJ doesn't excel at three point shooting even in an era that emphasizes it."
"Yeah, but Hamilton went to the Piston and played the same role. He was a low usage player because that was his game. He was almost exclusively an off ball player. That’s why the team dealt him for Jerry Stackhouse, so Jordan’s usage could go down and his efficiency could go up. But Stack was shooting pretty horridly that year and couldn’t be the guy. So who else on the Wizards would warrant usage over Jordan? Ty Lue? Kwame Brown? Brendan Haywood? C’mon now.   This is why it’s important to have seen things in context. Stats don’t tell the story. Jordan was the only reliable option on a trash ass team who’s supposed running mate was shooting 40% from the field. So MJ had the ball in his hands a lot and he was 39 years old, so his overall TS% was average-ish. The point remains that Jordan in his younger years wouldn’t be the least bit bothered by zone defense. Like, it doesn’t stop Demar DeRozan now. Sure as hell wouldn’t stop Jordan."
I love me a wholesome DeMar DeRozan post. One of my my all time favorites.
DeMar DeRozan. Serge Ibaka.
"DeMar DeRozan is an all-time RAPTORS great. He gave the franchise everything he had, and I doubt the fans will ever forget, or take for granted the ""don't worry, I got us"" tweet. He wanted to be there, and he wanted to win - it's not all about winning titles.  He earned the privilege of being the last Rapor to wear the number 10"
I don’t care at all about Derozan’s numbers. He earned a place in the Raptors pantheon by being one of the best ever team culture guys that we have had.   Demar WORKED and got better every year. He had swag. He was always positive and wholesome. He WANTED to be here. He took us from trash tier to legit competitors in the east. He had fun. He grew as a leader. He was a legit all star talent who got respect from everyone in the league.   Demar DeRozan was the best thing to happen to Raptors culture maybe ever…until Lowry showed up and the two of them took it to the next level.   He absolutely deserves to have his jersey retire.
"HiS nUmBeRs  oh my GOD give me a break. Nowadays people are blinded by their statistics and can't watch what's happening before their eyes. Do you really think people are going to argue about his *fucking numbers* in *a hundred* years? Everything will look different, as things look different than they did 25 years ago (let alone 100 are you serious). Those of us who were aware and conscious during this time have an understanding of the context and *history* of Demar DeRozan and Toronto basketball, and people in the future who aren't spazzing out about nUmBeRs will have an appreciation for the context and history 25 and 100 years prior as well."
"Oh, people think raptors fans are debating this?  Lowry will get his, then DeRozan, and then Vince will get his.  The only reason Vince hasn't gotten his yet is because he can't get his before Kyle and DeMar."
"Great points and good info.  Would you say the best comparison of play style is Demar Derozan in today’s game? And he isn’t even really that dominant around the ring, right? And he doesn’t have the defensive skill of Jordan either.  But Demar is still a very good player and he was able to develop a 3-point shot. I think it’s fair to say that MJ would too, given his determination to win. That’s not to say that he would love it, though. Given these statements he’s probably happy he played in the era he did, I mean why wouldn’t he? :)"
"Welp that’s a completely different thing than it seemed like you were arguing previously so okay let’s see. I mean as someone who’s rooting for this team, when we were originally going for the buddy hield trade instead of Russ and it was rumored the next move was Demar sign and trade to the Lakers,,  I personally would have gone the Derozan/Buddy route all day so I’m not totally against what you’re saying. But let’s be real, neither are really meant for today’s game and both would be way better 20 years ago."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"&gt; I also find it particularly ironic given DeRozan's status in Toronto - there is no player in the league more stubborn and illogical about refusing to fix their relatively fixable flaws.   Looool, DeRozan was definitely trying. His form just doesn't extend well beyond midrange. DeMar actually has a pretty good work ethic, it's just that not everyone can shoot great."
If Demar derozan a scrub then so was Kyle lol trash BROS
"Demar DeRozan. Old heads in Toronto might have memories, but the general population unlikely."
"Demar Derozan, black &amp; white has been a key part of all 3 teams with red a prominent part or 2 of the teams jerseys"
"&gt;	the Spurs woulda been drafting in the top 5 the last 2 seasons without DeMar  And therein lies the problem. DeMar Derozan gets you from 20 wins to 35 wins. You could have a team that is accumulating draft capital, but instead you have a team that is barely missing the playoffs. No playoff success, no young talent to hope for. Just kicking the can down the road for X years.  I would not personally pay $25m/year for that player."
Demar DeRozan has a history of choking in the playoffs.  Vuc has never seen real contention.  Neither has Lonzo.  The biggest question is if LaVine can be the best player on a championship team.  I'm with you.  LOOOOOTS of questions.
"Jesus fuck no one's contesting how good Demar is.  DeRozan is 32 is on the decline. The players they would get from LA are young, on the same timeline as Murray, and on the rise. Ingram is the clear cut star, Hart would be a great 3 and D for them. Lonzo and Kuzma might just be trade pieces.   Point is that Pop chose to fuck the Lakers over in favor of short term gains...a gamble that didn't even pay off because they were a fringe playoff team at best.  If they chose the Lakers package those players are either gonna fit Pop's long-term views or be great trade pieces.  Now DeRozan, Aldridge, Mills, and Gay are gone and the Spurs got McBuckets and Zach Collins? Lmao."
"Demar Derozan has been being perpetually criticized for bad playoff games and inefficiency like 10 years. Ben has a looong way to go to catch him.  Now, this might be the biggest narrative turn I’ve seen, because it flipped on him really fast."
"Well.. does a pairing “work” if they make it to the ECF twice and have some good regular seasons? By that logic the Derozan-Lowry pairing “worked” and trading Demar for Kawhi was pointless. I realize Tatum/Brown are younger than Lowry/Derozan were, but it’s a little early to say the pairing is too good to be broken up. Especially if the guy you’d get back is Luka Doncic."
"what in the fuck yes he did  his biggest competition the past few years in the east was a teenage jayson tatum, demar derozan, kyle lowry, victor oladipo, and a young paul george  you gotta be smoking nuts to think he wasn't in the absolute weakest conference all those years  plus on top of that the dude would get to the finals and LOSE to the western team more times than not"
"I think it just further reinforces the fact that poverty breeds more mental health issues and sadly Detroit is and has been a pretty poor metro for a while now. I made this post mainly as a joke, and I’ll poke fun at some of the weird things some of these dudes did, but at the end of the day for most of the people that have been named here they clearly have mental health issues and it’s a good thing that people like Kevin Love and Demar Derozan talk about that shit now and hopefully it can lead to people being in better situations in the future."
"So hard to know.  What do the Sixers want?  How does Masai feel about Simmons?    I've given up on prognosticating trades, the Kawhi to the Raptors deal was the last straw.  Even as news was breaking I was skeptical.  ""No chance Pop would trade Kawhi and Danny Green for some replaceable big and Demar Derozan.  The Spurs would be lucky to crack .500 with that lineup!"""
I don't get why people make a weird deal about this stuff. It's not someone's opinion it's based on a combination of historical data and statistics and for every Kevin Durant you get a Russell Westbrook and Demar Derozan that it absolutely nails.
"&gt; You’re wrong.  No, you! (See, we can both play that game).  &gt;A good shooter or even a great shooter doesn’t need to shoot from deep.  A good shooter doesn't. A great one definitely does.  &gt;Booker for example is an average deep shooter but is an elite mid range shooter.   Yes, and on the offensive end, that's his main weakness.  &gt;Jokic is an elite mid range shooter  He's also a 39% shooter from 3, but again, that is his one ""weakness"" on offense, yes.   &gt;Rose has a killer mid range, DeMar DeRozan eats off the mid range  Not exactly GOAT caliber players here.   &gt;Leonard is an elite mid range shooter  And also a 40% shooter from 3.   &gt;McCollum eats in the mid range.  And also a 40% shooter from 3.   &gt;You literally just said KG wasn’t a great shooter. KG, one of the mid range shooters of our time. You’re really showing your age by saying he wasn’t a good shooter.   I'm older than you. You shouldn't assume people who disagree with you are 1) kids or 2) idiots. It's an unflattering degree of arrogance.  &gt;We literally just saw the mid range be the reason 2 teams went to the Finals and you’re saying some of the best mid range shooters ever need to change their game?  The Bucks were 5th in the league in 3PT FG% and the Suns were 5th. They're both *very good* shooting teams.   &gt;Did you even watch the Finals? The mid range is as important as any shot to win the championship  Yes, it is, because it is the shot you *get the most often*. Because analytics very clearly proves it to be the least valuable shot. So when you're planning defensively, if you have to give up a shot, you want that to be the long range two.   &gt;Dirk was not comfortably above 40% for his entire peak. The year after winning MVP he shot 35% from deep. He only had 5 years where he shot 40+ from deep. So he shouldn’t make your cut if we’re using your logic of having to shoot 40% from deep to be a great shooter. That’s your logic.   That is.   &gt;Bruce Bowen. Multiple years of shooting 40% from the free throw line while being an elite 3+D player.  Did you just call Bruce Bowen a fucking *great shooter*? He's a fucking role player.   *Man, I wonder who I would take in a fantasy draft, LeBron James or Bruce Bowen.*  - Nobody ever.  He also had **one** year of shooting 40% from FT, and he got to the line roughly **once per game** for his entire career.   &gt;You have shown you don’t know your history of the game  We're not talking about the history of the game, we're talking about the modern NBA. You know, the era where analytics made its entry into the league and showed everyone that you want to shoot from two places on the court, and two places only. Under the basket, and beyond the line.   &gt;and you overvalue the 3 ball and want everyone to shoot the 3  No, actually, you greatly undervalue it. And science proves you wrong.  &gt;Thanks for showing you don’t know what you’re talking about  Ditto."
"You’re wrong. A good shooter or even a great shooter doesn’t need to shoot from deep. Booker for example is an average deep shooter but is an elite mid range shooter. Jokic is an elite mid range shooter, Rose has a killer mid range, DeMar DeRozan eats off the mid range, Leonard is an elite mid range shooter, McCollum eats in the mid range.

Sasha Pavlović is another player who was a good 3 point shooter who shot in the 40’s% from the free throw line a few times. And than there’s a ton of players who shot great from 3 but shot in the 60’s% from the line.   You have shown you don’t know your history of the game, you don’t hold the same beliefs for all players, and you overvalue the 3 ball and want everyone to shoot the 3. Thanks for showing you don’t know what you’re talking about"
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."
"Over a small sample size the stat is effectively meaningless.   Moreover, true shooting doesn't take volume or degree of difficulty into account.  Player A only catches and shoots, but does so at 60% true shooting. He's a complementary scorer.  Player B actually creates his own shots as a first option, and his total TS% is 55%. However, he shot at a 63% TS% on pure catch-and-shoots if you isolate just that shot type.  Player B is not only a better scorer, but probably a better pure shooter as well. He just has the added burden of having to create his own shot and take more difficult shots.  As a result, you get nephews on r/nba saying that Otto Porter is actually a better scorer than DeMar DeRozan because Porter had a TS% of 60.2% one year and DeRozan's TS% was only 55.5% that year. Extreme volume scorers often have lower TS%, guys like Kobe, Iverson could have much higher TS% if their volume was cut down even a little bit  True Shooting % is a fine means - but shouldn’t be the only means - of looking at efficiency over a whole season, a whole playoff run. But for one or a few games, it’s effectively meaningless. And, you should only compare TS of two players with similar work loads on offence"
"Jabari Parker, DeMar DeRozan, Melo, Felicio when he was in the league, Drummond,"
"Brandon ""DeMar DeRozan"" Ingram"
CJ McCullom isn’t even more than DeMar DeRozan.   What are you talking about?
"Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for Demar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, a first, and cash considerations has to be one of them."
"There's a trade that's talked about but not enough, IMHO. That's Demar Derozan, Jakob Poetl, and a 2019 FRP for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.   At the time of the trade, DDR was (rightfully) viewed as a negative value contract. He bounced back a bit on the Spurs but he also locked them into the treadmill of mediocrity. Poetl was intriguing and has evolved into a defensive anchor for the Spurs but isn't exactly a world beater out there. Danny Green is still one of the league's better 3&amp;D players, and Kawhi was (and is) an MVP-caliber player in his prime. Yes, he had one year left on his contract and was widely rumored to be interested in going to LA, which of course was 100% true. He was also done with San Antonio, and that forced their hand. However, they almost certainly had better offers on the table.   Overall, it was an absolute steal for the Raptors. Naïve observers saw that the Raptors got an All-Star back for Kawhi and were happy, but the correct move (in terms of winning a championship in the future) was to trade for more assets rather than chasing the 8 seed with an aging Demar Derozan. That trade happened in 2018, and the Spurs have finally accepted the invetiablity of rebuilding. Instead of having 3 years to tank, get more assets, and build a new core, they spent that time missing the playoffs or getting gentleman's swept by the Steph-less Warriors. Yes, Popovich probably didn't want to tank. At the time, there were rumors that DDR was basically a going-away present to Pop so he could retire without the bad taste of a ruined season. However, he's still the coach now, so that basically amounted to nothing. That draft pick ended up being Keldon Johnson, so time will tell how much that pick was worth. At 29th tho, the value of the pick before it happened didn't exactly make up for losing Kawhi.  From Toronto's perspective, just getting off DDR's terrible contract was a massive win. He was terrible in all of their previous playoff runs. Not only did they get off Derozan, they got Kawhi MF Leonard and Danny Green for Jakob Poetl and a 2019 FRP. It turned out to be a Kawhi rental, but that didn't matter because they won the championship. What's more, Kawhi leaving was still preferable to being stuck with Derozan's contract. Even if they hadn't won the championship, it would still have been a great move with very little opportunity cost."
I saw DeRozan chillin with Rudy Gay at Jones Assembly in OKC. I walked up and choked out a “…DeMar?!” walked away and continued with my life.
"True. At least that location hasn't changed, just the name. It's still the same arena that Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Chris Bosh and DeMar DeRozan played in. And it's in the core of the city."
Wherever you rank DeMar DeRozan HAHAHAHAHA
That's a Demar Derozan 3
Playoff DeMar DeRozan*
"Overall, the commentators that do national games aren't that bad. They'll have duds here and there, but I like most of them in general.   Demar Derozan is the best player on the bulls."
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
Someone has post DeMar DeRozan stress syndrome.   You take what the defense gives you. No lay ups no threes means open mid range.
"The Bulls are the last undefeated team in the East… just as we all predicted! /s  That being said, our defense has been absolutely amazing based on this small sample size against bum teams. Lonzo and Caruso have both been better than advertised in terms of their productive output on both ends. Our biggest signing in Demar DeRozan came up huuuuge for us in last nights game in his old stomping ground of Toronto. When we needed a bucket, he delivered time and time again.  P Will has shown some early flashes of what we could expect to see from him. However, he has"
"“Wait, ~~DeMar Derozan~~ / ~~Patty Mills~~ Spurs player is balling?” 🤔🔫 Always has…"
"Yeah the idea that trading Thad was a disaster and that somehow DeRozan would be worse was always ridiculous.   I wouldn't have expected Thad to continue acting as the defacto playmaker for the second unit, but even around his career averages of 13/6/2 with decent defense he would've been a big improvement over what I expect from Johnson.  But would I prefer that over DeRozan? Hell no. We don't win last nights game with Thad insted of DeMar."
"Zach seems like more of a boom or bust scorer to me. When he's in the groove he can easily get you 20 in a quarter like we've seen this year already, but there will be quarters where he goes 0-4 too, as we've also seen already. And that's fine, as long as during those dry spells you can turn to a DeMar who knows how to get a 15 footer whenever he wants - no matter what team he's playing, or how many points he has up to that point.  Having DeRozan and Vuc as your 2nd and 3rd options instead of Lauri and Coby/Otto Porter is going to be huge for Chicago this year."
"&gt; Thad Young, a guy who has played all of 9 minutes for the Spurs so far this year and who figures to play kind of deep in the rotation this year (and hey, he was great for Chicago last year but the great year screamed a one-year-wonder, sell-high situation)  I don't think that's due to Thad being over the hill, or overperforming last season. Thad has had a very good 14 year career doing largely the same things he did in Chicago last season. His style of play, numbers and impact were in line with his career averages, and his efficiency was up (in my opinion) mostly because he came off the bench and beat up on bench units as opposed to starting for most of his career.  If he was still in Chicago I have no doubt that he would be a big part of the Bulls' rotation, taking minutes that are currently going to Alize Johnson who has a grand total of 53 career NBA games under his belt. Thad's lack of usage for SA this year seems far more related to the Spurs beginning a full on youth-focused rebuild than him being finished.  That said, it was entirely a fair price to pay for DeRozan. I think anybody claiming that Thad + a 1st round pick for DeMar was an overpay listens to too much Lowe Post and is significantly overrating the impact that his poor defense would have on an overall team, and underrating the impact of his playmaking and shot creation.  I don't really care about the first 3 quarters here, but having another guy for Chicago to trust in close 4th quarter situations is *huge* in taking the burden off LaVine to win every single game."
Demar derozan is good at basketball
"Honestly who has a comparable midrange game? I don't mean this like ""Demar is a top 5 player"" way but pretty much everyone else in the league scores either from the post or from long range with little in between. It's kind of a lost art so it's hard to find people who do it, period, let alone do it as well as Derozan. Curry's kind of famous for 30 footers. Kawhi when he's healthy? I imagine Lebron could but that's unfair because Lebron could, like, do anything in the game if he wanted to."
"Yeah, people seem to spend a *lot* of time concentrating on what Demar doesn't do - he's a bad defender, he likes to be The Man on iso ball, he shoots from 15 feet in an era where nobody in the league does that unless they have 2 seconds to shoot - and as a result they don't get into what he *can* do. I think as a result of that DDR is lowkey one of the more underrated players in the league.  I've been absolutely loving what he's been in Chicago so far. Last night the Bulls were just getting destroyed by the Raptors' fullcourt press and in a way that looked sickeningly familiar, in spite of Lavine and Pat Williams being the only holdovers from last year (also Coby White but he's injured) - guys trying to do too much, playing too fast, getting weirdly frantic. Then Derozan was just like ""okay, give me the ball"", calmly walked the shot clock down to 8 seconds like it was still 2001, and got a couple of daggers with isolation. It was exactly what the team needed and exactly what they didn't have last season in situations like that.  Demar reminds me a *lot* of late-career Kobe Bryant. Kobe was a much better defender in his prime although TBH by the time he was doing the things that remind me of him when I watch Derozan he wasn't doing much on that end anymore. But Kobe even when he was young had this thing where he'd try to break you down and sometimes you could do your job against him and keep him in the midrange and force him into a fallaway jumper... and he'd *still* manage to hit that, and not only hit the shot but since you knew he was going to hit it you had to still chase after him and when you chase after a guy falling away you're probably going to draw a foul doing it.  I'm sure there will be a time or two when Derozan goes iso-ball late and doesn't hit a shot and everyone, probably including me, will demand that he pass to Zach more. But at least last night, a little bit of calm, Kobe-style ball was just what was needed."
"That DeRozan sign and trade was really beneficial for San Antonio too. I enjoyed DeMars time as a Spur and his exit was smooth because of the trade.   Really good situation, we took back draft capital and DeMar gets to thrive with you guys' new roster."

DeMar DeRozan came up clutch when bulls needed him most. He silenced the raptors crowd 3 times in the last 4 minutes.
"Which to me is insane. Lonzo cemented himself as a good defensive-minded playmaking sharpshooter, Zach is an offensive machine who can shoot the 3, and Vuc is a knock down 3 point shooter too. That's an insane amount of spacing for DeRozan to go to work. And Caruso is always great off the bench. The only issue Chicago has right now is at the 4 because PWill is still young and a work in progress, but other than that they're clearly a good fit. I still don't know how people don't see that, especially because I'd begged all offseason for us to get Lonzo and DeMar in NY."
The Bulls were one of the worst in the league at getting to the free throw line last year and it was one of the areas they wanted to address in the off-season. What does Arturas and Marc Eversley do? They go out and sign DeMar DeRozan…
"I like the Sixers, and only the Sixers.  But there are plenty of other players that I root for.  TJ McConnell, RoCo, Kemba Walker, Chris Paul, Dario Saric, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, Bobi, Deaaron Fox, and a couple more.  I’d never root for any of these players when they play against Philly but I do any other time."
We won that game because of Demar mf Derozan. Period.
"Demar ""still feeling as disrespected by the Raptors as Ujiri does with Edward Rogers"" DeRozan really came to work today"
I love DeMar DeRozan. I want the Bulls to win one for him
Demar Derozan deserves more recognition than he gets.
Austin Reaves AR-15 or The Trash Bros (Demar derozan and Kyle Lowry)
Damn that's a realistic looking Photoshop for Spurs legend DeMar DeRozan
"Shaq and Bron would be the obvious answers at their position just based on physical ability, but honestly don't think either of them actually fight.    At C, I'd take the Big Chief, Robert Parish.  Not only was he a blackbelt, but at the end of his career he signed with the Bulls and actually told Jordan to shut the fuck up, and Jordan did.    PF- Kenyon Martin.  Kmart was nuts and not at all above throwing down.  Alternate, KG (but only if the opponent was a small european role player)  SF - Ron Artest got in a fight with the entire Detroit fanbase, and won.  Alternate, Xavier McDaniel -  Most of you younguns don't know the X Man, but he was a rough and tumble dude in the 90s.   SG - Vernon Maxwell or DeMar DeRozan.  Just depends on whether you listen to Kenny Smith or Vince Staples.    PG - Steph Curry.  hahahahahaha.  Ok, Probably Iverson, but alternates would be Mark Price and Rajon Rondo."

Demar Derozan showed nothing but loyalty to Toronto but got shipped to San Antonio against his interests
"But they **didn’t**. That’s just the facts my friend. None of the players from the 90s have enough shooting to be good players today. If you just magically give huge skill boosts to the 90s players, then don’t give the same type of boost to the modern players, what kind of nonsense comparison are you making? The whole point here is we are comparing the players as they were. As they were, Jordan would be a pretty shit shooter by today’s standards. He is a career 32% 3pt shooter. He is in the same category of shooters as guys like Lonzo Ball, DeMar DeRozan, or Draymond Green. Jordan is a guard type player who makes his buckets in the midrange. It’s just simply trash skills by today’s standards. It doesn’t matter how good you are at taking midrange pull-ups, they are not good shots compared to 3s."
DeMar DeRozan. Masai pulling the hard bait &amp; switch did him dirty as hell
"Nikola Vucevic yelled, “There you go!” DeMar DeRozan gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lonzo Ball belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Alex Caruso hit the locker room door, NBA star Zach Lavine hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"...nah Kyrie dont belong on the top 75 list.  Like, hes got one more All NBA team than DeMar DeRozan, and really his only big moment is the '16 Finals. With no All Defense either.   His resume really doesn't stack up all time yet.  And if he keeps taking 20 game sabbaticals every year it might not ever."
"Two words:  LONZO BALL, DEMAR DEROZAN, ZACH LAVINE, NIKOLA VUCEVIC, ALEX CARUSO. MUST SEE TV"

Andrea bargnani  Demar DeRozan
"right, it becomes easier for him because he's surrounded with more scoring options to adequately take the heat off of him every possession. it's much harder for opposing defenses to cover him when there's 3 shooters and demar derozan to worry about everywhere else on the floor. and there's really only a few players in the NBA who can stay in front of him.  i'm calm, just posting stats he's put up against good defenses in the past, before he was surrounded by good scorers"

"MIAMI — For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry’s face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      “I knew I was good,” Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. “I knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.”      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee’s tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      “We all were mutually agreed that it was time,” Lowry said of leaving Toronto. “It’s hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      His journey in Toronto started with questions — he was the team’s backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash — crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      “The city of Tampa was great,” Lowry said. “It was just difficult because we didn’t know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.”      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team’s dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team’s president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      “Sometimes franchises have to do what’s best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn’t say power — but I had a little bit of, ‘Listen, it’s not going to be a good look if we don’t collaborate on this together,’” Lowry said. “We all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      “With DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.”      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. “It’s been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,” Ujiri said at a news conference in August. “We knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.”      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      “I’ve never been super athletic,” Lowry said with a laugh. “I can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I’m not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don’t need to be jumping.”      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry’s sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry’s primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan — “Smooth,” Lowry said of DeRozan. “That’s my best friend.”      And of Leonard: “A machine,” Lowry said. “He gets it done.”      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game’s quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      “I partly think it’s to get him going, because he’s got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,” Lowry said, adding that “some people can’t take it” and think Butler’s a jerk.      “Nah, it’s just how he is,” Lowry said. “Everybody has different demands on themselves.”      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      “He’s always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,” Butler said. “It’s incredible. It’s a blessing, and sometimes it’s a curse because you’ve got to be in some really great shape if you’re out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.”      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      “Freddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I’m the guy who was like, ‘Yo, it’s on me,’” he said, adding: “They have to take the criticism, and that’s what’s going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.”"
Derozan wasn’t the problem.   The entire team(LaVine being the exception) shot horribly tonight. Demar hit some clutch baskets towards the end that helped us seal the win.
"Them's ""I've watched DeMar DeRozan play defense for multiple seasons"" words."
"Ah yes, noted 3 and D player DeMar DeRozan"
"DeMar DeRozan is atrocious. Like one of the worst defensive players in the NBA. Between him, Lavine, and the mediocre rim protection you get from Vuc, that's a worse defensive team."
Demar DeRozan might be the league's worst defender.
demar derozan generally is not regarded as a good defender  maybe he will be now
depends on how much faith you have in demar derozan
"Nikola Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Demar Derozan, Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball  Vs.   Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, Rip Hamilton, Luol Deng, Derrick Rose.   I think it’d be a close game but I’d give the edge to the 11/12 Bulls. They were the first overall seed for a reason."
"Again, the DeMar DeRozan trade is my example. The Bulls traded one mediocre player (Thad Young) and one useless player (Aminu) and got a useful player back.   What use did the Raptors have for Dragic when they're in rebuild? But the Heat were able to move him and a mid-first rounder who didn't really impress in Precious to get Lowry.   I think you're severely underestimating the value of contracts regardless of the player's usefullness."
"Like I said, teams don't NEED Tucker. They just need the contract to match. Al Farouq Aminu had a $10M contract this season. The Spurs took him and Thad Young for DeMar DeRozan in a sign and trade. Then they cut Aminu.   Like if they want to make a run at someone in the $25M range in a S+T they could pair Lopez's expiring deal and someone like Tucker's contract together along with someone like Jordan Nwora (who you can try to spotlight this season to boost trade value) plus future picks."
"And I'm just disagreeing with you that a $7-10M expiring contract is hard to trade. We can have differences in opinion on that.   I just don't understand why you're looking at 4 years down the road when I'm merely stating that signing him to a deal similar to his Miami contract would be beneficial for the Bucks next season. Like if they WANT a guy with a $25M contract, having someone like Tucker's deal there to package would make things a whole lot easier for them.  Like look at how the Bulls got DeMar DeRozan by moving Al Farouq Aminu's $10M deal. Then the Spurs just waived him yesterday"
Demar Derozan
Demar DeRozan and Kawhi
Who moved from west to east to shift the balance of power?  Demar Derozan was the best player to switch conferences. He doesn’t control the balance of conferences.
"For me, it's putting it in perspective of paychecks. I get paid every other week, 26 paychecks per year. DeMar DeRozan, the [43rd highest paid player in the NBA](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/page/2), has a reported annual salary of $26M. If he's paid every other week, each paycheck is $1M."
"This is Masai Ujiru's music. The 76ers have quickly reached Demar Derozan level prices from their outrageous demands. Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn and a 1st incoming."
"And then you got Draymond interviewing demar derozan on draymonds show, not asking him about x's and o's, but asking about the 3 year old masai ujiri drama.  None of us are above all that, including draymond."
"&gt;he will. if 30 year olds Demar Derozan and Gordon Hayward can get a max, someone will take a bet on Ayton  100% false, this is exactly why you can't trust randos on r/nba to bring the facts.  Neither of those players got even close to the max.  The max for DeRozan (as a vet with 10+ years of experience and using Bird rights through the sign and trade) was 35% of the 2021-2 salary cap in his first year with 8% raises each year, that's ballpark ~3/130.  DeRozan actually got 3/82.   Hayward was also a vet with 10 years of experience so his max would have started at 35% of last year's cap.  I don't believe Hornets signed with Bird rights so he was eligible for only a max of 5% annual raises.  So his four-year max was ~4/164.  Hayward actually got 4/120.  Both of these players got $40 to $50 MILLION less than their max over the life of their contracts."
"1983 Sixers   PG: Mike Conley(Mo Cheeks)  &gt;fringe all star level players, both good defenders and passers   SG: Demar Derozan(Andrew Toney) &gt; fringe all star level players, both very good scorers that don’t take many 3’s  SF: Kevin Durant(Julius Erving) &gt;Elite all around hall of fame players   PF:(Marc Iavaroni)  &gt; don’t have a comparison I literally know nothing about this guy he averaged 5 points a game  C: Joel Embiid(Moses Malone) &gt;MVP caliber centers"

Demar Derozan in an era of 3 and D
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
You can't seriously be comparing DeMar DeRozan to Chris Paul
"I would've gotten slapped then. Cause there was no point in the season when I thought they would get past the the Raptors that upgraded from DeMar DeRozan to Kawhi, nor the Bucks."
"Yes, but what you said was that KG was never seen as the better player. You didn’t specify those years. Now you are trying to specify those specific years, when it wasn’t in the context of anything you or I said.   And All-NBA teams disregard team record?   So DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Julius Randle we’re all top 10 players? They didn’t get 2nd team All-NBA for being the beat players on playoff teams?    And I watched the series live too bro, I’m in my 30’s. Good speculation though!  I’ve proven you wrong with your All-NBA takes, and said Shaq being the best player prior to 2002 was pretty much a unanimous thing. However everyone knew he coasted during the regular season and turned it on for the playoffs."
Demar Derozan. The Raptors took off like a shot at the same time Masai Ujiri and Kyle Lowry arrived and as the face of the team and fan favorite he was completely disproportionately credited with Toronto's success both by fans and the accolades he probably would not have received were he just about anywhere else at the time.
Thank you for the most level headed response I’ve gotten so far lol. But yea I agree with everything you said.  I think Ben would do a lot for our defense that Lonzo and Derozan can’t. And is a good point guard (which we’ve been missing for awhile).   But ultimately I think I’d lean towards Lonzo and Demar
Him and known NBA basket case Demar Derozan.
"It's very much a ""what have you done for me lately"" league, mate. DeMar DeRozan was all-NBA too - that didn't stop people from shredding him for his playoff performances. Like Ben Simmons."
"Not necessarily most affected, but Paul George and DeRozan, are overlooked examples of jumping into defenders. (Why did you leave DeMar? You had a forever home in San Antonio. Nonetheless all the best in Chicago.)"
Bradley Beal / DeMar DeRozan works better just in terms of caliber of player because its just pretty disrespectful to KD to compare him to Melo.   There isn't a modern player exactly like Melo though.
DeMar DeRozan was pretty darn good off the glass.
You’re betting on Demar Derozan and Nikola Vučević getting passed the 2nd of the playoffs let alone beating the Nets and/or Bucks??
"Saw Willie Cauley Stein walking down the sidewalk with one other dude somewhere in Manhattan. Called him by his name and asked him for a picture. “yea sure man” he said. Wished him good luck with the Kings. It was 2016  Only few hours later, I met KAT at his greet and meet in a Foot Locker store for winning his ROY. Congratulated him for winning the ROY. “Oh, thanks!” He said with a big smile. Pictures not allowed, sadly. 2016 again    Saw Demar DeRozan and Ed Davis at Canada Wonderland’s when I was maybe 13. My friend suddenly blurted out “bro! Demar is over there!” Me not looking: “yeah right lol stop.” I looked over and there they are. 4-6 people following them. Demar ignored me. His girlfriend/or wife piggybacks his back for some reason. Ed Davis dapped me and said “what’s up man.” It looked like they are leaving. That’s it. Cool guy. Early 2010s   Saw Terrence Ross and Quincy Acy with my own eyes this time at Canada Wonderland’s another time. No one follows them this time (ahh, Canadians not caring about basketball) Quincy came off kinda egotistical but I actually find it hilarious. He didn’t look annoyed or irritated. It’s just Quincy thinks he’s the shit. Terrence was very polite and took a picture with me and thanked me for saying hello. Early 2010s again    I notice calling them by their names first helped."
Both Danny Green and DeMar DeRozan in shambles.
"I mean, you got three years of Demar back for Kawhi. Sure DeRozan can't be the best player on a championship team but cmon, there's an ocean between DeRozan and Barnes or Bagley lol"
"Of course he's not better than Kawhi. Toronto Kawhi was probably a top 3-4 player in the league. Kawhi is far better than Lowry as well. But Kawhi and a point guard works better than Kawhi and a volume scoring wing, so they shipped out DeMar.   What's your point? That because Kawhi is better then DeRozan *isn't* underrated?"

DD stands for DeMar DeRozan.  There you're all caught up with NBA fans now.
This ain't your uncles DeMar DeRozan. Lol. He's not a blackhole on defense any longer.
If the raptors were to get an all star.. it would unquestionably be FVV.. there’s no debating it  Ya OG was the first option scoring wise but overall FVV has been the raptors best player. It’s the Lowry derozan thing all over again. Yaa demar was the first scoring option but Lowry was always the best player
"Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozan, and Derrick Jones Jr are all on the same team. Doesnt quite fit your criteria, but it's a pretty good mix of players that have won/participated in the dunk contest."
2 points down with 18 left... fate of the universe on the line... I WANT DEMAR DEROZAN SPINNING MIDRANGE
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
"I think it's impossible to make it to the NBA and be like ""oh wow am I good at this?"" Some super humble players like Demar Derozan aren't in your face about it, but they know they're nasty"
DeMar “Kobe “Michael Jordan” Bryant” Derozan
Demar Derozan is the man
Lonzo little bro’d Melo tonight with that fire pg energy and 3pt range and Vucci Man3 had himself a 30 piece tonight hitting all them 3s we knew he had in him. AC Fresh showin out with his usual self and Javonte Green bringing that hustle energy. Oh and DeMar DeRozan is a midrange god but we already knew that.   Fr tho Charlotte is a fun team to watch and this was definitely one of our most fun games so far.

"Derozan got the hate for being a choker, but it was just as much, if not more, on Lowry. He played much worse against those Lebron led teams. He figured it out and won a title, when he was several years older than Demar is now, Derozan can figure it out too."
"It’s about accumulation of Playoffs experience you bozo. Finals or not, it’s about the body of work of battle tested in Playoffs. Lowry, Butler, Tucker, Spolestra been thru way more than the likes of Derozan, Lavine, Lonzo, Caruso and Billy Donovan.. that’s my point  Also don’t even bring the Bucks into this. They have multiple All Star caliber players and they have a multiple MVP. Can’t fucking compare last year Bucks to this year Bulls.  Giannis himself gone thru multiple years of Playoffs before he breaks thru and so did Middleton and Holiday and Brook Lopez and they had PJ Tucker, Zach Lavine has never even sniffed the Playoffs yet, same with Lonzo, Vucevic had a handful of Playoffs series maybe 2? Or 3? DeMar a choker. Can’t compare that"
"Tim Duncan might be the single most underrated defender in NBA history. That right there is pretty much the story.   Now, losing Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard and replacing them with DeMar DeRozan can kill just about any defense as well.  But the biggest thing is that Duncan was Duncan."

Dont forget demar derozan and the Raptors
"well, i was in the demar derozan is still a good player camp, so....    looking at you bleacher reports trash ass articles about how he's the worst free agency signing smh my head"
"I thought DeRozan would be big but I did think Ball and Caruso were overrated and wouldn’t help that much. I also think Demar could’ve alleviated a lot of problems LA has. Really, either of the Trash Bros could’ve but the Lakers wanted Westbrook."
&gt;DeMar DeRozan  Huh? DeMar was blindsided by the trade. Dunno how that's moving on in a mature or healthy way
I mean demar derozan is playing better then Jokic
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
No it isn't. Blake was incredibly valuable in his prime. DeMars teams have been better with him off the court in all but like 2 seasons of his career. That sort of tells you all you really need to know.  Besides Peak is more important than Being pretty good for 8 years or however long it's been for derozan. And blake was better than him from 2010 to I'd say 2018. Again so demar doesn't really have much longevity over blake either.
Curry  Harden  Blake  DeRozan  Jrue  Pretty clear cut order imo. Can take Demar over Blake for longevity but Blake was a legit MVP candidate at a point
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills
"Steph, Harden, Blake , DeRozan.  Don’t see OKC taking DeMar with KD."

Man it shouldn't even be close but that offensive foul was so bull shit man. Refs hate the bulls especially those not names Demar Derozan
"Demar “I’m like a Tesla” Derozan, quote from 2016"
His middle name starts with a D as well. He can literally be called Demar D Derozan and it'll work 😂
Do you know how hard it is for professional athletes to admit that? Did you see Giannis' tweets? Did you see Biles at the Olympics? Kevin Love? DeMar Derozan? Have you paid *any* attention to mental health in sports in recent years?
"I'm obviously biased but neither Tatum nor Brown would have ever sniffed the playoffs if they played on the same teams Zach has had to. Maybe in Minnesota with KAT but that was obviously cut short due to injury. You say they've won 5 playoff series, but DeRozan who has won 4 playoff series in the span of 3 years sucks in the playoff. DeRozan has a 22-22 record in the playoffs as the best player on his team against non-LeBron led teams. So it's really just not true that he's sucked.  Meanwhile Tatum and Brown have had a better supporting cast than either Zach or DeMar have had their entire careers, and now we're seeing what Boston looks like now that their team isn't all that great on paper. And now that LaVine and DeRozan have a solid supporting cast they're obviously playing up to their potential.  At the end of the day, I think most people would (and should) pick Tatum/Brown because of their perceived potential. But that's also assuming there's substantial growth to be had, because in my biased opinion LaVine and DeRozan are clearly the better duo and both in the MVP convo for good reason. But I don't blame you for picking your guys either, everyone wants their players to succeed."
"Ben Simmons, Demar Derozan would sign here today if they were free agents.  Kawhi would of signed with the Lakers if it weren't for Bron and AD already being here. PG wanted to play for the purple and gold before Bron got here."
"DeMar ""[Dubious Starter](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/demar-derozan/)"" Derozen and Zach ""[Average Starter](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/zach-lavine/)"" Lavine."
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
"Is Beal a max player? Existential question over at r/wizards. He's great, but he's starting to look more and more like a shorter DeMar DeRozan."
Demar Derozan. I mean he already has had one but 15-17 years is within reach.
i hate demar derozan because he never passes to me in 2k mycareer
"There's a whole generation of guards that I hate just because at some point some pundit, or analyst, or rando on this site said was better than Dame.   Kyrie Irving, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, to name a few. Most of these dudes are good guys and very fun to watch, but a part of me loves seeing them have a bad game in the pettiest way, because I know that at some point someone said with a straight face that they were a better player than Damian Lillard. These days Dame usually gets the respect he deserves, but like pre-2019 everybody was trying to act their favorite player was actually better than Dame because of some stupid shit and I still hate those players, just a little bit, because of it."
"""Demar Derozan is the worst signing of the offseason"" - League Executives  ""I can see this team being around 10th in the east"" - Nick Friedell (Former Bulls Writer btw)   ""I don't know how they are going to play defense"" - Some random guy on Fox Sports."
I like the implication that this means at least one of DeMar DeRozan or LaMarcus Aldridge will be in the Hall of Fame.

"it all depends on DeRozan, if he doesn’t turn into Demar DeFrozan then they’ll get to the second round"
"No order, Lebron, KD, Kyrie, Paul George, Kawhi, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Giannis, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, AD on days when he feels like dominating. These are just guys that I enjoy watching who I think are top 10 when they’re playing at their best."
"that could have possibly been the most embarrassing way to reply.  a) are you saying you think the all-star center is going to make the bulls worse than with backup rim-runner tony bradley? okay.  b) demar derozan is currently shooting the worst he has from the field since 2018. he’s having a sustainable “career year”  because maybe, just maybe, playing with good players makes the game easier.  c) one of the points in my prediction was literally AKME would make big additions in the off-season to try and win."
moving to the varsity conference made people realize how overrated Lebron was when his toughest opponent in the East was Demar Derozan
"Demar Derozan? Too good? His accolades aren't great, but his stats are good enough."
"&gt; Again, if an organization fails you I have absolutely zero problems with a player requesting a trade. I’ve said this multiple times.  You’ve said this multiple times for what? Derozan didnt request a trade. He was blindsided by Masai.   If you are talking about player empowerment requesting a trade, why does an organization have to fail a player first? Thats makes no logical sense. There has been repeated disloyalty from many NBA teams. Demar isnt new lol."

"That would be insane. Rest of the league better watch out.  Since my team’s out of contention, if I wasn’t rooting for DeMar DeRozan to win the chip he deserves for never once shirking the Spurs, I’d say GSW deserves to win it all with the way they’re playing and Curry for MVP and FMVP."
"No, that still probably goes to the 84 class, that's why I said those two are one of the best, and I did not say the best. If you look at who was drafted in those classes it's hard to argue that they're not one of the best drafts classes . Steph Curry, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Blake Griffin, kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Kawai Leonard, Jimmy Butler all came from either the 09 or 11 draft class."
DeMar Derozan. I started watching NBA/Raptors in like 2007 and Dearoxan was the first young player who came along a I got to watch his development as athletic / raw rookie averaging like 7 points a game to starting all star. He was the first player who made me actually believe in the Raptors.
"Demar wasn't gonna take the 6-7mil MLE we could have offered over 85mil. If it was a sign and trade, the Spurs would have wanted something worthwhile, but it would hard-cap the Lakers.   I'm not saying I'm happy with the moves the Lakers made, but everyone is kinda blending in the what ifs, by this time next year, it might turn into ""the Lakers could have had Lowry, Derozan, Hield, Ben Simmons 6th man"" lol"
Could have gotten Demar to help you ball-handle/secondary playmake and kept everyone else as well.  Derozan is still making less than Russ and he wanted to go home to California.
"DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a first used to be the going rate for superstars  Damn inflation ^^/s"
"Wow, the level of condescending tone while clearly showing you know nothing is impressive. What a horrible comparison of players.  1. Demar has never been a spot up shooter. He is a off the dribble creator from mid range. This is his year from three pt range at 33% at less than 3 attempts per game and his reluctantance to shoot from behind the arc has been well chronicled his entire career. Derozans next best year is 31% at 3.6 attempts per game. Westbrook at at his best shot 34% at 7 attempts per game. Neither are good shooters/floor spacers.  2. Melo has always been a great shooter and has played the spot up shooter role/microwave scorer the past 5 years.  3. Just to be fair to your argument, the best comp for current Demar is probably Wade at the tail end of his prime. Almost everyone, including LeBron and Wade admitted it was an awkward fit because they had redundant skills. It worked because both were at their absolute peaks and deferred. So yes, Derozan is a better fit than Westbrook only because he is a better player.  4. Post Miami LeBron has been most successful as the primary ball handler with elite shooting around him. Heild is nowhere near the player Derozan is but there's no question he's a better fit since he's an elite shooter. I'd still take Derozan over Hield but he's far from a good fit on a LeBron team."
"Why are we calling Harden a point guard in this but both Zach Lavine and Demar Derozan, on the same team, are shooting guards"

DeMar DeRozan
"You seem to think I’m trying to say that Steph isn’t having a great year. This is not the case. Steph is playing phenomenal basketball, I don’t think anyone can really disagree with that assessment.  What I AM saying is that you provided a stat to bolster your argument that Steph was playing All-NBA level defense, and I’m saying the stat you used is terrible. Do you also think DeMar DeRozan is a top 10 defender? Do you think there are 50 better defenders than Rudy Gobert? If you say no, then you agree it’s a bad stat. And if you say yes, then that’s a hot take I don’t really have the fortitude to comprehend at this present moment."
"This stat says there are 34 better defenders than Giannis and 41 better than Draymond. And DeMar DeRozan is a top 10 defender too?   Don’t even see Kawhi or the literal reigning DPOY in the top 50, so nah, this stat is trash."
That still puts DeMar Derozan and D’Angelo Russell with Steph curry in the top 3 defenders in the league based off that lone stat.
When you remember that KD is probably the most hated star and curry is the most loved you understand to take these threads with a grain of salt. Reading here you would think were comparing demar derozan and curry
What about Demar DeRozan?
"From the article:  “It’s all well and good that we have some other things to entertain us, like Steph Curry doing Steph things with a real team around him in Golden State and the DeMar DeRozan-led Bulls trucking teams in the East.  Just don’t lose sight of the big picture, folks: Jokic is still the most effective regular-season player in basketball. Voters seemingly reluctantly gave him the MVP last year and again appear to be scanning the universe for alternatives, and it may be harder to convince them after seeing Curry go amazeballs on Tuesday in the league’s most prominent TV game of the season.  People: I get the Stephmania and all because the Warriors have been unbelievable (and we’ll get to that soon here), but for the love of all that is holy, would you please stop dismissing Jokic? He’s basically a 7-foot point guard at this point, dragging an injury-riddled Denver team to competence.  Yet we’ve heard comparatively little Jokic banter thus far, despite the fact that through 13 games, his PER of 35.4 ranks … (checks notes) … first all-time.  All. Time.  By a wide margin, actually — the all-time best heading into this year was 31.86 by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019-20. It’s only 13 games, and maybe Jokic’s numbers will dip as the year goes on, but nothing about his start has seemed particularly fluky or weird.  Even relative to the other four players who have been notably awesome in the early part of the season, Jokic has been on a completely different level.  We’re blessed with some awesome players right now, but in terms of production, it’s The Joker’s world. Yet, reading the tea leaves, it already seems very possible Jokic won’t repeat as MVP due to some combination of voter boredom and embarrassing oversight.  (Also, while we’re here: It is an unconscionable, embarrassing mistake that Jokic was left off the league’s top 75 players of all-time list, just to leave room for misty-eyed wistfulness about the fourth-best players on Lakers, Celtics and Knicks teams of yore. “Sure, this Jokic fella is good, but he’s no Dave DeBusschere.”)  The breadth of what The Joker is doing is overwhelming. Skill-wise, he’s the best passer in the league, but he’s also second in rebounding; oh, and he’s shooting 38.3 percent on 3s. And — get this — he’s sixth in scoring, while very nearly leading the league in 2-point shooting percentage at 66.3 percent.  Defensively, he’s less off-the-charts awesome, but his IQ and giant mitts still make him effective. (Fun fact: Jokic has more steals than Giannis, Trae Young or Kevin Durant. He’s in the league’s top 50 in both steal and block rate.) The Nuggets, quietly, are third in the NBA in defensive efficiency despite missing multiple key players, which sort of neutralizes the “WuT AbOUt hIs D?” angle.  In addition to having the best individual stats in the league, Jokic’s impact stats are borderline hilarious. The Nuggets are plus-14.2 points per 100 possessions when he plays, minus-11.6 when he sits, nearly a 26-point swing depending on whether he’s in the game.  The eye test backs up the numbers. He’s steadily improved his doughy physique and now moves better than ever, gliding past opponents in transition and making guard-like moves closer to the rim. As a roller, it’s been interesting to see him use long strides and (gasp!) athleticism to get chances close to the rim rather than ambling into jump hooks like he used to.  And mixed in, of course, are assorted displays of a rare basketball genius. He’s reinventing the game on the fly, doing stuff no big man has ever done and adding to the repertoire as he goes. Oh, here, let me just whip this one-handed, no-look, pick-and-roll dish to a driving Aaron Gordon.  Even as the Nuggets scuffle along in fits and starts through early injuries and bad bench units, Jokic has been unbelievable. Night to night, he’s not just the most effective player in the league, but he also makes at least one mind-blowing play every single game … and everyone just kind of ignores it and goes about the day. Playing in the Rocky Horror Time Zone doesn’t help, but it’s still weird. It doesn’t help that the league still markets him like he’s Mason Plumlee.  Fans of good basketball: Appreciate this guy. He is an awesome, generational talent at the absolute peak of his powers.”"

"The two largest gangs in the west coast IIRC US for majority African-Americans. Bloods wear red and crips wear blue. It’s a major rivalry. There are members in other areas of the country.   Also since some nba players grew up poor and sometimes in the hood near gangs when they showed potential the gangs would protect them, the biggest example is DeMar DeRozan who grew up near crips. Other guys like John Wall have flashed gang signs in games before. Terry Rozier is part of a smaller group called GMB.   The rivalry is so intense crips don’t say B so for example for birthdays they say G-Day, and if you wear rival colors to the wrong neighborhood you could be possibly seen as a member and attacked.   Crips are known for their dance the c-walk, lots of vids on YouTube. Bloods have some famous hand signs like making the word “blood” with their hands and also CK which means crip killa"
Hear me out.   Rajon Rondo -&gt; Lonzo Ball   Ray Allen -&gt; Zach LaVine   Paul Pierce -&gt; DeMar DeRozan   Kevin Garnett -&gt; ALEX CARUSO
"This is the ‘92 mixtape night at the arena, and just like 1992, we’re getting shit on by Demar “Michael” DeRozan and Alex “Scottie” Caruso"
"Agreed, it was all because of his shot selection I just don’t think that just gets fixed. Is Kobe still Kobe if he doesn’t hit insanely tough shots all the time? My point was more that Derozan is more patience and will wait to get a solid shot. Even then Demar in an era that’s easier to score still pales in comparison to someone like Wade who was taking much more difficult shots. Kobe’s would probably consistently shoot above 50% if he took better shots, I just don’t see that happening though."
"&gt; Think Derozan but even better  Think DeRozan, with better mid-range game, better passing, better 3 point shooting and all-time great defender (12 all-nba defender).  Kobe is closer to Jordan than DeMar is to Kobe (and I love DeMar)."
DeMar DeRozan
"Derozan is also a better inside the three point line then Kobe was. Demar has 4 seasons shooting over 50% on 2 point shots, Kobe only has one. Also for the people about to say oh spacing it was a different era. Michael Jordan has 9 seasons shooting over 50% on 2’s, Wade has 7. Kobe is a fantastic player but people are really overrating his shooting."
Lmao Demar Derozan
"&gt;DeMar DeRozan had multiple conversations with LeBron James in the offseason.  &gt;“I felt like going to the Lakers was a done deal and that we were going to figure it out. I was going to come home,” DeRozan told Yahoo Sports after scoring a game-high 38 points to lead the Bulls to a 121-103 victory at Staples Center. “The business side of things just didn’t work out. A couple of things didn’t align. It didn’t work out. It’s just part of the business, part of the game.   LeBron: You should come to the Lakers!  DeMar: Fuck yeah!  Lakers: That's unpossible. We don't want to be hard capped."
DeMar DeRozan would definitely want a trade to the Lakers now.
"Anthony Davis is a DeMar DeRozan type player. He is sometimes a top 10 player on the league rn but his body is unstable and he is not reliable. You also cannot be one of the greats if you haven't done anything solo. By solo I mean taking your team to atleast a conference final, you don't have to win but atleast lose in the conference finals. He doesn't get held to a higher stand because most pundits and people know that he is only considered great because of LeBron.  In my opinion Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie, Klay, jimmy butler, and a bunch of past centres could have made it to the list."
"&gt;I assume it would’ve been some combination of Schroeder, THT, and/or Caruso,   You assume the Spurs and Lakers would structure a sign and trade deal (while knowing both would be hard capped) around all players who would be free agents and not players on the Lakers roster who are already on contracts? Make that make sense. He would’ve gotten traded for the same package or similar package to the one Westbrook did.   &gt;which is why I didn’t include them in the calculation.   A calculation that doesn’t make sense.   &gt;Did you ever stop and think why they weren’t there?  Did you ever stop and think you don’t have to be a dick and that you can debate like a normal person?   &gt;AFAIK the lakers had already committed Kuzma and Trezz for Hield in this scenario  Expect we’re not talking about THAT scenario, we are talking about a DeMar DeRozan sign and trade to the Lakers, not a demar DeRozan sign and trade coupled with a buddy hield trade which literally no one brought up.   &gt;so they’d 100% definitely still be on the team   They would 100% be on the team in this completely random scenario you brought up for no reason other than the purpose of creating a counter argument?  &gt;Perhaps KCP goes for Demar, so the lakers have $16 mil in cap space to sign what, 6-7 fucking players   If we go off of this scenario where demar is S&amp;T for just KCP then the Lakers would have 16mill in cap to sign players, and Would still have Trezz, Kuzma, and Gasol available to either keep or trade for multiple players on smaller deals. The only downsides would be not being able to retain Caruso (who they didn’t anyway) and likely losing  THT (who they could’ve made a S&amp;T deal for if they wanted).   &gt;Either way Demar is not on the lakers because he wouldn’t take a pay cut.   Again I disagree, DeMar isn’t on the Lakers because the Lakers didn’t want DeMar."
"Knife could be driven further when you remember that DeMar was talking to Lowry about going to the Lakers together. The starting lineup could have looked like:  Starters: Lowry, Hield/Caruso, DeRozan, LeBron, AD"
"I legitimately believe that DeMar DeRozan was barely a league average starter in terms of value over his entire Raptors tenure. The entire time he was part of the Raptors, they were better with him off the court. His entire time with the Spurs, the Spurs were better off the court. This season with Chicago is the first time in his career(other than 2011-2012 when he was a slight positive) that his teams have had a better point differential with him on the court versus off the court.  He spent most of his career as the epitome of an empty stats player. Zero impact, engagement, or effort on defense despite having elite tools. Inefficient chucking on offense. He figured out how to be more efficient in SAS, which made him probably a net positive for them, but still. The fact that he gets the respect he does is mind boggling. This is a dude that doesn't care about winning at all. He doesn't. You can't convince me otherwise. He's refused to shoot threes or put any effort on defense for most of his career. He's a born loser.  His All-NBA nods are a bad joke when he was obviously and severely outclassed by the other half of his backcourt the entire time him and Lowry played together.   There's a reason he's been dogshit in the playoffs his whole career. Considering him for the HOF would be a bad joke."
"Lillard being on there is the ultimate proof that these lists are more about show and hype than winning.   Dude hasn't played defense his whole career and never taken his team to anything significant  Before you go and say that he made the WCF once; so did Demar Derozan, famous playoff non-factor. Dame's shot 41 FG% in the playoffs and been swept in three series. His team has had a below league average DRTG pretty much his entire career. Just not a winning player."
I don't get that line about Bulls.  The Bulls weren't good last few seasons and now they are good and this might be a complete co incidence but I think it was because this season 2 players called DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball were added.  &amp;#x200B;  Are you saying the 11th seed 31-41 Bulls were a good team?  Or the 13th seed 22-60?
"2018 Demar Derozan Fred Jr, CJ miles, Delon, JV   2019 Kawhi, Fred SR, Danny Green, Marc Gasol  There was huge changes in the roster not just kawhi  Also cant really say we were built to beat Lebron in 2018 when we've got no defense and CJ Miles is making Kevin Love look like Embiid"
"must be nice that the lakers gave the bulls a free win, so they could feel good about their season.  &amp;#x200B;  we all know the nba is rigged, demar is a black hole in the playoffs, just proves the nba is a marketing scam for people to think their team is good and buy tickets to the regular seaon  &amp;#x200B;  demar derozan is not good as you can see by his stats in the playoffs , the nba is just rigged so cities can think they have a shot untill its the lakers vs nets in the finals"
"For people who don't know its simple:   DeMar Derozan - 9 seasons in Toronto 0 championship   Kawhi Leonard - 1 season in Toronto 1 championship"
"Nobody is ridiculing Ben for not playing  Nobody is ridiculing Ben for having mental health issues  What's making people pissed is that Ben and Rich are using mental health as a leverage to get what they want. Derozan was professional enough to cooperate with the Spurs, why cant Ben do the same with the Sixers? Demar was even allowed to take a leave for more than a week to take care of his mental health, and the entire team (end even the entire city) supported him for that leave  The problem with Ben is he's not cooperating with the Sixers. What's worse is that he's using mental health as a way to leverage his position"
For people who don't know its simple:   DeMar Derozan - 9 seasons in Toronto 0 championship   Kawhi Leonard - 1 season in Toronto 1 championship
I believe 'DeMar DeRozan' is the right word
That’s a weird way to spell DeMar DeRozan
Welcome back DeMar DeRozan*
Demar Derozan should be an Allstar this year.
"Drummond is also the best example for why PER is flawed as the be-all and end-all stat, especially for big men. Drummond has a higher career PER than: Stockton, Nash, Kidd, Wall, Iverson, Isiah Thomas(thats the Pistons one, but but applies to both anyways), Gary Payton, Reggie Miller,  Ginobili, Drexler, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Lowry, Beal and probably dozens more of great Guards who are clearly more valueable and better players."
"Don’t get me wrong they’re playing fantastic and better than i expected, but above milwaukee? pls  and we don’t even have a guaranteed all star cuz ppl haven’t been watching demar “82nd best played in the league” derozan playing fantastically consistent basketball"
"It's gonna be a bad class. The only reason teams were clearing space was for Giannis but now that he got his supermax the best available players are Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr and DeMar DeRozan"

"Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan  EDIT: Also, we are not better without DeRozan, that take is so insane. He runs our entire offense."
Jaylen Brown &gt;&gt;&gt; Demar DeRozan. Over the next 5-10 years at least.
"Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan, Kawhi Leonard"
Demar Derozan
"I think with Aldridge being out we have some addition by subtraction too. I love Aldridge and want him to get healthy, but he and DeRozan have never been a good fit together.  With Poetl in the starting lineup, I think we're getting the rim protection that we need (we were bleeding lots of points with the starters before Aldridge went out)  This year Aldridge has changed his game to space the floor more and isn't doing the 'roll' part of pick and roll a lot, so it frees up DeMar to work more in the midrange, but I'd really like to see LaMarcus go to town on bench units."
"Tell me where I said he's a better player?? Im arguing the fact that you're saying he's easily way better which is just stupid. You don't even know what's going on lmao.  And oh he leads mediocre rosters to playoff births? Like when Lowry led a lineup of him/DeRozan/Luis Scola/Demarre Carroll/Bismack Biyombo to the ECF where they took the champion Cavs to 6 games while Demar shat the bed consistently? Or like last year when he took Toronto 7 games against Boston's big 3 by himself while Pascal did his best to lose us every game? Or like how he's led Toronto to be one of the most successful franchises over the last decade regardless of who he plays with? Like oh god I'm CP3 led Schroeder, Dort, SGA, and Steven Adams to a first round exit what an untouchable god lmao.   Before last year's playoffs started Kyle was literally first place over a 5 year span in clutch shots hit in the playoffs. You're spewing nonsense."
Demar DeRozan on the defensive end and I are a wash
Look nobody is saying LiAngelo has a bad life but ya don’t get mental health and it shows. I thought Kevin Love and DeMar Derozan made that clear but is that too mature for this sub?
"Do you believe that was the only change we made?   - We got Marc Gasol  - Siakam became an all star / borderline all star caliber player   - Serge improved significantly  - We got a championship 3&amp;D starter in Danny Green  - Fred VanVleet was a lot better in the last 2 series  - We got a new head coach that understood positional matchups   In 2018 our offensive rating against Cleveland was fine. The issue was defensively, we had JV guarding Love, Serge Ibaka on JR Smith and DeMar (a guy who infamously couldn't get around a screen to save his life) guarding Kyle Korver. There's a reason those 3 shot 40%+ in that series and did shit all offensively  In the other series .  If Exchanging Kawhi for DeRozan was truly the only change we made, we lose to Philly 100%"

You’re a fucking clown. Who said anything about LeBron?  Enjoy DeMar DeRozan 🤣
Some guys off the top of my head that are getting nowhere near the all-star consideration they deserve are 100% Maple Jordan AKA Andrew Wiggins and DeMaR DeRoZaN
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"lmao FUCK KD but this is adorablelol  &gt;Durant said he started to feel better about his decision during his time with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  “I was worried about how my peers were going to feel about me,” he told Steinberg. “In my profession, that’s the only thing I care about. So when I was talking to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and they were like, ‘Congrats, man, do your thing,’ and Paul George was like, ‘Congrats, man, I am happy for you,’ and Kevin Love was like, ‘Shoot, do what you gotta do,’ that eased my mind a little bit, because I want that from my peers.”"
Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2.

"yeah luckily he's also a good playmaker and rebounder, as well as being a statistically proven clutch performer. nobody thought Kyle Lowry was better than DeMar DeRozan during any year that they were both playing together.  which is why the Spurs traded for DeRozan and not Lowry.  trying to make a case for Lowry as a top 20 player of the last decade is hilarious."
"I honestly don't know right now. For us to get much for him, a team would need to believe he can get back to where he was pre-injury. We also have the TPE, but if we're trading Kemba or the TPE, it would preferably be for a player who'll be on contract for at least 2 years.  I was intrigued by a potential DeMar Derozan and Lamarcus Aldridge for Kemba, the TPE, and a pick, but I don't think the Spurs are bad enough right now to want to haul those contracts off, and they're only for one year. This team desperately needs veterans that can still play minutes, right now we have none besides Kemba."
"DeMan, DeMar, DeRozan."

Early DeMar DeRozan vibes.
"“Losing” DeMar  You guys didn’t just lose him. You kicked DeMar to the curb to pick up someone who loudly whined about the prospect of going to Canada instead of LA. You gave up a loyal franchise star, but hey, you got a championship out of it before Fun Guy ^^^TM shot you the finger on his way out.   I‘ve been a huge Derozan fan throughout his career. I was simultaneously stoked to see him come to San Antonio, disgusted with your front office to see him tossed out the way he was, and heartbroken for the Toronto fans who loved him."
Demar Derozan is still in the league
Does that make Demar Derozan my father?
Demar Derozan had to take personal days because of his dad’s health but he let Pop know. It’s not that difficult
"Right but if Versatile Scoring is much more importan than winning basketball, then you must have Kyrie Irving pretty high on your all time list right?  DeMar DeRozan would also be a better player in your eyes than most people, because his footwork is some of the best the league’s ever seen. Your criteria for greatest is greatly skewed, which is fine I guess, more points out how fucking stupid it is to argue about who the greatest ever is, but at least understand how that makes what you’re saying weird to a lot of people."

"i like watching LaMarcus take dudes into the deep water of the left block and just kill em over and over with the shoulder bump into turnaround fadeaway. also how demar derozan always find a way to the rim even without respecting his 3s. if he can't get there, he stops and uses a top 3 pump fake in the NBA and gets to the line. sadly he doesn't enough respect by the refs for getting mauled on his drives, but he has still been an insanely efficient player the last two years largely off fakes, post moves, and ridiculous finishing. also has a 5:1 ast/to ratio, which is forcing guys to not help off shooters and 4s can't guard him. also when he hits dudes with the up and under it makes me freak out."
spurs offense = demar derozan
"Um are you serious right now, Jamiecballer is a notorious r/nba redditor who is know to obsessively shit on players like DeMar DeRozan and Westbrook. You don’t need to stalk his account, he is literally everywhere on every post that mentions DeRozan. It’s sad because a guy like DeRozan who single handedly changed a billion dollar business by being the first NBA All Star to uncover his struggles with Mental Health and change the whole NBA. Yet jamiecballer notoriously and obsessively goes to any derozan post to shit on his entire career and say stuff like he makes every team he’s been on worse etc. You must be one of his mutuals if you’re really defending this man who should be banned on the subreddit by now"
"I'd argue Demar DeRozan  On a hot night, no one game's looks more fluid."
"Here for the armchair sports analysts that commend Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan for speaking out about mental health but shit on Kyrie Irving when we don’t even know anything about his situation and don’t want to give him any benefit of the doubt, it’s pretty clear he struggles mentally let’s just leave it at that."
"&gt; The supporting cast the Raptors have now in 2020-21 is better defensively, and is a better 3pt shooting team, and Lowry is still Lowry. In 2018: 59 wins, 1st seed and he played 34 minutes aka most of the game. Don't know how that made the Raptors worse.   We don't have any bigs that are playing well unlike when we had JV at the 5, Lowry is not as good as ever man is 34, due to our lack of quality bigs we have the 20th ranked defense so far this season easily the worst in recent Raptors history and we are 16th in 3P% (mediocre af) with the highest attempts in the league. Nothing you said is true in any sense.  &gt; I also see the on/off analytic frequently used where they say he’s had a negative on off for a decade. The on/off statistic is deeply influenced by lineups and team benches. Starting units performing worse against other teams starters, in comparison to how the spurs bench performs against other benches, will yield bad on/offs. DeMar has most of his minutes staggered against starting units. The Raptors have had the some of best benches in the league for years.  If this was truly the case, why were DeRozan+Bench lineups also negative in on/off just like DeRozan in general? If our bench was so good, you'd think DeRozan on/off consistently being negative would not be the case when he played with the Bench Mob? Shit, the bench mob without Lowry was a mediocre lineup and a mediocre bench. Lowry made the bench mob great.  Let's face it. DeRozan is a player that looks better than he actually is. He puts up good box score stats, his game is visually appealing with his tough shot making in the mold of great shooting guards of old. But when you scratch under the surface, he really is not that impactful on the court and even a negative. Even with the eyetest, when DeRozan is in the game the Raptors played slower, less ball movement and far more ISO (something DeRozan wasn't efficient enough at to run that many times a game)."
"Agreed, but why do guys like u/jamiecballer and u/lardbiscuits turn that into “DeMar makes every team he plays on worse”, and “they are a better team with DeRozan on the bench”"
"Tony Parker had a negative on off for 7 seasons including the year the Spurs won the Chip against Miami. It is a huge stretch to say the Raptors win 59 games without DeMar, or are a top team those years and now it shows when the Raptors are struggling with a better defensive 3pt shooting cast than any DeRozan year, with Lowry still as good as ever."

"DeRozan has actually been more efficient in San Antonio than he was in Toronto. The problem is he’s gotten ZERO media coverage since he got there, it’s like most people have just forget that he exist.   People gotta give him his respect though, people saying he’s not a top 10 shooting guard anymore are crazy. DeMar has still been hoopin (he also should have made the 2019 all star game instead of LaMarcus)"
"No room. Harden, Luka, Curry, Dame, CP3, and Mitchell all looking to get *back* into the ASG this year, along with guys like Booker*, D’Lo, and Murray looking to get in for the first time in the west. All of them I’d put ahead of CJ. John Wall is a guy too that might get a nod. He was a 5x all star before the injuries. DeRozan may be in play here as well.  6 guard spots gets you Harden, Luka, Curry, and Dame as probable locks. Then only 2 spots to split between Mitchell, Booker, CP3, Russell, Murray, Wall, Demar, and CJ. With the Suns being a top team (right now) id wager one of Booker/CP3 get in (probably Booker). That last spot could really go to anyone, probably D’Lo or Mitchell."
I respectfully disagree. DeMar has been balling out of his mind this season and has vastly improved his shot selection since Toronto but Derrick White scored a comfortably our best two way player. I’m not against the idea that DeRozan is a better player than White but for the Spurs and all of our massive defensive deficiencies I think White is the more important player for us.
"DeMar ""That-Goes-In"" DeRozan"
I miss DeMar DeRozan
"Actually yeah that makes sense, because then we can do this:  - Bradley Beal - Jrue Holiday - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - James Harden - Zach LaVine"
SG is pretty loaded tbh  - James Harden - Bradley Beal - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - ??? - Zach LaVine  No idea who'd play the 5 though.
I just got out of a Thai prison is Demar Derozan the best player?
"DeMar ""Manu"" Derozan"
I love DeMar DeRozan
just here to say i love demar derozan
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
"This is Lowry's last season as a Raptor, and he'll probably be gone by the trade deadline. I don't think you understand how either team management, or basketball strategy works.   DeRozan is not Kawhi, but they have similar skillsets on offense. He's probably in the same ballpark as Middleton and CJ McCollom.   Would you trade Lowry for CJ or Middleton? Or are you just a spiteful Raptors fans that tries to act like DeMar is a trash player because he doesn't play for the team anymore."
"  Lowry has always been far more impactful on the game, and is our floor general and leader.     Demar brings offense and some playmaking but nothing else. He's not kawhi and has shown he can't be reliable in the playoffs, so I don't understand the point of that comment lol.  we don't need demar.  We peaked with him, there's no point bringing him back. Idc about lowrys age, I'd take his all around game easily over demars scoring. A lowry for derozan trade makes no sense for either team."
"Bill Worrell is way better than Mike Breen. I mean, where else but a Houston Rockets home game are you going to hear a man mistake DeMar DeRozan for Luka Samanic?"
Nah that’s a joke of an opinion. Some great players are both but a lot aren’t.   Draymond and Rodman were both all nba quality players in their prime but they were floor raisers at all but they could raise the ceiling of a team dramatically   Russel Westbrook and Demar Derozan are floor raisers who can help a bad team a ton and help them become pretty good but they don’t have the skills or habits that translate to playing on good teams in high level playoff games.    Lots of other examples    Really just a ridiculous terrible opinion. Floor raiders and ceiling raiders are absolutely a thing.    Sure a lot of great players are both but a lot are also just 1 or the either
"No. This makes no sense at all. We need someone who can compliment Lowry, not get rid of him. I love Derozan but he’s not a star player that can cover the loss of Lowry. With just Demar alone we aren’t winning a chip."
"I mean it’s a fine line.   Firstly, I don’t think praising somebody for being mentally strong is something that needs to change.   Because it is a part of what makes greats great. Being able to handle pressure is a big part of being a great NBA player. And we should recognize greatness. I don’t think it should be taboo to say Herro has balls of steel for a young player  I was personally more sympathetic towards Derozan and Love because their mental health did not come up after their successes or failures. We did not hear anything about Demar when LeBronto was happening or about Love during Cavs Finals.   PG talked big shit the whole year then brought his mental health up after his failures, which in my opinion would be open to a little criticism."
"On a winning team you’d take the guy who is way worse at the skills you need to be a good third option, defense and shooting?   Give me Brown over DeRozan. I think he’s straight up better, but just in terms of fit, the former makes way more sense around other guys who can handle the ball. It’s not like DeMar can be that top guy so he needs those secondary skills Brown has. I would hate to be giving big minutes to a wing who can’t stand up against the best players or really be a positive on defense at all. You have to give a lot in those secondary areas."
"If interpreting [long, warm, unprompted bear-hugs as reconciliatory](https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/article/masai-ujiri-demar-derozan-shared-special-moment-courtside-nba-bubble/) makes me a hater, so be it.  The fact remains that Toronto should absolutely be considered a possible destination for him next season."
"DeMar and Masai [hugged it out in the Bubble](https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/article/masai-ujiri-demar-derozan-shared-special-moment-courtside-nba-bubble/), for what that's worth.  DeMar doesn't seem like the grudge-keeping type."
"Did you just compared demar derozan to Kobe getting paid for all his contributions to the franchise? Good God what's happened to the spurs fanbase,have y'all gone completely insane since Kawhi left? 🤣🤣🤣"
"Demar derozan is about to have the most impossible to value free agency of all time   He still isn’t really looking for the 3 pointer - but he’s shown the ability to keep the defense honest if they give him space. I want to see him get some off ball action and a few spot up attempts, his catch and shoot looks really nice."
What if I told you demar derozan is actually tim duncan with a new haircut?
DeMar Derozan deserves way more respect IMO
"Better,  Are you equally upset with the other players who had “education reform” on their jerseys?  Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum, Marcus Morris, Solomon Hill,  Kent Bazemore, Demar Derozan, Ed Davis, Georges Niang"

"Not surprising at all. He literally, in the full sense of the word, got better every single season with TOR. He has a legendary work ethic. As an example, one of the big criticisms of him was that he had no left hand. So one off season he used only his left hand for everything he did. Eating, writing, playing basketball, etc to get as natural as possible with his left. Like who does that? A normal person would just focus on the left hand in workouts but not Demar Derozan. He just flat out uses his left for every thing he did that offseason."

"I watched this live and was very confused as to why Beverly was allowed to step in the lane like that.  Here's what I think happened: I believe one of the refs incorrectly told Beverly that he had fouled DeRozan when Patrick asked for an explanation. This is likely why he seems to be directly questioning that particular ref in this clip. His point is, if I fouled DeMar like you claimed, why is Patty shooting? The ref made a mistake in the explanation and that's why Beverly got away with what he did."

"It’s basically how many points you generate relative to your drives. Russell Westbrook has a 23%, so basically if he were to drive 20 times in a game, he’d generate 4.6 points for himself off those drives. An elite inside scorer like James Harden has a 63%, meaning on 20 drives, he’d score 12.6 points.   Now Kyrie on 20 drives would score 19.6 points.  It also speaks to decision making, as Kyrie will look to score every time and at a good level too, whereas Demar Derozan often passes on the drive"
I need this to try and reply to analytic derozan haters because I love demar
"If you can get a future unprotected first for a 1 yr demar derozan rental, you take it.  How is this even a question?"
It’s not that Demar is the problem. Gary Harris is not enough of a problem for DeRozan of all people to be the solution. If that makes sense lol
"Yeah but less points than Terrence Ross, less rebounds than Mason Plumlee, and less assists than Demar Derozan"
Demar Derozan
I used to play 2k all the time growing up. I think it was 2k13 or 14 where the Raptors had Rudy Gay and Demar DeRozan.   For some reason both those guys were like prime Vince Carter dunking on everyone all game. They were the most fun team to play as by far.   I've been a Raptors fan ever since
"This JJ Redick podcast is really good   https://youtu.be/0P4G2Fanjio  From about the 27:30 min mark, he talks to DeRozan about shooting/shot selection.   JJ says something along the lines of “If you shot 8 threes a game you’d average around 30 on 65 ts%.”   DeMar replies with something along the line of “I’ve never thought of it in that perspective, everyone keeps telling me I HAVE to shoot 3’s, no one ever asks why I don’t .”"
No Demar Derozan love in here?
"You seriously don’t think the Spurs would offer DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a 1st round pick for Harden?  Clearly he can get a better return than the Kawhi trade."

"you know they don't have an argument when they bust out ""NBA PLAYER IS BETTER THAN INTERNET GUY"". Yeah Wiggins is also better than most NBA coaches and GMs, this is literally meaningless.   Plus Wiggins has been in the NBA for 6 seasons and has played a focal point in most of his years. He has mostly stagnated in his development. If Wiggins was even DeMar DeRozan good, the GSW wouldn't be destroyed everytime they face a half decent team"
"&gt; LeVert and Prince are 26 and you have them on reasonable contracts for a couple of years  And are also worse players. You don’t get bonus points for having great contracts, the goal is to win games and be the best team. Demar makes us a better team than both and FYI LeVert is only being paid like 9m less while being a significantly worse player.  &gt; Do you expect Derozan to play 40+ minutes a game? How good do you think he is anyway?  I expect him to play 30ish with his minutes rotated with our other 2 stars, but still closing games.  &gt; You'd be left with no maneuvering ability whatsoever... If Derozan won't re-sign you won't be able to ge  Agreed, but you need to take risks to win championships, and imo we are still 1 more offensive piece away. I think Demar can be that."
"DeMar might have the most underrated posters ever  Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Rubio, past Butler and then on prime Noah, TT, Singler the GOAT, Mozgod, pushes it to OT over Tolliver  I think Butler might be a better finisher but DeRozan is more explosive and not that far off"
"It kinda depends on the circumstance. Pop would prefer to hide derozan on defense and most teams don't have a 4 that is their best player. Keldon, White, and Murray take the guards/wings which are usually the most skilled/hardest to guard (Lillard, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, etc) and DeMar usually gets stuck on the 4/3 depending on the team. If we're playing the Bucks Keldon will be on Giannis, if we're playing the Heat he'll be guarding the 4"

That happens when Demar DeRozan is your 1st option
"Many said the same about Wade, Tony Parker, Demar Derozan, Ewing, Lebron, etc."
"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
Lowkey demar derozan is the closest thing we have to a modern day MJ. He's just way worse at everything.
"It doesn't make sense on paper for the spurs at all. We already have Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Patty Mills, and DeMar DeRozan running the offense."
Point god Demar derozan  Seriously all the “Demar is a 4 now” BS from early season has really distracted from the fact the guy is a legit floor general now
"We're shopping our vets who're on expiring deals like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge and potentially Trey Lyles as well.  I'm not expecting any of them to be getting traded, but those guys are on the table.   Spurs on in the middle of a rebuild, so makes sense to shop our vets. Patty and Demar have been excellent for us, so doubt Spurs will move them unless some irresistible offer comes along. Rudy and Trey Lyles are pretty useful pieces for teams looking to bolster their wing depth. Lamarcus is washed atm, so doubt we'll move him."
DeMar DeRozan.
"If Demar DeRozan wasn't a 2021 all star, then Popovich is the 2021 COTY.  Either DeRozan performed a godlike team carry or Pop coached cardboard cutouts into the playoff race, one or the other."
From your least most to least likely to be forgotten:   Marc Gasol   Demar Derozan    Ben Simmons    Kyle Lowry    Damian Lillard
"Kyle and Demar are amazing leaders. It's almost crazy picturing a team being led by Siakam, FVV, and OG since I still think of them as kids under Derozan and Lowry."
"I can understand you disagreeing with Sabonis, but DeRozan? You really think Julius Randle is better then DeMar DeRozan? 😬"
"They arent trading him, but he's tradable   Look at DeMar DeRozan, nobody in their dreams thought he would be traded, but here we are."
"For me - Demar Derozan  His entire moveset is like watching an the NBA equivalent of ballerina. There are vids of his off-season work outs where he's just flowing, and it's one of the best things to watch as his game seems to come second nature to him."
Demar Derozan has had a fairly similar career
I sometimes got Maggette vibes from early career DeMar DeRozan but he's become more versatile over time. There isn't really a great present day comparison for him.   I'd love to see Miles Bridges adopt some of Maggette's offensive game. He gets to the line a weirdly low amount given how athletic and strong he is and he's also a damn good free throw shooter. He needs to seek out contact more.
"&gt; Pop should have taken the Lakers offer and restocked the young talent  It's a little more complicated than pettiness. Pop had an 18 year streak of making the playoffs. No other team in the NBA had anything close. But the longest streak across all four major leagues is 20 years. Pop wanted to tie or break that. With the Lakers young core, especially with the Spurs young core, it wasn't sure that was going to happen.  For what it is worth, DeMar DeRozan led to them to finish the 2 Decades straight of making the playoffs. That's a pretty unbreakable record, given that the next closest team hasn't hit double digits. I can't speak for Spurs fans, but I think they take pride in that and Pop.  TL;DR: Pop (and the Spurs) have a pretty unbreakable record of 2 straight Decades of playoff appearances.  EDIT: To answer OP's question this trade was a win for what the Raptor wanted (championship) and what the Spurs wanted (playoff streak)."
Beal is pretty amazing in how he can be the leading scorer while not really relying on his 3pt shot much at all.   When he drives he does some Jordan/Harden shit every time where he contorts his body in 5 different directions and somehow lays in this graceful layup through two big men.   Not to mention his 12-16 ft jumpers are all so silky.    Give me Beal/Russ + Jimmy Butler + Demar DeRozan + Capela and lets become the greatest team of the pre-Three era
Kyle Lowry got away from Demar Derozan and everyone forgot about how he used to choke in the playoffs
Kobe was a good shooter bro I don’t know what you’re talking about. His percentages may not reflect that because he had horrible shot selection... but he could shoot from anywhere at any time with hands in his face or not.   Were talking about a guy that made 12 3s in a game and you’re comparing him to Demar derozan lol.   And why wouldn’t his game change with today’s game? We’ve seen players like Blake Griffin who couldn’t shoot anything when he came into league become a decent shooter so why wouldn’t Kobe adjust his game...

"Losing your best player is huge. Demar Derozan was a staple for them and would likely still be there if not for the Kawhi Leonard trade. The Raps saw a championship opportunity if they upgraded demar for Kawhi and they took it, knowing that they would likely only get Kawhi for one year.   It ended up working out and they won a championship, but they expensed their future for the present and now they are paying for that"
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"A less athletic, better shooting young Demar Derozan"
"Would reverse DeMar DeRozan be Nazored Ramed, DeRozan DeMar, or MarDe RozanDe?"
"&gt;and you trying to explain to me that's not how it works?  Yes, I am trying to explain many things to you -- although you seem pretty resistant to understanding.  &gt;DeMar DeRozan is currently listed as our starting power forward, and he clearly isn't a fucking power forward lmao.   This will clearly blow your mind, but basketball teams are not required to always play 1 C, 1 PF, 1 SF, 1 SG, and 1 PG.  They can play any combination that totals five players, believe it or not.  Teams can and do play two centers, or two point-guards, and many other combinations.  &gt; please look up the definition of a traditional power forward and then go watch game footage of Tim Duncan.   Tim Duncan's career breaks down into two very clear situations -- when he played center, and when he played alongside a better center in David Robinson, and was listed as a forward.  I realize that Duncan fans like to pretend that he wasn't a center -- despite that being the only position he ever played for teams other than San Antonio -- because he was a fairly unremarkable one most of the time, but that simply is not the case."
He's basically reverse Demar Derozan : he can't jump at all but has a lot of lateral quickness
"I think DeMar DeRozan. He’s put in time at SAS, lost his dad, elevated his game in SAS becoming a huge play maker, isn’t a big enough star for someone to criticize like KD, and has 2 fan bases that love him in Tor and Sas. I think DeRozan is the perfect storm of acceptable ring chasing.   OH, and bc he helped transform Tor and him being traded contributed to their ring."
"DeMar DeRozan a better player at the same position, more underrated and closer to a superstar imo."
Idk just how much better we’d be but I’d do a lot of DeMar Derozan on the warriors instead of like Kent Bazemore playing 25 minutes a game.
"&gt;Duncan was listed at center because he was playing center.  &gt;Duncan was a center in college, and would've been a center in the NBA his entire career, except for the fact that San Antonio already had a better player at that position.  When Duncan played for Team USA, he played.... drum roll... [center again.](https://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxviiith-olympiad-2004.aspx)  so... the years that he played alongside guys like Nazr Mohammaed, Oberto and Splitter - you trying to tell me those guys were actually power forwards while Duncan was listed at center?  because they clearly weren't power forwards on the court compared to Tim Duncan. the eye test was clear since they sure as fuck moved and played like traditional centers while on the court.  and you trying to explain to me that's not how it works? DeMar DeRozan is currently listed as our starting power forward, and he clearly isn't a fucking power forward lmao.  just because a guy is listed as playing a certain position, doesn't mean they actually PLAY that position.  please look up the definition of a traditional power forward and then go watch game footage of Tim Duncan."
Shades of Derozan against us. Although Demar left a few tenths of a second left.
Well when the raptors won the ECF Rachael Nichols asked about Demar derozan so I think she’s still way worse than Doris.
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i´ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren´t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
It's crazy how similar their playstyles are too. Cj is just Toronto DeRozan with a 3 ball while spurs Demar is just Toronto DeRozan with elite playmaking.
Knicks need a volume score aka DeMar derozan

"Norm was the man at the end! Derozan was going off on Covington, completely unstoppable, Norm took over defending his old mentor Demar and got a couple of stops, and puts in the winning bucket. What a game! I miss the dude man."
"DeRozan is so much better as a playmaker and sadly he's also a miles better defender (not saying much), and while CJ's a much better 3 point shooter, i take DeMar 8 times out of 10, especially next to Dame"
"Yeah, would the Spurs rather DeRozan walk for free?  He’s aging, I almost think paying him in SA would be way worse than Oubre who’s only 25. Pop has done a lot more with less talented players than Oubre.  Oubre coming off his Suns season this wouldn’t be as hotly debated imo. Obviously Demar is far better, I’m really not a big fan of Oubre, but I don’t think he’s a bad option for like 18M, especially in a small market where he fits the timeline."
"How much do you think DeMar would take at most?  Do the Warriors have to trade Wiggins to make room for DeMar?  Do you think DeMar would be happy with a bench role if he signs with the Warriors?  Ngl, a finishing lineup of Curry, Klay, Wiggins, DeRozan, and Draymond is interesting. Unlike Oubre, DeRozan is actually a midrange monster."
He has not finished his course at the DeMar DeRozan School of Pump Fake Offense.
"The Nuggets could probably use in considering Marie just went down but I don't know I've never been huge on DeMar DeRozan there's nowhere I can think where I would just want him to be, maybe back in Toronto idk"

Up until somebody says DeMar DeRozan or some shit
DeMar DeRozan
"I remember when both Wiggins and Parker were coming out of high school, a lot of people were saying these are the highest rated guys coming out since Lebron. I laughed. Watched both in college, wasn't impressed by either player. I said that Parker wasn't going to be very good in the league (unfortunately, my Bucks took him 2nd overall). I also said that Wiggins' ceiling was Demar Derozan, and people laughed at me for saying on youtube comments."
"I'm putting all my chips in on Ant, time will tell if that's a good investment. I'm barely staying above water after buying low on Marvin Bagley after his rookie year 😔  I kept the faith in Demar DeRozan over the years and he seems to have rehabilitated his image in San Antonio. Love that guy, hope he gets a ring wherever he goes in free agency."
Randle’s seriously looking like PF DeMar Derozan getting absolutely exposed in the playoffs
"He was never even the highest paid player.  In 16/17 he was tied with 6 other players for second highest paid behind LeBron and that's because all of those players signed the max 30% cap contract.  The next year new players signed their max deals and he fell off and on and on it goes every year.  He signed the full max 5 years with 7.5% raise IIRC meanwhile someone like DeMar DeRozan signed a 5 year max with a lesser raise.  At the time of the signing I would have taken Conley all day over DeMar.  DeMar was pretty empty, inefficient, no defense stats back on Toronto.  Not til Spurs I saw any real improvements."
Mean Demar Derozan
jimmy butler giving me some 2018 playoff demar derozan vibes
Jimmy Butler is just Demar Derozan with a better hairline
He’s pulling a Demar Derozan come playoff time
This is also the full DeMar DeRozan experience raptors fans got in the playoffs
"2003: Spurs trade the draft rights to Leandro Barbosa to Phoenix for a 2005 first-round pick  2005: San Antonio trades Malik Rose, the 2005 pick from Phoenix, and a 2006 first round pick for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer. Now, this wasn't bad, since Mohammed played a role in delivering the 2005 championship but then...  2005 NBA draft: New York Knicks draft David Lee with the #30 pick conveyed through the Malik Rose trade.  ----  2011: San Antonio trades George Hill to Indiana for the 15th pick (Kawhi Leonard) and the 42nd pick (Davis Bertans).  2018: San Antonio trades Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl, and a 2019 first round pick (Keldon Johnson)."
Hot Take: Sign and Trade for DeMar DeRozan with KP straight up.
Demar Derozan?
Dude shouldve threw up some gang signs like John Wall and Demar Derozan do sometimes
Might be 3rd best option unless you have a real all nba player on team.  The Demar Derozan rumor signing still wouldn’t get them past this same hawks team next year. They need a lot more
derozan would be a better playmaker for y’all. not even joking 😭  demar has evolved into an elite playmaker. lonzo is currently a 3&amp;D PG who is more of a roleplayer
Demar Derozan joins the Lakers after a failed playoff run
This sounds like Demar Derozan to me

Remember when ESPN thought he was better than DeMar DeRozan?
No one tell him about DeMar DeRozan to Kawhi Leonard either.
"It’s not hard at all, Demar DeRozan had a negative on/off in all but like one of his season in Toronto. He was wildly overrated.   Lowry was clearly their best player."
The next super team being in Chicago when the Bulls win the lottery get Cade Cunningham and sign Demar Derozan and sign Rose
CJ “”DeMar Derozan” McCollum
"Julius ""Demar Derozan"" Randle"
What are the odds the Knicks max DeMar Derozan next season
"uhhhh theres a pretty big difference between demar derozan leading a team and kawhi leonard leading a team, or even jonas valinchunas as your starting centre versus marc gasol lol....goddam casual"
"Yeah cause we'd have expected a ""slightly better than Scottie Pippen"" type of guy and instead would've gotten ""slightly better than Demar Derozan"" type of guy.  Great player but he needs to start guarding Luka the way he guarded Lebron in the finals all those years ago."
"Miami Heat: Dwyane Wade (13x All-Star, 1x Finals MVP, 8x All-NBA, 3x All-Defensive, 1x Scoring Champion) and Chris Bosh (11x All-Star, 1x All-NBA, HoF 2021)  Cleveland Cavaliers: Kyrie Irving (7x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, 50-40-90 club) and Kevin Love (5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, NBA MIP, 1x Rebounding Champion)  For almost all of the series with that heat team, Dwyane Wade would have been the best player on the court without LeBron. Some series Chris Bosh would have been the best behind them too. Kyrie would have been the second best player in the Atlanta series and the Detroit series in 2016. Kevin Love was also better than anyone on Detroit and probably Atlanta too. DeMar DeRozan was incredible in 2016 but although he was considered ahead of Kyrie, it's not open and shut 100%. so there's an argument that LeBron's team still had the best player on the court without him all the way until they faced Curry in the finals  He's LeGM for a reason"
"I think Miami actually makes an interesting offer for the Clips. Any number of Bam, Herro, Duncan (S&amp;T), or Dragic could head to LA.   Same with Atlanta. Collins and Hunter would be an interesting trade.  San Antonio could give the Clippers DeMar Derozan and DeJounte Murray for PG"
"DeMar DeRozan and Chris Paul have a path to the Knicks if Dolan wants to pay.   A big 3 of CP3, Randle and DeMar rounded out by Mitchell Robinson, Barrett and Quickley is a damn legit squad."
“He’s probably the best player we have in the midrange outside of DeMar DeRozan”  Ironic
The only ones I differ are:  Celtics: Larry Bird  Pistons: Chauncey Billups  Grizzlies: Zach Randolph  Knicks: Jeremy Lin  Magic: Dwight Howard  Suns: Steve Nash  Sonics: Gary Payton  Raptors: DeMar DeRozan
Ariza been a bitch his whole career.  I remember back in 09 when he swung on a rookie DeMar DeRozan [after he got stripped of the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrgd5v184Xs)
DeMar DeRozan better than Jimmy Butler
"This sub hates ""foul baiting flopper"" Trae Young (FTR - .491).    This sub loves ""great player never flopped"" DeMar DeRozan (FTR - .478).   Sometimes you have to just sit back and admire the inconsistency."
I heard Demar derozan is a free agent this year
"When Demar was drafted by the Raptors he was utter trash despite the hype. He was a raw player who couldn't dribble, couldn't shoot or pass. The Raps, **especially Dwane Casey**, gave Derozan and Lowry a lot of leeway to improve. Demar put in the work, but he knew he had the coach and org helping him along.  Had Demar been drafted on a winning squad who needed a polished player, he would have not turned out to be the player he is today. What Kwame says makes sense, he wasn't given a fair shot to improve and 3 years into his career was labelled a role player and bust.  In the NBA your environment and label dictate your success. Come in a 27th pick, you will have to work twice as hard as the 4th pick to get minutes and shots.  Get labelled a role player? Good luck changing that narrative even if you turn out to be a late bloomer.  Get drafted by a team with championship hopes and vets? Good luck getting minutes."
Lebron played in the weakest conference of all-time. Facing players like Al Horford and Demar Derozan.  Who cares about getting to the finals by default and losing.
Did everyone simply forget about how efficient Demar Derozan is with his midrange J?
Paul “Demar Derozan” George
jimmy pulling a demar derozan rn
Sign and trades are always fun.  Perhaps a lightly used DeMar Derozan?
Grizzlies is gonna choke again lol. This grizzlies team has been a consistent choker. They choked a 20 point lead in 5mins against the spurs. They only won spurs because demar derozan was atrocious

"OP should do it again in absolute terms.  People are mistakingly reading this as the Spurs being stuck in the 90s or something.  Nope, trust me EVERY team is shooting the 3 at record amounts.  It's just that some teams (who don't rely on a particular superstar's interior shot) are building their entire rosters based on modern analytics.  This is a snapshot that exaggerates the (typically small) differences in shot selection.  It makes for a more entertaining read because a well known player can influence the graph so much.  But yeah, it's a 3-point game leaguewide now- even for squads DeMar DeRozan has played on.  😆"
Pops has made funny remarks about the 3-ball over the years but I guarantee the Spurs are a more modern ball club than any franchise would've been ten years ago.  This particular graph is the result of DeMar DeRozan far more than coaching preference.  It is kind of ironically humorous though.
Best player right now is DeMar DeRozan.  They also don't really have any great shooter.  Best is Patty Mills who's at 37.5% on 6 attempts.  Then theres Rudy Gay at 38% but on 4 attempts.  Pops is just working with what he has.
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

You can have a sign and traded DeMar Derozan!!!
There was only one good play-in game and it was because it featured a contender that was dealing with injuries all season  Most years you're gonna get Buddy Hield vs DeMar DeRozan or Sexton vs Rozier
Sabions the DeMar derozan of centers
Demar Derozan is literally just Michael Jordan but unlucky and not as good.
"You miss all the shots you don’t take - Wayne Gretzky, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Dejounte Murray."
"The Raptors make this one fun since I can do it completely via Raptors players, but Freddy and Hakeem Olajuwon lol    - Fred Van Vleet - Demar DeRozan - Chris Bosh - Vince Carter - Hakeem Olajuwon  It's crazy to me how every Toronto star player had at least one season with the previous gen's star player."
"&gt;we would have been clowned   You guys are clowned now for taking a rotation center and demar derozan and trading away green and Kawhi...  No one is clowing the Spurs for taking a future star, and hart+picks. That’s actually a solid package for kawhi considering he literally just sat out a year and was on the last season of his contract.    &gt;are we forgetting the reason lakers traded the farm for Ad  Because AD forced his way there. They missed out on kawhi because pop was too prideful to accept a better deal if it meant helping a team that killed him over his entire career and pg wasn’t worth what they wanted from the lakers.   &gt;in hindsight it could have been better   It’s not even hindsight. Trading green and kawhi for derozan was a wtf move even at the time especially with the lakers offer publicly in the table. No one thinks that’s a good trade at the time or now   You guys are now going to let derozan walk and green was a key piece in two title runs since that trade. Spurs literally got nothing from that deal when they could be sitting on a 20ppg future all star on a 5 year contract"

Not saying Brooks isn’t a great defender but this is Demar Derozan and the playoffs we’re talking about. Career 41.8% FG and 50.3% TS in the playoffs. Demar has shot below 40% from the field in 43% of his career playoff games.
Well that and DeMar DeRozan got replaced by DeMar DeChokezan
"Anthony ""DeMar DeRozan"" Davis"
Orlando magic legend Demar Derozan incoming
Demar Derozan with a classic 5 of 21 shooting performance. I hate this.
Demar Derozan was already in playoff mode
"""Im like Demar Derozan. When I shoot, it goes in.""  That lyrics from that one song did not age well."
May be seeing the last of Demar Derozan as a Spur.  Love his game.
Pelicans should sign Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan and reunite the best buds for an awesome starting 5
Good guy DeMar DeRozan.
They have money for another star and I’m liking DeMar Derozan or Bradley Beal over there
I feel like Bradley Beal is low key Demar Derozan with just a little more shooting range
"Kawhi in New York would be lethal in fact send Demar DeRozan there too because Knicks can afford two stars just to shit on the Spurs, Raptors, and LA for that matter."
"The talent in the play in tournament is just insane.   Hayward/Rozier/LaMelo  Brogdon/Turner/Sabonis  Beal/Westbrook  Tatum/Brown/Kembert  LeBron/AD  Steph/Wiggins/Draymond  DeMar ""De82nd"" DeRozan  Ja/JJJ/JV  shits wild."
"The Knicks have shitloads of cap space this summer so they could just sign someone outright. I'm guessing Kawhi would be their top target, if it's even a possibility that he'd leave LA, but if not him then maybe DeMar DeRozan?"
"The shots that have completely vanished since the 90s are mostly still jump shots, they're just the inefficient ones.   Nobody spots up inside the 3-point line, nobody runs plays to generate baseline jumpers on the sides of the key, and unless you're Kawhi Leonard or DeMar DeRozan, you probably don't take long 2s off the dribble.   Post-ups are down overall, but they're far from dead. Joel Embiid was automatic facing up in the post for this entire season; teams just aren't (or shouldn't be) wasting touches on post possessions for guys like Drummond, or like when Dwight Howard was in Charlotte and Atlanta."
"Well Mortal Kombat only had seven characters:  Scorpion - Lebron (Always bringing other stars to play with him. ""GET OVER HERE!"")  Sub Zero - Russ (Ice in his veins. Also his 3-pt shot is ice cold)  Rayden - Steph (Enjoys fucking the sky)  Johnny Cage - Lamelo Ball (Showmanship!)  Liu Kang - Demar Derozan (Spams from mid-range)  Kano - Ja Morant (Real first name is Temetrius)  Sonya - Jason Tatum (Looks good in green)"
"Kyrie was on a top of the line defensive team, hello? The 2017-2018 Celtics were literally the best defensive team in the NBA. They were better defensively than we were. Kyrie got exactly 0 MVP votes and couldn't make 3rd team over Oladipo or DeRozan. He was also the clear second fiddle kn the team behind Tatum to the point that Kyrie started sulking and demanded a trade.   Sometimes I think this gets overlooked so I just want to repeat it. Kyrie has made two All-NBA teams. Since his career began he was overlooked for All-NBA in favor of such superstars as Demar DeRozan (twice), Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo.  At no point since 2014 has Kyrie been the best player on his team. The top 7 players in the NBA could all miss an entire season and he would still not be a serious MVP contender because guys like PG, Dame and Butler are just better than he is. Kyrie has incredible skill, but he's not an MVP level player."
"o, guess he issued separate challenges to specific players and not just one to every team.

It's just a continuation of it by bleacher report for all those players."
"Mostly athletic ones. The Demar Derozan one cracked me up though: ""I challenge you to rekindle a lost friendship from your youth in Compton"""
Idk about that. He's just a scorer. He can't do anything else on the court. He also played against plumbers and milk men. Jordan in today's game would be comparable to Demar Derozan.
"CP3. I’d compare it to the Lowry-Derozan years on the Raps. Even if Demar put up better numbers (counting stats, not advanced), Lowry was always the better player."

Who’s a better option on the Spurs in late game situations other than Demar DeRozan though?
Good news for the Grizz the Spurs have DeMar  Derozan and not Curry
"Lance Stephenson, Demar Derozan, or Joakim Noah would be the best fits imo"
"I don't need to watch him to know he has neither the tools, desire, or reputation.   For what its worth I went looking on a few metrics for him and my finger got tired from scrolling.  Hes 234th out of 250 in defensive raptor, for example. In the same area as Demar Derozan, Carmelo Anthony, DeAngelo Russell, Damian Lillard and Trae Young. Tell me defensive Raptor isn't on to something."
"&gt;He def didn’t belong on that USC team, he was solely there because he was a package deal with DeMar DeRozan.  He def didn't belong in the rap game neither lol.  He was solely there because he was Master P's son."
"He def didn’t belong on that USC team, he was solely there because he was a package deal with DeMar DeRozan."
Demar Derozan
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
Demar Derozan?
Raptor fans would say Demar Derozan but it should be more like Jimmy Butler level imo
"Why does everyone want us to get DeMar? I love his playstyle, but we cannot have another starter that can't shoot threes. Jimmy and Bam hit some, yeah, Jimmy even hit 2 against Philly but they don't stretch the floor. If we get DeRozan, we're gonna have 90s spacing and that's not gonna cut it, especially now that Duncan is getting more attention."
"I'm no Derozan expert, but from what I understand about him I'm surprised Book isn't viewed as a DeMar comp more often"
"Remember when the All-Star Saturday night event program was leaked early and had an event where you could ""meet slam dunk contest winner Blake Griffin"" before the contest had even taken place. Then Demar DeRozan went off the side of the backboard between the legs and got a lower score than Blake Griffin who went off the side of the backboard and windmilled? But if Blake didn't get a higher score at that moment he would have been eliminated in the first round. Now try to remember how Blake was the worst of the 4 dunkers in the contest. But then later in the competition Blake would jump over the hood of a Kia and end up winning, which revealed the plan all along. That was near the beginning of the NBA/Kia partnership 🙄"
"The reason Scottie is top 50, and guys like Kemp and Johnson aren't mentioned is cause Scottie was part of a dynasty team. If he was drafted to the Hornets instead, who knows what would have happened, maybe he'd be another 90s all star on a middling team like Kevin Johnson or Tim Hardaway.  Maybe he still leads his team to the playoffs but they get bounced early. It's not like 50 wins and the second round (what Scottie did in 94) is unprecedented. About 8 players do that every year.  Like DeMar DeRozan led his team as far as Scottie did as the #1 option. As did plenty of other all stars over the years like PG, Butler, Blake Griffin, Vince Carter. Etc.  Also people never acknowledge how that Jordan-less Bulls team in 94 still had Horace Grant. Then in 95 when grant left, before Jordan came back, they were under .500. Grant was a big part of that first 3 peat before they got Harper and Rodman. Him and Scottie were rookies the same year as well. So it wasn't just Scottie that put them over the hump or helped that team win games."
DeMar DeRozan
"&gt; DeAndre Jordan, DeMarcus 'Boogie' Cousins, DeMar Derozan and possibly 3 other players went out on the town Wednesday night in Rio and strolled into Termas Monte Carlo ... which Rolling Stone called 'one of the high end brothels in Rio.'""  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carmelo-anthony-talks-about-alleged-accidental-us-basketball-brothel-visit/"
yes Jordan's 38 made the playoffs while Lebron's 35 doesn't. what's so unfair about that?  Jordan only played 17 games when the Bulls won 30. came back from a broken foot and still dropped 60 wewwww  yeah East so garbage when Jordan had to play 5 HOF in the 1st round while Lebron was playing real legends like Demar Derozan
"&gt;So to answer that question, how I feel having Poetl, DeMar AND (you forgot one) Keldon Johnson vs. Ingram and what would likely have been the 30th pick? (That was the reported package)  Well now it's my turn to correct you, as you forgot the trade also included Danny Green, and they didn't trade for Keldon Johnson, but rather Toronto's 1st round pick in 2019, which turned out to be the 29th pick in the draft. If the Lakers had LeBron and Kawhi I'm sure the pick they sent San Antonio would have been no worse than that, as the Warriors still had KD that year and Milwaukee had the league's best record with 60 wins (the Warriors had 57).   So what we're actually talking about is Danny Green and Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and the 29th pick vs. Ingram and basically the same pick for just Kawhi. So really it's a question of whether you'd rather have Ingram and possibly Danny Green or just Jacob Poeltl, since the pick would have been the same and DeRozan is probably gone. Was the DeRozan era really that great in San Antonio that you're happy with that return?"
"JV was better than both the trash bros in 2014-2015. Powell won the game 7 vs. the Pacers. Derozan and Lowry were about equally trash all of those years and it's revisionist history for Raptors fans to say Lowry was never the problem, just because he stayed and DeMar got shipped. If Lowry was traded for kawhi fans would say the opposite.  Also Dwane Casey's lack of an offensive gameplan was the biggest issue. Way more than the talent. Literally made zero adjustments and watched his team get swept multiple years. LeBron was telling Patrick Patterson where to stand on an inbounds play for Christ's sake."
"Lillard obviously, Drexler was a glorified role player who was just good in a weaker era. He's just shitty DeMar DeRozan in this era"
You'll overpay DeMar DeRozan and you'll like it.
"Lou Will, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Chuck Hayes, and Amir Johnson still have a group chat going from their Toronto days. That's incredible."
"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."
Trying to find the best combination of dope name and actual skill/talent. Here's my starting 5:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - Zach LaVine  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Zion Williamson  C - Bam Adebayo
Yes. That would be unequivocally more impressive than MJ leading a team to 6 rings that won 56 games without him. Without Pippen he’s a more clutch Demar Derozan.
"DeMar DeRozan is who came to mind for me. And I'd say he's had about as good of a career as Wall, so we're on the same page."
DeMar Derozan and Jokic have the best footwork in the game today
huh? Giannis is a 2x MVP + DPOY  who was Lebron's toughest opponent? Demar Derozan?
"who is the best player Lebron **ever** beat from the eastern conference?  Demar Derozan? Paul George? 60 year old KG?  The east was cupcake as fuck for *years*. People love to tout the finals appearances, but it's true it's not really as impressive when almost every good team besides the Heat/Cavs played in the West for what 6 years?"
"the east has *not* always had soild teams.   The Boston Big 3 Celtics were the best team Lebron ever played in the east. The Lowry/Derozan Raptors and Paul George Pacers were probably 2 and 3. I can't even think of who would be 4th best. The hurt/baby Celtics with Tatum?  The only team Lebron ever beat that would have possibly made it out of the west were the Celtics with KG/Pierce/Allen all aging, albeit a prime much scarier than the nephews remember Rondo.   Not trying to knock Lebron but the competition in the east was **bad** for a long while. Paul George, Demar Derozan, Roy Hibbert being the best players you faced for over 5 years is as cakewalk as it gets."
"Giannis had a tougher path. even without Harden, Lebron has never played a team as good as the KD-Kyrie Nets in the East  his toughest opponent for several years was Demar Derozan lmao"
really says a lot when Lebron's biggest opponent in the East for several years was Demar Derozan lmao  no offense but Demar paired with the GOAT coach Poppovich in the West couldn't even make the playoffs

"&gt; DeMar DeRozan caliber of player with better range  Prime Derozan with better range is like a top 5 player in this league, I feel Knicks would be really happy with that. If Sexton becomes Lavine that would be great for the Cavs as well"
"Demar derozan, smooth, to his spots, bucket"
"That’s what he feels comfortable shooting. I had Aldridge on the spurs. I agree. It’s a terrible shot. Demar derozan shots are also terrible. Would much rather have wide open shots, but that’s how those players vibe. Basketball is about flow as much as anything. If one player has too much usage, the other players aren’t in flow. A great player can find flow at any time. It’s the great players job to help the lesser players find their flow."
"You mean he beat 35 year old Garnett after assembling super team in Miami what a feat! And yeah that Chicago team was insane, how could he beat Chicago when he only had Dwayne Wade and Bosh and Chicago had Rose and, I don’t know, Boozer?   The Raptors best player was the world beating superstar Demar Derozan, so I could see how that would cause issues. (And Love wasn’t injured in 18)  I have no idea why this is considered “discrediting”. Am I lying? I literally just said who played on those teams and how no one in their right mind would consider them good teams. That’s just the truth."
"yeah, I was thinking DeMar DeRozan sign and trade and Drew Eubanks oughta cover it. they might have to throw in a pick or two tho lmao"
"Okay but then explain:  * Dwight Howard * Lamarcus Aldridge  * DeMar DeRozan * Ibaka * Westbrook  * Paul George  * Harden * Hayward  * Whiteside   Basically Kawhi, LeBron, and Carmelo picked big cities in the last decade and that’s it.   Most of the time big cities are leverage. Most players re-signed with their team or went where they had a shot at the title"
How's this for a line up of players with shitty rookie years:  James Harden  Kobe Bryant  Kawhi Leonard  Demar DeRozan  Dirk Nowitzki
"When Drake said ""my city love me like DeMar DeRozan"" he wasn't talking about San Antonio"
"I wasn't sure about including Kobe but when it comes to SG's this decade it's Harden and then I don't think anyone comes close. The only other players I could think of was Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler and DeMar DeRozan lol"
"Not a Spurs fan, but this helped me understand her coaching style: [https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/](https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/)"
I would rather have a Kevin Porter Jr than a DeMar DeRozan.   (card)
This is the classic post retirement bump. Joe Johnson was the DeMar DeRozan of his era.
"They made the playoffs in both 2017 and 2018. In 2017, they lost because Kawhi got hurt. In 2018, DeMar Derozan was their best player and they still made the playoffs in the western conference. Even the last two years, they were only just a little under .500. Again, with Derozan as their best player in the western conference.   How is that “sucking”? Do you even watch basketball?"
"I am so jealous of the Knicks. This year they were everything we though we’d be. New coach instills great culture and improvement from the young players and gets the team to the playoffs and we have resources to get a big time player. We should still be decent but the Knicks, while they have a few key guys to re-sign, can have $70 million in cap space to sign a top point guard, Demar Derozan, and a shooter plus have two firsts and two seconds they can package to move up for a lottery prospect. They’re gonna be a 50 win team next season"
"So what? Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin, and Alonzo Mourning all finished 3rd for MVP too.  So in Scotties absolute best year he was basically PG-13 (although he never had a year as good as 2019 PG). He's nowhere near a top 25 all time player or on the level a lot of people put him.  The other claim of leading his team to a second round exit that year. Does no one realize that literally 8 players do that every year. Like DeMar DeRozan and Donovan Mitchell have led their teams as far as Scottie did as a first option.  It's just strange to me that when people claim Scottie is overrated nowadays, everyone retorts with this 1994 season which doesn't do anything other than prove that his absolute peak was a nothing special."
"I can see that you're not blaming players for this, but for anyone who thinks players (or even just stars) should try to stay in one place, remember what they did to DeMar DeRozan, a perennial all-star starter, beloved by the fan base, coming off a year where he became a plus defender, averaged 28 ppg, and improved his 3 pointer as well while leading the team (along with Lowry) to the 1st seed (although in the East, and although no one really thought they were going to come out of the East over the Cavs and Celtics, still an accomplishment). They traded him for an injure Kawhi Leonard. Obviously, Kawhi was a big addition for the Raptors, but they used that DeRozan was underpaid, since he'd taken a loyalty discount when he could have made more money for the Lakers close to home, and because that made his contract more valuable, they were also able to get Danny Green. They treated him like a stepping stone, an asset. So don't expect players to trust the franchises beyond exactly what the contract says.  See also, Isaiah Thomas."
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
Facts. Jordan is just a bigger DeMar DeRozan too
Aka The Eastern Conference and Demar DeRozan.
Demar Derozan
"But who? No star has the market yet. And there's no marquee FA. The only star I could see going there is DeMar DeRozan and he doesn't move the needle. Plus, I think DeMar would rather play in the East or for an LA team."
31 y/o DeMar DeRozan??
Did you just say that demar derozan is the greatest nba player of all time?
"To everyone who says DeMar DeRozan isnt the greatest nba player of all time, he would have 3 rings if LeBron didnt exist. His last 3 playoff series L in Toronto was in the hands of LeBron James."
"Well example for Dame- Celtics:Jaylen Brown,Marcus Smart and a future first round pick.   The examples for Simmons are like I was saying, the Wiggins trades, DeMar DeRozan, those level of players, I’ll admit the Ben Simmons hate is extreme but I feel like Portland isn’t going to pull the trigger on a trade, and I feel like the 76ers are going to panic trade so they don’t feel like they have another Lowery and Harden situation and are going to go full do or die for a championship.  It’s not me saying a Lillard for Simmons trade would never happen but I feel like Portland isn’t truly shopping Lillard…yet, and more realistically teams are offering weaker packages after the playoffs this year."
"I was about to say maybe they can get Lowry and DeRozan to take discounts in order to make a run at Kawhi (since I saw an article saying that he is fed up with Clippers medical staff and we know he likes the Raptors on this front), but I think it's going to be a long time before any player, let alone DeMar DeRozan trusts the Raptors enough to take a pay cut after what they did to...DeMar Derozan."
"I understand that but to treat him like this Demar Derozan level of choker is unreal lol, it was his first time in the playoffs and not only that he was the main focus of the other team's defense, a team who just from top to bottom had a better overrall roster than we did. They added Deandre Hunter right before the playoffs started and he really fucked us up, one of the best defenders in the league"
DeMar Derozan sign and trade (and yes I know it doesn’t work for the draft day trade.
Shoulda just taken the rumored Lamarcus deal last season.  /s     Now they are gonna have to take a Demar Derozan sign and trade...
DeMar DeRozan.
"She gets a lot of praise from her own players: [https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/](https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/)  I'm fine if they determined she wasn't the right person for the job.  Heck, if you want to keep Dame happy and he didn't want her that's fine too.  But you don't leak out this report unless you are trying to justify not picking her and picking Billups instead.  And that's way worse than just admitting the reason you wanted to hire Billups."
Jose Calderon  Demar DeRozan   Vince Carter  Chris Bosh   Jonas Valanciunas
"The whole heartbreak of losing DeMar DeRozan, but getting Kawhi Leonard and a championship, was a whirlwind for us Toronto Raptors fans. I love DeMar, but seeing Toronto get a ring didn't make it as sad lol."
"Maybe I'm forgetting some people, but other than this (which is a 90% chance that Skip is just throwing shit at the wall and hoping he ends up being lucky enough to be right without knowing it), what else is exciting about the off-season?  CP3 opting out for one more big payday, some damaged assets like Simmons and McCollum possibly being moved around, and a FA class whose best players (excluding CP3's opt out and the slim chance of Kawhi) are.....   Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan?  Looking at the list, I can't even think of who I'd put up next after them.  Maybe THJ?  Doesn't exactly sound exciting to me (barring the Thunder going trade-crazy with all their assets/getting more assets, of course)."
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
What?  What period of time was DeMar Derozan ever the best Spurs 3pt shooter?
DeMar Derozan
"How about making an open layup once in a while? Or a shot? You can’t always count on steph curry to shoot over 3 people all the time to win lol. It baffles me how some nba players can’t shoot when they dedicate their whole lives to the sport. If dray could actually make a bucket once in a while then the whole warriors team would improve 10 fold and then they would actually have a legitimate big 3.   I usually don’t comment and try not to sound like a hater but god damn draymond irritates me the most. Talks like he’s on Lebron James level or something. Look at demar Derozan, couldn’t shoot, pass, dribble or defend when he got into the league. Now he has improved that tenfold, same with Tatum, same with Brandon Ingram, same with siakim . List goes on bruv. Draymond is really good at defence but he’s one dimensional. Get better at other parts of your game then talk"
"What the point of being a DPOY runner up and a multi-all star before 25 years old if none of that helps towards winning a championship? At the end of the day the best players are the ones who can get buckets. Demar is a bonafied bucket getter, ben simmons has proven to be an offensive liability, literally had to be sat out during the 4th quarter during stretches due to his lack of offensive ability and horrible free throw shooting. There is no way the spurs are going to trade demar derozan AND ADD ONTOP OF THAT for a player as 1 dimensional as ben simmons. Guy has proven to be supremely overrated by continuing to regress every year. All of his numbers have continued to decrease since his rookie year. Absolutely unnacceptable."
Kyle Lowry and demar derozan vs indy2016
why would anyone criticize a player for having easy Finals paths? what doesn't make sense is praising a player for making Finals when his toughest opponent is Demar Derozan while criticizing a player for not making the Finals when he had to slog through 3 rounds of elite West teams every year
"glad to see some positive takes on the comment section here!  i'll answer op tho. no, we definitely not. i gotta say that we really went undercover this season, i really doubt ppl saw spurs games outside of when their favourite team played us, maybe even not. we are currently seen as a trash team, it's easy to see everyone calling us out to ""click the rebuilding button"" but the situation here is way different from the common understading of us. i even made a extremely long [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you wanna give it a try! ^(i don't wanna  pass for a spammer lmoa, but that's my complete point of view, just if you want) . Anyway, what ppl mainly do not realize IMO is our core. It seems crazy to me how much even spurs fans undervalue the potential of our young guns, and also that we have ton of them. My main counterpoint is this: OP falls into the same trap kinda everyone fall into: not give them enough time. (it's not a dissing, chill out, sorry if i ever offend you in any way, not my intention) There have ton of bad coincidences in our development route and if you don't follow the Spurs with attention it's easy to miss them. We don't do the same things other teams do, rookies do not get playing time, vets eat young players' playing time. I'll go player by player: Keldon Johnson just finished his sophomore season, but in his rookie year he only played in the bubble for us, he did'nt even played three digits games in the NBA! And he was played out of his position too, guarding crazy opponets like Zion, AD, LBJ, literally always the best forward on the opposing team. DJ spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got a solid amount of minutes in the second season, he torn his ACL in preaseaon headed to his 3rd season, he came back after this devastating injury and already Spurs fans wanted to give up on him because he did not perform that well, and last season he was clearly our briightest young player. Oh, he was in the 2nd Defensive Team according to bball-index. Derrick White again spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got solid minutes because of DJ's injury, in the third season then played ok, but in the Bubble showed a crazy improvement (check out his stats there) and was clearly our best player, even arguably better than DeMar; this season tho he injured his foot twice, his toe twice, got COVID, injured his ankle, could stay healthy; he did need time to get back to his bubble form and when he did man he was amazing, just again clearly our best player. Assuming he stays healthy, dude is a baller, cannot wait till he get recognized. Devin Vassell, our rookie, our 4th lottery pick ever, seems like everyoen forgot about him, which is crazy. Dude is arugably one of the best defender in the team and even his rookie class, jsut amazing. He got COVID and then he couldn't buy a shot. Also, he didn't get those many minutes, again, for the reason I explained before, we tend to overplay the vets. Definitely a bright future. Lonnie Walker is a polarizing player in the sub, but probalby got asked to do too much, but he absolutely he didn't play that well, but now let's not act like he was complete garbage. Obviously he needs to work a lot this offseason, especially on defense and BBIQ plays, but he really stepped up in terms of offense, he polished his jumpshot and his ability to finish at the rim. He came to the league as a raw talent, spent his first year in Austin, second one barely got minutes because of Forbes, Belinelli, COVID. Last season he finally got minutes and he did ok, maybe not as much as everyone expected, himself included. Next season I gonna be really important for Lonnie! I think that he could be able to have good defensive player with him on the court that can help him and cover his weaknesses. Also, he will come off the bench and won't start. So playing against weaker opponents, being probably the go-to-guy oon offense off the bench, without DeRozan who is not a good defender and instead have Tre and Devin, extremely valid defender, will help him. If he still struggle a lot, decisions have to be taken, definitely. I'm still a huge believer. Then Jakob Poeltl stepped up this season and has been a really good player for us, an underrated defender, i think the best one in terms of contesting the shots under the rim in the whole league, he got into the 3rd defensive team for bbal-index too! Consider also dudes like Tre Jones and Luka Samanic who have a solid chance to be good role players for us too.  I also gotta admit the we didn't rightly used our resources yeah. DeMar clearly do not fit us and we should have traded him before and the deadline was our last chance, unless we pull an extension-and-trade, we will lose him for nothing, we could have gotten at least a Pick around 20s. Also we misplayed many players that damaged our young guys fit in the team. for example by playing bad defenders like forbes and demar, dj had had a tough time that season, and this was mad clear, white should have played alongside dj like we do now. in the bubble jakob showed how aldridge wasn't good for us anymore and we should have traded him immediately, we did not and lost him for nothing. also this season, lonnie and demar were bad defensibily, it was clear also that keldon was playing outside of his natural position. i do not wanna sound like an homer lmao, even thoon my inside i know i am at least a little bit, but this is my point of view.  TLDR: so yeah, it comes down to ajust these things and finally move on and leave the keys to the young guys even if it means lose more. i think tho he ready to at least compete for the 8th seed, these guys are really mad hungry and have the right mentality to get to the next level one day, we just need to give them time and the right playing time! cannot wait for next season! also, we have ton of cap space. oh, i urge you again to watch my full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"

"You're missing the point.   It doesn't matter *how* Pippen gets his name out there. The more people who see is name, good or bad, means that *something* interesting involving him has happened.   Case in point - LOADS AND LOADS of people are interested in this tweet. One of the most successful NBA personalities, Stephen A., replied to this stupid tweet.  Loads of people are looking at this and it's *fun* because Scottie is so wrong here.   Now look at something like an ESPN top 100 list. It is created every year and every single year they have people listed in completely asinine spots. Do you think they do that on accident? It *effortlessly* generates views, clicks and interest. People are excited for those to come out so they can pick them apart, feel superior, and get a bunch of likes on the internet. Or they can have discussing the dumb shit ESPN said about DeMar DeRozan this time around.   If Pippen has a book coming out in five months, then I would almost guarantee this tweet from him is crafted with care by him and his publicist."

"Jordan stopped Stockton/Malone, Payton/Kemp, Barkley, Mark Price, Ewing, Dominique, Alonzo, Tim Hardaway, Reggie Miller  Lebron stopped Demar Derozan   Lebron is the GOAT"
You’re best player was Demar Derozan lol
DeMar DeRozan
I don’t think DeRozan is what Philly needs. He’s obviously not Simmons level of bad in terms of shooting but you still want the maximum amount of 3 point shooting possible around Embiid and DeRozan is not that.   If Beal or Lavine demand out they should offer Simmons + whatever picks it takes to get it done. Lavine or Beal fit Embiid both play style wise and age wise much better than DeMar.
Demar Derozan has to be on this list unless he’s listed at the same position as Kawhi.
"&gt; 2009 has Harden/Curry/Rubio  Did you just put *Rubio* ahead of Blake, Jrue, and Demar DeRozan?  '11 should be mentioned, too. (Kawhi, Kyrie, Kemba, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Vuc, Klay)   '12 was AD/Dame/Draymond/Beal/Middleton which ain't bad, either."
"Since 03 I would say the best 2 are 09 and 11.  09 has Blake Griffin, James Harden and Stephen Curry who will make the HoF (2 of whom reached MVP level), also had multi-time All Star Demar DeRozan who honestly might get into the Hof, pls Jrue Holdiay and Jeff Teague all made at least one All Star team.  Then 2011 you have Kawhi, Kyrie, Klay, Jimmy Butler who are all probably going to make the HoF, plus two additional All Star players in Kemba and Vuc.  And as for your last statement, for this class to be better than 03, either Luka would have to basically be the GOAT, with another player being like Top 20 all time, OR, this class would to have like 3-4 guys be Top 10-15 players.  For 96, again, Luka will need to end up being one of the 10 best players ever, with Trae Young and Ayton being on the short list for consideration as Top 30 guys.  I'm sorry, I can't say ""yeah, I really see that happening""."
bald 90's version of demar derozan
"He's a glorified, bald headed Demar Derozan that was lucky he was playing in a watered down league and through Nike's propaganda was sold world wide as some mythological figure that cannot be criticized at the perfect time when media was more controlled in the narratives that got pushed to the masses."
DeMar derozan
Nah Kawhi was whack for that I definitely have rooted against him on other teams because. Also the literally everyone most Suns hated on the Spurs are pretty much gone now.  I even like players like Keldon Johnson and Demar Derozan.
Overrated: Tracy McGrady  Underrated: Demar Derozan
he's not wrong mj would just be a bald demar derozan if he played in today's era
You could have a demar derozan! He’s even a free agent!
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
"I read a [solid article](https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/) explaining what kind of coach she is. Basically a player's coach in the mold of Pop (obviously) and someone who's not afraid to push her players. Not to mention she was instrumental in developing the young guys in SA. From the article:  &gt;She’s a noble leader, one who connects with players and teaches them to be the best versions of themselves. Her imprint has made a noticeable impact on the growth and development of young players like Bryn Forbes and Derrick White. Hammon’s guard expertise in her own playing days made her a one-of-a-kind point guard and now, she’s instilling those floor general qualities in the next generation of Spurs.     I'd imagine her background as a guard should help her work with Lillard and, should the team decide to blow it up and trade Damian, she'll be around to mentor any young players they get back."
"yet the raptors manage to make it to a conference finals with demar derozan and kyle lowry at times playing like shit before they got bounced by lebron with dwane casey of all people!  Demar Derozan scored in the single digits 3 times in that playoff run, he was in the teens multple of times, He was the best raptor on that team, he didn't play like it but they still were able to beat indy, beat milwaukee, and make it to a conference final.   Why can't doc even do that? If ben sucks in the next round, okay, I can see that. Milwaukee is a good team in the east, ben should be that player that delivers, but doc can't beat the atlanta hawks and make it to the conference final? Really? the atlanta hawks? Dwane Casey can coach with his star playing being inconsistent, but doc with his second star player that's not known as a scorer can't?   We're not asking Doc to pull off an upset, here. We're asking doc to beat the atlanta hawks. the atlanta hawks. undermanned atlanta hawks where hunter went out and bogie was not himself for 2 straight games.   I'm telling you man, we really have to look at doc as the issue. Seriously lol. The guy is a joke."
"DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Love, Joe Johnson.  As for a less realistic choice, Tony Allen."
"Home town deals are not going to happen for a long while after players saw what happened to DeMar DeRozan and Isaiah Thomas. They saw that even if you're a face-of-the-franchise perennial all-star starter or MVP candidate, teams will not hesitate to give up on you. They won't return anything you give them."
"- I do not miss the years before the title other than watching DeMar DeRozan. The championship basically justified every shitty move (and there were a lot of shitty moves in the history of this franchise) up to that point, in my mind.   - I would not trade away the championship for anything ever, it was the greatest sports moment of my life"
Insert DeMar DeRozan joke here
Demar Derozan has never been a good player.
"At least they'll know who Demar Derozan is lol.   But if Pop is serious about this, it's probably Simmons for Demar plus one of White-Walker. Just hope Chip Engelland can work his magic the second time around.      Damn, Philly's gonna send my boys into depression in the big market."
"Demar brings good playmaking as well as his offense isn't bad. He was bad in the last game of the season sadly, but he straight up carried the team at times. Plus, it helps that the Sixers have good defenders, which is absolutely perfect to fit Derozan into."
"yeah I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Sixers need a PG that can handle the ball, shoot 3s, and score not DeMar DeRozan lol"
There's no way on earth that the 76ers take that trade  32 year old Demar DeRozan on a fresh $30million contract (an overpay) + maybe a future lottery pick is selling far too low
"2010’s  PG - John Wall  SG - Jimmy Butler  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Giannis  C - Brook Lopez  Bench: Jamal Crawford, Joe Johnson, Joakim Noah"
"I agree with you and also think Pop would play him a lot like he's had DeRozan play.  A playmaking forward.  And honestly, if we did a sign and trade with DeMar ad one of the pieces I think it would be a win win for both teams."
Demar Derozan? Those other guys already had outside shots
Imagine a back court with Ben Simmons and Demar DeRozan?
How could the Warriors possibly land DeRozan? I assume he gets 25M. What could they trade?  edit: I'm in now way implicating that the Warriors would be interested in Demar.
space jam: the demar derozan anime series vols 1-12 coming to a walmart near you
I'd prefer it be Doug McDemott? Wtf are you on about? I'd prefer it be Buddy Hield and Demar Derozan. I'd prefer it if we didn't make the highest paid player on a team including Bron and AD a ball dominant volume shooter with no 3 and no defense.
"Well putting a few pieces together this STILL makes sense:  - Spurs were said to be eying Kuz per Woj today -  Kuzma on the Wiz now - DeMar-Wiz had mutual interest  - even after Westbrook trade Wiz still need S&amp;T to acquire DeRozan - Beal says he wants to stay in DC, but still will need a sidekick. - Spurs really liked Deni in last year’s draft  Could Kuz + Deni get DeRozan?"
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"DeRozan for ML lol (in all seriousness, would be great to see DeMar get a ring but im sure he wants to do it for the right price)"
Haha  Acc to me derozan is a much better fit than Westbrook now that that's the deal that's gonna happen. Could have had him for cheap too.  I can't believe demar would actually sign for the MLE just to play for the Lakers.
We draft another SG/PG AND announce an extension for DeMar DeRozan at max for 4 years lol
He needs structure. Between the two options of Sac and San Antonio I think he'll do better with the Spurs under Pop and Duncan. They'll be losing Derozan to free agency anyway so it's a perfect fit to trade Kuz for Derozan. Also trading within division is a bit risky so I don't think LA would risk that potential headache. Ideally if the Lakers can get Sacramento to bite on KCP(with other assets) instead of Kuz for Buddy and then trade Kuz for DeMar they're set. It's win win for all teams involved.
"Hi! Thanks for taking your time!  What is the Spurs plan for DeMar DeRozan? Even though he cannot sign a contract until 2 August, has there been any potential package for a Sign&amp; Trade? Thanks!"
Demar DeRozan - Compton Crip
well I suppose it did take him from guaranteed top five player and ascending superstar to DeMar DeRozan and the 29th pick lol so clearly his trade value went down if nothing else
"Mobley is an avid Toronto Raptors fan.  He wears #4 because Chris Bosh is who he models his game from.  He’s from Compton and his favourite player growing up was Demar Derozan.  He only follows 1 NBA team- the Raptors.  He may be trying to angle to his favourite team, where he would be a perfect fit and who have made him the top of their board."
Woke: 5-team race for DeMar DeRozan.  Bespoke: 5-team trade for DeMar DeRozan.
"Sure, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Kobe specifically would’ve changed.   Look at somebody like DeMar DeRozan."
"Buddy Hield, Westbrook, and DeMar DeRozan"
"DeMar DeRozan, 4x All Star and 2x All NBA, is the median player at #9? He is significantly better than every other player on that list not named John Wall, and I'd still take DeMars career over Wall  Something isn't adding up"
I've heard an announcer use it as a positive epithet to say like he's stone cold/got ice in his veins when he gets clutch buckets.  (IIRC it was DeFrozen DeRozan rather than DeMar DeFrozen but same thing pretty much I think.)
Prime demar Derozan too
"a 32 year Demar Derozan who’s already said he wants to win a championship and that he’s made enough money, said he wants to return home, who has rotted away the peak of his prime in San Antonio, I see no reason why he doesn’t take the tax payer $9 million. Also remember that he’s 32, not an allstar anymore, niche offensive package. if he’s commanding $20 million he’s trying to not be competitive winning."
"The Hawks made the ECF on the strength of their overall roster with multiple players bailing them out at different points. I don't think that three alone is enough to carry a gutted roster against them, they're not the Nets 3 (tough and impossible comparison tbf). I like the Hawks depth to carry them through. This might be a hot take but I would rank DeRozan as the second best player personally but I agree the Knicks would have the 1st, 3rd and 4th best players in the series in this scenario. I want to see Randle lead or be a key player for a team for a couple more seasons, Demar is pretty accomplished and he's had a long career."
"My assumption is that the Spurs sign-and-trade Demar DeRozan (let's say... $66m over 3 years?) to the Lakers for Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Once they fill out the other parts of the roster, Ellington is an extremely savvy option."
"In a vacuum by my definition is basically by most scenarios I would rather have DeMar, however I would still pick Jrue under the right circumstances.  For example his current team, the Bucks, I would rather have Jrue than DeRozan because his defense and his ability to hit the 3 outweighs DeMar's playmaking and ability to iso the mid-range.  And just for the hell of it let's take the Spurs as the other example. I'd rather have DeMar than Holiday on that team.  All in all, I think their value is about the same but their strength differ. Plus I've always had a spot for my boy from Toronto."
"If they trade for DeRozan they might as well trade deni because that boy will not touch the ball with demar, Westbrook and Beal playing together"
Who would you rather have for 20M duncan Robinson or demar derozan? Genuinely asking.
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
"How is DeMar fucked over? Dudes earned almost $175 million on his career, was the co-face of a franchise for years, and only got dumped when it was blatantly obvious that that core was never going to win a chip. And im supposed to feel sorry for him just because hes not good enough to win a title as the number 1? Even though hes coming up on an offseason where he is actively looking to sacrifice money to team up with a team thats already a contender? No sir that is absolutely not getting fucked over, thats living the fucking dream of millions of little hoopers out there right now. Not every top 30 player in the league deserves a ring in their career, people are going nuts thinking every single fan favorite needs a ring before retirement. He can literally sign anywhere he wants this offseason, how did he get fucked over? Not to mention the dude kept running into lebron. Was Karl Malone fucked over cus he couldnt win with the jazz and kept running into Jordan and didnt get to retire as a jazz lifer? Fuck no and Derozan was no Karl Malone either."
"Danny Green, a career 40% shooter from three who doesn’t need the ball in his hands, is exactly the kind of player who thrives next to LeBron. DeMar DeRozan, a career 28% shooter from three who needs to handle the ball a lot, is not."
Yes with him as the primary ball handler and 1st scoring option   Replace DeMar DeRozan with Kyle Kuzma for his entire career and the teams he’s on don’t make the playoffs my guy   Kuzma is at best an okay 7th man
"DeRozan had debatably his best season of his career.   Not to mention he would be signing a big discount for the Lakers. DeMar making Kuzma money is 100% a winning player,"
Would you rather have Kyle Kuzma or DeMar DeRozan? That’s who he’s replacing if he goes to LA
"DeMar ""midrange spot-up shooter"" DeRozan"
"I've repeated myself ad nauseam over this but there is no proof that DeMar was told he will not be traded. DeRozan said it happened, Masai said that he never did. I'm not going to put my stock into something that potentially never happened. Even if we say they're both lying and that the truth is in the middle, as long as it's not a word for word, ""I am not trading you from this team"", then I'm not budging from my position.  &amp;#x200B;  And idc how many all star games you make, the playoffs is where you prove your worth as a star. He never did, period."
"Demar was completely classy with us. He not only went through his contract, but was also a great locker room presence for our young core. Sure, we didn't win a lot, but he was a great presence. No ghosting, no media leaks, no public complaining. Popovich is know to do his guys a solid one, and I'm sure he'll do Derozan a solid one. I have nothing but respect for the dude, even if didn't work out. I sincerely hope he can succeed with the Lakers.  The folk who always bring up Popovich refusing to trade Kawhi really overlook just how much of a shitshow he caused to the team as a whole."
"That's not disproved, that's Ujiri saying one thing and DeRozan saying another.  There's no person whose word is more valuable than another's in this.  DeRozan clearly believes he was given the assurance he wouldn't be traded. Ujiri says otherwise. And Ujiri even acknowledges IN YOUR SOURCE that there may have been a miscommunication.  &gt; Sources close to DeRozan had told ESPN’s Chris Haynes that DeRozan met with Toronto officials in Las Vegas during summer league and believed that he would not be traded.  &gt; Ujiri added Friday: “In my job, I always have to assume we’re going forward with the team that I have. If there was a miscommunication there, I do apologize to DeMar and his family and his representation. It’s not what I meant.”"

&gt; Damn DeRozan  His name is DeMar
"Who cares: Ben Simmons and Demar Derozan wont help any team win at all, ever."
"No one faults DeMar DeRozan for running into LeBron and losing, it's the absolutely shameful way they lost. Getting swept as the 1st seed, when a young Celtics team put up a fight, disgraceful.  If DeMar felt disrespected by Masai, it pales in comparison to how embarrassed all of Canada was watching that sorry ass performance."
"No one faults DeMar DeRozan for running into LeBron and losing, it's the absolutely shameful way they lost. Getting swept as the 1st seed, when a young Celtics team put up a fight, disgraceful."
"I did have points that DeMar DeRozan has always been a #1 option and even then he had highs, he had his shares of lows also but he’d be a fantastic 2nd option, and the best 3rd option in basketball outside of Brooklyn"
Yo Ant the new god Edwards. Sing Demar a song.  The wolves need this shit for cheap.   Help me DeMar DeRozan your my only hope.
"RJ Barrett and to a lesser extent Anthony Edwards. I don’t think either guy is bad, but I just don’t see either guy being a top-2 guy on a championship roster.   Barrett is a pretty awful finisher, doesn’t take many 3s and his defense isn’t much to write home about. I see a high end outcome as DeMar DeRozan for him.   As for Edwards, it’s a similar thing, although I see his athleticism helping him a lot more.  Basically, if a guy’s only premiere attribute is scoring, they better be damn amazing at it if they want to be a superstar."
"I think it's more likely Lowry uses the threat of getting a 3/90 contract from New Orleans as leverage to get Toronto to trade him to his preferred destination (wherever that is) for similar money.   Like let's use the Lakers as an example, since [there have been recent reports that he's interested in going there.](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/.amp/news/nba-report-demar-derozan-and-kyle-lowry-reportedly-interested-in-joining-los-angeles-lakers) If the Lakers trade Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell there along with the 22nd pick then they too could offer Lowry a 3 year $90 million contract via sign and trade. Up till now the assumption would have been that that's not enough for Toronto to trade Lowry, but now that there's the threat that they could lose him for nothing, they'd probably prefer that instead.   The same thing could apply with the Sixers or any other team he wanted to go to who's over the cap. All New Orleans having this room to offer him a deal means is that Lowry now has the leverage to basically orchestrate his own sign and trade anywhere he wants with little to no pushback from Toronto. I think he's playing David Griffin, rather than him having a legit desire to go play for a lottery team."
&gt;So he's Demar Derozan    Tell me you haven't watched Shai without telling me you haven't watched Shai.
"&gt; i believe 87% of shais points were unassisted,  So he's Demar Derozan"
Why does unassisted matter?   Demar Derozan used to kill those metrics too btw
"Thanks for proving me right. Those are basic defensive stats and they are terrible to use, even then they still label DeRozan as a bad defender especially in the playoffs.   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  This is a better metric, DeRozan is at 238th out of 250 players. Looking at his stats year after year including San Antonio paints him as one of the worst defenders in the league basically his entire career.   https://www.poundingtherock.com/2019/11/26/20983960/demar-derozan-defense-san-antonio-spurs-worst-defender-league  His first season in San Antonio, an entire article explaining how terrible his defense still was and how his advanced statistics were getting worse."
"They're both FA, Miami don't need to offer anything.   Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, PF?, Bam Adebayo."
Demar DeRozan on the hawks 🤔
"I like your sarcasm, but it’s about DeMar DeRozan… and he deserves a title."
DeMar DeRozan
"Sans-Utah Reggie was like a 35% 3 point shooter in the playoffs. *Passable* is the word to describe his shooting, contrast that with DeRozan who just isnt particularly interested in 3 pointers for himself, and to his credit he hasnt needed it. Demar has been a 20 ppg scorer at 60% TS the last 2 years *without* the 3. He's plenty efficient on offense. And he just clocked his most efficient season as a distributor as well and there are a lot of ways a wing can exist to space the floor without a spot up jumper. Like Jimmy doesn't shoot 3s well either but he still spaces the floor on and off the ball because he distributes the ball when he has it and cuts when he doesn't.  We have 5 guys who shot over 40% this last season from 3 who're currently slated to come back (and then Cousins and Reggie). Some of that is gonna regress next year (and I believe Reggie is a prime regression candidate, I'd love for him to prove me wrong but he had a career year last season) but imho you have room to have 1 non shooter on the floor if that non shooter is useful to your offense in other ways as a vertical spacer (Capela, lob city era DeAndre Jordan, Giannis, Daniel Gafford, Zion, etc) or as a distributor (Jimmy, DeRozan, etc)"
Demar Derozan on all-nba?  Heh?  He hasn't even been an all-star in 4 years - how is he suddenly going to crack all-nba?
"Reports: ""DeRozan willing to take less than 27mill on his next contract""   Lakers fams: ""Lowry and DeMar split the MLE 📈 because Family"""
"Reports: ""DeRozan willing to take less than 27mill on his next contract""   Lakers fams: ""Lowry and DeMar split the MLE 📈 because Family"""
"Welcome, Golden State Sixth Man of the Year DeMar DeRozan (I wish)  If he went to LAL, how would Lebron/DeMar/AD work? AD prefers PF, and Lebron and DeMar are both at points in their careers where they are like 80% PF 20% SF"
"Pop is still elite. He’s just playing with a roster whose best players are DeMar Derozan and Dejounte Murray. It doesn’t matter how good you are as a coach, you just can’t turn every single roster into a contender."
"Gordon Hayward got 30 million a year at 30 yrs old and was definitely coming off a worse year at the time than demar had this year at 31. I think the Hayward contract is an overpay, so derozan probably deserves around 25 mil a year on a hornets type team and 16-20 mil on a contender?"
"I know he won’t but if he went to the Pistons they’d be a darkhorse team similar the Hawks this year.   Cunningham, Derozan, Bey, Grant, Stewart would be a great starting 5. Decent bench with Hayes, Diallo, Jackson, Lee, and Plumlee. Definitely would need to get a true PF type of player as the Pistons are lacking that on their roster.   I would bet he goes to the Lakers bc he’s from the area and they are a championship contender. Pistons are still a couple years away from being considered legitimate title contenders. With Demar however I think the process would speed up."
"Plot Twist- DeMar DeRozan sign with Clippers to play along side Kawhi.  It'll be a pretty cute story, Kawhi feels bad Toronto traded DeMar and won the championships so kawhi tells demar to come to clipper so he can win him one also"
"Sounds pretty good if you got Bron and AD behind you. fReE sAfEtY and all. If Marc Gasol decides to stay the LA defense will again provide all around great rim protection with every lineup they roll out. You put DeMar on smaller forwards or wings to bully them off the open 3 or deter their drives and that's all he will have to focus on in order to be a positive defender. There's a lot of size and agility on that roster afterall, enough to switch on the perimeter without giving up a mismatch inside. I think the Lakers are one of the few teams that can make DeRozan look solid on defense."
"I think DeMar really cleaned up his play and is at his peak as a player currently, a real veteran with enough gas in the tank to not look old on the court. He's very much primed to be a great player in the playoffs on a contending team. If Lou Williams can have standout games on a well-led squad DeMar DeRozan will match this type of production easily because he's honestly a good bit better and younger. He came off consecutive career years under pop, played back2back 60%TS seasons and increased his AST% to above 30.   If he accepts to lead the Lakers when Bron isn't playing DeMar could really be huge for the consistency of this squad. His shooting splits from the midrange this year were 51/46/48 3ft-3p which is all around elite. I think DeMar's been forgotten on a not so exciting Spurs squad but he grew so much under pop and is playing winning basketball at this point.   Analytics view him as an All-Star level impact player and the Lakers will have the possibility to get him at a huge discount because nobody really cares about DeRozan. This may very well turn into a massive win if the Lakers don't have to give up KCP or if they can replace KCP with another floor spacer."
"thats actually not true, Demar is an amazing secondary ball handler for them. If they get him on a decent contract he's a much better Schroeder. His ast/TO  ratio is and has always been VERY good.  The stability the lakers require when LBJ goes to the bench is exactly what derozan brings. He's also an ironman and always available.  You just need to lose kuzma / Schroeder which should probably happen anyways.  but this is all if he decides to take a discount"
"He's the exact opposite of the kind of player we need around LeBron and AD. We need Danny Greens. Not DeMar DeRozans.  Offensively we're always going to be at our best when LeBron and AD have the ball in their hands. DeRozan isn't nearly good enough as a shot creator for it to be worthwhile to give him the ball above LeBron or AD. And when those guys have the ball, DeRozan has negative value because he's a horribly deep shooter that nobody respects. Lakers have already struggled on LeBron/AD postups for two years because teams pack the paint.  On defense he's legit one of the worst defenders in the league. Per BBallindex he was one of the defenders that was hidden the most often in the entire NBA, and somehow still had significantly negative defensive impact.  So DeRozan with the ball in his hands : ok but not nearly as good as LeBron or AD so what's the point  DeRozan with the ball in AD/LeBron's hands : negative value  DeRozan on defense : negative value  DeRozan is one of many players in the league whose skillset is only suited to being a number 1 option but isn't actually good enough at it that you can build a contender around him. And the less you give him the ball the more his lack of any usefulness off-ball and on defense hurt you."
"He's still a very solid coach, but as a manager (Pop is President of Basketball Operations for the Spurs) he has been bad for quite a few years now. The Danny Green trade (where we disastrously traded away Danny Green and an expiring and got DeMar DeRozan on a poison 3 year contract in return) marked his decline.  Pop was not willing to have any sort of rebuild on the Spurs and was hell bent on win-now moves, but more accurately ""win some"" moves. DD + Lamarcus was guaranteed to generate *some* wins, but to never be even close to contending. It was effectively a medium ceiling - medium floor situation were we we won't suck but can never do great. All because he couldn't stand to have even one losing season.  This ""never have a sucky team"" mindset has been leading his thought process ever since. I get it, since he's close to retirement and only cares about the short term, but you need long term thinking on top. It's harsh."
"It was the same way on the spurs sub the last two years with Aldridge and DeRozan. Literally all it took was going to /r/nba and asking fans of every team what they would trade for one of them to realize they had basically no trade value. But tons of spurs fans thought we could get a pick for Aldridge or multiple picks or a pick and a good young player for DeMar.  I think tons of fans just think about what would be good for their team and not what would be good for a team involved in a trade with them. Trades are a two way street, both teams have to think they improved in one way or another by doing a trade."
Would you like one demar derozan?
Dude pulled the 10th seed in a competitive west with a slew of injuries+two best players of demar derozan and rudy gay but he drops a couple games with team usa cause the players are just isoing and chucking and suddenly he's bad? That's whack lmao
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
"He doesnt have a 60 win contender around himself anymore because he is a petty asshole.  He could have traded Kawhi to the Lakers - most likely they wouldnt have won a chip with Paul George anyways.  If anything it makes Pop and the Spurs look like the bigger men by shipping Kawhi out (bc even if he was a piece of shit he did win Finals MVP and helped the Spurs bring home a chip) to his destination of choice.  Just like in the Harden deal (where they could have had Ben Simmons), Pop's pettiness cost the Spurs organization wins and most importantly money.  Lonzo is playing great ball to the point where the Lakers are considering bringing him back to play point in LeBron's final push for one last chip.  Josh Hart is a decent bench player, as is Kuzma.  The grandfather deal was Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart, probably a pick or two involved as well - and POP TURNED IT DOWN.  He didnt turn it down for a better haul or a player he wanted - nope he turned it down for DeMar DeFrozen when even a new poster to r/NBA would laugh at the idea of Kawhi for DeRozan.  Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart is wayyyyyy better than DeFrozen/Poetl and you can thank Pop for that."
2015 - 3rd in effective field goal percentage  2016 - 10th  2017 - 26th  2018 - 6th  2019 - 14th  Almost like Pop recognizes his team is better when they shoot a limited number of 3 pointers because his main scorers were DeMar Derozan and a 33-35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge
"&gt;In the NBA, he lost the crazy Spurs playoff streak and now they haven’t been in the playoffs for two years.  Dude is clearly a scrub. I mean a real coach would definitely be in the playoffs in the western conference with *checks notes* DeMar Derozan and a 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge..."
DeMar DeRozan
"Don’t like the Shai and Cade comp. Shai is significantly better as a ball handler but Cade is stronger and a better defender. Shai is more of a Kyrie type player whereas Cade is like Tatum or a less athletic PG13 but with somewhat better playmaking.  Green and LaVine is pretty solid.  Mobley and Bosh is a bit optimistic for Mobleys offense but not bad.  Suggs is super athletic, he’s more of a Jrue Holiday IMO.  Moody and Mikal is fine but pretty optimistic  Kuminga’s ceiling comp is more of a Jaylen Brown. Less optimistically, I guess Kelly Oubre. Floor is maybe more explosive Stanley Johnson.  Bouk is more of a Jordan Clarkson or Raptors Demar Derozan, an athletic scoring guard.  Davion and Jrue is fine. Realistically he’s a more athletic Pat Bev though.  Wagner-Ariza is ok I guess.  Scottie is much more of a big than OG, and OG, while a solid passer, doesn’t playmake like Scottie. I’d say he’s more like Draymond at the very high end, Rondae Hollis Jefferson on the low end."
I remember telling people that Wiggins wouldn't live up to expectations. I said his best NBA comparison was DeMar Derozan. Athletic wings that slashed and didn't have range.
"1. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both go to the Lakers 2. Chris Paul wants to go to the Lakers only to be turned down because of the salary cap issue and stays with the Suns instead 3. Lillard doesn't stay in Portland, but gets surprisingly traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown 4. Spencer Dinwiddle goes to the Clippers 5. The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the OKC thunder in exchange for Kemba and 2 first round picks and flip Tobias and those picks to the Blazers for CJ McCollum, Simons and Covington 6. Lonzo goes to the Bulls 7. Kawhi Leonard stays with the Clippers"
"Yes! In fact, if the Bucks swapped Giannis for LeBron, I think they’d still be contenders. If you swapped Jimmy Butler for LeBron, the Heat would be consistent contenders. If you swapped LeBron for DeMar DeRozan, the Spurs would be favorites again. I think there are a lot of situations without other HOF players where LeBron could thrive."
"&gt;Clippers, Pray that Kawhi re-signs.  &gt;Lakers, Sign DeMar DeRozan.  How about I pray that the Lakers sign DeMar and call it a day"
DeMar DeRozan 2022 FMVP
"On the other hand if Demar DeRozan is the only thing keeping them from sinking... you're still not going to see another Spurs championship, buddy."
DeMar DeRozan for Kyle Lowry
"Bring in DeMar, bring in DeRozan"
"I know DeMar can't really shoot 3s and we need that, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want him as the 3rd star. I've been a fan of DeMar since he was at Conpton High and I was at Centennial. Dude is nasty and I always wanted him to come home. Honestly, if they're somehow considering Westbrook just to have another playmaker, why not DeRozan?"
"Okay, I'm deceased  Kyle Lowry  Demar Derozan  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Marc Gasol   Toronto duo gets their ring together with the man that blockaded them from Playoff success for half a decade..   sad nut"
"I dunno, I think there is even a grudging acceptance for the D-Wade/DeMar DeRozan pump fake on a midranger/jump forward a little to draw the foul, although it does depend on how far forward the jump and how out of control the defender is. I think jumping to the side is what really get peoples' goat. If a play like Barnett's drew a foul today I think there would be minimal complaints."
"From midrange? AD has shot 42.6% from 10-16ft over the last 5 years, DeRozan has shot 45.6%. From 16-3pt range, AD has shot 34.9% and Demar 42.1%  Demar is definitely a lot better at midrange than AD."
"&gt; The gap between Russ and Derozan as efficient scoring options is way bigger than Derozan and Russ as playmakers.  Disagree, DeMar has a great AST/TO ratio but he doesn't actually generate quality looks. The gap between their scoring efficiency and playmaking is about the same, depends which one the Lakers need more.  But in reality, any smart Laker fan would hope to get neither and instead of looking for a 3rd star hope to acquire some actual shooters. LeBron + shooters has always been a winning strategy, people wanna complicate it for some reason."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"I'm THE most skeptical person when it comes to Laker FA rumors, so no one needs to remind me of the unreliability of these rumors.  All that said: Lowry and DeRozan reunite, DeRozan and Bron bury their history, and DeMar wins a title in his hometown? Pretty sweet."
Demar DeRozan
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"

DeMar DeRozan?
What about a mutual sign and trade trade for a gently used DeMar Derozan?
"Okay, so who do you buy low on?   DeMar DeRozan? - Alright that's something I guess  I don't really see Oubre or Fournier moving the needle for either of those guys - not a lot of defense going around there.  Reggie Bullock? Honestly I might like him more than the former two but not a needle mover.  A welcome-home show for Nic Batum or Will Barton? Both decent players but may end up commanding a bag bigger than Portland could offer. Also have a hunch Batum wants to end up on a stronger contender.  I like the upside of Otto Porter Jr a lot and that's why I'd ""buy low"" on him. The other guys sans DeRozan don't have a huge ceiling in my opinion or may just not be available for Portland.  I'm also a huge stan of Harrison Barnes to Portland if they can pull off a CJ trade - not a star obviously but makes for a cohesive lineup."

Demar Derozan for sure. You can't tell me a guy who is never on the court when his team is objectively playing its best is raising the ceiling of his team.

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

"hey listen when you have the opportunity to pay DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, and Vooch over $20 million each you gotta *LEAP* at that opportunity. When else will you have the opportunity to spend $75 million dollars a year on a center who can’t do anything other than shoot, a 3&amp;D wing with delusions of grandeur, and one of the biggest choke artists of the 2010s?"
Your team is gonna look real awkward when you’re stuck paying DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball $160 million after Zach LaVine asks out
"This is a much better argument. But this still seems like an irrational grudge from a bad series with your favourite team.  He can shoot, but since you are discounting that evidence, we'll assume he can't. He was one of the top 10 point of attack defenders in the NBA last season. So while yes, he is bad at team defense, it's usually the case in clutch situations that teams revert to heavy iso-ball play. And in heavy iso-ball play, strong point of attack defense becomes incredibly valuable. See: end of wizards vs spurs second game, where Westbrook defends DeMar DeRozan, a top 5 isolation scorer, on the final possession.  Second, he can playmake. I'm not sure where the idea that scoring is the *only* indicator of offense came from, but it's weird. An assist gets your team points too, and Westbrook is a 3x NBA assist leader. And since late game NBA focuses a lot on iso ball and stopping drives, and Westbrook is 1) one of the best drivers and 2) likely the best passer out of drives, his passing becomes incredibly valuable in the clutch as teams are virtually forced to help and sag off their man to stop him, after which he gets his teammates open shots. And if AD and LeBron are the clutch shooters you think they are, having a guy who can consistently get them good looks in the clutch is *immensely* valuable.  Despite being good on offense, neither LeBron nor AD are strong isolation players, and who's the next best iso player after that - the ghost of Carmelo Anthony? A closing lineup *needs* someone who can create off the dribble, regardless of whether they're the one taking the shot or passing out of it."
What about:  Demar Derozan -&gt; Adrian Dantley
"&gt;DeMar DeRozan -&gt; Michael Jordan     ..."
"So you never watched TMac on the Raptors. Got it. And everyone knows Kyle was always better than Demar, even though DeRozan scored more points. It's backed up by every advanced metric and the fact that DeRozan would get benched in 4th quarters.   As for the rest, they are more talented. But there are reasons they are not as celebrated by actual Raptors fans."
"If a team like Chicago has no problem giving a huge contract to DeMar DeRozan but not to the 24 year old player they traded Jimmy Butler for, that should be your first red flag that somethings up. IMO he’s not worth max money, and Chicago is playing their cards right by letting the market dry up for him. Now there isn’t really a team who can sign him out right to a max contract outright so Chicago can get him cheaper. His market may be so bad that he only takes the QO and is a UFA next season."
"I'm aware of Tony Bradley from his stint in Philadelphia and I don't think he's moving the needle. I saw ayo dosunmu play and I like his game I don't think he's going to see a lot of minutes and now that they have Lonzo Ball it should open up Coby Whites game up he's a pretty good three level scorer and can give you points coming off the bench or in a small ball lineup which I think we're going to see a lot of.  And I think you missed the point about the bulls needing a inside shot blocking presence that Gafford would have given them.  Because they are not getting any of that from Troy brown while he may have a higher upside than Gafford but how does that help them when you have a log jam at perimeter wing players with Patrick Williams, and Zach lavine, DeMar DeRozan there only so many minutes and how many can they find for him 12 to 15 a game tops?"
"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks. Retained all key players and bench pieces, while getting to while touted rookies that dropped a lot and have huge potential)  Worst offseason: New Orleans Peicans (that's fair)  Best value contract: Lonzo Ball, Chicago Bulls  (that's fair or even a slight overpay, I'd say DRose is a better player for less money)  Best value contract (buyout division): Kemba Walker, New York Knicks (seems alright)  Best value contract (minimum division): Otto Porter, Golden State Warriors (also a decent pick)  Worst value contract: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls (Khem Birch 3/20 is way worse imo, that dude is a third stringer at best)  Best fit: Reggie Bullock, Dallas Mavericks (decent pick)  Worst fit: Robin Lopez, Orlando Magic (okayish pick, Drummond is probably worse though)  Best gettable free agent remaining: Dennis Schroder (definitely right.)"
"DeRozan and him had very overlapping skillsets so DeMar and Lowry weren't being used to their full potential, Rudy was better than DeMar on D but he was also having a super cold start to the season, so just removing him allowed both Lowry and DeRozan to start taking up more possessions which meant the starting line-up hit was pretty much nothing since Lowry could shoulder more of the scoring load.  Then the guys we got gave a very thin team an actual bench who wouldn't completely dig us into a hole the second they got on the court. Patterson and Vasquez were actually very solid for us as role players at that time because even though they were very limited, they were 10x better than the other guys we had in those roles."
"you lost your best player in DeMar DeRozan, a great point guard in Patty Mills, and replaced them with Doug McDermott, who is ok but nothing special, a center who has played 8 games since the start of 2020 but is going to get paid 22 million dollars over three years, and Bryn Forbes, who is fine at best. you also had maybe one of the most whack lottery picks in recent history"
"If we’re talking about the entire playoffs, the Cavs had too much of a cakewalk in the East to be a part of this conversation. The best player they faced in the Eastern conference that year was one Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan."
"Lebron had a lot of lucky breaks in the finals with injuries and a suspension. Lebron also had a cakewalk through through the east, his biggest challenger was a team led by Demar Derozan. Dirk went through Kobe, KD, Westbrook, Harden to get to the finals."
"At the time, I thought the plan should have been to add Kawhi to Lowry and DeRozan. Not exchange DeMar for Kawhi."
Demar DeRozan
"Hate isn't something you are qualified to judge. I find humor in Demar Derozan, not malice."
Demar Derozan is up there
Both him and Demar Derozan had negative reputations and would get made fun of very often. Kawhi really did change **ALOT** surrounding Kyle Lowry
"I had said both GROAT and jersey retirement so I took your no he wasn't as to both.  It was consensus basically that both would get their jersey retired. Like I said, you can go through both this job and the Raptors sub and see that. Ain't no point arguing man, the fanbase been saying both would get their jersey retired from time.  Bosh has an argument, as an individual player. I personally don't care if he gets his jersey is retired or not, I have no strong feelings either way. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. But one could make the argument based on his individual achievements as a Raptor which are up there with DeMar, Lowry and VC. To say he has no argument is just simply wrong.  Lowry and DeMar have played poorly in the playoffs, more-so DeRozan though. Lowry and DeRozan have had series that they have underperformed in, and both Lowry and DeRozan were guaranteed jersey retirements before 2019 as the threads show. It isn't even a discussion. You are the outlier my guy, and that's fine.  Vince is behind Lowry and DeMar. Does he deserve a jersey retirement? Like with Bosh, you can make the argument either way and I personally don't really care. He quit on the team to force his way out which is trash af, but he was also Air Canada and a big reason for Canadian basketball coming up like it is now. I don't really care all that much as I can see both sides of why some such as yourself feel strongly to not retire VCs number and those who want to."
"It does matter, cause you said he wasn't the GROAT without the ring but he was already in the GROAT talks before 2019. Can't have it both ways.  Lowry and DeRozan both were already getting jerseys retired before the 18-19 season, it was basically a done deal at that point. Like it was inarguable by that point for most of the fanbase, double jersey retirement. The two best players in our greatest era as a team, multiple time all stars and franchise achievements as a team or individually not being guaranteed retired jerseys even though it was consensus in the fanbase that both would get their numbers retired is wild  Bosh also has an argument to get his jersey retired. I personally don't really care or would push for it, the franchise was absolute trash during his tenure but as an individual player he is up there which is why I just chalk it up as arguable. He has an All-NBA 2nd team, 5 all stars tied with VC and 1 behind Lowry, 7 player of the month (tied with VC and 3 behind DeMar), 3rd in points, 1st in rebounds, 3rd in minutes played, 1st in blocks. As an individual player you can make an argument for being jersey in the rafter caliber, but the issue is with the team success which is an issue of the team around him being shit vs Bosh being shit. Acting like someone talking about Bosh being retired is some completely indefensible idiotic thing is just stupid. Let's not act like Bosh getting a jersey in the rafters is the same as like T Ross or Doug Christie.   If you don't give a fuck what threads on this sub say, why the fuck are you replying to me in a thread on this sub and giving a fuck what I say or think then? Like huh?????  Lowry and DeMar over VC, but I didn't say otherwise. I said VC was still in them talks, as in some brought him up. Not me, but some."
"Doesn't matter if GROAT talks existed before the ring  it wouldn't be enough for jersey retirement until 2019. That's legend status in toronto. He got rid of all the talk about him in the playoffs.  It would definitely be uncertain, jersey retirements don't just happen easily. You don't have to do it just cause a guy was the best for an era, especially when he's not a superstar.   I don't give a fuck what threads on this sub say lol. This thread right now has comments saying fucking bosh deserves to have his jersey retired. for what lol  &gt; you still had people arguing DeRozan or VC but Lowry was clearly and easily in those talks.  ???  Lowry and demar were way ahead of VC by 2016 lol. Vince may have peaked higher individually, but those 2 led the we the north era."
"The team I think is still a bit underrated in terms of shooting, and LaVine is still a bit underrated as a scorer even if he gets his respect. Outside of DeRozan, the projected starting 5 of Ball, LaVine, PWill, and Vucevic shot around .399 from 3 last year on 23-24 3PA. If you add Caruso and White, it’s .390 on 33 3PA. That’s really good spacing and a particularly good iso situation and general playmaking environment for DeMar."
"DeRozan with better 3 point shooting and defense but highly doubt he gets to the same level of offensive prowess that DeMar has right now  DeMar averaged 27 without a 3 point shot , I don’t think RJ is a guy that can get to that"
Zions ceiling is closer to a DeMar DeRozan level of success than media makes people believe. Perineal all star but not an MVP player
LeBron and Kyle Lowry/ Demar Derozan
"We have drafted extremely well. A lot of our picks haven’t been lottery picks, but those that were we have hit on a lot of the time. We’ve drafted Chris Bosh, Vince Carter (sorta), Tracy McGrady, Damon Stoudamire, DeMar DeRozan, and with picks in the late 20’s have drafted OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam. Not to mentioned we signed FVV as an UDFA. From 1995-2019, we have made 8 very, very good selections through the draft. That’s one every three years.  We’ve literally been a playoff team for the past 8ish years. That’s a third of this team’s existence. I don’t call that underperforming."

I’m at a loss for why signing DeMar Derozan means that you can trade one of the best shooters in the NBA for literally the worst shooter in basketball.
"“Hey we just signed Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan. You know who we should trade for? Ben Simmons. DeMar and Ben Simmons. And then you’ve got Lonzo off ball. I mean come on, it’s perfect. What a trio.”   -	Said no one ever (except Bill Simmons I guess)"
"It was more how the Raptors used him. Their plan of letting Lowry and DeRozan play a 2 man game was great for the regular season but it would never work in the playoffs. He didnt get the nickname ""DeMar DeFrozen"" for nothing 😂😂😂"
"I don't really consider arguing about whether DeMar DeRozan is a ""good player"" productive either tbh... Matter fact I'm not sure reddit is a very good place at all for ""productive discussion"""
"Fair, but I'm sure there were ways to get DeRozan without giving up Thad Young.   First off, they shouldn't have given DeMar that much money, like who were they bidding against?   But secondly, couldn't they have signed him outright if they had just not signed Caruso? I'd rather have Thad Young then Caruso given the scarcity of elite 4/5 glue guys there are and the fact that I had just gotten Lonzo.   Hell I'd rather send off Vucevic elsewhere and keep Thad Young if it came to that, Vooch is probably not going to be playable past the 1st round of the playoffs."
The Lonzo Ball/Devonte Graham/DeMar Derozan S&amp;Ts about to conglomerate into a one massive trade that will merge with the Dinwiddie trade to form the largest trade in NBA history.
"the only difference from a week ago is instead of DeMar DeRozan you have an unknown 1st rounder from Chicago. The chances of that mystery pick yielding a player of DeRozan's caliber aren't all that high tbh. It was absolutely the right move, getting a 1st while another team overpays DeRozan and you get to fully commit to a youth movement is great, but let's be real, it's still a substandard return for an elite player."
&gt;Additionally Lonzo is a much better shooter than Caruso but this is yet another redundant skill with the rest of their lineup.   Shooting is absolutely never redundant. You don't think Vucevic and DeMar need spacing to operate?  Also lmao at saying DeRozan doesn't pressure the rim. Dude is elite at getting to the line. How do you think he does that.
"Yeah, and that's a lot. As opposed to the Texas and Florida teams that have ZERO state income tax, AND better weather.  Raptors are highest taxed team in the NBA, followed by California teams.  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanpackard/2018/07/18/kwahi-leonard-makes-money-in-trade-to-high-tax-toronto-but-demar-derozan-makes-millions-more/?sh=1eb4cbe27b0f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanpackard/2018/07/18/kwahi-leonard-makes-money-in-trade-to-high-tax-toronto-but-demar-derozan-makes-millions-more/?sh=1eb4cbe27b0f)"
"-Demar ""KD"" DeRozan"
"The Bulls have gotten their fair share of big free agents over the years, just not Lebron, KD or Kawhi. Demar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball this year, Rondo and DWade in 2016, Pau Gasol in 2014, Carlos Boozer the year of the decision, Ben Wallace a while back. They get more big free agents than the Knicks"
You don't think that *DeMar DeRozan* is a defensive liability??  Ok...
"These aren’t big name free agents though. Raptors have retained guys like Serge Ibaka, Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry before. Those are bigger names than Portis &amp; Holiday. I really don’t see what your point is with Milwaukee."
Why Jaylen Brown over Jayson Tatum? also Demar Derozan is on the Bulls.
"&gt;. Was Tony Allen just being lazy? Draymond Green? Rudy Gobert?  Did the rest of their game regress? Is their lack of shooting just killing their teams offensive schemes? Can defences set up entirely around the fact they can't shoot? No, no and no.  &gt;Demar Derozan has been trying and falling to improve his 3 pt shooting   Lmfao please dont talk to me about Demar. He came into the league as a high flyer AND THAT IS IT. If you bothered to look, at all, you would see he improved his shooting AND was working on his 3 before we traded him.   &gt;If it was as easy as just deciding to be a better shooter, half the league would be Steph Curry clones. It's not.  So you're either Simmons bad or Curry good. It's not possible be anywhere in between. Got it."
"Yeah some guys have improved their shooting, but there are tons of examples of high character guys who couldn't. Was Tony Allen just being lazy? Draymond Green? Rudy Gobert? Demar Derozan has been trying and failing to improve his 3 pt shooting for his whole career, is he a slacker too?  If it was as easy as just deciding to be a better shooter, half the league would be Steph Curry clones. It's not."
Yeah if Randle does the same shit next seaaon(bad playoffs and all) he’s getting maxed. Demar derozan made the same amount of money as lebron james ffs. Getting a guy who can be the best player on a playoff team for below the max is great
Lowry isn’t overrated.  Trust me.  DeMar Derozan? Maybe?
DeMar DeRozan
"Some/most of these guys are better than him. Another good way to look at his deal is that it’s similar to DeRozan’s. He’s undoubtedly better than DeRozan at this stage in their careers, younger, &amp; with only one bad playoff performance to DeRozan’s entire career of bad playoff performances  I’m sorry you had to catch these strays DeMar"
Demar Derozan is money in the midrange
"Pascall has an good midrange jumper. He can shoot. He just hasn't managed to extend it beyond the arc.  So, he's closer to a fatter/slower Demar DeRozan. Which is pretty bad considering Demar's defense is already sus. Especially for a team like GSW that values defense over offense. Since they have the greatest gravity player in the league to generate easy offense."
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
DeRozan makes sense when you consider literally no one except Zach could create their own offense with this team and we still lacked a halfcourt facilitator. DeMar solves both problems.
"Chicago Bulls a threat. To fucking who lol?   Lonzo ball, demar derozan, and light skin lavine are beating who exactly?"
"I had a MyLeague were Demar Derozan stayed in the league until he was 49. I assume he was a Player-coach for the spurs because between 2026 and 2039 he only played in one season... when he was 46. and this has happened in other sims too, one of the developers must think its mad funny"
"By adding derozan, they get someone else who can really score in isolation and get their own bucket, and he lowkey became a good playmaker and can be a good mentor to zach. He brings a lot more to the table than thad young did.   I don’t care about picks at this point because none of them are gonna help the team get better soon enough to fit zachs timeline. They have to convince him to stay next offseason and as far as i know having demar will do a lot more to convince him than keeping thad young would. Also, with lonzo and pat will in the lineup with caruso and troy brown off the bench the defense can be pretty average with some lineups being above average.   They also still have the 20m cap hold on lauri markannen so its also possible to clear up a lot of space if they don’t keep him.   I think that these moves overall were to build a winning culture in Chicago, show that they can make the playoffs a few years in a row. Those are the teams that attract superstar free agents. Chicago should be a big market that everyone wants to play in. The previous front office was treating it like a small market team for far too long."
He's been wrong about a lot of things this offseason including saying things like:  Scott Brooks will be retained as head coach for the Wizards (just completely wrong)  Wes Unseld Jr is not the new coach (within a few hours the team announced it)  Russ is not going to be traded (traded within a week)  Demar Derozan to DC (most likely died when Russ got traded but still)  The only things he tends to get right are things related to Beal (he's good friends with their family). Everything else is sort of a crapshoot. Where he could be 100% right but I'd take anything he says with a bit of skepticism until he starts getting things right more consistently.
I’m high on Derozan but also know his limitations. When two of your best players (lavine Demar) have overlapping skill sets (get you a bucket) and overlapping deficiencies (horrid defence) that’s a recipe for a .500 team
"[According to John Hollinger via The Athletic:](https://theathletic.com/live-blogs/2021-nba-free-agency-live-updates-news-analysis-trades/Sv5IIlL9fSee) ""League source says the protection on the first-round pick from Chicago in the DeMar DeRozan trade will be top-10, then top-eight, then top-eight. It conveys two years after the first-round pick the Bulls owe to Orlando, which conveys anywhere from 2023 to 2025 or turns into two seconds. Most likely, the Spurs will get a first-round pick in 2025."""
"Idk I think there’s something to the idea that having someone like Demar Derozan as one of your main guys puts a ceiling on your success. He was a max-level guy, but he wasn’t underpaid on the max. It’s not like a Steph or a Lebron where they should be making 60% of the cap and there’s excess value. You’re just paying a guy that’s good enough to fuck up your depth, but not good enough to get you over the hill."
"knicks resigned their guys, signed kemba who just got brought out because no one wanted him enough to give up assets or pay him on that contract, and signed evan fournier lmao. at least lowry and pj tucker have playoff experience, lowry is definitely a better player.  lakers signed vets and potentially nice young players like monk and nunn, but im not bout to defend them  bulls got way better, brought in a real point who plays defense, and demar derozan lmao  knicks are easily below the bulls and heat"
Demar DeRozan.
"Nah lol sorry but at his *best* he's a significantly below average defender.  Read any breakdown/analysis of this move/DeRozan in general, they all mention he's a negative on that end of the court.  https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/fkatiu/how_has_demar_derozans_defense_changed_from_last/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.poundingtherock.com/platform/amp/2019/11/26/20983960/demar-derozan-defense-san-antonio-spurs-worst-defender-league  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/1/8/22220471/demar-derozan-spurs-trade-free-agency  And even with his move to the 4 for San Antonio last year he was still awful:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/l1ao37/oc_demar_derozan_is_a_four_now/   Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to have a relevant Bulls team to root for.  But DeRozan &amp; Vooch are objectively bad defenders and this team will struggle to defend anyone with them on the court together.  There's no use in lying to ourselves about objective reality."
Yeah it turns out that you need more than one person to stop teams offensively in the nba but go ahead and tell me how Graham will work out better defensively when he was never good at defense and now his back line defense will be the amazing duo of Zion and Bi LMAO.   Also there is nothing for me to find out about I already said Eversly trolled our season by signing demar derozan when we needed wing depth and a center
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
"I think most of the hype is the Lonzo signing(he's such a nice fit for us and we needed Caruso for depth) and that hype is seeping over into the other moves, mainly the Derozan move which I'm not a fan of. If we just got Caruso and Demar, there wouldn't be nearly as much buzz, so consider most of the hype from Ball instead of the other signings equally.  I've never been a fan of the Vooch trade, but after we did that we couldn't really do anything else but go all in. The long term hope is that we start winning with our core of Ball, Lavine, Paw and Vooch just enough(we're obviously still not contenders) to entice big name FAs to join us and put us over the top."

"zach lavine = one of the best scorers in the NBA  demar derozan = gives us some desperately needed playmaking and provides another wing who can relentlessly attack the basket   vucevic = big guy who scores from anywhere  like yeah derozan isn't going to help us much defensively but as i've said before, we have moves left to make and i'm not too worried about it for everything he's going to help us with offensively. these guys should play really nicely together"
"That’s fair.  I think if we’re talking fandom you have to understand GarPax, and the hatred of that FO. This is an organization for years that would sell 2nds for Cash Considerations. Do nothing. Or add Wade and Rondo past their prime.   The Bulls just gamed the cap system hard. They’ve brought in Demar and Ball and still have a netted Trade Exception from Theis and Lauri to sell in an S&amp;T.   In the short term, they have a team. They *could* be something. That hasn’t been said since we were hoping for Melo in FA back when that was a near Max proposition.  In the Long term, the Ball-LaVine-PWill is the happiest we’ve been on players 26-27 or younger in decades. Vucevic and DeRozan are old, for sure. But if they don’t work out directly maybe they can prove the concept of what can be built from that nucleus."
"&gt; Im starting to think not a lot of people watched the Spurs/Demar last year  yeah... I think we plan on using him as a 4 like y'all did a good bit this year. we played pwill at 3 and 4 last year, i think we might keep up the 3/4 position swapping with DeRozan."
"Of course he fits. There are three other capable shooters around him in Lonzo, Lavine, and Vuc, and even the Paw shot 39% from distance last year. Lonzo is not a great half court facilitator, so DeRozan can act as a playmaker/slasher and take some of the pressure off Lavine.       On defense they will have to trust that the Paw can cover him but it should be doable.       Plus there are vet intangibles that DeMar brings to the table. He was a good influence on the Spurs kids, Pop literally said [his leadership was amazing] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OHdjWXAOeOk). He and Vuc will be a good veteran duo for that squad."
Funny because I agreed with your ring-take in another thread but why do you care how much the worst NBA players are making? That's the job of the NBPA lawyers and they've agreed to a CBA in which non-generational talents make max money in the league. No wonder small-market teams are doing poorly. They're overpaying Scary Terry and Demar DeRozan.
"&gt; he’s going to a team that already had Levine to do that,  lavine has improved his passing as well but derozan is SUCH A BETTER PASSER than lavine  &gt;There’s a reason why every credible basketball analyst is killing this deal.   honestly i haven't really seen many analysts killing this deal at all personally lol. looking forward to seeing how it actually plays out. in theory i like it a lot. demar derozan is very good"
"Even the guy you're responding to says in his previous posts that Demar is best suited as a 6th man. It's just the truth, Derozan is a trash player who is either suited for 6th man or spamming worthless stats on a bad team, and this trash kid is celebrating 30m for 3 years of that garbage and ruining their teams capspace AND spacing AND defense and having a untradeable contract XD.  Enjoy mediocrity you trash casual fan, this the type of guy who would celebrate when Andre Drummond would join his team for the max (before when everyone besides smart people and Piston fans realized he was actually empty stat garbo) only to cry later on when they realize he's trash that you wouldn't barley want for the min."
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
DeMar DeRozan DeWas DeBeing DePlayed DeBy DeBoth DeLA DeTeams
"2013/4 - 2017/8  Kyle Lowry 19.0/4.9/6.9, .388 3P%, .577 TS%, 50.7 Ws, 5.0 BPM, 22.7 VORP   Demar DeRozan 23.4/4.5/4.2, .304 3P%, .542 TS%, 41.3 WS, 1.9 BPM, 13.1 VORP  Seriously how is Demar better at all?  Lowry is the better floor and ceiling raiser it is not even a question.  Raptor fans liked Demar more because he was homegrown plus there were a bunch of vocal fans who didn't like Lowry's whining to refs and obviously his constant problems with Casey while Demar is just a likeable guy who they saw grow up from terrible in his first few years to a star."
Never refer to Demar Derozan as “Rozan” ever again
"&gt; In isolation (in multiple senses) Demar is the better player. Surround them with 4 ""average"" players, I would much rather have Demar. He helps you win games, and I really hope he has been able to shake the un-clutch tag. With the Spurs he has been an incredible 4th quarter scorer - just hasn't had much chance to do that in playoffs.  This is just straight up not true. Lowry + the Bench Mob year in year out was a top 5 man lineup no matter which version of the Raptors Bench Mob. Meanwhile the exact same Bench Mob with DeRozan instead of Lowry were routinely negative lineups based on +/- and actually sometimes one of the worst somewhat used lineups in the entire league. That's why we actually abandoned trying to play DeRozan with the bench and instead had him come out first and bringing the bench in with Lowry as the sole starter. DeRozan is also a negative player in On-Off for his entire career. Career -1.9. -3.8 for his Spurs career and -2.5 for his Raptors career. DeRozan, and it hurts me to say this, is just the offensive version of Pat Bev. He tricking y'all. He doesn't just have no impact, he has a negative impact on teams. He is the best example I can think of an actual empty stats player. He puts up good box score stats but if you look just beyond them he is essentially an anchor around the team's legs.  Lowry is better if you surround him with 4 average players, better on a shit team (just look at how the Raptors turned around once he became the defacto starting point guard) and better on a good playoff team or contender. There is simply no argument for DeRozan at all."
"I don’t think the bulls are operating under the same assumption that this team is ‘mediocre.’   To me, the Bulls could’ve either traded LaVine and just been back to having a bad team or tried to build around him. There really was no third option that made viable sense. They made their decision and view DeRozan as a positive asset. Vuc is already over 30. Vuc and Demar will be a trial run with what the team/org believes has genuine upside and hopefully between your young players, you can have something that continuously is more enticing for a star to join and take over the top.   I think that’s the real thing— trading away cap is never easy but only if the deals become albatrosses, and even then can be used for instance to facilitate a trade/balance salary. Not as a positive asset but as a facilitation. I don’t think if the opportunity for a star that could take Ball and LaVine and maybe someone out of the PWil Coby Mirko bunch if they develop to the next level in the next couple years, I don’t think Demar would really represent a significant barrier to that facilitation.  I guess the simpler way to put it is this: If it makes this year better, the only significant reason not to do it is if the contract is truly restrictive in the future. I think you vastly overestimate how restrictive a 2/60ish or 1/30ish contract would be to facilitating a true superstar if the occasion arose."
"&gt; In isolation (in multiple senses) Demar is the better player. Surround them with 4 ""average"" players, I would much rather have Demar. He helps you win games, and I really hope he has been able to shake the un-clutch tag. With the Spurs he has been an incredible 4th quarter scorer - just hasn't had much chance to do that in playoffs.  This isn't true though. Lowry had better on/off #'s on the Raptors by a mile, regardless of how much talent they had around them. When they first made the playoffs in 2014, they had limited talent around the two of them (they started Amir Johnson at PF that year). The Raptors played 4 points better when Lowry was on the court. DeRozan had no on/off impact."
Heavily disagree about DeMar and Vuc not getting better  Vuc has gotten better every season and his game will age like wine and DeRozan transformed his game a bit over the past couple seasons and became one of the NBAs best passers
DeMar DeRozan DeHas DeNegative DeGravity
"Score more points =/= better.  Love DeRozan but Kyle had the leadership, defense, playmaking, and 3 point shooting Demar lacked. Demar is a really good playmaker now though"
"Lavine, Derozan, Coby White, Caruso, Lonzo  That's a loaded back-court. I guess Zach/Demar can play some small forward, but still. Will be interesting to see how it plays out."
"You are just gonna ignore how we have 3 point shooters around Siakam and Barnes, because you lost that point there. And now you say Raps don't do miracles. Did you see what Derozan was in college? He was a dunker, didn't do much else. We improved him tremendously. Casey didn't push Demar on defense. We pushed him to shoot 3s when we finally went with Nurse's offense in the final year of Casey in 2017, and he shot 31% from 3 - that's only after one summer of working on 3. The next summer we traded him to Spurs, and he stopped shooting 3s with Spurs. It's only been since 2017 that Raptors have gone over to the 3 point shooting offense.   Now did you see what we did with OG, Siakam, Boucher? Siakam was a 17% 3 point shooter. He was shooting 37% in 2018-2020 before dropping last year. That's a miracle. Scottie in contrast was shooting 28% in college. Have you looked at him? His stroke is much smoother than Siakam's. We'll get him to be a 38% shooter from 3 in a year or 2. Count on it."
Does DeMar DeRozan want to be a sixth man though?

Uh the Lakers definitely wanted him in some shape or form. He’s Demar Derozan. Just didn’t work out that way
"John Wall/DeMar Derozan would’ve been ECF shit a few years ago  it’d still be fun as hell to watch, but damn…"
"Derozan did that to himself. He was only trying to go to “contenders” but no “contenders” *really* wanted him and all the lesser teams started making signings at the beginning of FA. so he was forced to go to a lower end team.   That shit is on him.   Mavs had interest in the beginning of FA, but we couldn’t hold up acquisitions for a Demar Derozan who probably wouldn’t have came regardless. I imagine it’s the same for a lot of other teams as well."
"Again, our team this year was much worse defensively. So no it really doesn't matter if DeRozan is playing big minutes. Coby White is a worse defender then DeMar, we had Sato getting a lot of minutes.  Our perimeter defense is a million times better with Caruso/Lonzo alone, which is Vooch's biggest weakness when he has to get pulled to the perimeter. Vooch isn't as bad a defender as people think, he just has glaring weaknesses. This covers his.  We are already better."
DeMar DeRozan hasn't been an all-star in 3 years.
"What superstar? They have no cap room or trade assets, and DeMar DeRozan taking the highest offer doesn't mean that they're now an FA hotspot.   How good do you seriously think this team is, and what's their ceiling in the next two or three years compared to the rest of the East?"
"I can see the bulls flipping Lauri and Coby White for a big now too. Lotta guards on the roster   (Lonzo Ball, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, Devon Dotson)"
This hurts the DeMar DeRozan to Lakers narrative
Zach LaVine DeMar DeRozan Nikola Vucevic Lonzo Ball Alex Caruso   Damn
I never thought I’d be this happy to have Demar Derozan on my team.
"He spent weekdays with the family and weekends with his mom until she was able to get a consistent place to live. He then did the reverse by spending weekends at the Walker's and weekdays with his mom once she got a good place to live. He didn't have the easiest childhood by any chance but it wasn't like he was like DeMar DeRozan who grew up in the most dangerous city in America. Also it's not like Crosby didn't have his own problems growing up. He had a target on his back from a young age  &gt;[Crosby] has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant verbal abuse from parents on and off the ice. Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, he took to not wearing his jersey between tournament games while he waited to play so that he would not be recognized.  They both had disadvantages to their childhood and advantages, it's like comparing apples to oranges and we should all be glad we are able to watch two of the GOATs play their respective sport at the same time."
"Throw in Demar Derozan, Rudy Gobert, and Julius Randle if you want 30 names.  I don't know if you can pick 10 names from that list that you would rather have Simmons over."
"EFG% and more specifically TS% account for the extra variables you are tracking. TS% accounts for all three percentages and weighs them by respective attempts, as you can imagine people like curry and harden, who have not only high percentages, but also insane volume, do very well.  TS% is also pretty cool because you can more easily compare different styles of play, like demar derozan versus steph curry, versus Davis Bertrans versus domantas Sabonis. You still need the eye test to understand why they are different, it can be enlightening to know that joe Harris has a higher true shooting percentage than deandre ayton. (66 versus 65)"
"I have a question I have for everyone who seems to think getting better is always worse—  Is there *one example*... one *single example* in NBA history.... of a superstar wanting to come to a city, desiring to come to that city, and being unable to because of cap? Particularly in this era?   In the past half of a decade, we have seen a team that was ‘too fringe to ever win’ trade quite literally the player we are discussing— DeMar DeRozan— for one of the players you list and they won a Title.   So I guess why is a good team an albatross? People say that but how often is it true? Why would Giannis or Kawhi or AD or any of the players you list later in their career prefer to go to a Bulls team with Zach LaVine and bad role players over a team with LaVine and Ball and Vooch and DeRozan where they may be able to pick and choose players to play with?   I agree with you that the Bulls have gotten better and aren’t a true contender right now. But are we saying that the only way to move forward when you can’t instantly make a title contender to lose every year where regardless you have to compete with a *lottery system.*.   So yeah I just don’t think this team construction notion that you’re either a true contender, a tanker, or an idiot realistically makes any sense. Despite the fact that so many fans seem to have it."
"Carmelo Anthony, Demar Derozan, Zach Lavine, Manu Ginobli and Kobe"
"I'm going to ignore the strawman presented here.  I'm in the belief that Barrett will be better this year because he is a better shooter [True Shooting Percentage is not a measure of being a better shooter, its a measure of scoring efficiency], a better defender, and frankly I don't value someone of LeVert's skill-set because your team isn't going anywhere with him playing the role he does.  LeVert's usage doesn't allow for other perimeter players to flourish on-ball in a way which Barrett's skill-set allows. LeVert needs the ball to have his impact  and it takes on a usage where other players can't have the ball.   I always think about the DeMar DeRozan vs Danny Green comparison. I would take Danny Green over DeMar 10/10 times."
"he didn’t destroy the spurs, y’all did by trading him for DeMar DeRozan and a useless first round pick"
"Dame is on the trading block right now. If Chicago had been smart and gathered assets they would have enough to trade for Dame. Instead they won too many useless regular season games and drafted shitty #7 draft picks and here we are. No superstar, no dynamic young player, but 80M on DeMar DeRozan. aka a road to nowhere. I have nothing against Chi. I just call it like I see it."
"DeMar worked pretty well for the Spurs last season. I don't think they'll have any problems between himself, Lavine, and DeRozan."
A better return than DeMar DeRozan? 😭
Did anybody better than Demar Derozan actually move West to East this off-season? I feel like I’m missing something.
DeMar DeRozan was the worst contract of the offseason.
Demar Derozan
come on bro Lebron dominated Demar Derozan in the East for years. who else could do that?
"Which if we're honest with ourselves even without injuries Klay as a 2 started to become a problem for GSW moreso than the opposition because NBA offense is becoming more and more predicated on having multiple ballhandlers/playmakers and that decidedly isn't Klay. He made the easy passes like everyone in the warriors system in the late 2010s but by 2019 (especially after KD went down) they really struggled to generate consistent offense if Steph wasnt cooking. Even though they swept Portland that was moreso Portland collapsing because they had *multiple* 20 point leads, their defense deserves credit but you play those game scenarios out 10 times Portland closes those leads at least 5-6 times and we're talking about the '19 WCF completely differently.   There are healthy guys of his body archetype (Paul George, DeMar DeRozan) that naturally slid up in positions the last couple years. The off guard spot is leaning more towards athleticism and ballhandling/shot creating skill than length and defensive switching ability. Pre-injury Klay is a prototypical SF today"
"DeMar DeRozan. Also on this list. Kemba, KAT, and Bradley Beal"
Demar Derozan
Patty Mills and DeMar DeRozan 🖤
"Completely agree bro  An uber athletic scorer that can hit the midrange wouldn't do shit in the modern NBA. Oh wait, wasn't Demar Derozan all nba during his prime? Blake Griffin was an MVP candidate once right?"
Demar Derozan
"&gt;The worst team lebron played in the finals is better than the best team Jordan played   2011 Mavs is not better than the 90's Jazz lol, or the '93 Suns or '96 Sonics for that matter. Plus, its not like Lebron had a better team than the Bad Boy Pistons in his own conference.  &gt;Imagine being guarded by Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec in finals after finals instead of defensive players of the year like Leonard and green  Two can play this game. Imagine being guarded by JJ Barea, Demar Derozan and rookie Jayson Tatum instead of prime Rodman, Gary Payton, Joe Dumars and John Starks.   &gt;yet lebron has much better finals performances  Really? Lebron averages 28/10/8 on 48% FG and 4 turnovers per game in the finals. Jordan averages 34/6/6 on 48% FG and 3 turnovers per game in the finals."
"Someone described Booker a few years ago on this sub as DeMar DeRozan but he’ll shoot the 3, and I’ve never looked back."
Kevin Love will wear clothes next season.  DeMar DeRozan will average more than 1 assist.
"Who were probably the biggest unrestricted free agents this summer? You had guys like Kawhi, Conley, and Chris Paul who just re-signed with their teams (and that could happen with LaVine, of course). But what about guys like Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan? They were unrestricted but ended up getting signed and traded elsewhere. So the same could happen with big unrestricted free agents next summer as well, right?  So of course, the big question is ""why would the Bulls sign and trade LaVine next summer?"" Well first he'd have to make them believe he's going to leave no matter what. He could do that by threatening to go to Orlando, San Antonio or Detroit. That's probably how Kyle Lowry got Toronto to send him to Miami: by making them think if they didn't then he'd go sign with New Orleans and they'd get nothing in return. At least now they have Precious and Dragic, right?  So if LaVine wanted to go to say, the Lakers (this is Klutch, after all), all he'd have to do is convince the Bulls that they're going to lose him either way, and then they'll feel like they'd be better off getting something for him rather than nothing. So then all the Lakers would have to do to offer him a 4 year max at $154 million in a sign and trade is send back matching salary for that first year at $35.7 million. If only the Lakers had a big expiring contract they could send... Oh yeah, Westbrook will only have one year left on his contract next summer, they could send him! They also could send Chicago native Talen Horton-Tucker or their first round pick in 2027, 2028 or 2029 if needed.   So there you go. If you're a conspiracy theorist and you're wondering why LaVine might sign with Klutch, well it could be for the same reason Anthony Davis did. Or maybe he plans to just re-sign with the Bulls and wants Rich Paul to represent him. We'll have to wait and see."
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid. Guys like Biyombo, Mozgov, Mahinimi, Deng, Parsons, etc. [Here's a list from that summer.](https://www.businessinsider.com/31-best-nba-free-agents-2016-2016-6)"
He’s taller and lankier than most players so it’s really hard to say like his body reminds me of a better version of Malik Monk’s (not play style just look) and he moves like a faster DeMar DeRozan if that makes sense.
That’s the dude that got dunked on by Demar DeRozan and Amare Stoudemire
Demar Derozan &gt; Jamal Crawford &gt; Lou Williams
Stephen Jackson plus Demar Derozan equals Kobe Bryant
When will demar derozan bulls jersey be available?
"He was speaking up for mental health accommodations. But he wasn't famous like Kevin Love, Demar Derozan, or Simone Biles."
Khris middleton vs DeMar DeRozan
"Yes, it does. You can't always hunt match ups against better personnel and specific schemes like you see in the playoffs. There's a reason why Tatum can maintain volume and efficiency in the playoffs while DeMar DeRozan struggled to do so."
Demar derozan sucks at basketball
Demar DeRozan maybe. Playoff success is pretty much the only thing hes missing.
"They then added Nikola Vucevic in midseason, and signed DeMar DeRozan while trading away Thad Young (their best defensive player). Combined with Lavine and yeah, that's a recipe for a defensive disaster. Ball and Caruso are good but they can't overcome Vuc LaVine and DeRozan"
"?? It's about comparing him with Curry, not comparing him with his former self. DeMar DeRozan doesn't need to be *bad* for him to be in a totally different league than Curry."
"That is exactly it, I watched Demar Derozan (bad NBA defender by most standards) play a drew league game against a upcoming top 5 pick (I think it was marvin bagley) and he absolutely locked him down"
Demar Derozan is the 82nd best player.
"I once got called Filipino DeRozan so I’m saying DeMar  I am absolutely garbage at 3 pointers and catch/shoot , but when you get me in a pick a roll , I can hit midrange shots and floaters  Obviously I will never be as good as DeMar , but at least I have the pump fake down"
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
DeMar DeRozan and Michael Jordan are the same players in different eras.
"Vince Carter, Shaq, Ben Wallace, Shawn Kemp, Larry Johnson         Honorable Mention: Demar Derozan, Lillard, Sir Charles, Dr J"
Nowadays FG% for a guard is useless unless you know what % of their shots are from 3.  Demar Derozan had a higher FG% than Curry last year for example.
What how? All they gave up was Thad Young and a protected 1st for Demar basically. Thad Young was great for them but getting an all-star in Derozan was definitely worth trading him.
"Westbrook was the least efficient player that got a first place mvp vote. The list includes players like John Wall, DeMar DeRozan and Isaiah Thomas. That and he almost got swept in the first round. Harden should have won that MVP."
"Pretty much all the superstars have decent shot selection. AD and Giannis probably have the least ideal shot selection cause all those face-up contested midrange shots AD takes and the fact that Giannis is even attempting 3s.  For non-superstars, Derozan and Middleton. Demar won't ever shoot the 3 so his offense is predictable, which isn't necessarily bad if you're unstoppable somewhere else, but he isn't. Middleton settles for the dumbest shots a lot of the time, it's why he's hyper efficient and unstoppable one night then shooting 30% the next. And yeah, WB is in there like you said. For all the post turnaround bank shots he takes, the dude makes like two or three of them every two weeks."
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
"DeMar DeRozan, Karl Anthony Towns, CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell"
"It is different mentality with soccer, cause soccer fans are not crazy about the best player(they are but laid back fans are not), i.e. my favorite players are Raul Gonzalez and Ronaldinho and I don't care if they are not the best, they don't have to be the best, they are my favs and that's it.   In NBA people who are not fans of the teams cant have the same thing cause this reddit and social media would make you think if Lebron is not absolute best currently he is shit not worth and so on, people think it is something to be ashamed if you like lower tier guys like Demar Derozan, Eric Gordon and rotation bench players we meme like they are joke of a players like Bayness, Boban, Cancar or idk Javale..."
"demar I hear, ‘Dis dis dude DeMar DeRozan jus do dis’ demar I like the sound of it."
"I don’t know man, in an age of positionless basketball I don’t think that archetype holds any meaning. Like, three of the best passers in the league are Lebron, Demar Derozan, and Jokic, who are a small forward (mostly), a shooting guard and a center respectively."
"I like him, but DeMar Derozan."
DeMar derozan
"This.  There is a reason why some players are 82 game players and some are 16 game players.  Using Demar Derozan on the Raptors as an example, the guy was absolutely elite in the midrange, driving, and drawing fouls, but he was absolute dogshit or non-existant in other areas.  He wouldnt shoot 3-pters, sucked at facilitating, and was a junk on defense.  This was fine in the regular season, where half the teams are awful and cant match up properly, and teams arent gameplanning every single matchup, but come playoff time, teams are doubling him early and refs are swallowing their whistles, while attacking him on defense every possession.  All of a sudden his strengths are minimized and his weaknesses magnified, and he goes from all star to dogshit.  It really speaks to why players like Lebron, Kawhi, KD are so successful and champions - they have weaknesses, but only relative to their strengths. Even their worst attributes are still good enough to make positive impacts"
Kyle Lowry  Vince Carter  Demar Derozan  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Bosh  &amp;#x200B;  Probs not but just trying to mix it up
"Top 8 imo.. The biggest problems: Defense and sharing the ball. Defense: Vucevic: horrible defending.. Derozan: Absolutely no defending.. Lonzo: Individual defense is good even not elite but if team not defending well, he just concedes. Caruso: Good perimeter defender. Zach: not a good defender..  I expect them to be worst 5 or 10 defence in NBA tbh.  Sharing the ball: Zach LaVine wants to play with the ball, Lonzo too, Demar too.. Who will be the PG, who will handle the more more?  I believe Bulls just wasted all of their resources for bringing 5+ individually good players which will create a very bad and unharmonic team while playing together.. Also who pays Demar that much!?"
"Demar Derozan.   Dear, Zero D Man."
"I'm not convinced that their defensive success towards the end of the season was sustainable, and I'm not so sure they got better on paper— replacing Thaddeus Young with DeMar DeRozan is a pretty big defensive downgrade in my book, and having watched Lonzo in New Orleans, I don't think he's the defensive stopper that people seem to think he is. Alex Caruso is a great pickup coming off the bench, though."
1) Tony Allen  2) Kawhi Leonard   3) Demar DeRozan  4) Andrew Wiggins  5) Charles Barkley   6) Shawn Kemp
"Scoring. Vooch and DeRozan are good scorers in regular season. Where scouting isn’t focused entire to the Bulls. As I’ve said in my other comment. Prime DeRozan choked against the Wall, Beal, Paul Pierce, Otto, Marcun Gortat Wizards. Then against the LeBron Cavs following that. Vooch didn’t have much success in the playoffs as well.    Miami has Bam who will have a filed day dunkinh lobs over Vooch. Bulls defenders aren’t really fast in closing out to Heat’s three pointers as well. Heat will pressure the Bulls in defense. Unless Zach goes bananas and the rest just feeds him. Then Heat will use their athleticism , quickness and shooting to punish the slower DeMar and Vooch. It’s just a bad match-up IMO.   I follow non-bulls teams a lot. And I know the limitations of the new acquisitions. Bulls will make the playoffs. But it’s gonna be a hard battle in the first round against either of the east top 4."
"I think you are forgetting how good DeMar DeRozan has been. He could have been an all-star last year and the Spurs only let him go because they are rebuilding and had no reason to pay him. The Pelicans are getting ridiculed for letting Zo go, because he certainly shouldn't have been dispensable.  They have 3 players that could all be All-stars this year and Zo and Patrick Williams could be good role players. And their lineup fits decently well together on paper. Some people saying they are contenders are going too far but this team is certainly capable of being a top 4 seed if they mesh well."
"I believe our offense will carry to a higher seed. Lavine, Vucevic, DeMar, Coby + Lonzo and PWill being respectable to good 3pt shooters. I believe we have 4 guys that can get 25+ on any night. If Lauri stays and commits to being a bench guy then that’s even more firepower. Playoffs is one thing but I can see us blowing at a lot of teams away in the reg season.   As far as defense, DeRozan is not a good defender and there better options (but who’s actually obtainable?)… But we were playing lineups consisting of Coby, Lavine, Valentine, Lauri etc and we were never ranked lower than 13th defensively. That isn’t terrific like the Knicks but we were never trash. We lost Thad yes but also upgraded with Zo and Caruso + probably make another 4/5 signing. So DeMar is replacing Lauri and Valentine, our defensive issues are being overstated. We’ll just never be great on that side of the ball.   This past season showed that you never know what’ll happen in the postseason. But you have to get there first. The new FO just put Chicago in position to compete. That’s it"
LaMarcus Aldridge   Tracy McGrady  Vince Carter  Chris Paul  Steve Nash  Paul Millsap  Rudy Gay  Marc Gasol  Kemba Walker  DeMar DeRozan  Shawn Marion  Dwyayayayane Wade
"Oh then we agree, I shouldn't put Vucevic and Demar like they are the same : Vuc at least can fit with anybody.  Demar I just hate it, because he's really bad defensively. And yeah he's a better passer than Lavine so you can argue him having the ball with Zach off ball isn't a problem, but a Demar Derozan offense will always struggle in the playoffs, while I really think Lavine can still improve as a on ball guy, and if Demar declines it's an absolute disaster"

This initials thing is getting out of hand . Who refers to Nick Nurse as NN ? or DeMar Derozan as DD?  What do you all make of that saved time ? lol .
"Are the Bulls going to run line-ups of Lonzo Ball - Alex Caruso - Zach LaVine - DeMar DeRozan - Nikola Vucevic this season?  And if so, can we have all minutes of that lineup posted to this subreddit somehow? Because that lineup sounds like a blast."
"I wouldn’t be surprised Billy quickly realizes Caruso is a great 3rd guy/role player with Lonzo/Lavine, while DeMar is super well-suited to running the bench offense and FEASTING on opposing backup players.  They’re not gonna shakeup the starting lineup (at least this year), but I think Derozan will end up fulfilling a lot of what a typical 6th man does, while Caruso plays more of a role player role with the other starters. Great way to keep our stars always on the floor as well."
"I think his d brings him over Derozan but demar also became a more complete, all round player"

Real DeMar DeRozan vibes
"Beating Al Horford and Paul Milsap, Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, and young PG and Roy Hibbert.  Context please.  Shaq had to go through Duncan and the Spurs, Dirk's Mavricks, Webber and the Kings, Nash and Stoudemire, prime KG, Pippen's Blazers.  All of those teams were better than anything Lebron faced during his 8 straight Finals.  Shaq actually had competition before the Finals.  Lebron did not.  Lebron's Finals run is one of the most overrated accomplishment in sports history."
REPORTS: Demar DeRozan is beside himself. Driving around downtown Miami begging (thru texts) Lowry's family for address to Kyle’s home
"DeMar DeRozan has all the tools to be an elite defender.   Height, weight,wingspan, athleticism,speed,vertical."
"Lowry has been the best player on the Raptors since he became the defacto starting point guard instead of splitting time with Calderon in his first season with us. It is inarguable then and now. DeRozan was the face of the team because he had a longer tenure thanks to being drafted by us, had the ""I got us"" tweet, after Bosh left and put up good box score, splits especially points. But if you look even slightly beneath the surface, DeRozan was actually a negative on the floor as shown by having a negative on-off for his career and every single season except one. Or that the lineup data which birthed the Lowry + Bench Mob as one of the top lineups year in year out while DeRozan+Bench Mob was so routinely terrible that Casey actually just pretty much stopped playing DeRozan with the bench. You don't even need to look at the on-off, lineup data or advanced stats to come to this conclusion, all you gotta do is consistently watch the Lowry DeRozan Raptors to come to it, the eye test makes it glaringly obvious that we played better with DeRozan on the bench than on the court whether that be with the starters or bench. Or just looking at the season when Lowry was splitting time at the PG with Calderon vs the next season where he was our true point guard we went up 14 wins which wasn't just that bump up in his role but was a big contributing factor. It kinda sucks cause DeRozan is a fucking legend in the city (my city love me like DeMar DeRozan) but lets stop with this ""Lowry wasn't the better player"" revisionist history. Especially coming from someone who ain't even a Raptors fan, like whose mans is this?  Oh, and don't forget, second option and second best are not the same thing. DeRozan was the first option scorer, but Lowry was the actual best player. Siakam was the second option on the championship team but it is clear Lowry was the second best player. Or for a non-Raptors example, Rudy Gobert was deemed the best player on the Jazz during Mitchell's rookie and sophomore season by many. PPG is not the end all be all of NBA basketball.  And Rondo wasn't a main guy either, he was a clear fourth banana behind the Big 3. You can never make any argument that Lowry was not the best player when with DeRozan or the 2nd best player when with Kawhi. It is set in stone."
"Not true, LeBron James and DeMar DeRozan are both all stars"
"Which players in the East from Lebron's eight year run will be in the Hall, in your opinion?  You say we don't know because we are not far enough removed.  I feel we have a pretty good idea right now whether or not Paul Milsap or Al Horford deserve to be in the Hall.  Demar Derozan has shown us enough to say he isn't a Hall of Famer.  I don't think Lowry has done enough to make the Hall, and if he does, it would be almost entirely because Kawhi dragged him to a title.  PG has a decent chance, but I'm not sure he has done enough yet.  Plus, PG was far from his prime in those early Pacer days.  It is all opinion in the end.  There is no way to say with any certainty that the 97 Heat would beat the 60 win Hawks or Raptors.  I can't say for sure, but it is my opinion that the Heat would indeed win.  I watched those Heat teams.  I watched those Hawks and Raptors teams.  I would take the 97 Heat over any team Lebron beat during his eight year run.    I do think looking at how many Hall of Famers were battling in the conference gives us a good indication of just how competitive that conference was.  When talking specifically about Hall of Fame credentials a couple years ago, Zach Lowe and his guests on his podcast discussed how the Eastern Conference over the proceeding decade had skewed the notion that having ""x"" number of all star appearances helped make a players case for the Hall.  They were debating whether or not the all star appearances in the East should count as 2/3 or 3/4 of an appearance based on how weak the talent level in the East has been.  The Eastern Conference being a joke for that entire decade is pretty universally accepted.  Are you arguing that the East was not incredibly weak during that stretch?"

A DeMar Derozan and Alex Caruso highlight in a Cavs vs Bulls game. Just as we all expected.
DeMar DeRozan (48)....
"Not Wiggins.   But yes to Glenn Robinson, Boogie Cousins, and DeMar DeRozan."
&gt;DeMar DeRozan? Gone. LaMarcus Aldridge? Gone. Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are gone   but Joshua Primo has arrived
"lol as a raptors fan shut up bro  just say you don't like DeRozan and go, you clearly missed the point of the post and just wanted to talk shit about demar"
"We had worse defenders on the team last year and still managed a top 15 defense. The only truly terrible defender we have starting is DeroZan and he could easily just be put on a non shooter. Analytics say LaVine and Vuc aren’t good defenders but they’re not liabilities. Especially since we literally saw LaVine be an excellent defender on team USA when he’s not tasked with carrying the load offensively. LaVine + Vuc = Tatum + Brown but we have Demar who’s coming off the most complete season of his career. And I’d take our role players in Zo, Caruso, Pat, Bradley over the Celtics ones. It’s a lot closer than you think and the Celtics were a 7 seed last year that got worse."
"Exactly. Derozan signed an extension to try to win a ring with Toronto and then his team flips him and he has to watch his best friend win a ring on the Raptors.  Never came out and demanded a trade, never complained about teammates or coaching, didn’t pout when we missed the playoffs, never tried to change the rebuild. Just went along for the ride and did all he could to win and was a huge positive presence for our young guys. I think the lack of team success and short time with the franchise is going to be what stops him from getting his number retired with SA, but I’ve been watching the Spurs for nearly 30 years and DeMar fits precisely what a Spurs player should be and deserves to have his number in the rafters"
"this post has ""MJ is just Demar Derozan with 40 inch vert"" feel to it"
"Personally I actually think the Raptors would be the easiest team for him to beat(you aren't winning with DeMar DeRozan vs. KD just like you aren't winning with DeRozan vs. LeBron, and the Raptors defense was awful in that series)  I also think he would beat the Pacers  The question is would he have enough stamina by the ECF"
Also why is Harden like a literal god most of the time in game and wins MVP like 90% of the time but his team always loses later on lmao  I swear every time you even simulate the current season on here he wins MVP   But in every one of these simulations I've done he's played like DeMar DeRozan in the playoffs
Why is Harden always trash in the playoffs in these simulations 😭  Ik he’s not exactly the most clutch player but he ain’t Demar Derozan 💀
I’m a bulls fan and the thing is lavine lonzo and demar Derozan are all 6’6 that is short for a wing player
The gif of Lowry hugging DeRozan is my all time fave https://giphy.com/gifs/nba-replay-demar-derozan-4MY5B10ngxPAWSgluQ
"they were 12th in defensive rating, but it was a three way tie, so they were actually tied in 10th place technically.   I totally agree. People say the fit is bad because of Derozan. But they don't realize that this is actually the ideal roster for a player like Derozan. On the Bulls he is surrounded by really good three point shooters and two other elite offensive threats in Zach and Vooch.   I think the other reason people are skeptical is because they think Zach, Demar, and Lonzo are all ball dominant and won't be able to get as many touches as they need. This isn't really true though. Lavine is one of the most efficient scorers in the league which means he doesn't need a lot of touches to score a lot of points. And Lonzo is more of a facilitator than scorer, so his touches should be turning into points for his teammates. The only true ball dominant player is Derozan.   Also we see year after year super teams form with multiple ""ball dominant"" players and do just fine. Good players figure out how to play together."
"Just you wait and see. All advanced metrics rate Caruso higher than Demar. Glue guys matter.  Who do you think the bucks would rather have closing a game, PJ Tucker or DeRozan?"
"Yes I’m sure famed playoff performer DeMar Derozan will surely deliver, as he always has. Can’t forget the incredible Billy Donovan either, with his renowned ability to make adjustments in the playoffs!"
People really underestimate proven all-stars like Derozan and overrate young talent that hasn't proven anything. Yea they only won 38 with Demar as the #1 option but that number probably would have been like 25 without him.
Not necessarily.  If it had happened this off season. Sixers would now have the cap space to go buy Lonzo or Demar Derozan. And get a bunch of solid mid-level Weapons while retaining the draft picks.
Because MJ is significantly better than Demar Derozan
"overpaid Demar Derozan so he can pass up open 3 point shots for a contested midrange jumper, expected Lonzo Ball to be anything more than a 6th man type player, traded Thaddeus Young. Vuc and LaVine, while “good” by some measures, aren’t really anchor level stars that you can base a franchise around. So what the fuck are they doing? But I’m willing to wait and see. I just think the overall optimism surrounding this roster construction is a bit on the delusional side but I am sure people will run in with advanced stats to show why the individual players are good, but that would just be missing the point."
Spurs are an elite organization who already won before Kawhi. Raptors were constantly an elite regular season team with a ceiling as a 2nd round exit because replacing Demar Derozan with any star is an obvious upgrade. Why do you sound like an arrogant punk?
"He was a relatively important part of the DeMar DeRozan trade; I know Bulls fans don't like to hear it, but having to give him up is a pretty big negative.  ESPN's Kevin Pelton, who is more of a basketball nerd/statistical models guy than a hot take artist had it as about a push whether DeMar or Thaddeus was more valuable straight up (for this season), before even considering the contract and the pick."
Demar derozan. Is that what u wanted to hear?
"Pascal came in looking at Demar and Kyle as big brothers and saw how that dynamic was on the court and relationship off the court. No matter what, Lowry is/was always going to be a big brother who could at anytime come down and snatch the reigns from Pascal. Pascal wants to be on the same footing as Derozan was in terms of freedom. The ball was put in Derozan’s hands for better or for worse, nobody questioned it. But we’ve seen this past year even, Raptors fans exclaiming Pascal is not a #1, he’s a #2 and questioning his game &amp; standing with the team.   When Lowry sat last year, Fred and Pascal took over and had such great synergy to the point where it looked like it was time to move on from Lowry. Hearing it from Pascal and Fred solidifies what the eye test was showing. Lowry is GOAT and big dog eats first. But it’s time for the young pups to mature and get a chance to run the pack with no other alpha challenger. Lowry wanted his 30M deal so there was no way he was going take a back seat like he did for Derozan and even Kawhi."
Idk if DeMar DeRozan is smart but he seems very mature and in tune with himself.
"Yeah, Ben’s case is really similar to DeRozan. They are both great regular season players but they just can’t replicate their game in the playoffs.          For DeRozan it’s that he has less space and he gets less calls. For Ben it’s that transition opportunities are non-existent and the game is played in the half court. Both also get in their own heads when things don’t work for a few games, which makes everything worse.            DeMar did re-invent his game though, so perhaps he would have a better time in the playoffs now that he has improved his passing. I think Ben can do the same if he improves his FT shooting and improves his slashing."
"Maybe you don't understand how this works, but let's just get this straight.    Ben is not entitled to millions of dollars just for walking the earth.  Ben Simmons chose to be a basketball player.  He chose to sign this contract.  He chose not to even try to improve his game.    &gt;What part of “Ben won’t come back and get fined hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to avoid the fans” are you missing.  Ok then let him. Win/Win right?  It's a negotiation contract from a guy that is already robbing a team blind and has appeared to not care about actually winning in basketball since before the NBA.  &gt;Kevin Love, DeMar DeRozan, and every other NBA player that battle depression, suicidal thoughts, etc didn’t manifest on its own.  So you are their personal psychologist or psychiatrist?  Kevin Love has publicly stated that his depression was exacerbated by not being able to play (the opposite of what Simmons is doing right now) and  DeRozan has publicly stated that he has dealt with depression since childhood.  Lemme know how the fans did that again.  &gt;And that seems like the perfect crappy response. Fire a guy instead of helping a guy.  Dude this isn't something that happened overnight.  It's been years and he was handled with kids gloves the entire time.  If you had an employee at work that you thought was having a mental block and you gave them years of advice on how to overcome that mental block and they refused to even try, do you really believe it's just a mental block and not an attitude or effort issue?    At a certain point, you have to realize that there are lazy/entitled/stubborn people out there and you can't let them take advantage of you just because some people have depression.  This is despite the fact that Ben Simmons has literally never claimed to have depression, ever, so I'd appreciate if you stopped throwing that around like it has any merit.  &gt;That’s not a solution, that’s pushing the problem to somewhere else.  Yeah, that's how it works.  Ben Simmons' mental softness and attitude issues are currently our problem because of his contract, and I want them to not be our problem anymore.  He had plenty of chances to change and didn't take them, and at this point that is on him.  &gt;Oh so you take it personally and feel then if you can ruin his life it will make you feel better.   How am I trying to ruin his life? lolololol. Jesus are you his uncle or something?  Criticizing his lack of willingness to improve is ruining his life?!?!?!  Honestly, are you Ben himself, because that sounds like something he would think.  He didn't fuck up by not attempting to improve, OTHERS are trying to ruin his life by criticizing his lack of attempting to improve.  You're killing me lol  &gt;News flash, if you goal is to get the best return for him, driving him to avoid the team is the thing that lost you leverage and continuing to hurt it.  Sunk cost dude, we're already fucked at this point.  I'm all for just holding him until a team gets desperate or he decides to play/retire.  I'm tired of treating Simmons like White House Aides had to treat trump to keep his ego inflated because he can't handle a single piece of criticism.  It's exhausting.  Like this is an actual quote from Doc during the Wizards series:  &gt;“Only in Philadelphia,” Rivers said Tuesday when asked about the critics. “If you guys don’t know the treasure you have by now, then shame on everyone because he’s been fantastic for us. He creates points every single night for us. When Ben was on the floor, we were really good.  He called him a TREASURE.  If a grown-ass man needs to be called a ""treasure"" to feel good enough to play, and then demands a trade when he's actually held to the standard of a max-contract player.  &gt;Second news flash, the return you get for Ben is going to end the Sixers status as real contenders  Yeah, that was the case from the time we were eliminated from the playoffs, due to his performance.    &gt;The Sixer could have possibly had Harden by giving up Thybulle (though not guaranteed).  This was the first time I was 100% sure you weren't Ben Simmons, because we offered Simmons+Thybulle+picks.  Houston refused to make the trade because of they hate Morey.  &gt;Is Philly a miserable place?  I don't live in Philly anymore, but I visited a few weeks ago and had an amazing time actually.  Lastly I just want to call out that your implication that we can't criticize people for lack of effort or a poor attitude because they might get depressed is an insult to people actually suffering with depression.  As someone who has suffered from depression, and has a history of mental illness in my family and lost people to suicide, your take is insulting.  If Ben is dealing with depression then he needs to see a therapist, not change the entire world around him so that he doesn't have to learn to cope."
"And that’s how fans justify it. It’s not like I did X. Ben apparently doesn’t have emotions as long as your attacks are only basketball. This is the same argument that verbally abusive people use. It’s not like I did X. What part of “Ben won’t come back and get fined hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to avoid the fans” are you missing. When a guy gives up money to be left alone that’s a good indication that he is hurting mentally.   Kevin Love, DeMar DeRozan, and every other NBA player that battle depression, suicidal thoughts, etc didn’t manifest on its own. It was fans that justified their attacks because they only went after that thing that was public.   And that seems like the perfect crappy response. Fire a guy instead of helping a guy. Because that has proven to work so well in our society. You certainly don’t get people that snap that way. That’s not a solution, that’s pushing the problem to somewhere else. Instead of publicly going after the guy (which you can see did not work), privately work with him to get on the same page. That’s Doc doing a bad job.   Oh so you take it personally and feel then if you can ruin his life it will make you feel better. News flash, if you goal is to get the best return for him, driving him to avoid the team is the thing that lost you leverage and continuing to hurt it. Every GM is lowballing Philly because they know those fans are forcing Morey’s hand. It’s why Morey tried to mend fences. So by being so self serving all you did was hurt yourself (which is actually typical of selfish desires).   Second news flash, the return you get for Ben is going to end the Sixers status as real contenders. It has been driven into the dirt. The Sixer could have possibly had Harden by giving up Thybulle (though not guaranteed). Now you aren’t getting a tier one player. Morey is going to have to find some gems. You aren’t doing that in one offseason.   Is Philly a miserable place?"
DeMar DeRozan is a good defender
"Excerpt:   &gt; In the two months that followed their first-round playoff flop against Phoenix, when Davis’ groin injury left them pulling up lame, the Lakers explored the prospect of trading for such stars as Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook. The process unfolded well beyond the team’s front office’s search, with James setting up a war room of his own at his Brentwood estate for some in-person player meetings while leading remote communications in other conversations."
"Isaac does not realize that being a public figure , your words hold more weight than let’s say anybody of us right now. For him that’s harmless , for someone , that’s another weapon they’ll use to spread misinformation  I remembered when DeMar was open about his depression , a bunch of people in our school who have never seen DeMar in person , bought his jersey and were more open towards depression and mental health  All I’m saying is this: Be more DeRozan and not Isaac"
The spacing argument with DeMar is overrated. He’s been a premier piece in multiple top 5 NBA offenses and this is arguably the best offensive team he’s been on. Offense and role definition will not be a problem whatsoever for DeRozan or Chicago.
So is DeMar DeRozan just stealing pay checks? Is DeMar DeRozan win share meaningless? This stat never made sense to me because if a team is always worse with a player..why play him
"&gt;mediocre players like DeRozan and Vucevic  Vucevic was literally an All-Star this year, and DeMar was probably the best non All-star this year"
The Demar DeRozan effect
[DeRozan thought he was going to the Lakers](https://sports.yahoo.com/demar-derozan-opens-up-about-free-agency-move-i-felt-like-going-to-the-lakers-was-a-done-deal-180945526.html)
"I’d be sick if I was a Lakers fan, at the time it’s not like one was way better than the other or one was worse than the other but fit should’ve played a major factor in their decision making last offseason and it clearly didn’t with the Lakers passing on both DeRozan and Hield. Both Westbrook and Demar don’t provide 3pt floor spacing but demar is still an elite offensive player everywhere inside the arc and his playmaking is just as impactful as Westbrooks."
So Buddy Hield thought the deal with the Lakers was done. And so did DeRozan. Meaning there’s a timeline where the Lakers land DeMar and Hield. Instead they end up with Westbrook. That’s some Vlade level incompetence right there.
"They did, but both times that they did they were either just pieces on a well rounded team (2018) or had way more help than Zach or DeRozan ever had (2020).  On the hierarchy of wing duos i would say that Tatum and Brown as a pair are behind LaVine/DeRozan and PG/Kawhi. They don't have the playmaking ability that both of the other duos have and while they might be better defenders than LaVine and DeRozan, they are less efficient.  I mean, they are averaging 5.9 assists as a duo and they aren't elite perimeter defenders (like PG and Kawhi) or incredibly efficient (like Zach and DeMar) to make up for it."
"KD is my favorite player so him, but I would love to see Joker go back to back as well, but as a bulls fan the way we've been playing and the way this boy has been shooting lights out, if DeMar DeRozan when's the m v p I'm all good with that haha"
"ESPN: Bulls star DeMar DeRozan claims teammates don't care for his healthy, try to overwork him"
Iirc someone tried to rob Demar Derozan’s house at one point too and he chased them off. Could you imagine being chased by Demar fucking Derozan?

DeMar DeRozan Demoralizes De Defense
"Someone hasn’t watched Demar at all in the past few years. He’s become a great playmaker, he’s great at attacking the rim, his defense has been way improved this season, always putting in the effort and helping our always intense perimeter defense, he’s been shooting more 3s than he has pretty much ever (and a solid percentage too), and he hasn’t even been in the playoffs for a while, players can develop a lot in 4 years, Derozan himself is a prime example of that."
"Nah, they def would've taken the deal Lakers gave to Wizards for DeRozan. Especially since DeMar said he wanted to be on the Lakers."

DeMar DeRozan is good at basketball.
That’s bullshit.      No one has a problem with Ben Simmons because he has mental health issues.    Nobody was against demar derozan or Kevin love. And we wouldn’t be if they decided to sit out. No ones upset with hachimura     What Ben Simmons is doing is claiming he has a mental disability and refusing to see a mental health professional.

"I've been known to wager a bit on NBA MVP and I've bet on the following two players, not because I think they're the favorites, but because I liked the odds from a risk/reward setup:  Paul George  Demar Derozan"
Daily reminder that [DeMar DeRozan has done some shit](https://youtu.be/0X57NI-MoWQ?t=170)
"Attended the game and it was awesome! It felt like there were almost as many Bulls fans as Clippers fans — as a Bulls fan myself, it was a great feeling.  DeMarvelous DeRozan was so dominant all game, but in the first half he was automatic. I’m starting to see comments here and there about him being a dark horse MVP candidate, and while that’s an optimistic take IMO, his impact for this team cannot be understated. He keeps the offense afloat when the bench is in (bench mob has a lot of high energy guys but no real playmakers while Coby White is out), and he’s a real calming presence with the starters which really showed on nights like this. Every time the Clippers pushed to within 5 or so down the stretch, the Bulls answered. When we just needed a bucket, DeMar got one for us. The team was poised under pressure and pulled off a solid win on the road. This sort of thing never happened in the last few years. Usually, it’s just Zach playing hero ball (out of necessity), and when his shot wasn’t falling (as it wasn’t in the first half tonight) we’d fall apart. But with DeMar, Zach doesn’t need to force as much and can focus on hitting the big shots he’s now proving he can hit.   Then add in Lonzo looking like a bonafide sniper and Caruso locking down everyone. Plus high motor guys in Javonte Green and Ayo Dosunmu off the bench. This team is so much fun to watch.   I’M HYPE, NEIL FUNK!"
"Squid game spoilers  &gt;!DeRozan was literally Ali!&lt;  &gt;!Raps: ""Don't worry DeMar, just go count the other teams and then we'll win together""!&lt;  &gt;!And then they left with Kawhi as he was counting the teams!&lt;"
"KD averaging 30, Steph has the Dubs as the one seed, MVPG-13, Jokic doing Jokic things, yet somehow the MVP voters r gonna give it to Demar DeRozan LMFAO"
"Without him, I think we would be around .500, probably below.  Signing him (along with freaking Lonzo Ball and AC) brought on one of the most radical changes we’ve ever had from free agency. I’m pinching myself thinking about how we suddenly have prime Demar Derozan on our squad… It was glaringly apparent that the Bulls needed veterans to help Zach propel this team into the next era of winning games and I feel soooo lucky to finally have a top-tier front office who are already knocking it out of the park. It feels like Chicago is a FA destination and that’s crazy."
"&gt;  that Warriors game kind of showed us that if you can shut down DeRozan and prevent him from operating, you can kind of shut down the whole show  With Vuc out/underperforming, sure. Ideally, if we're back near full strength by the playoffs having a big man who can get you 20 ppg mostly in the paint every night changes the equation completely. Then the Bulls aren't just a jump shooting team reliant on DeMar isos and drive and kicks.  Honestly, regardless of how the playoffs may go this year, just being confident of *getting to* the playoffs feels great. Anything after that is just a bonus. It's a building block."
"Demar has been more reliable for late points but Zach scores in bunches in a way Demar can’t. If Zach gets rolling then it’s him, but if both are having an off-night, it’s DeRozan."
"Does he?

"That usually what happens when you play for Pop same with the Big 3 , but DeMar and LMA were the sole who Pop let do ""their own style"" at certain times , DeRozan also made others part of his games better because of Pop."
That would be like Toronto fans booing DeMar Derozan when he plays in Toronto haha
"DeMar ""100% from 3"" DeRozan"
"This Bulls team is full of players who have something to prove and it shows on the court  Zach ""empty stats"" Lavine  Lonzo ""overrated"" Ball  DeMar ""got traded then the Raptors won a title"" DeRozan  Nikola ""who?"" Vucevic  Alex ""not worth 7M a year"" Caruso"
Demar Derozan is top 5 MVP candidate. Kiss me about it.
"DeMar DeRozan is an offensive weapon.  Alex Caruso with team-high rebounds, and tied for both team-high assists and steals. Does all the little work."
So I guess DeMar DeRozan just decided to activate a second peak huh.
DEMAR DEROZAN
Do you guys think that Demar Derozan can make a run for MVP this season?
Just gotta start with lower case  dEmAr dErOzAn
"DeMar DeRozan cameo'd in Master P's music video for 'Cookie Money'  DeMar has a lot of connections from his Compton, LA background"
DeMar DeRozan never misses if his foot is on the 3 point line
"""DeMaR DeRoZan"" @_@"
"In this situation I'm guessing most players understand the clear personnel upgrade being made even if it means their friend being shipped. If Kawhi joined the Bucks and they made the next five finals I think Giannis would be pretty happy with the front office.  On that topic, Toronto traded DeRozan for Kawhi even though Demar and Kyle Lowry were best friends. Kyle might have been mad but he definitely understood it professionally."
"DeMar DeRozan leaving the raptors was one of the saddest moments in basket ball for me as a diehard Raptors fan. But, much respect to him for sharing this. It's not an easy thing to process death at such a young age let alone the death of a close friend to gangs. Just sad what some of the youngsters go through in the hood."
"&gt; You clearly aren't old enough for this discussion if you think Pippen ""failed to perform on offense"" for 3 title teams.       And you clearly need to rely on ad hominems when Scottie had a worse TS% over the second threepeat than notorious underperformers Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan over their playoff careers."
"&gt;Saying Ross never ""broke out"" is nonsense. He's not a superstar no, but he's become a dangerous scoring 6th man with the ability to save or win you a quarter (or more of basketball).   Right and people were hoping he'd become an allstar earlier in his career...he never hit that mark because of his inconsistency.   So yeah, potentially being a decent 6th man is him not breaking out. That's an incrediblely fair assessment.   It's always been ""he could do this"" and ""he could be that"", long before his time in Orlando.  [What you're saying about watching more of his game is fair, but you have to understand there are other fanbases who were saying the exact same thing 7 years ago.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1937407-is-terrence-ross-or-demar-derozan-a-better-building-block-for-toronto-raptors) I'm not trying to discount what you've seen with your own eyes, but what you've seen has to be put into context.  You're talking about an exciting player with potential without seemingly realising that potential was always around and never turned into anything.   Now after a decade of stagnation he's a 30 year old who still doesn't have the consistency to warrant a large trade price.  30 year old coulda-beens aren't nearly as valuable as what you seem to think.   ""Maybe he just needs a new environment"" isn't something GMs say about 30 year old players.   &gt;with the ability to save or win you a quarter (or more of basketball).   Right and he's also been a guy who's shot you out of games as well.   Which is why his overall percentages are disappointing despite his league-renoun hot stretches (of which, our team was a frequent victim)."

"AD remains the most unimpressive first option for a ""star"" in the current NBA and probably in the history of the NBA. Of the top 11 players, he is clearly the worst first option. Even after that, Butler, PG, Russ, Beal, CP3, Dwight, Melo (lol even Melo), Beal, Donavon Mitchell,  Kyle Lowry, Jason Tatum, Demar Derozan, Trae Young, Devin Booker and John Wall have had more success than AD as the first option.  It's fucking ridiculous that I can name 25 players with better success as a first option than a ""TOP 75"" player ever"
"DeMar Derozan has got to be one of the most overrated players in the history of basketball, second to Mike Conley."
I want to see MVP level Demar DeRozan VS MVP level Stephen Curry.  Can I have this please?
"He probably should get called for more offensive fouls the way he barrels his body in to other guys but that's always been the more traditional way to draw fouls in the NBA, drive hard at the hoop, jump high into a defender and hope for the whistle.  Demar Derozan plays a similar old school attack the basket style which differs greatly from the Trae/Harden attack the *defender* style of drawing a foul."

He'll miraculously be ready to play the minute he winds up on a new team. They thought they would have been on a new team by now and they've decided to use the break in case emergency tactic.   There are players in the league who are genuinely struggling with mental health in the league. DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love did not bravely speak out as NBA players only for Ben Simmons to make a mockery of the entire process.
"Different amount of strength/muscles to shoot and arc angle makes them different skills to master. The correlation is there obviously where if you're good at one you're good at the other (Steph, Kawhi, KD, etc) but it's not always the case (DeMar DeRozan and Booker for good midrange/bad 3pt, and most role players for good 3pt/bad midrange)"

"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
 DeMar DeRozan  DeMarcus Cousins
"When Ingram sucked early, plenty of people were pointing to the trajectory of Paul George, DeMar Derozan, etc. It was met by the same response. ""Just because those players improved, doesn't mean he will.""  Sometimes you have to actually watch young talent play to see the potential as opposed to the just looking at the box scores.  Ingram was a shooter all through high school and college, but when he got to the league he couldn't throw the ball into the ocean sitting in a boat. Despite that, he showed an unexpected ability to get to the rim that should have actually increased his ceiling. Instead, box score watchers point to his inability to shoot as lowering it, rather than considering the possibility that a kid who was a shooter all his life would eventually find his shot as he settled into the NBA."
"And you do, mr insider? Tell me, what does Ben talk to his counselor about? How he built a brickhouse in the playoffs and decided he didnt like being held accountable so hed fuck around with the front office and get paid simultaneously? But then they didnt do what he wanted so he faked mental illness, that Kevin Love and Demar DeRozan have played through for going on a decade now, and claims he is unable to participate due to it... nah, thats too many red flags and conveniently timed narratives. Ben Simmons set back owners taking mental health seriously by 20 years."

So is demar derozan and John wall
&gt;demar Derozan  What? He's a strong guy dgmw but not in the context of this post lol
Demar DeRozan is a Crip too  And Rozier is openly a blood
DeMar DeRozan:  26.9/5.7/3.6 on 50/39/86 splits (.596 TS)
"Demar Derozan, Wall l, Rozier, Jr. Smith and Monta Ellis come to mind."
"A couple others that I think are tough but haven’t had to show, demar Derozan and Nikola Pekovic and actual Serbian “businessman” connected to drug lord Darko Saric."
"Models are built on assumptions, and they make a lot of bad assumptions. How is the number one player comparison for Steph Curry this year 2011 Chauncey Billups? They have Zach Lavine and Julius Randle as “average starters” and DeMar DeRozan as a “dubious starter” lol.       They keep building models on a flawed foundation. More data isn’t going to fix the models, you have to re-examine the underlying assumptions and methodology."
"DeMar continues his very strong season, man wants that all-star/all-nba spot back and deservedly.  Side note, I enjoy that more people are appreciating DeMar DeRozan as a basketball player now that he's been exposed to more NBA markets. You can see why he's a beloved son of Toronto."

A couple bonus articles too in which he calls the DeRozan sign and trade ""the biggest head scratcher of the off-season"", and also his Bulls season preview in which he picks the Bulls to go 37-45 (one game above the pace we were in last year) and miss the play-in  https://theathletic.com/2750537/2021/08/03/bulls-demar-derozan-deal-rates-as-biggest-head-scratcher-of-2021-free-agency/  https://theathletic.com/2862548/2021/10/06/hollingers-2021-22-chicago-bulls-preview-lineup-roster-prediction-is-there-enough-shooting/"
"Eh, one of the original spreadsheet boys (Hollinger) literally had DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agents last year behind guys like Duncan Robinson and Danny Green. He had his value at 15.3 million a year, and by comparison, had Bruce Brown at 14.8 mill. They played each other head to head yesterday and Demar put up 28 on 20 shots, and Bruce Brown put up 0 points on 8.  The real question is why advanced stat heads looked at a guy shooting at a 59 TS% in high usage and not think he might do well on a team that he isn't the main scoring option all the time."
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

The demar derozan
That's his nickname on the Bulls sub these days. Bad Fit Demar Derozan
DeMar DeRozan goes to the line like 8 times a game lmao. Not exactly the most physical or vertical player anymore
"In a battle between ex-Spurs DeMar DeRozan triumphs over Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge, 118-95."
3pt contest winner Demar Derozan
"[Quite a few](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=who+are+the+active+players+with+at+least+14%2C500+points+all-time), dwight, Lou will, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy gay, steph curry, demar derozan, and Dame"
Imagine Minnesota selected Steph Curry and DeMar DeRozan.
Yeah cos he's shooting 42% from deep. Once he regresses to the mean he'll be what he's always been : DeMar DeRozan. Thanks but no thanks.
Demar DeRozan is shooting 42% from 3. We all know that’s not sustainable. I also fully expect their defense to crash back down to earth. Spacing will be an issue too.
"Really weird game from the Raps. Too many iso plays and defensive breakdowns. We usually move the ball much better than this and have much better defensive rotations. But some great positives to take away, Siakam looked good, Scottie Barnes is not scared of anybody on defense, and Gary Trent Jr. turning into DeMar DeRozan is just an added bonus lol."
"People aren’t talking about how if lowry and hield ended up on the lakers, they would’ve probably signed Demar Derozan too. He mentioned he was seriously considering coming home to LA to play. With Lowry on there, it probably would’ve been a lock for him to sign.  So y’all woulda been AD, LeBron, Demar, hield and Lowry."
"Demar Derozan, anyone?"
that's why Demar Derozan became such a sniper. /s
I wonder if there is any way a S&amp;T trade with DeMar DeRozan could happen. And if somehow Morey finds a way to snag his old buddy Lowry...
you can look it up the % of his assists that come on shots at the rim is very low compared to other players it's the same idea with him DeMar DeRozan etc. We all know the reason why
"If you do a closer look at the assists of guys like Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan and Ben Simmons youll notice a recurring theme: they dont generate many assists on shots at the rim. Ill let yall figure out what a common theme between those players is.  Also the very loose giving of assists on jumpers in the NBA has been a thing for decades, open secret what a joke it is."
I think people are taking it as I’m disrespecting the Raptors when I’m not. That was a perennial playoff team and they swapped Demar Derozan for Kawhi Leonard (Ik they also added Gasol and he was instrumental but he played like shit in the finals) Nurse is a fantastic coach too. Kawhi’s numbers during that entire run were just fucking astounding. He shot like 65% from the floor or something fucking ridiculous for the entire playoffs.
"You realize he is still human right?  I will never understand this hateful, stupid mentality...   Just because you think he's better than you, doesn't mean he doesn't feel disappointment, shame, the public hate, and so on. I mean, Delonte West / Kevin Love / Demar Derozan / Lamar Odom all made tons of money and slept with tons of people, still pretty open about their issues with their mental health   Do better dude."
"You know how some teams punt offensive rebounds in order to get back on D? That’s the Spurs front office. We focus so much on bringing in people who can help with home grown talent and player development that we’re kind of just shitty when it comes to trades, so playing down assets errs on the side of caution.   Personally, I think if Philly ran it back but swapped Simmons with DeMar, they could win a championship (ignoring the fact that Brooklyn is OP as fuck. The cheat code team doesn’t count). DeMar ceiling is limited. That’s just the truth when you’re a guard/forward who doesn’t take 3’s in today’s game. But he’s still really fucking good. He put up 21/7/4 this year shooting 49% and 88% from the line. It was also the best facilitating season of his career. Harris and Curry are good enough to compensate for his long range woes especially if his scoring threat takes some pressure off of them.   The two major issues that make it make less sense for Philly are defense and the playoffs. You say Philly doesn’t need more defense, but it doesn’t change that this move would explicitly give them less defense. Justifiably, Simmons is taking a beating right now, but he’s still a phenomenal defender and we can’t assume they’d just be alright after losing a guy like that.   Second is the fact that DeRozan has a history of disappearing in big moments right now. It’s worth noting that DeMar has pretty much been the first option his entire career. Being a second option with strong 3rd and 4th options may take enough pressure off of him to flourish but those are some big questions. And with Philly being in win now mode, I’m not sure if that’s a risk they’re willing to take.   It’s a nice pipe dream though."
"Also DeMar ""we out here like Michael Phelps"" DeRozan is a pretty funny dude."
JorFraud without Pippen&lt;Demar Derozan
Short DeMar DeRozan
Demar Derozan is a closer
Ah yes with superstars Demar Derozan and Dejounte Murray who’s been injured til this season
They call me DeMar DeRozan because I only bang twos.
"Spurs receive: Ben Simmons, future pick  Sixers receive: DeMar DeRozan (S&amp;T), Lonnie Walker IV, 2021 first round pick"
DeMar DeRozan.
Have a slightly used Demar Derozan. I wouldnt mind them taking a risk on Simmons since the Spurs arent in any contending spot anyways. Might as well see if Pop and the Spurs trainers can work with him.  And Sixers get a veteran who is still pretty decent.
demar derozan is an unrestricted free agent this season so no
"Yea, you can tell he doesn’t develop or try to develop the three because he never even attempts them. He took three shots this postseason further than eight feet out. Three!  He only took 84 shots outside of eight feet out this entire season. Ideally, he would at least become a good mid-range shooter. Compare Ben’s 84 shots outs eight feet to another player of similar build and usage who isn’t known for shooting threes, Demar Derozan. Demar shot 570 shots outside eight feet.   If he could just shoot anywhere other than right under the rim, he’d be an elite player. Sadly, today, we saw he refuses to shoot even there. My point, though, is if Ben were working on his game from three or otherwise, we would see more attempts than 84 shots attempted 8+ feet from the rim through 82 games. He doesn’t try, because he doesn’t trust himself, because why would he? He doesn’t put in the work on that."
You hear that? That's the sound of DeMar DeRozan
Hey Sixers fans want DeMar DeRozan?
DeMar DeRozan sign and trade
Can I interest you in one DeMar DeRozan in a S&amp;T? He might even agree to it
The truly sad part was that Oladipo took them to 7 but DeRozan and Lowry at their peak got swept   I feel bad for Demar since he got shafted but wtf
The ole' DeMar DeRozan
DeMar DeRozan syndrome is very real
Joe “Demar derozan” Harris.   Sad raptors noises
"Trae Young, Demar Derozan, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi."
Would you like a lightly used DeMar Derozan for him?
"&gt;Kawhi Leonard? **DeMar DeRozan**? Kyle Lowry? All of those guys are unrestricted free agents this summer, and **they all have good prior work experience with Ujiri,**  Besides the fact this article reads like a high school creative writing project, what reality is this idiot living in?"

My bad. DeMar DeRozan.
Obviously Bron was better but name one team he beat in his first stint in Cleveland or 2018 that was better than this Bucks squad  2006 Pistons: No Ben Wallace  2018 Raptors: Giannis is in a different universe than Demar DeRozan  2018 Celtics: No Kyrie or Hayward
I'd say the first one I could think of would be DeMar DeRozan  I don't have anything against the guy but it's undeniable he legit has played way below regular season levels in the playoffs(and often deserved a lot of the blame Lowry got as well)
CJ does not shoot like dame. He does not take over like dame. He is not as fast as dame. It’s the elite level dame does those things that makes him so valuable. CJ is closer to demar derozan with a 3 point shot and less passing and shorter.
Demar Derozan.
"Going from so bad at 3s that you won't shoot them to getting defenses to respect your 3 pt shot is a huge leap. Look at DeMar DeRozan. He's a good midrange shooter and even when he started the season off shooting 3s decently well, defenses still didn't respect his shot and he eventually basically gave up shooting them and went 4/31 from 3 over the last 39 games he played.  And it's not like DeMar is known for being lazy, in fact quite the opposite he's known for a great work ethic. Some guys just can't shoot."
Demar Derozan is going to be a Hall of Famer.
"Agreed demar derozan doesn’t shoot 3s but dude gets buckets like crazy. Ben just has no offensive game outside of driving, he’s easy to play against"
"It's possible PG makes it, reasonable chance like I said. Is DeMar Derozan making it? John Wall? Rondo? Blake Griffin? Kevin Love?   PG is clearly better than most of these guys, but in terms of overall career success, he's not really differentiated himself that much from a lot these guys.   There is a chance some of these guys will make it, and I think PG has made a case for himself over his career. But to call him a ""definition of a hall of fame player"" or guaranteed ""future first ballot hall of famer"" as the image in the post says is a wild exaggeration.   Let's just agree that he could make the hall of fame, and not delve into wild guarantees or hyperbole. It isn't hard to recognize PGs accomplishments without exaggerating like this post does."

This article stay underrating Derozan. Idk how they thought dinwiddie coming off an acl tear was more intriguing than Demar
I didn’t know 20 5 and 5 was “dominant.” Can’t believe DeMar DeRozan was a dominate player in ‘19-‘20.
DeMar DeRozan -&gt; DeMarre Carrol -&gt; DeMarcus Cousins
Demar DeRozan —&gt; Kawhi —&gt; MJ
I prefer the situation now and possibly walking out of next week with Jalen Suggs than being a first round exit with Demar Derozan.
"I don't know if it really changes anything in regards to superstars/all-stars on small market teams.  The Spurs have won 5 titles but not every fan thinks much of them.  The Cavs won in 2016 with the help of drafting players like Kyrie and TT, getting back Lebron, and trading for Kevin Love.  The Toronto Raptors, even though they may not be considered a small market team, technically, won in 2019 when they took a gamble and traded their loyal franchise player in DeMar Derozan and got Kawhi Leonard.  As a small market, when you have a great talent on your hands, you have to be mindful of their timeline. While not every player is looking to leave, a player that is trying to be in the caliber of the best players in the world may start losing patience. You need a competent front office that is willing to take a risk, if needed, and gauge carefully on the needs of the team surrounding their best player(s). The Bucks have done that and got rewarded with a championship this year. The Spurs are known as a top organization thanks to their front office and the players that established that winning culture (i.e., Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili)."
Demar Derozan just so him and Kyle would be sorta equal in the eyes of history. Best bros.
Demar Derozan is why players shouldn’t be labeled villains for leaving teams. Owners cut bait with homegrowns for Kawhi Leonards in a second.
&gt;Hopefully this inspires the future generation of stars to stick it out with the team that drafts them.  Counter-point. Demar Derozan.
"Would the Blazers improve if they re-sign Norm, then do a S&amp;T for DeRozan? Maybe where they send out CJ and a 2023 1st for DeRozan and White? That gives the Blazers their SF and a solid backup G. Spurs get a SG that fits well next to Dejounte and another pick to help them rebuild. Plus they get something for DeMar."
"Absolutely. That's a lot of talented shooting to space the floor around a generational talent of a center in Embiid. If Lebron was able to drag his early Cavs teams through the playoffs, I believe a healthy Embiid could be competitive with that roster in the playoffs.  Tobias is like Melo with better defense, Seth is low-sodium Steph Curry, and CJ is a Devin Booker / DeMar DeRozan type of scorer. That team, anchored by a talented defensive center with a solid post game like Embiid, could beat a lot of playoff teams in a 7 game series.  Ideally they would also get a veteran point guard like Rondo to run their offense and rack up double-digit assists every game with limited scoring, although Rondo - Curry - CJ could be rough defensively and Seth might have to shift to 6th man."
"You called it, pretty darn close  &gt;Sources: The San Antonio Spurs are finalizing sending DeMar DeRozan to the Chicago Bulls for Thad Young, a future first-round pick and two second-round picks.  https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1422648840574881801"
DeMar Derozan
Well thats quite a lot but fuck it DEMAR DEROZAN BABY
"If you think about it, MJ is basically a bald Demar Derozan with a gambling addiction."
"They've already set it up for a restart. Lonzo is a #1 pick that plays like a 2nd rounder, he'll be lucky to see multiple all-stars let alone anything more. Lauri just isn't developing with this team. We continue to draft poorly. Now we're trying to bring in Demar? I love Demar, he's a good player, he's just not THAT guy. So what our starting 5 is going to be Lonzo, Levine, Derozan, Yoing(?), Vucevic? That's definitely a playoff team, but that's it. 6th seed that wouldn't make it past the second round with injury to another team."
Demar Derozan on a vet min babyyyyy
New Lakers FA targets:   * Demar Derozan  * Jimmer Fredette  * Ricky Davis
My projections  *  Kawhi Leonard (LAC) * Demar Derozan (DAL) * Dennis Scrotum (OKC) * Spencer Dinwiddie (WAS) * John Collins (ATL) * Josh Hart (NOP) * Victor Oladipo (BOS) * Danny Green (LAL) * Andre Iguodala (GSW) * Patty Mills (SAS) * Reggie Jackson (LAC)
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
my city love me like Demar DeRozan
Yeah those guys are pretty good because they are floor spacers. Unfortunately Demar Derozan is a ball stopper who can’t shoot the 3. Useless in today’s era
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
"So would they pursue that first with the DeMar situation currently happening?  Would figure they’d want to get a DeMar sign and trade done so they get something in return and then go after Collins.  However, if the rumoured DeRozan for Markkanen trade happens then I’d imagine Spurs would be off the table for Collins?"
Donald’s comeback will dwarf that of the glorified Demar Derozan
Feel like Kawhi is backing things up. Clippers can’t make their decisions until they know what he’s doing which effects DeMar DeRozan &amp; Reggie Jackson &amp; probably Schröder too tbh.
Aren’t the Heat an over the cap team anyway? Demar would be signed using the MLE so Jimmy and Lowry wouldn’t free up money for Derozan if they took less

"At what price tag though?  I don't see Demar taking less than 25mil/year.  Don't you need nearly matching salaries for S&amp;T too? You guys are sending us Dragic in the Lowry trade for that matching so that leaves you with almost nothing for DeRozan ... if you S&amp;T Nunn, you can't attach other players with him and salaries for Nunn and Derozan would have to be roughly the same."
Top free agents still available     * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Richaun Holmes * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker
Maybe. But DeMar is the better player. And the Pelicans just need backcourt talent. A Graham-DeRozan-Ingram-Zion-JV starting 5 can go places.
"If we drop Sato, we can still sign DeRozan at a little bit above 20 M. We could turn the Sato + CHI 2nd into DeMar with a S&amp;T"
"The only way the Heat can get DeRozan now is a S&amp;T involving Kendrick Nunn or Andre Iguodala.   Regardless even with DeMar, I wouldn't even say we are top 3 Title favorites."
It's almost like the biggest name in free agency coming in was going to be Demar Derozan until Kawhi and CP3 declined their options
Maybe we can sign Tobias Harris and Demar Derozan in 2029
"And then traded Kawhi for a middle aged Demar Derozan when they coulda got Ingram, Ball, and multiple first rounders. Holding on to grudges isn't always worth it, but that's that old man mentality down in San Antone aint it?"
here comes DeMar DeRozan /s
COME ON DOWN DEMAR DEROZAN
"Well pack it up everyone leagues fucked! We don't need a Kyle 'Dump Truck' Lowry, Demar 'Long 2' DeRozan or anybody else!   🥴😭"
DeMar DeRozan signs with the Pistons
Because r/NBA hates DeMar Derozan
"DeMar ""DeBulls"" DeRozan"
I wonder if Jimmy Butler or Demar Derozan shoot with the wrong hand as well.
"Yah, he's a 4x All-Star, there's absolutely no chance that giving Demar Derozan all of the minutes that were going to Elfrid Payton last year would be a downgrade for you guys aha   It'd definitely be a bit clunky to start, but I think you could find some creative ways to make a Derozan/Barrett/Randle line-up work"

"My personal take on the infamous former Laker core that got traded to NO is that all of them are inconsistent players. They have potential but they won’t  be top stars. They are in the Demar DeRozan tier. Good but not good enough.   Trae, Luka, Ja, Booker are consistent and that’s why they are leaders. When Lebron went down they had their best chance to prove what they were made of and they choked hard. They got traded to a team with Zion and much talent around them, and still choke hard especially at the end of the games. I can’t remember a team with 2 All stars that misses the 10th seed. ! It’s not on Lonzo, but if he was the second coming of Jason Kidd as many claim he would have led them to a winning record. If he is the second coming of Ricky Rubio well he can’t.   That said his biggest flaw is driving which can be fixed by improving the free throws. A guard that can’t drive is not a threat at all for serious defenses. He can’t even run a pick n roll due to this deficiency. He just hangs around and waits for a catch and shoot as he can’t hit out of a dribble either. Even that catch n shoot is way too inconsistent to be considered a threat. So actually his team is forced to play 4vs 5 on offense. Good luck with anyone that invests on him to be their starting PG."
"""Sorry Mr Barton but Demar Derozan is earning $2.6m this season. Why would I pay you more than $4m?"""
Jimmy Butler and DeMar DeRozan is a terrible fit.
"&gt;You just named off Morris, Beverley, Kennard, Ibaka and Rondo…..you really think one of those players can’t be traded to clear cap room to sign someone like Demar?  How many rotation players are the Clippers willing to lose just to get DeRozan though? If they traded for him then the hard cap would prevent them from bringing back Batum and Reggie Jackson, in addition to the probably two players they'd have to trade for DeRozan, and they might have to salary dump another player elsewhere on top of that.   The hard cap is $143 million, so let's say the Clippers trade for DeRozan, here's what that would look like (I'm using Morris and Beverley for DeRozan in this example):  * Paul George - $39 million  * Kawhi - $39 million  * DeRozan - $24 million  * Kennard - $13 million  * Ibaka - $10 million  * Rondo - $8 million  * Zubac - $7.5 million  * Keon Johnson - $2.5 million  * Mann - $2 million  * Oturu - $2 million  * **Total - $147 million**  So even if they trade Morris and Beverley for DeRozan and don't re-sign Batum or Reggie Jackson, they'd still be over the hard cap. They'd probably have to straight up salary dump Rondo somewhere also. So do the Clippers really want to exchange 5 rotation players for DeRozan? I doubt it."
"&gt;they have very overlapping offensive skill sets imo. drive, score in paint, get fouled, no real outside threat... i guess they arent comparable in that zion is just way better overall.  Completely ignoring the gap in their mid range and that's where DeRozan does most of his work lol. Zion is a physical player that bulls his way to the rim. DeMar is much more finesse.   &gt;maybe the heat would be better but a heat team with lowry and demar is not really that much better than last years heat team imo.  It makes a sizeable difference. Lowry himself fills a massive hole and DeMar adds another reliable scoring threat on the wing next to Jimmy or off the bench."
"Bron and AD alone are better 3pt shooters than Jimmy and DeRozan, Demar doesn’t takeover than like 1 a game last I checked"

"Arguably yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty in a great number of playoff teams.  Utah just blew their best shot at a title and they've now blown a 3-1 lead and then a 2-0 lead to get eliminated in the last 2 years. They're pretty suspect defensively even despite a top 5 defense as shown by how the Clippers exploded offensively, and they aren't necessarily making any major moves.  Denver and the LA Clippers have stars out for most of the season (if not all) because of injuries. Both teams have had great runs without them last season but it's gonna be really tough to extend that through a whole year.  Portland and Dallas are currently in their low points. Dallas' roster construction is lacking secondary ball handlers and Portland has a star in Dame that could ask out and a coach hired in controversy. Not to mention they both parted ways with their long-time head coaches.  The Lakers aren't going to fall to #7 barring injuries so they're obviously gonna get better but fit, injury, and age questions arise. Plus how they fill out the rest of their roster is gonna be vital as they're mostly capped out despite having only 5 players under contract for next season.  The Grizzlies just traded away arguably their 2nd best player to move up in the draft and although their youth makes it more sensible that they improve, how JJJ performs next season is a big point as well as how much their young core can improve.  The Warriors have a lot of star power and are getting Klay back, but after 2 devastating injuries. Their depth is a bit suspect (although it's probably better than what many suggest) and their youngsters need to contribute and take leaps. With all this said they are a good destination for vets who aren't blatantly ring chasing, plus they might make a move if stars are available.  The Spurs just took the most shocking lottery pick in Joshua Primo and aren't likely to re-sign DeMar DeRozan, meaning they're more likely to be tanking  I just named every other playoff/play-in team and their cases for being suspect. The Lakers, Grizzlies and Warriors are very likely to improve (ironically as #7, #8 and #9 seeds) but I'd argue the Suns are still the big favorites outside of the Lakers."
DeMar DeRozan says he hung up on Masai Ujiri when Raptors president called about trade Dan Feldman  Loopl
"Along with Patty Mills, Avery Bradley, Rudy Gay, DeMar DeRozan, Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Bullock  Did i miss anyone"
"Maybe the nets can move to Inglewood and we can have 3 LA superteams.  Honestly, the last time anyone gave a shit about DeMar DeRozan he played for the Raptors."
DeRozan would also know his role on this team. Could see a potential flameout with Russ when he wants to be the 4Q hero. DeMar also fits better into a AD at the five lineup IMO. Only way to work with Russ is the Houston model where he plays de facto five with two shooters.   But we had to go Hollywood.
The Demar DeRozan special
"i think we're all in agreement here that they're both bad fits. the difference is DeMar knows his place and will make better decisions, both in passing and scoring situations. way less sloppy of a player. DeRozan was about 60%TS as an inside the 3 point line scorer on a team with ZERO good shooters. not one. Patty sucked for 75% of the season and Lonnie is one of the most inconsistent shooters I've ever seen.   The Lakers have the defenders to make up for either players deficiencies on that end, but I'd rather have 59%ts than 51%. DeMar is also a better cutter than Russ, which shouldn't be the case, but it has been so far. that's part of why he played well with Kyle Lowry."
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan easily in the Top 5 Friendships in NBA History, that alone deserves a spot on the list.  Stats there are off the charts.  Serious answer:  Curry, LeBron, Kawhi, Giannis, Kyrie are easy locks."
All the mentioned players minus Booker are elite 3 point shooters which opens the lanes for them.  Demar Derozan is also an elite midranger but he lacks the 3 pointer which makes him more predictable for the defense.
I think the biggest reason they went WB over Derozan is because they'd hardcap themselves getting Demar

That's my point... we can do exactly that if we actually add back some good defenders. That is the opposite of signing people like Demar Derozan and Carmelo Anthony who are objectively bad defenders. You can't continue to add subpar defenders when we already did that with Russ too.
"In 12 seasons, Demar Derozan has only has a positive On/Off once. And in the playoffs his worst On/Off is -4.8."
3643) Demar Derozan
82) DeMar DeRozan
"There is not a defense in the league who will be able to stop a lineup of Westbrook, Derozan, Lebron, and AD at any reasonable rate. Leaving them open from the 3 point line like everyone suggests is not a viable defensive strategy. Those are 4 guys who are among the most dynamic playmakers in the league. I think there is a lot of underrating just how good Demar Derozan still is in this sub just because he’s not a good 3 point shooter."
"Here is the excerpt from the article, exactly the same as OP posted. Now please go and give me the podcast word for word rather than from your recollection.  &gt; There is some beautiful-mind framework in which the Lakers might still sign-and-trade Schroder and acquire Hield. It's just hard to find it. The Wizards and Kings don't want Schroder, sources said. The Lakers would need a fourth team that does, with assets the Kings want. (The Lakers do avoid the hard cap here by not acquiring a player in a sign-and-trade -- one reason DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry were likely off the board.)  &gt; A lot of teams with a need at point guard have cap space to sign Schroder (or some alternative) outright; they don't need to help the Lakers.  &gt; If Hield is out of the picture, the Lakers can and will try to turn Schroder into one or two other players -- though that requires Schroder's cooperation. It would be nice if one of those players could shoot 3s."
You can't be comparing Zaza Pachulia to DeMar DeRozan.
Rudy Gay has done more for the spurs than Demar Derozan
DeRozan would not just be turning down 14mil he would most likely be able to get 3 or 4 year contract that’s 100% guaranteed instead of taking a massive pay cut and risking injury for a title that’s not guaranteed.  You are also definitely trying to Demar on Zazas timeline which is hilarious
We need 3pt shooting and defense. Wigs is far far better than derozan at both of those.  Sounds like you just underrate wigs and you dont understand how our system works. Demar isos too much hes a bad fit here.
If Bulls fail out on Lonzo Id rather give DeMar 20M+ than sign like Schroeder and just let DeRozan be our pseudo PG
Known shooter DeMar DeRozan
Lowry Derozan reunion in Dallas? No way Demar is going to Lakers for under 20 mil/ year anyone who thinks that is dumb as fk....
we really comparing DeMar DeRozan to Zaza lmao
Wizards should go for DeMar DeRozan
"I mean i will vote for him. And i never liked kyrie whatsoever. But the meme and the fact of the joke that the nba is basketball second and entertainment first makes this a logical choice.  Gonna be something like Ben Simmons, Kurie Irving, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan (if hes coonted as a big) and Embiid."
Lowry and Demar Derozan were often known for choking in the playoffs. That changed when Kawhi came to the Raptors and they started winning. Even in the 2019 playoffs he had multiple duds but it was fine since they had Kawhi who played out of his mind.   Lowry did ok in the 2020 playoffs but he’s never led the team to great success as the number option. Beaten or swept by the cavs years in a row.  [lowry playoff stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lowryky01/gamelog-playoffs/)
Demar derozan since i love lying
"And Demar Derozan, who's having a great season"
"if bulls played a bit more defence and started letting derozan carry them, the game would be much much slower.   Demar a straight beast"
"ugh, we're getting to the point where cuban needs to hire a real GM and empower him to actually make decisions rather than just being a figurehead  cuban's way of doing business just looks worse and worse with every passing year.  this style of doing all our business deals and signings in the club like it's one big nonstop frat party down in dallas is probably rubbing some guys the wrong way, guys who take their careers seriously.   all that stuff about chandler parsons wagging the dog gives me the impression that cuban handles his team business in kind of an unprofessional way  like I imagine he pitched richaun holmes and demar derozan and lowry in the same manner that he courted deandre jordan back in the day.    and just nobody ever ever wants to sign in dallas, its clearly not working.   this last offseason was a big chance to bring in talent before luka's supermax kicks in and it was just a total whiff"
Demar Derozan has BEEN proving this. He doesn't get the credit he deserves.
"And yet some people will say stuff like Jordan would be nothing more than a Demar Derozan in this era. Yet Demar is still dominating this era even at 32 and never been a good three-point shooter. This is a guy that is vertically explosive, but not the quickest. He also not close to the defender Jordan was neither does he have the motor and fire. Butler is closer to what Jordan was, but nowhere near as athletic or as technically sound."
"Okay ben is being a cunt but this is fucking ridiculous lmao. Blake griffen, mike conley, john wall, demar derozan, al horford do you know how many max contracts have been given out for the player to not win jack shit and be a ghost when it matters."
demar derozan (no overreaction)
Don’t forget Demar Derozan. Dude’s mid range game is elite.
"Oh so not getting the proof of the illness is bad now?? The reason why I believe he should is A) to know exactly what he’s up against (depression, GAD, bipolar, panic disorder etc.) and B) so then he and the sixers can make a plan to combat it. Sure I might sound like an angry asshole in my comment but I’m coming from a genuine place of frustration of having dealt with mental disorders my entire life and also studying to be a social worker so I can help people put the measures in place before they get to the situation I was in.   Simmons doesn’t need to publicly disclose anything. That’s none of our business. However, it’s important for people like Ben Simmons to go through the proper channels for mental health diagnosis and treatment instead of saying they’re fighting it and leaving the organization in the dark. Kevin Love and Demar Derozan DID NOT PAVE THE PATH FOR THOS TO FOLLOW FOR SIMMONS TO RIP IT UP. What if because of this people like Rui aren’t able to take a step away from the game like he needed at the beginning of the season? That’s why Simmons needs to do this the right way. The way he’s done it is gonna hurt a lot of people."
According to ESPN and League Executives it was supposed to be Demar Derozan yet he’s 5th in MVP standings right now.
"I don't pay much attention to the debate over whether the stars of the prior generation would succeed today.  While the style of basketball has changed, the game has not.  You still need to put the ball in the basket, rebound, pass, etc.  Good is good.  Zion Williamson, when healthy, completely dominates the game even though he doesn't shoot much.  Well, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone were pretty similar players.  Both of those guys would absolutely dominate the modern NBA.  Demar DeRozan is a SG that is not a threat from distance (although he's a little better this year).  He has been the best player on the Bulls this year, who are outperforming expectations.  Yet Demar is just a worse version of Jordan, and similar to Alex English.  Neither of those guys dominated from 3, but both would kill in the modern game.  I dunno.  Good is good."

"First thing, thanks for the response. This was well written, easy to understand and valid points. I just want to address that before I say just to give you insight to my tone for this message.   One thing about the Bulls is their rise also directly coincides with LA and Boston starting to fall off (more so Boston). Boston’s last title was 86, last finals was 87, and last ECF was 88. Lakers last ring was 88, then Kareem retired in 89 (he was 42 and played in the finals [24 points and 33 minutes game too](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198906110LAL.html) Lakers were still a great team and played the Bulls in the finals, but then Magic got HIV and retired after the Bulls first win. The bad boy Pistons lost in 91 in the conference finals and then their team completely fell off afterwords. Phil helped bring the Bulls to where they were, but at the same time the Bulls dynasty was a changing of the guard moment when many of the powerhouses from the 80’s were done and the 90’s was expansion years.   With the Lakers, Phil definitely helped again, however this was also a time that directly aligns with Kobe’s development. Kobe’s improvement from age 20 to 21 and again to 22 is staggering. Phil definitely helped the Lakers, but I think Kobe’s rise was happening either way.  For the Warriors I agree that without Steve Kerr completely changing their style of play they don’t win. Kerr is an example where he showed how a coaching change can alter so much, but one thing I will mention is that on the other side of the spectrum was the same team and how Luke Walton while acting as interim head coach for the Warriors ended up getting the Warriors to a 24 game win streak to open the year off. I get that they were still essentially being run by Kerr though. That Warriors team lead by Kerr went to the Finals with a 73-9 team and they lost that year to the Cavs who were coached by a rookie head coach Ty Lue who was not seen as a great coach. Ultimately the Cavs won because they had Lebron.   Finally I would say look at Gregg Popovich who has routinely showed that you need a star player to succeed. Popps took over the Spurs the year Robinson was injured, and went 17-47 and the magically landed Duncan in the draft who was a 4 year NCAA player and the clear cut NBA ready number 1 option. The next year they went 56-26 and won their ring in 98-99 (sweeping the Lakers on the way as you alluded to). Through continued excellence throughout the years, and consistent play eventually Kawhi gets injured against Zaza in 2016-2017 ending their run in the WCF. The next year the Spurs dropped from a 61-21 team to a 47-35 7th seed team and a first round exit without Kawhi. The next year they traded for DeMar DeRozan (coming off a 2nd team All NBA) and add him to the roster and they finished 48-34, 1 win better than the previous year with no Kawhi. He is now on his 3rd straight losing season without having much talent on his roster.   Overall I agree, a coach can come in and change up a system or help unite a locker room and that’s the difference it takes to win. However I think the NBA is constantly changing and what makes a good coach now changes in 4 years because everyone copies good coaches plays, the rules change, and new players can change the game and the way it’s played. Most coaches are viewed as amazing for short periods of time (Thibs, Doc, Stevens, VanGundy, D’Antoni) some withstood time. Overall though the notion that a coach is more valuable than the players is something I can’t agree with. If you are the coach for an organization that doesn’t do well with free agency, drafting, or trades it doesn’t really matter who you have coaching they will look terrible because none of the players are good enough to execute anything.    Either way long rant, cheers!"
DeMar DeRozan dark horse for MVP
"I think Zach should be the first option thru the game, he’s the more efficient and volume scorer (even tho demar is underrated there) but in crunch time share the ball 1a 1b with derozan, cuz honestly derozan might be your best option to just get a bucket  Also, no disrespect to demar, but we’ve seen his potential as a lead scorer in the playoffs, and it’s not superstar level. Lavine really could get there, so it’s worth letting him handle things"
DeRozan is bigger than Lavine   Thybulle is a shut down defender but DeMar was able to move the furniture when Matisse was on him which Zach can’t do  Edit: DeMar has 20 lbs on Thybulle so he can’t get bullied
Worst good player and best bad player sound like the same thing to me. And it's Demar Derozan in either case.
"The Chicago Bulls of Los Angeles  Lonzo Ball - UCLA + Chino Hills CA  Alex Caruso - Lakers Champion  DeMar Derozan - USC + Compton, CA  Zach Lavine - UCLA  Nikola Vucevic - USC"

"Lakers have a chance to win and westbrook has been decent. However, he is not what the lakers needed. If they had caruoso and buddy hield and kcp they would have been better. Even demar derozan would be better than Westbrook for lakers because westbrooks lows are really low. Westbrook is too volatile. They also don't play defense and Westbrook is not a good defender."
he should have won the dunk contest.    https://bleacherreport.com/articles/345389-a-dunk-contest-demar-derozan-deserved-to-win  Which would have made 3 out of the 4 Raptors dunk contestants champs ... with the only non-win being Tracy was the same year as Vince.
"I can almost guarantee I’ve been watching longer than you have. The old joke was Toronto has 3 O’s but no D.   We can talk about the year Derozan and Lowry took the raps to the ECF. 2016 we had a great bracket, played a 45-37 Pacers team and then a 48-34 Heat team (Dragic and old Wade were the best players on this team). That was the only year the Raptors made the ECF with Demar.  On top of that, was he even our best player? IIRC the players making the clutch shots was Kyle. Demar had 20 pts/game on 46% TS. This is horrendous. Kyle on the other hand had 18 pts/game on 51% TS + all the other things he provides such as playmaking and defense. TS is still not great, but he was def our best player during that run.  Gtfoh calling other people casuals when you don’t even know what you’re talking about. I love demar and will always love him, but Siakam was better for us than Demar was in a Raptors uniform. DeMar has definitely gotten better while at the Spurs - but that’s not really what we’re talking about here, is it?"
This disturbs me. Making a mockery of Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan.
"DeMar ""Kobe"" DeRozan."

"&gt;I read your comment as a sarcastic one,   Yes, my comment was sarcastic, and I said “what” in reference to you thinking I made my comment so “that others will see as a valid point” I don’t gaf about Reddit internet points. I said what I said because I think it’s dumb and ignorant for someone to try and invalidate someone else’s mental health struggles that they don’t even know.   &gt;implying he’s not faking.  He’s clearly faking for cash.    And you know this how? Are you his therapist? What qualifies you to tell someone that despite them getting bombarded by literally thousands of hate comments, their name getting dragged through the media, and being in a situation that neither party wants to be in that they’re faking a mental illness?? Because that’s a very bold claim. On this same topic, are DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Love or PG13 also faking their mental healthy struggles or is it only Simmons because you dislike him?    &gt;Or maybe you were making a smarter comment than I thought, and you actually meant he was clearly faking.  A smarter comment to you= 100% believing that someone you don’t even know is faking a mental illness. Nice."

"Bulls: 6-1. With solid wins against Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics. Our only loss was a one point loss to the Knicks. And we even had the ball at the end to try to win that game.  I'm really happy with how our new additions are playing: DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Derrick Jones Jr. They are hustling on offense and hustling on defense! I love how they play with a sense of urgency!  Special shoutout to Ayo Dosunmu who feels like an absolute steal at #38 draft. Especially since we didn't draft anyone before him this year. (Our first round draft pick was packaged in a deal to get Vucevic).  It sucks to lose Patrick Williams for the year. I hope he recovers from wrist injury as quickly as possible."
DeMar DeRozan 😤
I LOVE DEMAR DEROZAN
"The closest player (offensively) in the modern era to Kobe is probably DeMar DeRozan, who just put up 37/7/2 to dismantle the Celtics"
"Okay but the Bulls have low key circumvented this completely, I got an Instagram ad from skillshare and I'm gonna paraphrase here, but it was basically like, 'Are you a PG like Damian Lillard? SG like Devin Booker? Or a PF like DeMar DeRozan?'   I was like.. huh? PF? DeMar? I haven't watched the Bulls enough (despite having Vuc, Caruso, DJJ and Javonte on my fantasy team—I had Patrick before he went down and picked up DJJ/Javonte when I saw the news) but I'm assuming with Caruso, Javonte/Dosunmu, Lonzo and Lavine that they are running somewhat of a 3 guard set with DeMar guarding 4's? There's no way all five of those guys are averaging 25+ minutes a game without someone logging minutes at the 4."
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there’s still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who’ll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."
I think most people would say Demar DeRozan was a top 10 free agent this past offseason.

No. Just no. Jimmy was at least a similar level of offensive player. Scoring a bit less but playing more of a playmaking role on those teams than Demar was with Lowery on his team. Meanwhile Jimmy was a defensive stopper and one of the best wing defenders in the league at the time and Derozan was a complete turnstile in Toronto.   Those Toronto teams were better than the Bulls teams but Jimmy was the better player.
Demar Derozan is nice
DeMar 3&amp;Derozan
"DeMar DeRozan is showing what he can do with some help. The guy should have won several rings by now, he's an absolute superstar"
"Derozan has never had a co star that’s as dynamic a scorer as lavine where opposing defences will not only focus on him but also have their best defender on lavine, for his whole career it’s always been on derozan. Demar gonna feast this year"
"It can work if one player sacrifices. Look at my Bulls right now. People didn’t think Lavine and DeRozan could play together, but they can. Lavine shifted more to playing off-ball and DeMar gets touches in the half court. They defer to whomever has the hottest hand. If DeMar is cooking, Zach makes sure he gets the ball and vice versa.   This is what Brown and Tatum must do. Tatum in particular needs to play off ball to hopefully be more efficient."
DeMar DeRozan has been incredible on the Bulls! I love it!
"Lol that's not true at all. Tons of guys would've gotten the spurs more wins than DeRozan did. And our roster was not that bad. We basically swapped Kyle Anderson, Manu Ginobili, and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl and weren't any better. Then we were significantly worse the next two seasons. There's a lot of revisionist history going on in this thread about DeRozan."
"it's similar to the development of lowry and derozan for the raptors. Demar always got the hype because he was the primary scorer, but just like lowry Brown impacts the game in many ways while also being a really good scorer"
"he also isn’t a demar derozan, kyle lowry, chris paul type vet"
If you don’t love DeMar DeRozan you don’t love NBA basketball
DeMar DeRozan demolishes DeCeltics
"Vuc with that quiet almost triple double statline 11/10/9. Euro bigs and passing oh yea.  Also shoutout to Zach for cranking up that extra gear at the 4th. Dude was cold most of the game, but became absolutely relentless at attacking the basket during the most crucial moments of the game.   Also Demar Derozan. That is all."
I love Demar Derozan man
I'm just here to simp for DeMar DeRozan
DeMar DeRozan baby
Demar “82nd best player in the league and a bad fit for this team” Derozan.
Listen if Demar Derozan is going to make 3 pointers now than I reserve the right to change my Buls as a 9th seed prediction.
DeMar. DeRozan.
Demar “3&amp;D specialist” DeRozan
"The worst free agency acquisition Demar Derozan accoring to GMs, just dropped a back-2-back 30 piece"
DeMar DeRozan. That's it.
Mfers really said DeMar DeRozan was the worst move in FA this off-season 💀💀💀💀  9 points in the 4th pre-garbage time is INEXCUSABLE god DAMN
GMs named Demar Derozan as the worst free agency acquisition this summer lmao
He’s very good but not good enough for what they want which is to be a real contender.  He’s their Demar Derozan
I haven't seen him mentioned in here but definitely DeMar Derozan. Usually leads his team in minutes and plays every night and has never had a serious/lingering issue.
Demar “tErRiBlE fIt” Derozan
Garland is a better natural PG. Garland is better at shooting 3s off dribbling than Sexton. Teams rather have a CP3 than an undersized Demar DeRozan.
"The “overpaid” thing blew my mind  A-list superstars are making over $50 million a year now  How is a reliable veteran all star who excels at what he is signed for an “overpay” at just under 60% of the cost?   And don’t get me started about people overvaluing these late first round picks, how many times do you have to draft a player at 19 overall and develop him for several years for him to be an impact player?    RJ Barrett is a good player and looks like he can improve.  Maybe he’ll become great some day.  He was drafted #3 overall several years ago.  He scored 32 points and it is a huge deal.    DeRozan scores 32 points and it’s “huh, a good game from DeMar.”  There’s a mile of difference between “a guy may score 30 points someday if he develops” and “this guy scores 30 points every 5th game today.”    Thad is a good player but he’s not a go to bucket, I know we like metrics but being able to get up quality shots reliably in the NBA is a rare skill.  It’s easier to build defense than it is to conjure up a legit scorer.    So yeah, I think it’s “worth it” to give up a future late first and a solid NBA player for this guy, and you need to spend your cap money on someone, seems like a very good #2 scorer is worth 60% of #1 guy money."

"Celtics need a jolt of change. Ainge needed to go, but Brad Stevens was a good coach, he should’ve stayed in the job (not a judgement on Coach Ime here). They also really should try to find another star to bring in. Tatum is a clear star, but Jaylen isn’t. He’s good, but he’s probably in DeMar DeRozan territory. Getting Kemba seemed like a good move, but sadly that didn’t pan out.   Seems Boston has been afraid to do any big moves since getting burned by the Kyrie trade. His drama probably really screwed up the team. Boston has been able to make 2 conference finals in the last 3 years, that’s pretty good. They just really need to take the next step, and I feel a roster change is needed. For any fans that think this isn’t the case, what exactly should Boston do then? They’ve been on the crux of contender-ship for years, some sort of change is needed. Bucks changed their roster over the years and won a ring. Not mega moves, but still fairly significant.   What does Boston do here? I say a big trade is needed. Preferably make a big 3 with Tatum and Brown, but if you can get someone better than Brown via trade, I’d do it. Easier said than done, though. I think Miles Turner would be a solid addition to make a decent trio, seems Indiana is kinda souring on him."
Suddenly wanna come up with a seafood dryrub blend and name it DeMar DeRozan.
"The biggest misconception from basketball media types who just look at stats is that Vuc is a bad rim protector just because he doesn't get blocks. But the reality is he does a great job of getting in position to put his hands straight up and not foul, and it makes people miss. It doesn't give you a block stat, but it protects the rim.  He is above average at forcing misses at the rim. Combo that with his above average defensive rebounding, and what do you know... you have a good interior defender. The issue is that he is too slow to defend on the perimeter, but now that he has such ravenous defense on the perimeter around him, he is able to drop back and stick to what he does best.  On the flipside, the main things that I deem **legitimate** concern about this year's Bulls defense is the following:  1) Demar DeRozan. He is infamously bad at defense. You can make a legitimate argument that he is the worst defender among All-Star caliber players during the duration of his career. Its perfectly reasonable to expect him to tank the team's defense, especially against playoff-quality offenses.  2) Zach Lavine. He hasn't been very good at defense in years past, but the Olympics have shown is that part of the reason is due to his offensive workload in Chicago being too heavy to have energy to play defense. Now that he has people to share the load with (along with him improving year after year), he is no longer the liability he once was.  3) Losing Thad/Theis. I still think this is and will be a problem, especially with Pat out for season. They were great defenders at the 4/5 last year, and we didn't really do anything to replace them.  I don't think THIS level of defense is sustainable. I think they are still taking teams by surprise at this point, as they haven't had the time to scout them out yet. I suspect they will still be a top 15 defense though."
#DeMar Derozan is Spanish for ofSea ofRub
"Excuse me sir, that's ESPN's 82nd best player and 538 ""Dubious Starter"" DeMar DeRozan to you"
"This is your reminder that John Hollinger had DeMar DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agent this year, valued less then 500k more per year then Andre Drummond and Bruce Brown, 4 mill a year less then Danny Green, and 8 million less a year then Duncan Robinson.  Thank you for your time, good night."
"Not this garbage again.  “Dame Lillard, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, trill…  Me not wanting to join a super team might end up being my Achilles’ heel…  Hector, I’m on my shield…  Trying to get next to Freak and Dirk on that lonely hill…  Now my goal’s revealed so fuck you, the reporters thinking my homies squealed…”"
And if he’s just below Chris Paul he isn’t worth the contract??? Being paid slightly below CP who never got Demar Derozan and Bismack Biyombo to 10 wins in the playoffs?
"Yeah Demar himself says he was comfortable with that shot and got a good look, but no, armchair expert here on reddit has seen HOURS OF DEROZAN so take his word over DeRozan himself! Lol yall are DeLusional."
"The most we could offer was taxpayer's MLE, which was around 5.5mill/yr. He took 26mill/yr from Chicago. That's quite a jump... 4.5x more lol.   I think Derozan was expecting us to trade for him from the Spurs so he could get his 20mill. So getting both Demar &amp; Kyle were never possible."
I agree - I think people should be looking at how Demar Derozan developed as a roadmap for how good RJ can be.
DeMar DeRozan
"It's an option play, he has to expect it back, but it was DeMar's read. DeMar said as much after the game. He had to make a call in a split second, and just before the handoff he felt like he had a good angle to attack the switch so he held onto it.  Maybe that was the wrong read, maybe it wasn't, but it's not like this was a designed play for LaVine and DeRozan just decided not to give it to him on his own. DDR still got a pretty clean look, and if he had've made it people would be talking about 'this is why Chicago signed a proven closer'."

Derozan took the play he easily could have handed it to demar
"The Bulls have won 42, 41, 27, 22, 22, and 31 games since firing Thibs and your dumbass is sitting here seriously turning your nose up at regular season success because it’s all about the playoffs. They made one playoff appearance in that entire time as an 8 seed and got bounced in the first round you absolutely delusional fucking moron lmao. Thibs could only dream of such playoff success tho I’m sure.  Also frankly you’re a fucking pussy lol. Disrespecting Thibs and the job he did for your  favorite team because you’re salty that Lonzo couldn’t flop his way to a win tonight. Embarrassing… Thibs won over 60 games and lost an ECF to Lebron Wade and Bosh. The next year Rose tore his ACL and Noah got hurt and they lost in the first round. The year after that when Rose was out they won a playoff series with Nate fucking Robinson as the best scorer lol before getting eliminated by LeBron Wade and Bosh again in the next round. The next year Rose played 10 games and they still won 48 games  and lost in the first round. The next year they won 50 games again and lost to Lebron and Kyrie in 6 in the 2nd round.  Thibs has literally never lost a playoff series to a team that wasn’t clearly and objectively more talented than the one he was coaching. Any year he had Rose was a guaranteed 50+ wins. He couldn’t get past LeBron James, that’s the extent of his mythical playoff ineptitude in Chicago. Have a little bit of respect and appreciation you absolute punk.  Also you’re joking about Randle being a choke artist when your teams biggest off-season acquisition was Demar Derozan. I’m sorry but LMAOOOOO."
"The Bulls are like the *fun* LA team this year.   There’s Caruso and our old pal Lonzo, plus LaVine is an old UCLA guy, Vucevic went to USC, and DeMar DeRozan is a Compton native *and* USC dude.  That’s a whole LA-connected starting five, and not a bad one at that."
"A lot of people are looking good defensively due to low sample size.  Min 25 possessions (DeAndre hunter has defended 46) DeAndre hunter is 51st out of 224 players in PPP. Compared to DeAndre hunters .739 ppp, number one is Luke Kennard at .226 ppp on 31 possessions. Poeltl is 199th at 1.095. Tyler herro, Duncan Robinson and demar derozan all in top 20 lowest PPP. Harden 25th. It's just crazy rn."
