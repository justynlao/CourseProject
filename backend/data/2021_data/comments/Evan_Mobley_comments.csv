Fade for ...... Evan Mobley?
"Great list, for the players not in the league yet, smart money would be on Cade Cunningham, Emoni Bates, Evan Mobley, Chet Holgrem, Jalen Green."
" Might as well join the FadeForCade Sweepstakes. Lots of talent in the 21 Draft, Evan Mobley, although the Mavs could use a pure scorer too like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams or Jalen Johnson.  Would bubble playoff teams rather have a Top 7 pick in this year's draft?"

Plus this year’s draft features Evan Mobley and I believe the following draft has 3 bigs projected in the top 5
😭watch you guys jumó the lottery and get Evan Mobley
SHHHHH you're not supposed to notice us right now     \*waves at evan mobley\*
"After the season perhaps, why not go for a Top 3 Draft pick to ensure its out of the Warriors hands?  Then get one of Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs."
"Exactly. Bulls fans who are not against trading Zach don't think he's a bad player, just don't think he's a true #1 due to his poor defense and decision making as a play maker.   People bring up Booker, who was always a bit better of a passer than LaVine, and point to the Suns now being good. Well yeah, they added arguably the best point guard of all time to their team haha. CP3 can turn anyone into a playoff team – we saw it with OKC last year.   I would have loved the Bulls to get him. So, our doubts are more about trying to get the superstar winning player like a CP3 to pair with Zach. If we can't bring that guy in, or develop one of our young guys to be that soon, then maybe trading him and trying to land a Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley type potential two way superstar is our best option.   I trust AKME to make smart decisions."
I'm torn between the Evan Mobley/Cade Cunningham potential and just wanting these dudes to absolutely lay waste to everyone in the east for the next 5 months
I don't want Evan Mobley. He might be a fine pro but I'm not as high on him. I say this as a USC fan too. Okongwu impressed me a lot more last year with how he jumped off the screen. A consensus top pick like him should be making his presence felt more. I'd much rather have a guard or wing who can be the future after Steph and Klay get older
Jalen Green?  Jalen Suggs?  Evan Mobley?
"Welcome to Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to complete a clean sweep of the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers.   The starting five for the Cavaliers tonight is Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. Look for big contributions from 6th man Larry Nance Jr off the bench."

I want Charlotte to get Evan Mobley 1st overall. Lamelo + Mobley would be an dynamic and exciting partnership to build around. Those lobs would make my pants turn a Charlotte minty blue 🥸
Evan Mobley?
You might be right. You guys can end up picking his replacement in Greg Brown or Evan Mobley and if you can finesse a team in to giving up a 1st rounder based off potential y'all can get another 1st.
They go off last years draft and we get the third pick again selecting Evan Mobley and becoming a dynasty
One Evan Mobley coming right up!

We need to make a trade for a top 3 first round pick so we can get Evan Mobley. The main thing we’re lacking is a decent center. Any 1st round center would do though.
I want Evan Mobley lol look at our Cs..
All aboard the Evan Mobley Sweepstakes Tank**™** !!!
"Luka can slot into 3 different positions. Point guards only play 1 or 2. I'm referring to prototypical point guards anyways.  I don't really need to mention AD's accolades in college. But he had unworldly defensive advanced stats in a much slower paced college era. Currently pace is 72, in 2012 pace was 61.  [Mobley](https://barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2021&amp;p=Evan%20Mobley&amp;t=USC)  [freshman AD](https://barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2012&amp;p=Anthony%20Davis&amp;t=Kentucky)  They don't come close to impact at all."
Evan Mobley on the Raptors would be so good. If Mobley continues extending his range it would allow for Siakam to keep on slashing.
I just want my Hornets to get a good enough pick for Evan Mobley so we can finally have a top 10 center for the first time in a long time

"If you looking at the very top of the draft, probably Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley."
Sources say you guys are selecting Evan Mobley in June
"If it's the 4th that's a massive dub for warriors, one of Jalen Suggs, Jonathan Kaminga and Evan Mobley will be left and they are all great"

"Depends on the rookie. Top 2 should liiiikely be Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley, and both would be really good fits in my view, and look like they could have pretty serious immediate impact."
Ahead of Jalen Green and Evan Mobley?
Is it out of the question that they get a high enough draft pick to get Evan Mobley? Zion and Mobley at the 4 and 5 would be insane.

"You’re missing the 2nd best prospect, Evan Mobley. I’d argue that he’s the best fit for Washington as well. He’s really a tier or two above Green and Kuminga.   Also, I don’t think Russ is going to win many games for the Wiz."

Evan Mobley is a better rim protector than anyone in Portland 😭😭😭
Honestly as a thunder fan we already have a shit ton of guards and Evan Mobley is looking fire to me
They win a ring and somehow get Evan Mobley or something like that. This sub would need to close down.
What rhymes with Evan Mobley?
"i think the best case for our FO currently is if we don't make the playoffs and minnesota conveys, then package wiseman and our later lottery pick for whichever player they think would help and use the minn one to pick somebody.   this would give them some pretty decent trades and a good rookie to build around to get their ideal ""contend + develop"" shit going. it also helps open up our our roster for evan mobley if he falls to the 4th/5th pick and they like him.   IMO as a fan i'd rather not give up on wiseman and just stack another top 5 rookie on the roster. trade the other pick for someone good, switch the roster up to whatever we need and go at it again."

"The problem is the center position in the NBA is really crowded.  Only so many teams actually looking for centers.  And a lot of the teams that could use centers are looking for vets.  I find it tough to think of a team off the top of my head that could actually use Wiseman more than the Warriors.  I suppose there are teams like the Spurs or Wizards that could be patient with him.  But even then, next year's draft is pretty strong at the center position.  Evan Mobley and Alperen Sengun may both be better prospects than Wiseman."

Evan Mobley
Just letting you know Lamelo is younger than Evan Mobley and one month younger than Cade. Risky bet you’re making there bucko
Considering the Wolves already have a 40% chance at a top 3 pick . And considering the fact I dont consider Cade to be all that much better than someone like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley... not a whole lot

" #EVAN MOBLEY, here we come 🗣🗣🗣"
"Oh my gosh if the Magic don't get Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley, they're f*cked"
Evan Mobley would be so sick with Nick Nurse and the Raptors development team.
1) Win the lottery and draft Evan Mobley or Cade Cunningham   2) Win the lottery again in 2023 and sign the future HoF Emoni Bates   3) Re-sign Lowry for the vet minimum and win the GROAT his 2nd chip with us 😈
"scott brooks gets canned, and so does does Tommy Shepherd, and we bring in Masai  Rui takes the jump to stardom, and Deni follows suit. We get a high pick and draft a quality center this year (Evan Mobley). Russ doesn’t regress a ton, and we hope Masai can bring in some good free agents.   in conclusion: Masai Ujiri please come to Washington"
ay we're gonna be rebounding a lot more once we get evan mobley
I think the hawks pick went there (okongu but I probably butchered it) and Evan Mobley is currently there
"Ive always wondered that too given the proximity to talent, strong school branding, and located in a major city. We were starting to get better in the mid 00s (Demar, Vucevic, Taj Gibson, Nick Young, others) but the sanctions set us back for a while in both football and basketball.   We're getting better the last couple years. About to have a top lottery pick two years in a row with Okongwu last yr and now Evan Mobley. Hopefully this trend attracts more top recruits who want to be one and done like Calipari has done for the last decade. Im not a big fan of Enfield as a coach, but he can recruit for sure."
Kevin Porter Jr. and now Evan Mobley (top 5 prospect for the upcoming draft). Both wore #4 at USC.
"team was 6-2 and had one the best record in the league with Fultz. Yes thats not many games but it looked very promising. We dont even have JI who is a premier defender in the league. We HAVE to flip Gordon and Evan together for something substantial.   We are actually in a great spot to get a top 3 pick which is either Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Evan Mobley. All 4 I think are gonna be good. Cades 99% going 1st so hypothetically lets say we get Suggs or Green to fill that SG spot our team looks like this  1. Fultz 2. Green/Suggs OR a guy that can be packaged with Gordon and Fournier. Oladipo again? 3. Okeke (Can put your top 3 pick here too if you move those guys for a SG..Either way the SG and SF could be interchangeable) 4. Isaac 5. Vooch  Bench: Cole, Bamba, Ross, Birch, Bacon  Thats a top 5 seed in the East"
"With these new lotto odds I feel like you might as well try to win and hope to jump into the top 4 .    According to 538, you guys are projected to end up with the 7th worst record with the roster as-is,  that gives you a 32% chance at getting a top 4 pick.  I.e. Cade, Jalen green, Suggs, Kuminga or Evan Mobley   The incentive to bottom out isn't there anymore , you just need a little lottery luck"

"Keep your head up. NCAA tournament starts Thursday, watch Cunningham, Jalen Suggs and Evan Mobley. If shit goes according to plan one of those guys will be putting on a Rockets hat in June"
"Honestly, I'm beginning to think you might be right.  It comes down to how our core bounces back from covid. Virus is a bitch. Even when they come back, it might take a couple months to get back to form.  Trade lowry for pieces, dip into the lottery, grab us a cade Cunningham or an Evan mobley, chip in three years nbd."
Well outside of the team I root for(Go Blue!)   I would say cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley
Would it make sense to draft an Evan Mobley when they already have Vuc though?
I want the Pistons to get the number 1 pick. Cade would be a god send for them.   I want the Raptors to jump up and grab number 2. Evan Mobley seems like a seamless fit.   3 I want to be OKC and they grab Jalen Green.   After that idk
"Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, Evan Mobley.  Davion Mitchell, Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, Isaiah Jackson.  Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, Kai Jones."
wait wait wait... you want the number 1 pick and you wanna take EVAN MOBLEY with that lmaoo
"Preparing for Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs or Jonathan Kuminga??"
"Lemme correct that for you.  Actual POV: Been mad about the top teams in the East getting a cakewalk to the conference finals for last 14 years. I don't even want to make the play in lmao, I want the #1 pick and Evan Mobley."
"The Thunders would be really good.   Ep 1: Okla-Home-A: the Thunder is born and the team comes to OKC for the first time with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in tow.

I would settle for Evan Mobley too
"How many do.  Detroit has Stewart who has proven to be an intriguing prospect and certainly flashes potential as a starting caliber big.  OKC has Moses Brown and his rebounding is a huge weapon.  We have WCJ with his versatile defense and rim running.  Houston has Christian a wood.  Minny has Towns.  Cleveland has Jarrett Allen in restricted free agency.  Every lottery team has a center prospect that they want to either develop or has proven to be capable of playing 25 minutes a night as a starter.  Most teams downsize anyway so it’s not like they need a big man for 35 minutes as their first,second or third option.  I’d rather pay all of those guys 10 million a year going forward than eventually having to give Evan Mobley his rookie extension if he isn’t going to be able to be the best player on a championship team.  If he can be that guy than frankly he should be the clear cut number one pick because Superstar big men are extremely valuable but starting centers or lower tier all star centers are frankly found everywhere in the league.  A team can sign Richaun Holmes and probably get a decent starting center who can switch and run the pick and roll.  Star guards and wings are steal way more valuable for championship teams these days."
"None but if I was a team I’d be hesitant to draft Mobley just because the role of big men are so different that unless you think he’s the next Giannis, Embiid, Jokic, or AD he really isn’t worth a top pick on.  If you can get 80 percent of an Evan Mobley in free agency for the cheap that’s not worth a top pick for."
Get real. Wizards will 100% not get a top 4 pick. Evan Mobley is unrealistic.
get a real coach and evan mobley in there and its scarytime
Bj and Davion way too high there bud    Cade Cunningham   Evan Mobley   Jalen Green  Jalen Suggs   Jonathan Kuminga   Moses Moody   Keon Johnson   Jaden Springer  Jalen Johnson    Franz Wagner
"The nba would be ruled by ‘big men with guards skills’ soon. embiid and Jokic are just the prototype. Them Top 2 in MVP is an indication.  Chet Holgrem, evan Mobley, emoni bates, Poku are the types of players that would rule the nba soon.  Just watch."

We will be bowing down in a few years when the run a line up of Shai/Cade/Jt Thor/Poku/Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley is who I want as a fan since I don’t think we’ll snag the first pick. But you never know.
Get mini Chris Bosh in Evan Mobley 👀
"I'm a USC fan and always used to wonder why Enfield didn't play him more in college. He was clearly the most talented player, but he's never been the smartest or most hard working. Even when you're a top freshman recruit like he was or Evan Mobley this year, you have to earn your minutes, and he never really did that. He was just too talented for the coaches to not play him."
And you're (probably) getting a top 3 pick too. Imagine adding Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley to the best team in the league. Easy chip next year
"Actually I remember a lot of draft analysts pointing out that Wiseman wasn't even that dominant in high school. In Nike EYBL he averaged 15ppg/8rpg on 52 TS% (even guys like Bol Bol put up more dominant numbers), and he got outplayed in head-to-head matchups against his peers like Isaiah Stewart and Evan Mobley . All of this happened in front of scouts and there have been concerns about his basketball development for a while.  People were willing to overlook his red flags because of his measurables but so far he hasn't done a good job of disproving them. Doesn't mean he can't still be good if he works hard on his flaws, but he's probably more raw and further away than people realized"
"If they get evan mobley, they will fill the PF position very well. Dlo-beasley-ant-mobley-KAT, absolutely terrifying for upcoming years."
"Jalen Green is a monster. His offensive skillset is larger than most NBA players let alone rookies. Think Bradley Beal with Zach Lavine athleticism. He’s 100% gonna win at least one scoring title, and his defence is very solid too. I really really hope we (Pistons) draft him.   Evan Mobley is also someone you should keep an eye on, he averaged nearly 4 blocks a game in college, his defensive presence &amp; IQ is off the charts. He’s also shown some playmaking, midrange, and three; along with posterizing dunk after posterizing dunk. A very very tall long defender that can make an impact right away.   Every single one of this year’s top 5 would go #1 last year, it’s a loaded class"
"I really do hope this becomes a viable option for high school players, but it definitely isn't good for brand or fame right now. I mix up whoever played for the Ignite this year, but I sure as hell know who Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs are."
"I agree with you that this year Minnesota's  had some really shit luck that's no one can be blamed for but I think he was asking about the 6 years that Kats been in the league and if I remember there was some unforeseeable injuries and bad luck. But at some point you have to ask is it the players or the coaching or maybe the front office. Sometimes it is systemic and is all of the above and it's just a poorly run franchise.  If I'm a timberwolves fan I'm praying to the lottery god's to give them ping pong balls in the top three because this is a pretty good draft and I think there's a real chance of getting Cade Cunningham, Evan mobley, Jalen suggs, or Jalen Green. And I really do think that any one of those guys on that Timberwolves roster would be a pretty good team. And if it's not a top three pick it's going to Golden State"
"Evan Mobley is pretty good though. Even if some team goes crazy and passes on him, Mobley is a pretty incredible second choice"

Wiseman and a first for Evan mobley
"Presumably Evan Mobley stands behind the authentication of the NFT he created. He would not stand behind yours. But making some kind of public statement that this particular hashId (or whatever, idk how NFTs work) is the real one, and possibly having to validate that in the future.  If it exists beyond his lifespan I also don't know how that would work."
"Kings will look a lot better with a new coach and Evan Mobley, don't worry."
"Emoni Bates, Evan Mobley and Cade Cunningham."
What? That doesn't answer my question. Do you think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs right now? Do you think Alen Smailagic is better than Evan Mobley right now? Paul Reed better than Jalen Johnson? Kyle Guy over Davion Mitchell?
Evan Mobley 2025
"It's a longshot but maybe they go super young and add Evan Mobley? I know they don't do it every Olympics, but AD was on that 2012 team as an incoming rookie and Mobley is pretty much universally a top 5 pick. If they don't love turner/plumlee/drummond as a backup, it would be fun to see a young talented dude debut on such a big stage."

If the Thunder get a top 5 pick and and land Cade or Jalen Suggs they won't have space in the backcourt for: the pick, Theo, SGA and Dort - all of whom should play over Kemba.    If they get Evan Mobley instead, I could see it."
Don’t think okc would want to trade Moses unless we grab Evan Mobley in the draft.
Imagine you are Richaun Holmes and winning game will result in your team drafting Evan Mobley. Would you try to win that game?
I’m a huge believer in Evan Mobley too. I think he’s gonna be great.
"It's not just positioning. Wiseman right now doesn't have a great feel for the game and the intuition you'd hope for in a top draft pick.  The Warriors front office were also surprised by how slowly he developed throughout the season.  Deandre Ayton for e.g. while bad in his rookie season was no where near as negatively impactful as Wiseman &amp; Ayton showed a lot more promise and development in his rookie campaign too.  Evan Mobley who tbf probably will end up playing PF also looks like he'd be a way, way better PF/C than Wiseman straight out of the gate.  Wiseman is an athletic freak no doubt, and a high character guy, and he was my preferred pick at 2 as well but damn GSW would be so, so much better with Lamelo/ Tyrese Haliburton"
"Or just luck into drafting Evan Mobley, but very unlikely"

"Brooks chucks like 20 threes per game he’s kind of the opposite of Jimmy on offense, Ayton is much more like Alonzo Mourning, AD’s version is coming in this next draft names Evan Mobley"
James Wiseman did better in his first year in the NBA than Evan Mobley did in the PAC12 (at roughly the same age) and probably would have been a top 3 pick in this years draft.
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
I’m very clearly an idiot and meant to say Evan Mobley. Sorry!
"Idiotic trades all around.  Especially when the ""rumors"" are now that Cavs are working on an extension with Sexton.   not to be confused with the ""rumors"" before the draft that they were trading him, but this was before we picked up Mobley, which makes all the trade talk about trading our #1 scorer and best player on the team moot.  ""Evan Dammarell of Fear the Sword and WKYC Channel 3 is reporting that the Cavaliers have put extending Sexton as a plan back on the table. More importantly, according to his report, Sexton wants to stay in Cleveland and continue the work that he’s doing with Darius Garland, and Jarrett Allen.""  from last week: https://factoryofsadness.co/2021/08/11/cavs-rumor-collin-sexton-extension-offer-back-table/"
 It’s just summer league but it’s   Cole Anthony  Evan Mobley  Killian Hayes
"Listen, teams have to show star players they care about what they want and the Timberwolves have given KAT two years with his best bud when they could have gone a different direction.  If anyone gets traded though it would be D’Lo, he only has 1 more year under contract after this season anyway. Imagine if the Rockets traded Jalen Green or the Cavs Evan Mobley for *Ben Simmons*, that’s what losing Anthony Edwards amounts to."
Buddy Cleveland drafted Evan Mobley not Moses moody
"You’re an obese child on reddit. You wouldn’t ‘punish’ anything. Kobe did the exact same thing in Charlotte, but he’s got ‘mamba mentality’ and that confidence to win. Evan Mobley didn’t work out with CL or H because he thought he should only go first, silence. Jalen speaks. Horrible, immature, shouldn’t be top 3, ego, bust, every summer league game except Jalens counts, why would he say this."
But what’s that gotta do with Evan Mobley?
Everyone knew Thabeet was gonna be a bust. Evan Mobley next.
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jonathan Kuminga 5. Jalen Suggs 6. James Bouknight 7. Jalen Johnson 8. Alperen Sengun 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Davion Mitchell 11. Trey Murphy 12. Chris Duarte 13. Moses Moody 14. Josh Giddey
"Sometimes a draft will have better guard/wing prospect than bigs, some times it will have better big prospect than guards/wings. You draft base on the best player available, not because it's ""consensus that bigs shouldn't get drafted in the lottery"" which is not even remotely true. That's how you end up with drafting Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan, because the consensus was that big men were more impactful back in the day.   The biggest game changers? The MVP was literally a center in the past season, the runner up MVP all season was another center until he got hurt, heck even Giannis is considered a big nowadays.   Draymond is not the perfect center, idk where you're getting this from. He's a good small ball center that can be used for stretches during a game but he's not what you should be looking for in a legitimate C, a guy like Anthony Davis is the perfect center when he's healthy and that's what Evan Mobley projects to be if he reaches his full potential."
"I would go:  1) Cade Cunningham  2) Jalen Green  3) Jalen Suggs  4) Evan Mobley  5) Jonathan Kuminga   6) Scottie Barnes  7) Josh Giddey (don’t think it’s fair to drop him since he pretty much hasn’t played)  Also, Scottie Barnes being two spots lower than where he was drafted isn’t meant to be a diss or anything. I still think he’s gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that’s where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"

Unfortunately too much of Evan the best Mobley
"Brought this up earlier regarding Evan Mobley being a poor screen setter, but it speaks to the larger issue that these mega prospects just don't practice fundamentals. Look at Ben Simmons. They just run and dunk on everyone until they hit the NBA."
Evan Mobley
Depends on if reigning MVP Evan Mobley allows it
It’s kinda funny to say “Evan Mobley reminds me of a young JJJ.” since JJJ is 21 years old and Evan is 20.
Evan Mobley is more like a lanky Jaren Jackson who is a better passer but worse shooter
For rookies I don't think those two have out and out comparisons unless you are joking..I see a comparison for Sharife cooper with Trae with same defensive flaws and a considerably weaker jumper similarly Evan Mobley and Jaren jackson jr
"Yeah Harden's first step was elite, did not mean to say his wasn't. Harden was real savvy with his and set it up via hesitations.  That said, Jalen Green's right now is very raw pure burst in a more Trae Young sense. I mean watch the speed he annihilates Evan Mobley here on this drive.   [https://youtu.be/VHS0zFOfxqs?t=118](https://youtu.be/VHS0zFOfxqs?t=118)  There was a slight hang dribble or hesitation here, but that was pure speed once he committed to attacking. There was a nother play that game where he went baseline but missed the layup, that one was another display of his first step because he practically exploded out of a stationary dribble and got right to the rim.  Again, with a savvy hesitation game on top of his jump shot this guy is going to be *crazy* with that burst."
"It’s hilarious to me that people had him below Evan Mobley. This kid is just so clearly a level of talent and polish above, has outrageous athleticism, and his efficiency is through the roof.  It’s honestly like watching 18 year old KD absolutely rip through college and then people are like “okay he’s good but is he really better than the goofy stiff 7 footer who looks like a 50 year old at the Y?”  Just wild that you could watch Green play and not think he’s one of the most obvious 19 year old stars ever to put on shoes."
Evan Mobley is a role player
"they don’t play like each other, but this is how fluid evan mobley looks"
"He went against Evan Mobley (3rd overall pick) on Sunday and clearly had the better game. How do you omit that from your ""analysis""?"
Ok what about Evan Mobley last game?
Evan Mobley gang we out here
Who? I thought that was Evan Mobley?
my take is that jalen green and evan mobley will both be better nba players than cunningham and im sticking to it
"Not really unless you have some serious pedigree. competition is way weaker in the UK than in the AAU or high school state championship in the US, so it’s difficult to do a solid comparison. For reference my friend was a 30/10/5 player in the UK high school leagues but would be a bench warmer on a varsity squad in the US for sure. He ended up going to USC and didn’t even touch the court in his freshman season. Did get to hang out with Evan Mobley and Okongwu though which is pretty cool"
"Crazy thing is that realizing somebody as young as Evan Mobley is going to make $21,000,000 over the next 3 years.  If you make $100,000 per year you'd need 210 years to make as much as this kid does over the next 3 years."
"Right now, the Cavs and Evan Mobley are in the Bagley spot."
"Yeah there’s nothing to be ashamed of if you are going to be a more efficient Evan Turner. That’s still a fringe-All Star level player.  Is that what you fully expecting out of a franchise cornerstone #1 pick though? Probably not. I mean you’ll take it over having him turn out to be Anthony Bennett but it’s not ideal if you are DET.  Make no mistake that Cade was still a bonafide Top 5 player in the draft…I just didn’t feel like he was the de facto #1 overall that everyone pegged him as. Evan Mobley will probably lead the league in blocked shots in a couple of years and Jalen Green already looks like he has the athletic prowess to create his own offense whenever he needs it.  Just watch the highlights of both Green/Cade in their first summer league game and you can see the stark difference in quickness, lateral agility, and ability to create in isolation. Doesn’t necessarily mean Cade won’t have a better career as Green still has many weaknesses (poor shot selection and overall strength) but Cade’s ceiling as a cornerstone franchise superstar is definitely much lower than the two players picked behind him."
"I don’t think Cade busts but I was always wary of his “ceiling” because he’s simply just not as athletic as people were saying. His first step is average at best and his lateral quickness leaves a lot to be desired.   Is he going to be a productive and good player? Absolutely. No doubt about that. But is he going to 100% be better than the elite-ultra athletes like Jalen Green and Evan Mobley? I don’t know. Those guys are top percentile even though they may not have their total offensive arsenal figured out yet.  Honestly, Cade’s physical package kind of reminds of Evan Turner. Good enough to be in the NBA but not enough to “game changing”."

"anyone else really annoyed by the announcers? i had to put it on mute at some point and put music on because i couldnt stand that guy who kept hyping up Jalen Green and Evan Mobley. It was just way too blatant. There was one play i remember where Sengun made a great play on Mobely defensively, it looked impressive but the guy almost seemed disappointed like he only wanted to watch Mobley. Then once Sengun was putting up better numbers he was like this guy came out of nowhere nobody knows who he is. Come on wasnt he like the 16th pick? He also kept saying Green is going to average 30 ppg some day. I was like come on its just so blatant. I liked watching the prospects but this guy just seemed overly hyped in an annoying way."
"Imagine if Evan Mobley was 6'1, would you draft him first overall?"
EVAN MOBLEY WELCOME TO THE BLOCK PARTY
idk about the only guy fighting for rebounds. Anthony Lamb had more rebounds than Evan Mobley.
Evan Mobley can't score on Sengun
Yea Evan Mobley is a bust too!!  I’ve watched him play for 13 mins in the summer league so I also have figured this stuff out
"Darius Garland. He already took a huge leap last year and displayed what he can do as a pure point guard/playmaker. Since then he has been playing on the USA select team scrimmaging against the best in the world all summer. And, they just gave him Evan Mobley to run pick and roll with. Look"
Evan Mobley  Larry Nance Jr.  Kevin Love  Dean Wade  Mfiondu Kabengele
"Gotta remember the NBA has some big man prospects like Evan Mobley (rookie this year) and Chet Holmgren (top 3 prospect next year). Myles Turner if he comes back from injury is still young and would be in his prime for 2024.   It's is still the U.S's weakest position, but they pretty much blow everyone else out 1-4 and in terms of top end talent and depth.  Plus again, many of USA's players were tired and had zero practice together."
"Anybody that thinks otherwise is ridiculous. This was on short/no practice, with 3 key players who played a Finals game the week before, some players who had the join on short notice and some potential players missing such as Curry, Kyrie, Harden, Lebron, Kawhi and AD. Team any of them up with KD and it would have been an ultimate joke.  2024 will have a prime Tatum, Booker and Lavine.  This year's rookie class (Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Scotie Barnes and Evan Mobley) were blowing teams out by nearly \~100 points the last few years. They showed some incredible chemistry reminiscent of what the original Dream team looked like vs the competition and played lockdown defense. That 2028 team is potentially going to be special imo especially when you combine them with vets from the 2024 games which I'm thinking will potentially be Lamelo, Ant, Ayton, etc.  Remember, these NBA players are the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the world's best basketball players and Team USA is the best of the best of that."
"Easily, trae/ja/tatum/zion/Mitchell/bam and i think kd may even play. AD is only 32 as well and can play. Then we got to see how Cade/Evan Mobley and jalen green turn out. They 3 looks legit."
Hopefully we get a fucking good American center again.. my god those lineups without a center.. hopefully some Evan Mobley comes out to be good

"our “few other pieces” are Jarrett “the Fro” Allen and Evan Mobley. Hence, Sexland and Frobley"
"PG: Cade; SG: Jalen Green; SF: Jerami Grant, PF: Christian Wood; C: Evan Mobley.  I’d rather get Mobley than SGA.  The drop off from SGA to Jalen Green in terms of offensive production isn’t going to be much, but the increase from Carter to Mobley is probably huge."
"Nope, Evan Mobley is not related to Cuttino"
"If Evan Mobley suddenly develops a KG-like work ethic and mentality, then yeah I guess him."

Man.. hopefully a new center arises like Evan Mobley..
Reminder that rookie Evan Mobley is the best American born center in the world.
"""I appreciate that mom, but I'm just not excited when I'm with him as when I'm hanging out with Evan Mobley."""
I think you can live with Jarrett Allen at 20 mil a year in a vacuum but it doesn’t make sense when you drafted Evan Mobley and you know he’s your center of the future
"I feel like Evan Mobley is best used as a 5 on defense and a mismatch 4 on offense so it kind of a weird fit, but the Cavs might as well keep Allen because he’s an asset"
So Evan Mobley?
"Its hilarious that you're trying to brag you have evan mobley, when I've literally made a post saying I'm not high on Evan mobley and I expect him to be a bust. If you'd like, we can return to this conversation when the season starts. That way you can brag if mobley is a stud, and I can call you a dumb fuckin loser if he's a bust"
"Exactly. You went on there to troll because you're a sad sack of shit and you're upset that the cavs have virtually 0 future.   Draft actually worked out fine. Kept all our good players and got a really nice international player. I got a news flash buddy, Evan mobley ain't gonna save your poverty franchise. If he's good he'll leave like lebron, and if he's bad then you're stuck with a bust. Congrats on that"
I'm looking forward to that 2019 u19 USA team who *dominated* everyone in their tournament:  Tyler Halliburton   Jalen Green   Cade Cunningham   Jalen Suggs   Evan Mobley   Scottie Barnes  Those Suggs/Green and Halliburton/Green lineups were lethal.
"&gt;[Cavs] always picking in the lottery, it would be worth it  Sexton + Garland + (now) Evan Mobley.  They are on the upswing.  Playoffs probably in their not too distant future.    Out of all our rebuilding and 1st rd draft picks, we have one guy who is as good as those three (Keldon)."
Evan mobley is too good to use in a salary dump
Evan Mobley would have dominated this Olympics
Lots of people have been talking about Evan Mobley on here and they don’t even know how the guy plays.  “Can Mobley play with Allen?” yes duh
"How? Because we prpbably only offered 6, 16, 18 and a future pick? Because that was probably the offer. I mean sounds like an overpay to me. It's not like Mobley is KD or Zion. Why would you give up 4 first round picks to move up 3 spots when a couple drafts ago 1 unprotected and the current was enough to move the needle and jump up in the draft for the Mavericks? Guarantee had Prsti offered 5 plus or 6 plus Cleveland would've said yes. Heck one of those could've been our future unprotected pick. He never offered a ""godfather"" offer to anyone because all three of the guys at the top of the draft weren't generational like Zion, Luka, LeBron, Giannis. There is no reason to overpay to move up in that case. Especially since we are going to trash next year with or without Evan Mobley."
- Jalen Green is most likely going to be an empty stat guy to start his career  - Evan Mobley is only going to be a solid starter until he puts on weight and refines his offense  - Barnes over Suggs isn’t even remotely a bad choice. People are overreacting off of name recognition and not seeing the issues with Suggs
"I have watched a lot of the Aldama in college and he reminds me of Evan Mobley. The bigs in the Pac-12 weren't really impressive this year (tbh the pac-12 in general was a guard-heavy conference this year)   I think in terms of value, Santi was a perfect fit for Memphis"
On offense he still plays the 4 but he can guard 3. And he may not be able to shoot yet but he already said he's in the gym everyday working on it! His body looks like Durant's to me who played the 3 when he started.   https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/2021/7/28/22596835/theres-no-prospect-like-evan-mobley
Evan Mobley
He compared Evan Mobley to Bill Russell and this dude to Dwight Howard. Lol.
"Sucks for Evan Mobley. He could add value to a good team, too"
Evan Mobley at all positions.
"Having watched a lot of Evan Mobley in college, I have no doubt he's going to be great for the Cavs. He can pass, shoot, play great D, and just influence the game in many ways. He will be a top 2 player from this draft in 5 years. Any other year, and he's going #1 with what he showed at USC."
Evan Mobley and I go to the same barber in LA
I don't get to see comments about Evan Mobley in real time! BOO!!
Anyone else think Evan Mobley is gonna be a major buss
Will Evan Mobley be better than Cuttino Mobley?
I don’t think Houston or Detroit will have any regrets but I think Evan Mobley will be one of the most valuable players in the nba in 3-5 years
This means Evan Mobley won’t play in a uniform with different colors than USC. That’s huge.
"Unfortunately for Evan Mobley, he will be playing in the same conference as Robert Williams."
"With the 3rd pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers select EVAN MOBLEY!"
"Cleveland has imagined USC 7-footer Evan Mobley playing on a frontline with Jarrett Allen; some four-man, some five. Cavaliers believe he's a franchise player. Teams tried to trade up to three, but Cavaliers are keeping it."
Evan mobley come on down Pleeeease dont fuck this up cavs :(
Evan Mobley should go 1. I think Cunningham will be a bust
They have some players in Sexton and Garland.   Jarrett Allen us a positive asset. Personally I’m not all the way sold on him but I think he’s pretty formidable. Obviously an Evan Mobley lifts that ceiling up.   But other than that. They don’t have anything too awesome.
"&gt; Excluding Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley (everyone is keeping a close eye on them)  Lol how are you gonna say this and then talk about Jalen Green like he's not in that category.  To answer your question though--for me as a Michigan fan,  it's Franz Wagner. Apparently he's grown to 6'10""/6'11"" since the season ended. Top tier defender and can do it all on offense. Outplayed Scottie Barnes start to finish in the NCAA tourney."

"I agree it's a plenty good enough offer, but calling McDaniel's the fifth best player on a 23 win team is misrepresenting value like it would be to reduce Evan mobley to the fifth best player on a 22 win team. From what I've seen of mcdaniels, he looks like he can be every bit as good as Jonathan Isaac. My issue with him isn't his quality as a trade piece, but that he doesn't fit Embiids timeline that well."

Evan Mobley is going to take some time to develop but that’s basically the only reason
OKC Thunder started in 08-09 season. Evan Mobley was born in June 2001. So Mobley was 7 years old.   Jeez I do feel old.
"Not too worried. Either Mobley will start next to Jarrett or Lauri will until Evan is comfortable. I'm actually not like most Cavs fans who look down on Love cause as slowed down as he is now, he still commands respect on offense and it was apparent when he came back. He dropped 30&amp;14 on the Celtics and had some other good games this past season. I think him and Rubio will be nice off the bench. As for Mfiondu and Fall I guess they'll just fill in if necessary."
Exclude Evan Mobley and Collin Sexton and *maybe* you have an argument.
"&gt;if OKC really wanted to move up in the draft, they would have  There are a multitude of reports that they’ve tried moving up to 5,4,3,2, and 1. But they were unable to do so - it takes 2 to make a trade. If a team really wants Evan Mobley, they’re not trading him away for protected picks."
"PG:Darius Garland SG:Collin Sexton SF:Isaac Okoro PF:Lauri Markannen(for now) C:Jarrett Allen Reserves: Dylan windler, Evan Mobley, damyean Dotson, Ricky Rubio"
"I'd say Memphis in the West. I think Ja will have a break out season and if that happens Memphis may have to say sth about top 6 places in the West. In the East I am saying Cavs, Sexton is a good young player but I think it's time for him to prove  that his scoring numbers aren't just empty stats and I think Garland will continue to develop and with addition of Evan Mobley I think his assist numbers will be better."
Evan Mobley is going to be so fucking good in 2 or 3 years when he has 35 more pounds of weight.  Holy shit hes going to be amazing
*Evan Mobley noises*
PG: Kevin Love  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Evan Mobley  C: Tacko Fall  Who needs good NBA players when you can just do netball passes to other seven-footers all day lmao
I’m already expecting a bunch of “is Evan Mobley a bust” threads if he struggles coming out the gate
I wonder if Evan Mobley will end up with the same problem. Even weaker and poorer about playing the paint due to playing so much as a guard growin up. He's got a thin &amp; tall frame too. Haven't watched him too much though.
PG: Evan Mobley   SG: Lauri Markkanen   SF: Kevin Love   PF: Jarrett Allen   C: Tacko Fall
"Right, so just as I said, ""defense"", ""shooting"", etc., - are arbitrary terms that are more intended to be unrefutable than to actually make a positive argument.  RJ Barrett is a better defender, but LeVert's lead over Barrett offensively is significantly higher than Barrett's lead defensively. Barrett has little ability to playmake or create his own shot, where LeVert does. RJ Barrett was assisted on 52% of his shots, LeVert was only assisted on 42%.  Which leads directly to shooting. The fact that they have the same true shooting (so I'm not sure why you're calling Barrett a better shooter to begin with) is not great for Barrett considering the degree of difficulty on assisted shots is much lower, so he should make more of them than LeVert makes off his own creation - but he doesn't, outside of spot-up threes, which LeVert doesn't really take.  As for playing in a system, Caris LeVert was the leading scorer on *two* playoff teams, whereas Barrett scored 14 points on 38% shooting and 28% from three in his playoff system debut. Regardless, ""playing in a system"" is more contingent on having a coach with a good system than anything to do with the players. Kevin Garnett never played in a good system the whole time he was on the Wolves, but they never had a functional system, so we don't hold it against him.  As for potential, that's just not really relevant. Evan Mobley has more ""room to grow"" than say Bam Adebayo right now because Bam is approaching his prime and Mobley isn't. That doesn't mean you give Mobley some prima facie credit for improvements he hasn't yet made.  All in all, to believe Barrett is better, you have to have a reason why ""defense"" and ""spot up shooting"" are sufficiently more important categories for a shooting guard than shot creation and playmaking, which are generally the go-to skills at that position. After all, in all the categories you value, Barrett is better than Devin Booker (better defender, higher 3pt%). But I'm skeptical you would use that to argue Barrett&gt;Booker."
Mo Bamba and Evan Mobley have similar builds. Scary.
"He is up against a rookie Evan Mobley.   Defense also react to him, when he gets the ball in the paint in actual games. And he is a good passer. So you can expect coaches told him to make the right plays."
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
Cleveland formulating a perfect bust situation for Evan Mobley.
Mobley/Markenen/Okoro/Sexton/Garland looks like a nice developing core that I run with on 2k but Evan seems about 2/3 years away from being able to hold down the fort in the paint.
"wait so let me get this right  they went into the offseason planning to re-sign jarret allen, okay reasonable. then they drafted evan mobley, the fits a little weird but its still reasonable. now they sign markannen for starter money, what the fuck now lmao.  this is like when the process 76ers traded for nerlens noel, the next year they drafted embiid and then decided to draft jahlil okafor the next season."
The answer is 2.   \-Lauri Markannen  \-Evan Mobley will be the PF 65% of the time.  \-KLove is 35% of a functioning NBA player.
a) imagine comparing KD to Evan fucking Mobley  b) Mobley’s a better rim protector than KD. You’re losing a lot of what makes him valuable if you pull him away from the basket.
"Terrible trade for CLE. Lauri, jarret Allen and Evan Mobley? How does that work?"
"I think it’s fine. If you presume Lauri plays 32 minutes at PF, Jarrett Allen plays 32 at center, and Evan Mobley splits his time playing 16 at each, then you have 48 minutes of PF and C filled out."
Did Cleveland forget they drafted Evan Mobley? As a bulls fan I kinda wish we just took Nance but I can’t complain
Evan Mobley Jaren Jackson Jr. AD
Collin sexton  Darius garland  Evan Mobley  Jarrett Allen   Okoro or Nance Jr(for the bench)  They can have Love.
George Mikan the OG of basketball !! Hoping Evan Mobley is the future for my birthday !!
How tf did Steven Adams and Evan Mobley become bros? Lol
I wanna see game speed before I get hyped for him.   A lot of guys are ballers in practice. I was watching Steven Adams have a workout with Evan Mobley and dudes footwork looked like a way lesser version Duncan at some points and he was hitting freaking one legged fade a ways. Practice is just that. Practice.

"Jalen Green will disappoint for his draft slot, and he and Kuminga will set back the entire concept of the G League as a stepping stone for 18 year olds.  Evan Mobley will end up the best player in this draft."
"Giddey and Moody are being significantly underrated as prospects  Cade will get pigeonholed into a full time point-forward role for years before teams realize that isn't what he is  Jalen Green is the best prospect of the draft IMO  Kuminga probably will not be a good NBA player  Evan Mobley is not a power forward and if a team tries to play him at PF they're gonna look really stupid  I think it's fairly likely we see Detroit trade down to #2 with Houston  &gt; The Thunder will trade up into the top 4  Unless a team really likes Kuminga or something, I think it's incredibly unlikely we see anyone trading out of the top 4"
"Over the last 10 College Basketball seasons, only 4 Freshman have finished top 3 in the nation in Box Plus Minus: - Evan Mobley (1st, 2021) - Zion (1st, 2019) - KAT (3rd, 2015) - AD (1st, 2012)  So, 3 All-stars and Mobley."
"This just isn't true.  Post lottery statements:    Pistons GM Troy Weaver - ""Yes, that's an option"" when asked about trading #1 pick.   James Edwards III of the Athletic - ""G League Ignite guard Jalen Green and USC center guard Evan Mobley are under, 'Strong Consideration' by the Pistons.""   Troy Weaver - ""We’ll uncover every stone and put ourselves in the right position to get the right guy for the Pistons. … We’ll look at everything; we’ll be aggressive and have the mindset to improve this team by all means necessary.”    Troy Weaver - “We’ll look at everything; we’ll look at 5 guys in the draft,""  Maybe you should be the new Pistons gm though, since you clearly know better."
Like I said Zach lavine is the floor that is the worst case scenario. With Mobley the worst case scenario is Myles Turner. That is Mobley’s floor in my eyes. I don’t know where you get the idea he was this outstanding scorer that can lead an offense on his own that’s not the kind of player Evan. He’s not gonna be initiating offense at this level and to be fair kpj is certainly good enough to get him in the right spots. Also I know we were the worst defense in the league last year. We were also the worst offense. We need everything we can possibly get on that end as well. The Rockets have three dudes on the roster that have double digit scoring potential. Threee!!!! Listen I love Mobley and green and I think they’ll both be all stars for years to come but defense is a skill that can much easier be learned. I just have more faith in Greens ability to become a good perimeter defender than Mobley’s ability to become a reliable scorer as a primary option. Also Wood is nigh untouchable. Unless you’re giving us an all star caliber player or a pick better than any of our current ones I’m hanging up every time.
Evan Mobley is super overrated.
They would be better putting Evan Mobley on the team
"Wait hold up hold up.... I just realized that college players can go to the olympics for basketball too  Thats insane, why not invite Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley and see how they do"

Never ending tank.  In all seriousness could we not get Evan Mobley or Cade on this team.
Evan mobley would've been better lmao
Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley would be great replacements unless DeAndre Ayton switches to team America
The Cavs are laser focused on Evan Mobley at #3 in the draft - Woj
"&gt;But the selection at no. 2 will cause ripple effects throughout the draft. Will the Rockets’ choice be Jalen Green, a 6-foot-5 scorer who played in the G League? Evan Mobley, a versatile big man out of USC? Jalen Suggs, a floor general from Gonzaga? Or will they trade down?  &gt;League sources say the Rockets prefer Green. Selecting him would make perfect sense: Not only is scoring a premium skill, he’s also flashed playmaking ability. Green is raw, but the Rockets have a young team that doesn’t need to worry about contending anytime soon. He’s a hard worker, and at just 19 years old, he’s only starting to tap into his full potential as an elite athlete with shot-creation skills. It would not be a shocker if he ends up as this draft’s best player.  &gt;Though Mobley and Suggs remain in consideration, teams are planning for scenarios in which Houston will pick Green.   https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/16/22579643/nba-draft-houston-rockets-cade-cunningham-jalen-green-evan-mobley"

Evan Mobley
"We already have that in Larry Nance Jr and Dean Wade who shoots 3s well and respectable defender and rebounder.  Trading a 24 point efficient scorer for another PF while we have decent power forwards behind an injury prone ass Kevin Love and soon, possibly Evan Mobley since Rockets are favored to get Green, is just dumb way to trade away good production."
"Quickley is the only good player we would be getting in return for Sexton and if we're making a player-for-player swap+picks in a Sexton deal, I'd rather swap for a veteran PG that knows how to win and is willing to be a leader. I really like IQ, but he's the same age as Sexton and doesn't have much experience either. Toppin is absolutely useless and he'll be buried on the depth chart instantly, especially if we draft Evan Mobley.  What you're saying makes sense. But if the Cavs are seriously considering trading Sexton for what the Knicks are supposedly offering, then I highly doubt Koby Altman is savvy enough to properly use the picks in trades if the best deal he can get for a 22 year old 25ppg scorer is a useless bum that has no place on the team, IQ, and picks that aren't in the lottery."
"Calling it now. No one went to Cade's birthday party, so Pistons take Green first. Rockets panic and stick with Evan Mobley. Cavs pull a cavs and take Kai Jones 3rd. Cade gets drafted by Toronto and is able to use his toronto mans voice everyday"

Evan Mobley is the best player in this draft
No thanks lol. Edwards hasn’t even turned 20 and has a solid season under his belt already. The #1 pick in this year’s draft in Cade Cunningham is only younger than Ant by a month and Evan Mobley is even older than Ant.
"Same. Maybe add Evan Mobley if he develops into a star early, he’s a perfect add for size."
"Dude most of his buckets came off of awkward broken layups and floaters in the post. How is that supposed to translate? Which NBA team in 2021 is gonna feed the ball to Evan Mobley in the post? Mobley is probably just as NBA ready than Wiseman is, and thats not a compliment.   I would take Bamba as a prospect over Mobley."
Key word hyped. He had a talented skill set and potential and he has certainly done everything possible to try to position himself as the #1 pick but there are also players with enormous upside like Evan Mobley and Jonathan Kuminga that teams may be more willing to take a flier on
"Why wouldn’t we just get an immediate impact long 4 in Evan Mobley with the third pick?  We have decent pieces but no true SF/PFs, and love plays like 2 games a year.  I just don’t see any scenario in which we do that."
Evan Mobley 📈🚀
"if evan mobley falls to them, allen will probably be on his way out lol"
it'll be the Cavs because they'll probably whiff on the 3rd pick and draft someone totally random instead of Jalen Green or Evan Mobley.

How valuable are those picks in the grand scheme of things? The nets could be good for a long time. Christian Wood has been passed around for a reason and is only there 1 more year and is about to command a lot of money. The #2 pick will be nice whether it's Jalen Green or Evan Mobley.

since they just got rid of horford and moses brown i bet it’s evan mobley
"Well, in the case of the rockets, maybe their preferred prospect will still be available at 4 (maybe Suggs/Green for instance) is top of their board whereas Evan Mobley would be top of the raps.   And maybe the Pistons would prefer to improve the situation for their rookies with Siakam, and/or og, and/or van vleet and have faith in whoever they can get. Maybe they internally think Cade might be overrated."
"James Wiseman wasn’t exceptional, it’s not a hot take to say he’ll never hit that next level. There’ve also been plenty of busts so no one knows what Evan Mobley can do or not. It’s not a hot take to say if someone who’s not even in the league won’t be an all star at all."
***This*** is the type of content you're here for? Lazy predictions about who won't be an all star? Then you're gonna *love* this:  * James Wiseman will never be an all star  * Mikal Bridges will never be an star  * Miles Bridges will never be an all star  * Evan Mobley will never be an all star  * Mike Conley will never be a two time all star  Enjoy! I have hundreds more
Probably because Houston is picking one of Jalen Green/Evan Mobley. Suggs plays good defense and does a little bit of everything. Personally I think he has the 2nd highest floor behind Cade.

Evan Mobley. Suggs is in a tier below the top 3 prospects imo.
This is how people should feel about Evan Mobley
I’ll take what seems to be Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes over Nikola Vucevic
"The draft is a 4-5 player class with the best prospects being Cade, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs, and Jonathan Kuminga/Scottie Barnes.  I believe Cade is 1A, and Jalen Green is 1B. This draft has a lot of wings + premier role players in the back end of the draft, and surplus of vertastile bigs. But if you watch Beal/Lavine/Brandon Roy, you can see a lot of similarities in his game. Super advanced scoring feel, his athleticism also takes him over the top, dude just glides when he finishes.  The dude scoring is just effortless, and he averaged 17.9 PPG against grown professional G-League players at 19.      [The man is just money, look at him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8YWVkr8D6w&amp;ab_channel=CPH2K)"
congrats on evan mobley
I’m interpreting this as OP saying rockets should draft Jalen green instead of Evan Mobley   u/bernardjordan
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Evan Mobley
"Can't go wrong with either, in my opinion (Jalen Green or Evan Mobley). I personally lean towards Mobley."
"&gt;If Evan Mobley, considered the most likely No. 2 pick to the Houston Rockets, is off the board and the Cavs choose one of the Jalens on July 29, there’s no rule against having too many quality guards on the roster.  Seems like it'll be one of the Jalens"
"No, that's impossible to do.  It'd just be a look back on whether the report came true or not.  Ex: ""Sources tells me that the Detroit plans to use the 1st pick on Evan Mobley"". Then we can go back and see if it was actually accurate."

"&gt;The Cavaliers hold the third pick in the draft. While many believe they will choose from a highly regarded pool of four prospects -- Cade Cunningham (likely the top pick), **Evan Mobley (who many believe will go second to Houston)**, Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs -- the Cavs are expanding their search beyond that quartet. Sources say Kuminga is in the No. 3 mix, with the organization believing that particular draft slot isn’t too high for him."
Evan mobley is a project Ben Simmons would definitely go before him lol
Evan Mobley
r/rockets is debating Jalen Green or Evan Mobley
“And with the first pick in the 2021 NBA draft the Detroit Pistons have selected Evan Mobley”
Evan Mobley. Top big in this year’s draft class.
"&gt; I seriously doubt Evan Mobley is falling past #2 so already the situation being discussed is near-impossible, at least in my opinion. So in the broader perspective, this arguing is almost pointless.  Yes I agree"
"Wow, you're a dick, and you're still wrong!  ""That's not a bear!""  ""No, it's a grizzly bear.""  ""Uh huh, not a bear then.""  Is the exchange we just had.  Restricted free agent is a type of free agent.   If the cavaliers draft evan mobley they will no longer want to pay jarrett allen 100 million dollars, meaning if someone offers him that, the cavaliers would, barring incredibly poor judgement, not match the offer, and allen will go where he pleases. They are now considering a sign &amp; trade to not let him walk for free. If next year rolls around and evan mobley is on the team alongside jarrett allen on a 100 million dollar contract, the cavaliers owner should consider firing their GM. Paying Allen when you have Mobley is literally worst case scenario for the cavs, you'd rather let Allen walk for nothing. So yes, the fact that Allen is a free agent matters, because he needs a new contract and the extent of that contract determines what team he goes to.  If he wasn't a free agent, it wouldn't matter, because his contract would stay the same on the books and you'd have no problem benching him. His free agency means keeping him costs many dozens of millions more to your cap space."
There's seems to be a definite top 6 in this draft.  Cade Cunningham - Evan Mobley - Jalen Green - Jalem Suggs - Jonathan Kuminga - Scottie Barnes
"We have one this year too, Evan Mobley is compared to Bosh and AD"
I think we'd take him for that price if we lucked into Evan Mobley honestly. We'd have two shooters you could safely leave but the defence would be brutal.
Pistons-Rockets 2024 NBA finals led by Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley confirmed
Would you take Evan Mobley or Jalen green
Doubt ur gonna get jalen green or Evan mobley. They are prob taken.
"Personally, I think Jalen Green.  But I suspect they'll go Evan Mobley who is also a great prospect."
"Possibly, but one of Jalen Green or Evan Mobley will be available, and BPA should be close enough between the 3 to go with fit."
"Such an interesting/weird development to see all of the top bigs being non-Americans/guys representing other countries on the international level (Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, Ayton, KAT, Capela, Vucevic, Valanciunas, Nurkic).    Hopefully some of the high-profile young American bigs coming up — Evan Mobley, Chet Holmgren, Hunter Dickinson, etc. — can start to rebalance the situation."
What’s bizarre about college basketball is that Drew Timme absolutely smoked Evan Mobley in their tournament game. Mobley couldn’t defend Timme at all. But Mobley is going to be the better pro.
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"Sam was on a podcast right after the draft and these are the relevant things I found from it:      Some Rockets relevant stuff on here:     -Troy Weaver (DET GM) has been high on Jalen Green all year and is ""a wild card"" and someone ""that doesn't subscribe to groupthink"" when it comes to draft eval &amp; pref     -Evan Mobley isn't a loud vocal leader type     - Both guys have Suggs 2nd https://t.co/zapou59V5m      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021      (ctd):     -Rockets have to consider Mobley's quieter personality in how they want to construct their locker room, Isaiah Mobley was the vocal leader for the USC team but Evan did try to ""come out of his shell"" more the last few seasons     -Vecinie has Mobley as All-NBA ceiling      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021      -Vecinie likes Suggs aggressiveness     -Green's athleticism and ability to produce against pros in G League are key and his shooting looks legit as well as half court creation abilities trajectory is most intriguing; needs to add strength     -Pennie has Mobley as more off-the ball guy      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021"
"After winning the 2021 [NBA](http://bleacherreport.com/nba) draft lottery on Tuesday night, the [Detroit Pistons](http://bleacherreport.com/detroit-pistons) are open to trading the No. 1 overall pick.   According to [Rod Beard](https://twitter.com/detnewsRodBeard/status/1407679561169506305) of the Detroit News, Pistons general manager Troy Weaver said Wednesday that trading the top pick is ""an option.""  Per [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2668326/2021/06/23/nba-mock-draft-2021-picks-for-every-lottery-team-including-jalen-suggs-to-magic-and-evan-mobley-to-cavaliers/)'s James Edwards III, Oklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham is the likely pick for Detroit if it stands pat, although G League Ignite guard [Jalen Green](http://bleacherreport.com/jalen-green) and USC center Evan Mobley are under ""strong consideration"" by the Pistons as well."
"I’m not so sure the rockets pass on Evan Mobley, they really lack interior defense"
"It's not a good comparison. Cade Cunningham is widely believed to be a lock for #1, but not everyone agrees (Sam Vecenie of the Athletic)  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don’t think we should necessarily write this in stone yet. The one thing that every person in basketball says about Troy Weaver is that he absolutely does not subscribe to group think. He said in a post-lottery presser that they’ll look at five guys and then make the best decision. It’s worth taking him at his word. After the lottery, I got texts from multiple sources that said the Pistons are also thought to be fans of Jalen Green. So look, I’m mocking Cunningham here. Pistons fans who want Cunningham shouldn’t have a meltdown based off this. But this isn’t like 2019 when Zion Williamson was a done deal and everyone in the basketball industry knew it. Cunningham is considered the likely choice here. He’s the overwhelming favorite. But everyone seems to be acting like this is unequivocally a done deal, and I’m not totally convinced of that as of right now, an hour after the lottery.  Most people have Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley at similar levels, with some adding Jonathan Kuminga to that mix. Since yesterday, Rockets fans have generally be in favor of drafting Jalen Green, followed by Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs a distant third."
"As you mentioned, he's a 4.  When the Rockets inevitably go with Mobley it's going to suck because he may be placed at the 5 and doesn't have enough meat on his frame right now to bang with NBA centers.  Somewhat ironically, a top comparison for Evan Mobley is Christian Wood lol."
"Really like the Evan Mobley fit in Houston. Just feels nice to see a potential star two-way center play for the Rockets again, and the USC connection with him and KPJ will be fun to watch"
Do you guys think that theRockets will take Evan Mobley? I don’t really watch their games and I don’t know if Christian Wood can play PF
"I'd do Wiseman and #7 for #3, I'm in love with Evan Mobley"
Mobley at the 5 wood at the 4. Rim protector in Evan Mobley and a very versatile Wood at the the 4. Should be pretty good if Mobley develops defensively at the 5 role in the nba
I’m guessing it’ll be 1. Cade 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jalen Green. Maybe flip the Jalens
Evan Mobley is just a taller Frank Ocean bust for sure
Evan um Mobley!
Evan Mobley looks so baked

Evan Mobley is my religion
"57-36 rebounding advantage.  Cavs grabbed 14 offensive boards.  Clips got straight pushed around.  The foul differential was 24-14 and a lot of those came while fighting for rebounds.  Clips couldn't take advantage of their footspeed either because Clips aren't that quick to begin with and Evan Mobley is very, very mobile and has great control for his size.

Evan mobley
"The way Evan looks right now is that no matter who he’s guarding, he’s effective at changing what opposing players do and forcing them to make adjustments.  People are excited in one part because you can just stare at Mobley all game and it’s entertaining to watch him play both sides of the court haha."
"Batum and his old man jumpers were the only thing that worked against Mobley tonight. Mann, Bledsoe, Jackson, or PG, none of them could get any action going when matched up against Evan."
"Did anyone mention Evan Mobley yet? If not,   Evan Mobley"

Evan Mobley
Dont get too high dont get too low. Remember with our best player its going to be rough.  On top of that our match up  vs teams with quality bigs is our worse match up. DeAndre defeated us. Jjj and steven adams hurt us. Today we had kevin love evan mobley and Jarrett allen stop us. They stopped jokic. Then shifty small guards is another weakness for us so sexland is an issue. Cavs are pretty much our kryptonite for sure. I hope we can get to 500 by all star break though.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe only five players in NBA history were on the All-Defensive Team in their rookie season.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (22 years old)  Hakeem Olajuwon (22 years old)  Manute Bol (23 years old)  David Robinson (24 years old)  Tim Duncan (21 years old)  None of them were first team, all of them were second.  Evan Mobley could seriously flirt with it at just 20 (!!?) years old. No Kawhi this year opens up a spot. First team is (probably?) out of the question, but I really think second team is in play. He's completely transformed the Cavs defense. Defends the paint, blocks shots, guards the perimeter, sticks with guys in space, doesn't foul. The footwork, and the way he uses his body is so advanced for his age. He looks like a multi-year vet.  Like, holy shit. I'm in love with this guy."
Evan mobley is a monster. Cleveland defense might be the best in the league
I see a GOAT role for Evan Mobley
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"I love Evan Mobley, him plus Okoro and Allen makes our team a nightmare to score on."
Evan Mobley is going to be must watch TV for fans of elite defense
"What’s great about Mobley though is he doesn’t have to touch the ball to have a positive impact on the game. When there is a pick and he gets switched on a guard he’s able to keep up with them and impact the angle of their shots cuz of his crazy length. And he’s smart and not fouling in those situations either. I was at the game Thursday and the way he forced players into poor shots, I’m seeing the Bosh/KG defense potential. I said in 3 years, but it might be sooner than that  https://mobile.twitter.com/Tony_Pesta/status/1451993477957423109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1451993477957423109%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftherookiewire.usatoday.com%2F2021%2F10%2F24%2Fcavaliers-kevin-love-evan-mobley-all-defensive-player%2F  https://youtu.be/dYleoS29RkY  https://youtu.be/UAqjhwzqqkg"

Hahaha I basically posted the same thing.  Did you know there’s no way Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen could ever play together?  Did you know Collin Sexton is a ball hog?
People talk about the Cavs and they don’t watch the Cavs.  They don’t actually know what the Cavs struggle with.  They just rehash things they’ve already heard.  They don’t know who Evan Mobley is.  They just know he is slim and 7ft.  And then they talk about Evan Mobley.  They did the same thing with Collin Sexton for years.
Who's your way-too-early all-rookie team? I got   Chris Duarte / Jalen Green / Josh Giddey / Scottie Barnes / Evan Mobley
"I know this is a homer's opinion, but Evan Mobley is currently my ROTY and i'm a big Scottie Barnes fan. Mobley is playing like he's a veteran with a high BBIQ. His defense is calculated, he's guarding 1-5, and he's making big stops without fouling. It's actually insane how refined his game is 3 games in."
I'd go   evan mobley   scottie barnes  jalen green  chris duarte  josh giddey
I thought Evan Mobley wasn’t even close to ready based on our preseason and then I drafted him 91st in a head 2 head fantasy basketball league based off of the first 3 games lol preseason is deceiving
"I think Evan Mobley is going to come out being the best if the class, but I can't wait to see Cade"
"Smaller market teams deal with this in everything.  Read a scouting report on Evan Mobley and you understand who the guy is, but the average nba fan just sees that he’s 7ft and Jarrett Allen is 7ft and “how could these guys play together?”"
People were trashing him in the Evan Mobley thread.   Guess what? They're both great. Who wins? Everyone!

"Evan Mobley sure, Jalen green I’m not so sure"
I think Jalen Green will consistently be all nba and one of the best scorers in the league. I think Evan Mobley will be a all-nba and All-Defense on a regular basis. No team made the wrong decision in my eyes

Idc if I get 10000 downvotes and flamed for this, a fairly refereed game and it isnt a tight win for Cleveland. That was absolutely shambolic, so bad to the point I genuinely wondered if refs dont bet on outcomes of games but make prop bets on free throws &amp; fouls. gg to cleveland my beef is with the refs tonight. The free throw disparity doesn't do justice to just how ridiculous and one sided this refereeing  was. At one point they called a foul on the hawks 3 or 4 possessions in a row while not calling fouls for the hawks on drives to the rim. Also, three 7 footers running a zone is so OP idk how youd even score on that"
Evan Mobley will win Rookie of the year and be an All Star.
Evan Mobley with 17/11 and 4 blocks in his third professional game 👀
Evan Mobley is my religion
Ricky Rubio is my king. Also Evan Mobley is the best rookie we've had in so goddamn long
" Evan Mobley had 17/10/4 with 4 minutes left in the 3rd.   you'd think he did nothing for the rest of the game after ending with 17/11/4, but watching it, he was still impactful all over the place. Keeps the ball moving, switches on defense, has nutty handles for his size and can move with anyone on the court... he's going to be a massive problem"

EVAN MOBLEY ROTY CAVS MAKE CONFRENCE FINALS
I'm annoyed as fuck BUT Evan Mobley is what I expected Ayton to be. Hes nice af
I wanted Evan Mobley but Giddey is fine
Evan Mobley because the Cavs just suck
"Man too bad Cavs and Raptors games are at the same time, gotta go back and watch these Evan Mobley highlights, stat lines in both these games look great."
evan mobley
"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."

Evan Mobley playing 38 minutes right out the gate as a big is pretty wild.
"Mike korzemba be like is Evan Mobley, Jokic with DEFENSE."
Evan Mobley is in fact good.
Good input. Would love to see Giannis flex on Evan Mobley next game.
"Evan Mobley has entered the chat after his epic debut last night  17/9/6 on 54% shooting with 1 STL, 0 TO's, 1 block and at least 22 altered shots per NBA stats https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle/?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS&amp;dir=1"
Darius Garland has been like this.  Evan Mobley has had strong passing.  Throw in Rubio and yea you’re gonna have a lot of assists.
"Evan Mobley shooting a sustainable 50% from beyond the arc, league fucked"
"Evan Mobley looked like a beast so i'm perfectly fine with tonight. 17 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, a block and a steal on 7-13 shooting and is shooting 3s, exactly what we wanted to see out of him."
Evan Mobley is going to be so good in this league. What a player.
That's 2021-22 ROY Evan Mobley to you
Evan Mobley already the GOAT tbh
HOW GOOD DO YOU THINK EVAN MOBLEY WILL BE? I'M EXCITED TO SEE JA BAPTIZE HIM LIKE HE TRIED TO DO TO RUDY GOBERT ALL POST SEASON
"""Darius Garland lobs it to Evan Mobley who THROWS THE HAMMA DOWN""  I'm really looking forward to Austin Carr having more things to get excited about."
"Right, I think we are playing for either 2 situations here. One where garland starts at point guard, sexton is at the 2, okoro at the 3, Lauri at the 4, and Mobley at the 5. Mobley at the 4 and Allen at the 5 works too, that being said either Allen or Lauri will get bought out, and love is probably a bench guy at this point. This would also require sexton to be better for the flow of the offense. The second situation has garland at the point, okoro at the 2, a bigger wing that is similar to Khris Middleton(acquired in a sexton trade) at the 3, mobley at the 4, and Allen at the 5. Here, the team flows through Evan mobley."
"He was fantastic at icing out Evan Mobley in summer league but that's a fairly limited skill, unless you guys also have a \#3 pick who you don't want getting touches."
Very young players only  Davion Mitchell Lu Dort Cam Reddish Scottie Barnes Evan Mobley
"I agree with you, I would definitely take the over on 27 wins. I think Garland is going to have a huge year. Jarret Allen is a really good player and will help that team immensely in a full season. Evan Mobley was my favorite player in the draft."
PG: Kevin Love  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Evan Mobley  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Tacko Fall
no he is the only center.   love-Markkanen-Evan Mobley-jared allen-tacko fall  this is the starting 5.
"For those who either didn't or couldn't open the link: The Cavs were ranked dead last, with Nick Roy of 'The Score' stating:  ""*Evan Mobley may provide the Cavs with a couple of jaw-dropping moments, but it doesn't feel like there's much else to get overly excited about on this squad*.""  Not only is that disrespectful to Sexland and everyone else on this team, but it is simply a lazy take in general."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"I think people overlook the fact that Poku is younger than Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and Scottie Barnes."
Davion Mitchell or Evan Mobley are my 1-2 ROY
"It’s a high number but I’d like the cavs to win 30 games.  I don’t mind if Evan Mobley develops slow.  His job in the nba is not easy.  I’d love to see something resembling good 3 and D play from Okoro, and that would really validate our organization’s path forward.  A minor improvement in Collin Sexton’s scoring is fine.  A minor improvement for Darius Garland is fine.  They’re both very good now."
"Excited for top 3 guys and Bouknight the most  Cade cause he’s got all the tools to be a great player, multi level scoring, create his own and for others, and can be great defensively given his height and wingspan. His main weakness is his athleticism and being turnover prone in college. He can work on both overtime.  Jalen Green is just a walking bucket, could really see him winning a scoring title. His game makes me think of Kyrie with how electric it is and he’s athletic as shit. He’s gonna struggle with consistency most likely and I don’t think he’ll ever be more than a solid defender (and he’s looked bad defensively so far), but I do find him having success as a premier scorer.  Evan Mobley is who I was extremely high on cause he has all the tools to be a really fucking good PF/C, like best in the league at his position. Which is his greatest weakness because he may not reach said potential.  Then Bouknight is someone I hoped we’d potentially trade up for. He’s just fun to watch."
MVP - Giannis or Steph.   MIP - OG  DPOTY - AD  6MOTY - Alex Caruso  ROY - Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley
Mvp Darius Garland  MIP Kevin Love   Dpoy Jarrett Allen   6moty Ricky Rubio   Roty Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley. Garza is destined to be a backup big at best.
Evan Mobley or Luka Garza. Who would you rather have for the next 8 years?
Who cares about that who would you rather have Isaiah Hartenstein or Evan Mobley
"One of Russ, LeBron, or AD will average less than 20ppg.  Evan Mobley doesn’t make all-rookie 1st team and barely makes all rookie 2nd. Unless the Cavs clear the logjam by moving someone but that’s unlikely.  Jazz take a step back and end up in the play-in, while the Celtics take a step forward and grab the 4 seed behind Bucks, Nets, and Miami."

"I don't think Ayton should be that high, there was already a strong contingent of people who thought Luka should go 1st in 2018, and there were concerns about his motor in college.  In 2014 many people thought Embiid was the most talented prospect in the draft, and only slipped due to injuries. If Wiggins and Parker are on this list I feel like he should be around them somewhere.  Cade Cunningham is too high, there are already some people who believe Jalen Green or Evan Mobley have a higher ceiling (look at the GM survey) so he already has a fair amount of doubters entering his rookie year.  It's been a while but I think Kyrie Irving should be a bit higher. He was the consensus #1 pick all year."
&gt; Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland  come on bro and your first bullet point?! cotdamn
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.

"In this season, only Evan Mobley."
I have season tickets so I have seen a lot of the Cavs live. Think Tim Duncan in terms of shooting touch. I see a lot of Tim Duncan in Evan Mobley.
Evan Mobley is going to be ROTY
"As a UCLA alum and Pistons fan, Evan Mobley is probably supposed to be forbidden fruit, but I’ve enjoyed watching him since college and even more as a pro. I wouldn’t have even been mad if Detroit went Mobley at one, much to the chagrin of Pistons fans."
"Everyone said he hated Gilbert before he went back to Cleveland last time. Not saying it’s going to happen, but Evan Mobley(20,) Okoro(20,) Garland(21,) Sexton(22,) Allen(23,) and Markkanen(24) could really extend that streak for him."
"You’re playing Giannis out of position and leaving Middleton on the bench for… Evan Mobley?  Shit man I like him too but come on now, be serious."
"Not an elite defense, but a solid one for sure, Nuggets would need an elite level help defender at pf, someone like dray or in the future evan mobley and then solid wing and guard defenders  Even an average defense could be enough given how fucking good jokic is on offense"
Cole Anthony and Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley is back baby
"Marvin ""Evan Mobley"" Bagley"
I’m surprised his TS is that high considering his terrible fg% and 3pt%. It’s in line with rookies that aren’t Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley #1  Scottie Barnes #2
"Call me a homer, but Jarret Allen and Evan Mobley should be over Fox and Herro."
"Literally everyone on ops list. (Hero is close). Hell, I’ll take Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley over fox at this point even, I’ve seen enough."
"Trae Young's impact would not go down due to the new officiating roles.  Brandon Ingram won't be a winning player without Zion.   Evan Mobley will be the best looking rookie (defense gives him the edge over Barnes)  Golden State will look like a championship team.  Now, ask for my pre-season thoughts on Kevin Porter Jr. and Jalen Suggs if you want some wrong thoughts."
This probably isn't unpopular but not a lot of my takes age well so I'll proudly take this one. I said from the moment I saw him live when he was in high school that Evan Mobley would have a major and instant impact on whatever team took him.
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"Evan Mobley is really good. It’s so hard to make these lists without projecting forward on what we think will happen, but Mobley is so freaking good right now."
"Sit down and ask yourself honestly, are the Cavs contenders with a team of Jarrett Allen, Kevin Love, Lauri Markkanen, Darius Garland, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Mobley?  Just think about it please.  In no universe are they contenders, just like how the Hawks weren't contenders in 2015."
Evan Mobley?
"Thank you Evan Mobley, very cool!"
"I kind of view him (in my albeit minimal watching of college basketball this season) as an Evan Mobley type. Not saying he’ll be as good. But he’s a lanky big with good touch and the ability to stretch the floor on offense. He plays in the high post in a very similar way. Great high low passing and solid court vision in that area. Plus he contests so many shots around the rim on the other end of the floor.    However as skinny as Mobley is, Chet is even skinner."
Evan Mobley
Be legends. Make your charge from a low seed. Evan Mobley gets heralded as the greatest Cav of all time.  Agreed that if both teams stay healthy we might be looking at a Warriors/Suns WCF.
Also people write off 19 year olds who don't immediately perform well in Summer League. Both Evan Mobley and Franz Wagner were getting a lot of criticism from what I recall.
We doing the Evan Mobley body thing again this year?
"as per OP: Evan Mobley, Emoni Bates, Bronny Jr, Victor Wembayana  ROFLMAO"
Anthony Davis  Giannis Jokic  Jayson Tatum Zion if healthy (not lookin likely but still) Ja Morant  Joel Embiid  Lamelo Ball Anthony Edwards Deandre Ayton  Evan Mobley  Emoni Bates  Bronny Jr Victor Wembayana  These are just the standout talents of you told me they are going to be the best player in the world I can clearly see why   What is Luka’s why?
**For readability:**  Evan Mobley   Darius Garland   Jarrett Allen   Lauri Markannen   Collin Sexton   Isaac Okoro   Ricky Rubio   Cedi Osman
Evan Mobley Darius Garland Jarrett Allen Lauri Markannen Collin Sexton Isaac Okoro Ricky Rubio Cedi Osman
Scottie Barnes + Evan Mobley combined haven’t saved a teammate from that many games due to suspension   Really makes you think about ROTY
My students got mad at me for saying Evan Mobley was playing better than Jalen Green so I gotta bust out some stats tomorrow so my kids know that I know my shit lmao
Evan Mobley should win this unanimously
We’ll see with Evan Mobley. He has everything the modern nba needs
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland
"&gt; But the lakers signed him knowing he wasn't a good 3pt shooter (at the time at least,) and they don't need another ball handler.  They didn't sign him from a pool of possible options. They kept him because they couldn't replace the salary slot if they let him go, and because they believe in his longer-term ceiling being much higher than Caruso's. Now, they didn't keep both for financial reasons...which might have been dumb. But THT hasn't even turned 21 yet.   He's younger than Bouknight, 3 years younger than Davion Mitchell, 4 years younger than Duarte. He's only a few months older than Suggs, Scottie Barnes, and Evan Mobley."
"Man, he was a sort of proto-Christian Wood/Evan Mobley type. I think he'd be fucking great (he was fucking great!)."
"He's younger than Evan Mobley, Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs."
Whatever you watch basketball like a child and argue like one too. Congrats on Evan Mobley though kid is a stud. Hope he gets healthy soon
"come back when Evan does! Mobley is the best draft pick we've ever had not named LeBron, dude has clear HOF potential (I do think his career will be more impressive than Kyrie as KI was one of the worst defenders in the league while in Cleveland)"
It’ll be up to the new LeGM.   Evan Mobley.
Evan Mobley is the next Tim Duncan
"Steph is amazing, although I think this looks a different with Evan Mobley instead of Love."
lol Evan Mobley?
like darius garland and evan mobley?!
this is why evan mobley is the ROY
evan mobley is effing insane
"How in the fuck are we outrebounding the Warriors without Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, and Lauri Markannen? Like literally how?"
"I just love every rookie all around, Scottie Barnes was my pick for ROTY and Evan Mobley a close second. Now that Cade is showing his true potential I won’t be surprised if he gets it instead. I’m loving this rookie class a lot"
Evan Mobley : Am I a joke to you?
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."

I rmeber when Charles Bassey was mentioned in the same convo as Evan Mobley back in high school lol
Whatever lets us watch more games with Evan Mobley
Cavs for Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley
"I don't know why Cavs play him at C when he ain't no where near ready. Mobley has one of the highest BBIQs for a big outside of Joker. Like Jokic who, only play the C, Evan should only play PF. It's bullshit how everyone says you have to play the C to have value. Draymond has value and Evan can certainly do what most of Draymond can do on D while also being a plus on O."
"But imagine you miss the playoffs, move up and draft another Evan Mobley"
"Evan Mobley sprained elbow last night, could be out a bit so ROTY has certainly opened up for Cade and others."

Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
Evan Mobley (I’m from the future)
He was trained by Evan Mobley?
"Recently, I was watching Evan Mobley and I thought, ""I want a player like THAT for my team."" I immediately remember that Anthony Davis plays for the Lakers.   Nothing like a 6'10"" monster with guard skills and high BBIQ. I hope the minutes don't grind him down too much."
I just described Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley obvi
Evan Mobley ROY &amp; DPOY
"There’s actually a (alleged) correlation between trading KPJ and Mobley falling to the Cavs, though. Mobley’s dad is a coach at USC and witnessed KPJ first-hand. Supposedly that was enough to not have Evan work out for Houston before the draft."
Evan mobley top 2 and he’s not 2
1. MJ  2. Kobe  3. Wade  4. Evan Mobley
He forces Adam silver to put bronny on Cleveland he goes back teams up with Evan Mobley but gets swept by Scottie Barnes in the playoffs sad ending to the goats career but he should be proud about getting swept by Scottie is nothing to be ashamed of. Im a time traveller so what I say is fact.
"Evan Mobley good, UpGarlands to the left"
Jordan.  Lebron.  Muhammad Ali.  Yao.  Evan Mobley.
"Yeah for sure. Evan Mobley is the clear frontrunner now, but I still have Scottie as the runner up. Cade is looking really good now though aftet that slow start too"
Love Scottie Barnes but Evan Mobley is definitely the front runner now. I don't think anyone could be upset about that fact either. We're witnessing greatness   This rookie class just keeps impressing me more and more each game
Evan Mobley vs LeBron
My redraft:  1) Evan Mobley 2) Scottie Barnes 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Chris Duarte 5) Jalen Green
"It's pretty early in his rookie season to suggest he might or might not become the GOAT PF. People calling him Slim Duncan, Evan Garnett, etcetera, are kinda missing the fact that he's his own guy already. All caps when you spell the man's name. EVAN MOBLEY."
"Losing KPJ may have helped team chemistry, but you’re making it seem like this was purely addition by subtraction.  The Cavs also went out and got Jarrett Allen and struck gold in the draft with Evan Mobley. These are arguably more important changes."
Evan Mobley: EXCUSE ME?
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23.

Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"Yeah there are a dozen posts for every good Bulls or Cavs win, and every Scottie Barnes or Evan Mobley  statline.  And while they’re all deserved, that same “let’s see if they can keep it up” argument applies."
"Whilst he's not putting up the most points, he's consistent as fuck, and he's already basically a DPOY candidate as a rookie. Fuck Jalen Green, our mans Evan Mobley is winning that hardware."

"20-9, and 10 of those free throws went to jarret Allen and Evan Mobley. That’s what happens when you have two 7 footers in the frontcourt that are banging down low all game and are active in the offense."
Evan Mobley has more points than Pascal Siakam this season for the Raptors so far 👀👀
What the fk is evan mobley man
Evan Mobley and Scotty Barnes are da future
Don't let the Cavs win distract you from the fact that Evan Mobley scored more points for the Raptors than Goran Dragic tonight.
"Evan ""Solo 322"" Mobley"
Can you believe the Cavs drafted Evan Mobley over Dalano Banton?

*thumb injury to Scottie Barnes has ultimately made Evan Mobley the better player*
"Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago...but seriously, Evan Mobley"
"I can't keep going back and forth with you. It is so very apparent that you can only assess players by box scores and basketball reference stuff. That's not how actual real world evaluation works. You are completely and totally on your own with this evaluation because you can't or won't assess anything except for box scores with players.   Everthing is a gamble. The Lakers trading very good players for Kobe Bryant who never played a game outside of high school was  gamble. The Wolves taking KG 1st overall out of high school when he didn't play in a huge bball talent pool is a gamble. Philly taking Embiid despite him only playing basketball for like 4 or 5 years and having a foot issue already is a gamble.   They are all calculated risks, calculated risks are gambles. But they aren't blind shots in the dark.   Once again, there is a reason why every front office would have given Jamal the contract he got to keep him and was a no brainer for the Nuggets, and why Sexton will absolutely not be getting it.   There's a reason that despite Mikal Bridges averaging 14/4/2/1/1 on 54/43/84 as a 24 year old got him 100m instead of the 180m super max. Those numbers are insane if scaled up even a little tiny bit, so why didn't he get a max?   Because you have to watch him play to actually understand that. Just like you have to watch Sexton playing to understand he isn't actually a better offensive player than Jamal Murray at all, and doesn't have near the ceiling. You have to watch the games. You have to watch the players playing. Rudy Gobert scores 16 points on 65% from the floor. He is nowhere near the scorer nor does he have the potential as Evan Mobley -right now- who is scoring 13 on 49%.   All stats aren't equal and it is painfully obvious you didn't watch Jamal Murray carefully enough and you may have not watched a single Sexton game ever.   By all means keep telling saying that the best evaluation and talent growing front office of the past 5 years, who work to make the proper basketball and financial decisions for a multi-billion dollar corporation, were wrong to give Jamal the max. Clearly they didn't know what they were doing and somehow they just lucked into Jamal becoming exactly what the coach and front office said about him being able to become since his second year in the league.   That massive 9 figure, franchise changing, decision made by the people who have proven to make those decisions the best was a silly unnecessary gamble that they made stupidly. They couldn't have possible seen Jamal's progression coming, or had any idea what his time behind the scenes was showing them. With the trainers, with the coaches, in practices, on his own.  No, it is you, redditor, who knows how to evaluate talent and assign potential and a dollar value on it better than the people who have a career doing it. Not the people who are around this person every day to understand his personality and work ethic. Who are watching him in practices, in the gym, in games, concentrating on him with the knowledge that can only come from being a career long basketball player, coach, scout, executive.   No, they didn't make this decision accounting for everything you're looking at on basketball reference, everything they saw in games, and the metric ton of things they see that you can't see not to mention wouldn't be able to see.   It's you, basketball fan, who understands what's an unnecessary risk and gamble. Not these people who have spent their entire life around basketball in order to have a literal career doing that very thing; and the fact that they were completely correct in their decision, oh, it can only be a fluke. It couldn't possibly be that your ability to assess players is faulty and lacking. It's definitely the entire team of professionals, ex-players, and coaches who were wrong.  Incredible."
"So Evan Mobley. The 3rd overall pick this past year.  You said there are centerS who fit next to Zion. As in, multiple. So who else? What are their deficiencies as a player? How available are they? What would the Pelicans have to trade to acquire them?"
"If Lauri was out there, the SF matchup could have been Norman Powell vs. Evan Mobley."
Evan mobley ish. Someone that is mobile and can still shoot outside
Easily the easiest superstar to root for in the league after Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley IMO
Don't know why nobody said this but: Cade Cunnigham. I do think Evan Mobley will be a good player but there was a reason Cade was far and away the consensus No.1 pick in the draft
either evan mobley or greg brown iii
Evan Mobley is going be a DPOY and 1st team all nba player
Evan Mobley
That core injuries name? Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley can play some defense
Evan Mobley obviously. Also top 5 defensive forward….and Center

"""Help! Somebody call an ambulance! But not for me."" - Evan Mobley"
"At the end of the season, someone should make a compilation of guards being excited when they switch onto Evan Mobley, only to be shocked when Mobley keeps up with them and blocks their shot at the rim. Dame was his latest victim and it'll never get old!  Also, Jarrett Allen better be an all star this year."
"Evan Mobley, Jarret Allen, Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Dylan Windler, Issac Okoro, and Cedi Osman (For now)."
Evan Mobley is a good defender.
How many wins would this all-rookie starting 5 lineup get?  * PG) Josh Giddey * SG) Chris Duarte * SF) Scottie Barnes * PF) Franz Wagner * C) Evan Mobley
"I saw someone calling Evan Mobley ""Evan Garnett"" the other day and that really tickled me.  When Matthew Dellavedova was here, Outback Jesus was a pretty good name.  Of course there's Sexland for Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  There's been the name floating around for our trio of 7-footers (Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, Lauri Markkanen) of ""Tower City"" because there's an area in Cleveland called the Tower City Center. Though personally, as a Kent State alum, I'm hoping to get the name ""Tri-Towers"" going because those were the dorms I lived in."
"IMO it should go: 1) Scottie Barnes, 2) Franz Wagner, 3) Chris Duarte, 4) Evan Mobley, 5) Jalen Green"
"They plan to keep him, anything short of a superstar center or maybe Evan mobley"
Josh Giddey Jalen Green Scottie Barnes Franz Wagner Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley does it on both ends and he has far more consistent
Evan Mobley is the best rookie in this class.
"It doesn’t matter what type of player Cunningham develops into, missing out on Evan Mobley when he’s this level of defender this early makes him already a cursed selection like Darko was."
"Evan Mobley looked really rough in the preseason and then suddenly he was fine.  Just stay patient everyone, let’s be adults about this."
Evan Mobley is a beast and I’m excited.
"About what I expected, maybe a little better but hard to tell because it’s so early.   Evan Mobley is gonna be nice. Especially if he can bulk up a little."
"&gt;Again, big men take longer to develop.   This isn’t actually true and is really just something fans tell themselves to cope. Most of the time star big men are at least starter level players in their rookie season if not borderline all stars. See Tim Duncan, AD, Embiid, Towns and more recently Zion and Evan Mobley. I’m not saying it’s impossible to have a Giannis-like trajectory, just thats it’s incredibly unlikely.  &gt;The point was to say that your logic of using his injury prone status against him is stupid because he's only 1 season into his career. using that logic you also wouldn't have redrafted Curry in the top 5 if you were asked to redraft the 2009 class in like 2011  But dude, my criticism of him isn’t *only* that he’s injury prone. It’s that he’s injury prone in addition to being a very bad player.   I wouldn’t use that logic since Steph actually showed that he was a legitimate good player during his first 2 seasons. It’s a completely false comparison because Steph already *proved he was a good player* during that stretch prior to his injuries.  If Wiseman came out during his rookie season and put up 18/8 with good defence, and then proceeded to get injured your comparison would make sense. You’re using the Steph comparison as a “gotcha” when they’re not at all similar situations. Surely you can see the difference between playing well and being injury prone and playing shit and being injury prone."
I had money on OG for MIP and Evan Mobley for ROY. I just need Scottie to start fucking up.
Evan Mobley
Damn someone let Evan Mobley know he only had 4 more years to get better
Evan Allen  Jarrett Mobley
Excited that Mobley is playing well but as a cavs fan I am hoping his performances stay under the radar.   He’s a few 20 pieces away from every other headline about us reading “will Evan Mobley refuse cavs rookie extension and seek trade to *insert big market* ”
Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley
"His numbers this year are because of minutes. He's playing under 21 minutes a game, and his per/36es are 17 and 13.  Cleveland is sneaky good this year, and has good big-man depth with Evan Mobley, Lauri Markinnen and Jarret Allen - so it's not like Love necessarily SHOULD be playing a lot more minutes or him getting that few minutes is because he's bad.   He's also 33, which for most players is WELL into their declining years."
1. Scottie Barnes 2. Evan Mobley 3. Chris Duarte 4. Josh Giddey 5. Jalen Green
"Sure, but just as much as he’s played brilliantly he’s also had games with staggering inefficiency. That 19 ppg may go down and become more inefficient or it may go up and become more efficient.   I have no issue with calling the Lakers a super team. However, as with many things in the league, it’s a bit too early to craft narratives/create labels after just 6-7 games (minus the narrative that Evan Mobley will become the GOAT of course)"
Evan Mobley would like a word
scottie barnes and evan mobley are both already better than jaren lmao
"I didn’t see the game but the numbers look odd. Was it a recency bias-the starters weren’t the squad that put you ahead so JB went with the bench? Doesn’t make sense having Sexton at 18mins. Though seeing the high minutes Raptors coach is playing the starters, it will probably go well for Those guys to play less. Still, you can’t really play tomorrow’s games today.   I liked Garland’s pairing with Mobley yesterday. Did the Suns shut that down today or was it just a cold one for Evan?"
Evan Mobley
Rough game but still think Evan Mobley is going to win Roty. He is already legit
Evan Mobley is the Man
evan mobley would never
Is evan mobley really a dark horse ROTY contender? He was the third overall pick and the first pick hasn’t even played yet.
"I don’t get the big playmaker hype. The best big playmaker in the league is Jokic, and every big playmaker prospect drafted is more like Ben Simmons i.e. athletic wing/big PG playmaker. Those players have been useful in today’s league but none have impacted the game like a playmaking BIG (as in Jokic).   Obviously tall PG’s have been incredibly useful over the history of the league (Magic, Kidd, Penny, etc) but in today’s league we’ve seen that the most useful guards are quick and great shooters (Trae, Steph, etc). Simmons and Ball seem to be the only big playmaker that’s payed off in recent memory, and even then neither of those players could carry an offense as well as a guard like say Fox.   If you have the #1 overall pick and you have potential #1 options like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley that look more like other top options the league has had recently. Time will tell if Cade can be that type of player but just off of past looks I gotta agree with others here that the Pistons should’ve took risks on either Green or Mobley."
"no no no no. It's Austin ""Mr. Cavalier"" Carr and then Evan Mobley."

"Man we went to the cavs-nugs game the other night and it was sooooo much fun watching both those teams. It was awesome listening to people heckle k-love, then watch him hit all those jumpers. Evan Mobley moves around like a beast, opens up so much for the cavs on the floor. Jared Allen just being such a powerful force around the rim on both sides. And the guards, just so athletic and fun to watch on tv and 100% worth the price of admission."
"I, too, would like one Evan Mobley"
People are too focused on the scheme teams are running lol This was literally when Cavaliers took Evan Mobley off the floor
I'm glad we have Evan Mobley and Darius Garland
Evan Mobley is so good. He’s gonna be really fun to watch in a year or two
Evan Mobley is the light skinned / right handed Chris Bosh
Evan Mobley is going the best player on the Cavs in 2 years
"I like Evan Mobley, he's also on two of my fantasy teams so him playing well + Lakers win feels like two wins tonight"
EVAN MOBLEY IS DIFFERENT
I JUST WANNA SAY EVAN MOBLEY
"I like Evan Mobley. I like watching the Cavs play intense basketball teams against good teams again. I don't like whatever Lamar Stevens was doing on offense tonight, I missed Okoro.  Garland gave the Cavs the lead with 7:51 left in the 4th and after that the Lakers absolutely took over that game like a championship level team should. It wasn't pretty, but Lakers fans should be happy with how they closed that out.  I wanted the win, but I'm glad this team finally has an identity. They're young and I think they learned a lot from this one."

here to watch Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley is that deal my god I was way too low on him
Friendly reminder Evan Mobley should have been the first pick this year. That is all.
The common answer would probably be a 6'1 or shorter rookie or a bum that barely anyone knows but for this im gonna pick some actual good actual good player  * Joe Ingles * Evan Mobley  * Duncan Robinson * Tim Hardaway
"&gt;Evan Mobley otoh absolutely should have been the #1 pick  Yeah man that kid is blessed with all that size, athleticism, and talent. I know it's a guard league but he's gonna give a lot of people hell during his career."
Somebody get Nick Chubb and Evan Mobley in a commercial together
He also had Evan Mobley on him.
"Let's see..Evan Mobley is the real deal, Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley as a back court means that literally 75% of the League don't even have the bigs to guard both of them. Ricky Rubio and Darius Garland mean that they have a consistent floor general almost every minute of the game, Stevens is an underrated defender and they have serious depth too. Cedi, Okoro, Markkanen, Kevin Love, oh and Colin Sexton who's not even healthy.   I'd view this team as a first round exit but a legit playoff team via the play-in tournament. Maybe they play in the tourney and get knocked out or maybe they make the first round, that's probably their ceiling right now but in 2-3 years once the right roster gets built up and Evan Mobley really gets into his bag, it's going to be disgusting."
Ahem  Evan Mobley
"Witness the greatness of the King, Evan Mobley"
"CJ Stroud, Evan Mobley, and Chunt are my religion"
Evan Mobley is a franchise player. But the Cavs are not good lol
"Loved it! Cavs know how to comeback!! Garland was the key holding the team in the first two quarters. Evan Mobley is a monster on the defense side but look at those crunch numbers. Rubio has a good connection with Allen and Mobley, he fed them and they delivered. Amazing game, really fun to watch, cant imagine from the arena  Edit: Garland is a top player! That dribbling he has… and the confidence to carry the game, to take the hot shots. I’ll watch more cavs games for sure"
"I think Cade and Green are going to ascend next year, or the year after that, while Evan Mobley is a beast right now. ROTY so far by a wide margin."
OH BLOCKED BY MOBLEY! EVAN MOBLEY WITH THE REJECTION!

I want to thank Turkish Lebron for shifting that momentum and Evan Mobley for being a fucking GOD. What a comeback
EVAN MOBLEY IS A BASKETBALL
Evan Mobley plays like a 10 year vet idk how a rookie can look this comfortable in crunch time
Bro Evan Mobley sounds just like Trae
I don't want to overreact but Evan Mobley is basically Giannis and KD combined
We scored 38 points in the first half and were down 15+  Then Evan Mobley decided we were gonna win this one
"I'm here for the nightly ""Evan Mobley is Good"" thread! Let's go!"
I’m so jealous of the Cavs and the fact that they have Evan Mobley
Super rookie Evan Mobley dominated that 4th quarter man. I cri :')
Evan Mobley is going to be real special.
My favourite win of the whole season. Hope anyone tuning in had the chance to watch the future MVP in 2022 Evan Mobley.

That's a weird way to spell Evan Mobley
It's this thing my wife tries to make me do to get my mind off Evan Mobley
Hot take but Evan Mobley deserves some consideration. He’s ALMOST single handily changed Cleveland’s defense. Of course playing with Jarrett Allen helps as well. But this dudes versatility is insane honestly I mean as a Rookie PF/C the Cavs are comfortable enough to let him guard PG’s on the perimeter.
Evan Mobley deserves more consideration than I would’ve thought possible for a rookie

Whatever allows us to watch more Evan Mobley is fine with me
Evan Mobley vs James Wiseman let's GOOOOOOOOO
"I would have to say either the warriors or the cavs. Since I'm a cavs fan, I'll be biased and tip my hat towards the cavs. Here are my reasons;   1) Evan Mobley has come out of this draft playing at least a year ahead of where I could have believed he would be. He has yet to come into his full potential, but I didn't think he would have been as much of an impact as he has.  2) Darius Garland has improved in all aspects of his game; and seems a lot more confident on the court.   3) Jarret Allen has been a pleasure to watch. I feel like a good center that can play defense is hard to find, and the cavs found him.  4) Ricky Rubio has been playing with a vigor that I've never seen before. His veteran presence has had a huge impact on the team. He's been present for so many clutch plays.   5) Their defense is on a whole new level, and they have been playing so well considering the misfortune they have had with injuries so far. Last year, this team looked lethargic and unmotivated. This year's team is the complete opposite."
Fucking Evan Mobley is the truth man.   Evan/Allen seems like a way better combo then turner/sabonis lol
The Cavs started stronger and tanked into Evan Mobley.
Is Evan Mobley the next Anthony Davis?  Is Evan Mobley the next Tim Duncan?     Is Evan Mobley the next Kevin Garnett?

"In his prime, Russell was 6’10 220-ish, freakishly athletic, with killer focus, and some of the greatest in-game defensive instincts we’ve ever seen.  Evan Mobley is a rookie with a comparable frame to Russell. Mobley is holding his own in the league today. Even in grainy video, we can easily see that Russell was not in any way a substantially lesser athlete than Mobley. It doesn’t matter that Russell was banging for rebounds against “the milk man.” We’re talking raw athleticism here. In 2021, where hyper-athleticism is at such a premium, Russell would not be at the back of the crowd.  So if we were to kidnap Bill Russell from 1964, and suit him up with the Celtics, get him some modern sneakers and let him loose, I feel pretty confident he could stay on the court, at the very least. Maybe he wouldn’t get 45 rebounds in a game or average 20pts, but he could easily be the defensive specialist assigned to KD or Giannis in games…. And absolutely kill it."
Evan Mobley is the best rookie of the 2021 class
Jarrett Allen / Evan Mobley
"Old and busted. Let’s talk about something no one has brought up yet - Who is better, Evan Mobley or Scottie Barnes?"
"Perkins, LOL! However, the first that came to mind: [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/anthony-davis-compares-cavaliers-rookie-evan-mobley-to-his-younger-self-hes-going-to-keep-getting-better/amp/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/anthony-davis-compares-cavaliers-rookie-evan-mobley-to-his-younger-self-hes-going-to-keep-getting-better/amp/)"
"I wish we had the 2nd pick a year later lol. Imagine Evan Mobley on this Warriors team, whose floor looks like it'll be Clint Capela. His ceiling is the roof"
20 points on 18 shots is bad efficiency but that’s besides the point lol. He’s a rookie and is improving. Just saying you’re generalizing all Raptors fans based off one person. I can assure you we don’t want any rookies to burn in hell lmao. If you look at almost every Evan Mobley post there are raptors fans gushing over him.
"Playing for wins against tanking teams last year in an effort to establish a ""winning culture"" screwed us for the draft (thanks Gerson...you couldn't at least have done a pick swap instead of sending a 1st and Wigs for D'lo?) and probably f-ed our timing with Ant.  Put Evan Mobley on this team and maybe you have something. I love KAT, but it's time to move on if they can get some decent assets (a couple of young and decent players - Allen and Garland? and pick or pick swap) and tank the rest of the year playing the kids (Ant, JMac, Bolmero, Jaylen Nowell \[why can't this guy get any run?\]) for the homegrown (rhymes with Holmgren) savior."
"Fun fact, Ant is actually younger than Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes"
Evan Mobley is already a top 10 PF in the league.
"I had three separate panic attacks during this game. 11/10 gg Cavs holy fuck. Game for the ages  Ninja edit: Evan Mobley is already giving me fits, this guy’s gonna be special"
honestly it's been a loooong time since I've been able to watch a Cavs game and just be happy with what i'm watching. God bless Evan Mobley
T MOBILE EVAN MOBLEY  Edit: Also your list is trash OP
"Evan Mobley, hes a better defender and a better playmaker by a a great margin"
"Smoke that chet holmgren packkkk babyyyyyy.  In all honesty, i really wanted Evan Mobley to end up in Charlotte."
"Ok that makes a lot more sense and it looks like you’ve edited the OP to reflect that.   I think my answer is Jarrett Allen.  To start with I wouldn’t consider any player over age 25 who isn’t an established star and those answers are all pretty boring.   Jarrett Allen is only 23 and has already demonstrated competency as a defensive anchor at the Center position.   Allen’s great rebounding ability, both offensive and defensive, low foul rate, great efficiency around the rim, and lack of injury history are all major selling points.   The biggest question marks/downsides for Allen are his passing ability and FT shooting.   Adding on to the lack of offensive upside for Allen is the question of whether he’s even better, right now, than his rookie teammate, Evan Mobley."
"I feel like this happens where guys expected to be good aren't and vice versa. Like Evan Mobley. Everyone thought he needed a year or two, he's been a surprise"
This question makes absolutely no sense. You have to eliminate rookies from the player pool or the answer will always be Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley.
Everyone’s just going to say Evan Mobley or Scottie Barnes
Cole Anthony / Evan Mobley / Gary Trent Jr
Two more for you:  https://twitter.com/DraftDummies/status/1416198093180076038/photo/1  Sam Vecenie in March:  https://theathletic.com/2439213/2021/03/16/2021-nba-mock-draft-3-0-evan-mobley-moves-up-ziaire-williams-falls-plus-coach-and-scout-breakdowns/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=2021  If it was clear as you say then you'd find zero sources. Its ok to admit that you didn't realize that so many people valued Suggs high early on during the college season
Evan Mobley 52%   Scottie Barnes 52%  Franz Wagner 47%   Alperen Sengun 47%  Chris Durate 45%
"I was terribly wrong about Evan Mobley, and I was also terribly wrong about Lamelo and Franz Wagner.   I should stop being so sure that certain players won't pan out."
"You just gotta ignore this sub with prospects, nobody watches college basketball or film. All the draft people had him in the top tier with Cade and Green, [and some were very high on him.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/13/22226644/2021-nba-draft-evan-mobley-usc)"
Evan Mobley gonna get lebron that 5th ring
"Warriors and Cavs, which is a very hot take  Warriors to top the conference at 63-19, Cavs at 55-27. They meet in the finals for the 5th time in 8 years, where Evan Mobley carries them to 2 wins however the Warriors win in 6 with a healthy Steph and Klay"
"We didn’t draft friggin Haliburton! Ball wasn’t miles away the better prospect it was a hot debate. Even closer than arguing Jalen Green and Evan Mobley as prospects. We took the same level of prospect and a way better fit. I don’t think Jerry West would literally waste a pick on a backup, taking a risk that he may never be able to shoot nor defend."
Wiseman and Kuminga still need time to develop and Moody plays basically the same position as Duarte. If you’re willing to give these guys some time I think they’ll all be rotation pieces. I’m still hoping Wiseman is going to be the next great American big man but that might just be Evan Mobley instead.
I think you’re forgetting about Evan Mobley and Ricky Rubio . Cavs are a lock.
Evan Mobley.
"cavs move the ball so much better  there’s multiple possessions every 4th quarter where collin will pound the ball for 12 seconds straight. he looks to pass more than he used to, but he’s still straight up not good at it. he hardly ever passes anybody open, he uses the pass after 3 different scoring methods. Garland and rubio are both top 10 in the entire league for assists and evan mobley gets more assists than sexton. collin just passes as a last resort so that’s why he’s passes aren’t quality.   sexton’s shooting this year has also not been good enough to play over rubio. he’s at 27 percent and his small size and the hitch in his jumper makes his pull-up so iffy. he’s shooting 54% from 2p% which is significantly higher than his career average, if that can’t be sustained, that’s another element to it   he averaged 6.5 FTA last year and now he’s halved that, he’s not able to get all those easy points due to rule changes and role changes. if he can’t get his free throws back up, his rep as an efficient scorer is in trouble  what playoff team starts a shooting guard that has more turnovers than assists every game?   lastly, this team belongs to Evan Mobley. everything about the roster needs to be about maximizing the fit around Mobley. we do not need a guard who is a below league average shooter, is weak as can be in the PnR, and cannot switch onto anybody on defense without being a total liability. we need switchable guards who shoot the ball and be secondary playmakers (Jute Holliday)  the Nets just drafted Cam Thomas at like pick 28, that’s where you get your guy that was born to get buckets.   cavs defense is improved because while their length is creating so many problems, rubio protects the rim by being one of the premier perimeter defenders in the league. sexton is still bad at defense and he is so bad at working through screens  tl;dr i think rubio is a lot better"
"Did anyone see this coming? It feels like only yesterday the Cavs picked Evan Mobley, traded for Rubio, brought in Markannen, and then we all heard that the roster was going to start with three near 7-footers and thought to ourselves ""no way that'll work."" The [preseason power ranker predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qcvtja/202122_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) did not. No one thought Mobley would be a ROY candidate, JA might be a MIP candidate given the way things are going, and no one put them down for most surprising team. They're definitely surprising us now.  Tricky Ricky's playing better than ever (having so many roll threats must be a dream scenario for him), Mobley was amazing right out of the gate, Jarrett Allen has exceeded expectations, and Lauri provides spacing (I guess).  I do worry a little about depth. Sexton's about to be out, which could be withstood by moving up Ricky or playing D. Wade. Love has only played a little. Markannen is also temporarily out. Windler, the other D. Wade, and Lamar Stevens seem like decent depth, and JA/Mobley are more than enough to cover for Markannen's temporary absence. However, losing either JA or Mobley would be huge hit to the rim protection and defense, kind of like if we lost Rudy, so I'm going to hope they both stay healthy for the whole season."
"Based on what i saw last night, absolutely. This team shot the lights out and then dunked it down our throats when we tried to double the perimeter players. Also let me jump on the bandwagon before it leaves the station, Evan Mobley is a problem."
But but Evan Mobley is a bust based on summer league!
Evan Mobley/Scottie Barnes  \*gap\*  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Everyone else
Evan Mobley can’t win rookie of the year because he plays like an 11 year veteran.
Evan Mobley is clearly a center.
Evan Mobley with the +26 is nuts
Well you are wrong. Everyone said there were three prospects that would be worthy of the number 1 pick this year and then a drop off after that. I didn’t read one article or watch one YouTube video pre draft saying Mobley was severely flawed.  https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/28/22596835/evan-mobley-nba-draft-2021   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/13/22226644/2021-nba-draft-evan-mobley-usc   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2021-nba-draft-potential-no-1-pick-evan-mobley-a-7-foot-wing-who-could-change-how-we-think-about-big-men/   https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/31269680/southern-cal-freshman-center-evan-mobley-declares-2021-nba-draft  Probably read 20 draft profiles on him worst thing I read was he was too skinny   Thread on Cavs Reddit sub saying we better not pass him up:  https://www.np.reddit.com/r/clevelandcavs/comments/opmpyp/tjarks_evan_mobley_is_the_biggest_prize_in_the/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Evan Mobley and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Ricky Rubio gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Mobley hit the locker room door, former NBA great LeBron James hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Evan Mobley.   On the other side, Dame has been atrocious to start the season."
You misspelled Evan Mobley.
how many wins can this lineup get?  pg: Kevin love  sg: Evan Mobley  sg: Jared allen  pf: Chet Holmgren  center: Victor Wembanyama.
"I wouldn't be surprised if Cleveland somehow win the lottery in 2022 &amp; 2023 then draft both of these guys lol.  The Triple Towers: Evan Mobley, Chet Holmgren &amp; Victor Wembanyama.  With ""Sexland"" &amp; ""The Triple Towers"", the Cavs might be on the verge of a dynasty."
Thats future ROY Evan Mobley to yall
Can we wait and see what evan mobley looks like after actually playing a chunk of nba games before we start discussing roster fits?
How is Evan Mobley gonna play full time center in the nba at 215 lbs?
I am here to slander Evan Mobley. Please come back to these comments in five years.   Evan Mobley is a homeless man's Chris Bosh.
I'll take him on the Cavs. Would fit our tall-ball lineup too:  PG: Bol Bol  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Evan Mobley  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Tacko Fall
The faith in this being the year JJJ breaks through is interesting. I hope its true.  Some big love for Evan Mobley as well.  Nothing else really surprised me but thank god they also agree that the current officiating of transition fouls is the stupidest rule that needs changing.
"I really hope the cavs are good enough for people to watch and realize  * Garland is not a combo guard he is a PG, he broke out near the end of his rookie year and continued that into last year, he and Sexton only 'overlap' in height * Sexton is a SG, he averaged 24 ppg last year, he is not a combo guard * Evan Mobley is not a C, he's closer to a SF than a C right now esp on defense * Lauri Markenen is a stretch PF, ask Bulls fans he doesn't play like he's 7ft  Koby has done a fantastic job with a bad situation, he's the best cavalier GM of my lifetime (going back to Wayne Embry)  The Cavs Vets have been the biggest issue, not his young core, I highly highly doubt he gets fired even if the Cavs win ~25 games again"

I’m betting on Evan Mobley

Chris Duarte I think this draft could be very deep with good/solid players. Mobley looks like the next great big in this league I think he can be elite in 5-6 years. Cunningham will be a perennial all-star. Suggs will be a
Sorry for all the teams not drafting Evan Mobley
"1) Jalen Green 2) Jalen Suggs 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Johnathan Kuminga 5) Ziaire Williams 6) Evan Mobley 7) Jalen Johnson 8) Alperun Sengun 9) Josh Christopher 10) James Bouknight/Joshua Primo  I think this is a crazy deep Draft but kinda top heavy with Bust Potential. Not to say all those guys will Bust just that they could, so I'll bet on these guys."

"[callmearookie] League sources view Evan Mobley as an ""essential lock"" to Clevaland at No. 3."
The GSW will end up with Evan Mobley.
"Damn you got us lol.  Guess I'll just have to settle for Evan ""will willingly shoot a jump shot"" Mobley"
"&gt;With less than 24 hours until Detroit is on the clock, the expectation here remains the same: that the Pistons end the suspense and take Cunningham. But no part of this decision process has been easy for them. There has been real disagreement within the Pistons’ braintrust surrounding which player to select, league sources say. Detroit always viewed the top pick as a three-player conversation that included Evan Mobley and Jalen Green. There’s still some uncertainty over which of Mobley and Green had more traction internally, but the strong feeling among rival teams is that Detroit has had a legitimate, prolonged decision process."
Then we get Evan Mobley who has the highest ceiling in this draft  Suggs is your typical best player out of the gate and could get better type  Mobley is your build a goat if you invest in him type
People who ask this question have not looked up a single video on Evan Mobley
"They probably plan on throwing a big bag at Allen and will use high draft capital on another big man, Evan Mobley. While he's a nice guy, they don't need Nance's contract on the books and need to free up minutes. If he can stay healthy, he's a nice rotational big for $10M a year."
"Watch a video on Evan Mobley, he’s not a traditional center, play more like a 7ft wing with great rim protection skills.  The Cavs can actually fit together really nicely with him because Larry Nance has been playing more and more like a larger wing, getting his 3p% up.  Larry had really high steals and deflections last year.  With Evan, the Cavs get a really big front court that can still move pretty quick.  It’s exciting!  I don’t think the Cavs will go out of their way to lose Allen but they could honestly just lose him in free agency.  He could be much more expensive than the Cavs want to pay and someone might pay him still."
"I think a lot of people get hung up on age when I personally focus on how far into their development a prospect is. This might be a really hot take, but I think Duarte has a chance to be top 10 in this class. Duarte came over from the Dominican Republic and only started playing in the US at 15/16, so he doesn’t have as much experience at a high level as others. Duarte also has improved every single year in college. He was a role player his first year of JUCO, then became the player of the year his second year in the JUCO level. He was fine in his role behind Pritchard last year, then was the 2nd best player in the PAC 12 behind Evan Mobley this year. Also, if you watched Oregon games this year, Duarte could absolutely create his shot and threes off the dribble, while also being a plus passer and defender."
"Yea but Jalen Green and Evan Mobley are both fantastic prospects, they’d both go #1 most years.  Cade said this draft is like 2003. There’s deadass a bunch of HOF talent at the top."
Evan Mobley at #1
"Look at all the trades Sam Presti has made in the last year and a half and try to tell me that he would offer a guy who averaged 25, 6, 5 plus this year's draft pick for Evan Mobley. Come on. I get offering SGA for #3 straight up. That is still an overpay for #3, but an additional lottery pick on top of that is crazy. No way the cavs would say no to that. SGA averaged 25 ppg."
"For Cade I'd get it.  For Jaylen Green, maybe.  For Evan Mobley.  That's insane."
"maybe, If I were you I'd let us select Evan Mobley tho just sayin."
Evan Mobley
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can’t take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that’s better than all those all stars lol"
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."

I want Evan Mobley   But my team is destined for Suggs
What’s funny is there was just a report that he is “intrigued” in rolling out a Jarret Allen &amp; Evan Mobley front court.   Pretty disappointed he is the guy leading the Cavs tbh
"It remains to be seen whether Houston will take the risk of choosing him anyway.  In the past, we have seen players go to the clash.  Nevertheless, I don't see Evan Mobley doing that in case the Rockets would select him."
"Makes sense. Christian Wood and Evan Mobley too redundant, so playing time would be a premium."
Drafting Evan Mobley is what the Cavs are doing.  How has Vuc worked out for you?
"""League sources have indicated there is a level of disinterest within Houston regarding Evan Mobley."""
You're dissapointed with a 20 year old averaging 17/6 and whos shown a great awareness of the floor despite only playing half of an NBA season?  I for one am very happy with KPJ and I feel he will develop into a great 2nd star  Also why is everyone acting like we think KPJ is gonna be the franchise cornerstone lol. Thats obviously gonna be Jalen Green or Evan Mobley
"""League sources have indicated there is a level of disinterest within Evan Mobley’s camp regarding Houston as a destination, raising questions as to whether that potential marriage would be ideal for either side. Rival teams do not expect Mobley, Jalen Suggs or Cade Cunningham to work out for Houston before draft night."""
Somehow i feel like Evan Mobley is the best player in that draft.. he looks really good.
I think evan mobley deserves serious consideration and if im calling my shot he has a better nba career than cunningham
Who has the better resume Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley? In my opinion Mobley because he lost to Gonzaga
"I know people are penciling Cade in as the de facto #1 but am I alone in not being  super impressed with him? I get it. He’s versatile, good size for the position, can pass, and seems to be a good character guy. But to me he doesn’t seem to do anything GREAT and it’s scary to have a player that seems like a Jack-of-all trades as your franchise cornerstone.  His game reminds me a lot of Lamar Odom which is a good and bad thing depending on how you look at it.  Jalen Green on the other hand is a bonafide elite athlete and scorer. You know pretty much what you’re going to get from him and his potential career path. Even Evan Mobley is a foundational defensive big with the ability to stretch the floor. To me these are better building blocks for a franchise as you have a concrete plan on how to develop and build around them."
"I have a feeling Evan Mobley will be the best player in this draft, at least in close future."
Are we sure about that if they trade down? Jalen Green and Evan Mobley are going to be great players too.
"How does no illegal defense favor 1 on 1 play? Having illegal defense forces teams to respect isolations despite non shooters spacing the court.  And you say international teams get to play a full zone as if the NBA can’t? Removing the illegal defense rules is specifically what allows zone defense. The effectiveness of that zone defense is what led to the increase in 3s to combat the paint denial. The def 3 second really is NOT pulling that much weight here. If a big is parked in the paint in this coveted “full zone” of yours, and a team calls for a high ball screen, and the big just stays there because it’s zone, it still functions the same as drop coverage, and the ball handler shoots a three or a pull up mid range off of the screen. His defender can fight over it all he wants, he still gets caught enough times that with no help, it’s a losing proposition.  This zone praise doesn’t account for when a team can run 5 out like the Clippers did to the Jazz either. Your favorite international center can sit in the paint for the whole shot clock if they so please, and that won’t stop Terrence Mann or whoever from shooting open corner 3s if they keep swinging the ball and penetrate with space.  Blaming it ALL on the rules and acting as if player skill sets haven’t changed is a bit shortsighted. Especially since you treat it as if this other rule set is objectively better.  Lastly, why would the NBA “take a long hard look at itself” over this? If you could measure one playstyle vs the other in terms of revenue, I promise some Olympic result isn’t going to make the nba choose the one making the less money. It matters 0. The same goes for the players. Sure, they’d love to win for their country, but they’d also prefer 100 million dollars to that gold medal, so whatever increases the value of the next CBA they are okay with. It is a business.  Also, America has “reaped what it’s sown” lmao, as if Anthony Davis, Jaren Jackson Jr, Marvin Bagley, James Wiseman, and Evan Mobley haven’t all been quality big men in the pipeline. That’s not to mention all of the quality international big men that have become so good and are considered superstars because they’re thriving AS big men…..in the current NBA ruleset lmao. Not sure what you’re on about. The USA Team lost this last game because it couldn’t hit its shots to close the game out, but make no mistake, they were open shots. The defense wasn’t so special that it stopped the goal of the offense."
"Yup that’s what made the Redeem team great with all the young talent ready to show the world what they could do. Hell I wouldn’t have even minded if they threw in guys like Cade, Suggs, or Evan Mobley or someone like that. I completely agree though we need fresh blood the team is too complacent now."
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De’Aron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
I think Ayton and hopefully Evan Mobley will fill that role in the future
Most big prospects are also not nearly as hyped as Evan Mobley.
"This team is so poorly constructed it’s ridiculous. We literally threw out a bunch of iso scorers and said “lets play Moreyball” without any of the chance creations from a Harden or CP. Dame, KD, and Tatum are a great foundation and core to build the squad around. Now you’d need to invite guys who complement their abilities. Draymond is a good pick up. Jrue is a good pick up. But having Lavine, Book, and KLove for that stint would never fit. None of those guys are positives on the defensive side. None of them are great off ball guys. Hell Book and Lavine need the ball in order to look as good as they do. And as good as they are they aren’t in the same tier as Dame, KD, or Tatum. Adebayo is undersized yes but his defense and athleticism should translate well. Myles Turner being hurt didn’t help with the back up big pick. Just thinking outside the box, would Evan Mobley be a plus contributor? His role would be small and all he’d have to do is play hard for the minutes he’d get. Although he may not have wanted to play out of fear of ruining his draft stock maybe. Jaren Jackson Jr.? Im spit balling but you get the point. We’ll probably win gold but looking into 2024, we might not be fielding the best team in the world anymore"
"Ok then, look at the top of this draft, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson, and Evan Mobley are all good-to-great passers."
Wait K Love is not even there?? Lmao.   Should have been Jarett Allen. Or even Evan Mobley... though if I’m a projected high draft pick I wouldn’t risk it tbh.
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De’Andre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)  Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"

Evan Mobley pls be good lmao
Evan Mobley for one
"Myles Turner, Dwight. You’re right the it’s very weak. Until Chet Holmgren and Evan Mobley get older."
"I feel like better American centers are young: Chet Holmgren, Evan Mobley, types. Myles Tuner, Dwight Howard l, Jarrett Allen, Bam, Plumlee I guess.   Definitely the weakest position for the U.S."
"Exactly. I'm hearing the same thing from Cavs media right now in regards to Jalen Green vs Evan Mobley. If the team believes both have similar outcomes then the guy they need is a long-term center (pretend J Allen doesn't exist).  But if they believe Jalen Green is significantly better, then fuck it, get him and figure it out (as they are rumoured to be doing by trying to trade Sexton)"
"He’s a big who can create his own shot off the dribble. Yes, Mobley [is a very good prospect. ](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/13/22226644/2021-nba-draft-evan-mobley-usc). He might be the most skilled big man prospect since AD, and is a 7 footer who is agile enough to guard wings and play small while not being small."
Good. We actually did something right. Now let's pick Evan mobley
"I'd also take Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley over Gobert"
[Dammrell] Evan Mobley doesn't think that he would be a good fit alongside Jarrett Allen.

"that's fair, he can stretch the floor a lot. Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen as a twin towers duo is not what I expected though lmao"
Evan Mobley will be a bust
Jalen Green and Evan Mobley will both be better NBA players than Cade when it's all said and done
"- Bouknight will bust  - Sengun will bust unless he’s drafted by the Spurs  - Jared Butler is making an all-rookie team &amp; regarded as the steal of the draft   - Evan Mobley has a disappointing rookie year   - Kai Jones will bust, next Jalen Smith  - Bones Hyland will shoot logo threes   - Cade becomes a top 15 player in the NBA in 4 years   - Jalen Suggs is the second best player in the draft behind Cade  - OKC trades with Cleveland for #3"
"Cade Cunningham will be a role player.  Evan Mobley will be the best player in the draft, with Jalen Green a close second.  Kuminga, Wagner, and Keon Johnson will bust hard."
The Raptors want Evan Mobley
One evan mobley please. He would fit great next to JA. Shores up our interior defense and can get us a bucket.
Evan Mobley
"Jordan Zirm  @JordanZirm  Lots of rumblings around the Cavs and Evan Mobley, for obvious reasons. file this into the ""things I've heard"" category, but it sounds like Mobley had a heck of a workout for them and the Cavs like him *a lot* just over a week to go, folks       Next."

Evan Mobley would be a real win.
The Raptors were primarily searching for front court help at the trade deadline. Andre Drummond was a name that Toronto chased back to his Detroit days. I think Toronto’s dream outcome is coming away with Evan Mobley.
"Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley are top two for sure, with some cool G-League players like Jalen Green"
"You’re massively underestimating the lack of give-a-fuck among NBA players. You don’t think a team with players like Cade Cunningham, Jalens Suggs and Green, Lamelo Ball, Evan Mobley, James Wiseman level players would win every game by 20? France, Australia, Canada etc have NBA-caliber players in the starting lineup. USA at any level has NBA-caliber players at the end of the bench. Give these kids a chance who haven’t won anything of note to compete on the world stage as Olympians and you’ll see something special"
I will take one Cade Cunningham pls  Or one Evan Mobley if you're out of those
Evan Mobley?

"I'd personally like to see Charlotte move up again, not like there's any bias or anything. No bias at all. *Quickly removes user flair*.  In all seriousness, I would like to see Charlotte move up to get Evan Mobley or Jalen Green, or use the pick in a package for another solid star.  Also, someone give Detroit the first pick. They deserve it, and if I see KrispyFlakes go another year pissed off at the draft..."

"I'd say he is close to the prototypical modern NBA center defensively, as he can guard bigs and also hold his own when switched onto a perimeter player.  But yeah, when you think of a ""modern"" NBA center you usually think of a guy who can hit 3s.  Not that Ayton really needs to do that in his role - if he could hit 3s consistently he'd probably be a top 20 player in the league lol  I'm excited for the day where a quick footed 7 footer who can guard on the perimeter and also hit 3s comes into the league.  Someone like AD but with a better 3PT shot.  They will break the league and ruin small ball.  Evan Mobley from USC could be that guy but I'm not sure if he'll develop a consistent 3"
"Evan Mobley could be there at 4. Cade, Suggs, Green could go 1-3."
"This is brilliant by Presti not just bc of the obvious plethora of picks, but bc he’s on pace to do what most tanking rock bottom teams havent: limit how long they have been terrible.  Much of this is due to CP3 miraculously having OKC good last year. The other part is Shai being so good. Bc of those 2 things, it’s very possible this past year will be the only year OKC is a sub 30 win team. So you have all those picks, mortgage sale, and still field a good squad. Compare that to the process Sixers they were rock bottom for lile 5 years.   Also it helps that the league is so young and young players come in ready.   But just imagine OKC gets 2 top 5 picks. Let’s say Evan Moboey and Jalen Green.   Kemba - Shai- Jalen Green- Mobley  I mean Luka Doncic is 22 and a 2-time all first team nba guy. It’s a young man’s league it wouldn’t surprise me at all if OKC is a 35 win team"
"i had this hot take since that draft, but honestly, no. if Zion can overcome his injury issues he has the potential to be one of the best players of all time. that is a big ""if,"" but when you have the #1 pick, you swing for the fences.

Who would have thought Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes are better scorers than Jalen Green lmao
"He literaly just turned 20 2 months ago. He’s younger then Jalen Suggs and Evan Mobley. No, it is not"
Evan Mobley posted 13/7/1 on 4/24 shooting and 45% from the free throw line tonight.
watch Evan mobley lock up AD

Evan Mobley will make the all-defensive team
Evan Mobley ROTY when Cavs secure that 8 seed over other favorites for it
Give me Evan Mobley
Its early but I already value Evan Mobley. He upgraded this team as a 20 y old rookie
"Cavs fans really hate to praise any other rookie. Screw Cavs fans and Dan Gilbert, but good luck to Evan Mobley and Evan Mobley alone."
"Evan Mobley is deceptively quick and crafty, a true coach's son."
Our best player is either Evan Mobley or Jarrett Allen
Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
"evan mobley is my favorite player since steph curry, thank the lottery gods for this one"
Evan Mobley is the best player from the draft.
EVAN MOBLEY: +300 Rookie of the year  10 bucks win you 30. I'd give that a shot if I could.

I mean if that were true wouldn't all the prospects that came from the g league be playing better than all those who didn't?    Who looks better between Jalen Greene and Evan Mobley? 🤷
"Evan Mobley is going to be a problem for the rest of the league... The man is legit and looks like a generational type of player.  Yes definitely slightly different timelines, the Warriors are in the middle of Curry's peak, while the Cavs have an upcoming superstar to look forward to."
They have a young team which improved from last year and have who looks to be the ROY in Evan Mobley. I think they’ll make it
Hot Take: Evan Mobley
