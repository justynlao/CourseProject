"Lmao Dame 3rd best player last season was Whiteside. Jaylen Hoard, Wenyen Gabriel, Mario Hezonja, Anthony Tolliver, and Caleb Swanigan were all playing real minutes. Now, this year all 4 of our starters have missed games so far."
Willy Hernangomez and Wenyen Gabriel aka Quadruple U
"Yeah I wanted to comment that, he was technically born in Maine but grew up in NH. Him and Wenyen Gabriel were both born out of state, but grew up in NH. So we claim them."
RoCo getting burned by LeBron is a step up from Wenyen Gabriel/Melo getting burned by LeBron.  Here‚Äôs to us taking it to 6!
"also last years team was playing Mario Herzonja, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swannigan as rotation players"
"I‚Äôve been saying it for a while. Dame has saved Stotts job a few times. Every time his late season heroics dragged the blazers to the playoffs. Plus Dame seems to love him, and the franchise player gets what he wants.   But I don‚Äôt really blame Stotts for the 2 center lineup in the playoffs. All of the forwards were injured. The blazers only had 6 guys that I consider rotation quality. 2 centers was better than playing Wenyen Gabriel and Hezonja."
"RoCo, Steven Adams, Russ, Furkan Korkmaz, Clint Capela.... technically Gerald Green (FOR NOW HOPEFULLY)... Embiid, Wenyen Gabriel, Jeff Green,  K-Love, Ja, Sabonis, KAT... I think that's most of them. No specific reason just dudes I like"
‚ÄúReal backup 3 and 4‚Äù.   I‚Äôd like to see Wenyen ‚Äúbig dick‚Äù Gabriel get a shot.
Can't wait for the Brandon Goodwin vs Wenyen Gabriel matchup tonight üî•üî•
"Yeah he's worse in the playoffs. That's not surprising.   Literally every player that's the only star on their team drops off. Dame reason Harden does  There's only so much you can do **when literal G-league players are starting for your team in the playoffs*  And yes, I'm using literally properly. Go look up Wenyen Gabriel - you know, the guy who has played less than 250 minutes in his entire career who we called up from the G league to start against Anthony Davis"
"Context matters though when assessing hypocrisy though, right? I mean, when people complain about silence from black athletes, I assume that they don't literally mean *all* black athletes, right? People aren't actually upset if Wenyen Gabriel chooses not to speak out on an issue, right? Dude isn't a prominent player and isn't known for making highly publicized statements regarding social justice so I don't think anyone legitimately gives a fuck if he voices his opinion or not.   Instead, I assume that most people that are looking for something are specifically looking for something from prominent player(s) who have made the choice to actively and publicly inject himself/themselves into discussions on social justice issues.  For it to be hypocrisy, you'd need to see people giving a free pass to white players that are in a similar situation. I personally have trouble thinking of who these guys are. Most of the best/most prominent white players are either foreign and don't get into US social issues or they are fairly quiet.  The guys that probably fit the bill the most are actually coaches like Pop and Kerr as opposed to players. For Pop and Kerr though, their comments are normally in response to questions as opposed to proactively putting out tweets. If Pop and Kerr are asked about it and they downplay it or refuse to call it out as racist hatred, I'd expect them to slammed for it, similarly to how they got slammed by many people for the way they responded when asked about Morey/China."

"AD is going to kill anyone they put on him, but there's still grades of difference from a guy like Roco and swapping Melo and Wenyen Gabriel on AD."
"We would have a chance against the Lakers. Clippers would fuck us up though    I know the first comment will be like ""lmao you lost in 5""  But that team was straight dead by the time we made it there and we still pulled off a win because it's a good matchup.   Like people joke about teams having G-leaguers as bench players, but we legitimately **started** a guy that we pulled up from the G-league who has less than 250 minutes played in his entire career (wenyen gabriel). And made him guard AD  Having actual wings to stop LeBron from abusing us (DJJ/RoCo instead of like mario Hezonja and Melo lol) is huge. Plus CJ won't have a broken back and we aren't going to be playing this awful spacing lineup with both Hassan and Nurkic out there at the same time"
So are Hezonja and Wenyen Gabriel. And Hassan is barely hanging on
"Luka easily had a better team around lol. That's insane. We started wenyen fucking gabriel in the playoffs last season   You've probably never heard of him. You know, because he was a rookie we picked up from the G league who has played a grand total of 247 minutes in his entire career  And **we started him against anthony davis in the playoffs**  Meanwhile Luka got injured against the clippers in one game and his team erased a 20 point deficit in one quarter with him on the bench"
Don‚Äôt forget Wenyen Gabriel too.
"Wenyen Gabriel. Played for Kentucky for two years, went undrafted, bounced around for a while on 2-way contracts, signed with the Pels this year."
Wenyen Gabriel for steph
"I mean, we're playing like shit and still winning lol  Also, that Blazers team was crazy injured. We started a literal G-leaguer in Wenyen Gabriel. Dude had played 250 minutes in his entire career"
"I mean, your other options at 4 are like Wenyen Gabriel. Maybe Naji? But with BI out then he‚Äôs probably the 3.  Jax started I think 2 games next to Steve and it was not horrible. Billy / Jax is probably the way to go really"
"Willy Hernangomez, Jaxson Hayes, and Wenyen Gabriel were all so good tonight.  Willy was a difference-maker and just gives the guys an energy boost that I don't think we get all the time."
"Game 7 of the nuggets series? We won the nuggets series in large part because Stotts put Hood and Collins in the starting lineup for games 6 n 7and used ET on Millsap.    Anyone else pull more than a game off the Lakers? We were playing Wenyen Gabriel 10 mins a game lol    New Orleans was bad, that was just rondo and Jrue killing Dame. No excuses but schemes have improved since then, sadly the roster still has holes."
1) Jordan Nwora - Bucks  2) Gorgui Dieng - Spurs  3) Ryan Arcidiacono - Bulls? (not sure if he was traded)  4) Keljin Blevins - not a clue  5) Tyrell Terry - not a clue  6) Brandon Goodwin - Hawks  7) Mo Wagner - Bulls  8) Oshae Brissett - Raptors?  9) Trent Forrest - Heat?  10) Wenyen Gabriel - Heat?
Wenyen Gabriel and Bol Bol are overlapping in Chartum.
Firstly get like 4 rim protectors on the roster - our bigs are always injured except Kanter somehow.   Bring back Wenyen Gabriel.   Try find 1 wing that can play both sides of the ball.
"Kanter was a Celtic last year. We were using Nurk, Hassan Whiteside, and Wenyen Gabriel against the Lakers last year."
We were starting wenyen Gabriel and playing mario hezonja ü§£ü§£
You would trade wenyen gabriel for who on this warriors team? what about mario hezonja? anthony tolliver? It's fine that you didnt watch the blazers last year but dont just say random stuff
"Right, but again last year Wenyen Gabriel was started an entire playoff series, being asked to guard Anthony Davis. And Hezonja also received significant minutes."
Did steph really have worst teammates last year? We were starting Wenyen Gabriel in the playoffs and had a rotation featuring Mario Hezonja and Anthony tolliver for long stretches of the season...
"To me it looks like with a head start, he‚Äôs about as fast Wenyen Gabriel. But it‚Äôs a nice finish."
"Yeah. He really smoked... uh... Wenyen Gabriel, with a two step head start? Insane speed. He‚Äôs gone plaid."
This name belongs to Wenyen Gabriel now
"No way. The Lakers are a good matchup dude  We were just injured like crazy last season. We started a **literal G-league player** in Wenyen Gabriel against Anthony Davis. And not one of these ""lol this dude sucks he should be in the G-league."" A literal G-league call up that had played 250 NBA minutes in his entire career  Not to mention Mario Hezonja being an actual part of the team and us having no wings + and injured CJ"
I like how 3 players just watched him to get to the rim after he got past his man. If you consider Wenyen Gabriel was playing a decent chunk of minutes for the Blazers against the Lakers in the playoffs last year (as did Hassan Whiteside)... it's a miracle the Blazers even took a game.
does anyone remember wenyen gabriel
"PG: Sexton or Lonzo, Kira  SG: NAW, Korkmaz, Didi Louzada  SF: BI, Naji Marshall, Bullock in free agency or Prince in a trade with CLE  PF: Zion, James Johnson, Wenyen Gabriel  C: Adams, Jax   Spots 14 and 15: prob 2 of our 4 second round picks   1. I‚Äôve really been digging the Sexton trade talk. A young guard who plays passionately and scores with great efficiency and actively gives a shit on defense; I‚Äôll take that all day every day. I‚Äôd do Bledsoe, 10 and whatever else Cleveland wants that‚Äôs not the young core.   2. I‚Äôm ready for Nickeil as a full time starter. Between his 15-20 starts last year and where he looked legit great next to Zion and BI (better than ANY other guard on our roster) along with his play in the FIBA Qualifiers for Canada.   3. I‚Äôm looking forward to Willie Green turning Zion and BI into a dynamic duo together rather than a dynamic duo apart (if that makes sense; I think Pels fans can speak to that) + raising defensive intensity   4. Need James Johnson back, he was solid for us and gave us great minutes after the deadline  5. Adams and Jax will be a top 5 Center rotation in the league next season, bet on it.   6. If we re-sign Lonzo, I‚Äôm cool with it too. I truly don‚Äôt see him getting the contract everyone‚Äôs been talking him up for. I also think Lonzo and Sexton could play together, but that‚Äôs expensive for at least one season before Sexton hits RFA."
"He willfully played Bledsoe 30 a night and avoided giving him any sort of criticism pretty much all season. I won‚Äôt ever forget him saying Wenyen Gabriel, some end of the bench rotation player, has room to improve after a good game instead of just congratulating him on it."
did you forget that the GOAT was on his team the second time? or did you also forget that carmelo anthony and a rookie named wenyen gabriel was guarding AD
"I would hate to give him up but if they get a package similar to Anthony Davis, I wouldn't mind the Pelicans giving up Wenyen Gabriel."
"You can't directly combine them, but with foresight you can. This hypothetical below shows the **financial** ability to make this trade, while clearly not factoring in player value.  * **At some point 2 months before the trade deadline:** * *Pels receive expiring F Thad Young and $3M TPE, Spurs receive $17M TPE*  * **At the trade deadline** * *Pels receive G Bradley Beal, Wizards receive Josh Hart, Thad Young, Wenyen Gabriel, 5 1sts*  *** * Beal salary: $34,502,129 * Minimum outgoing to acquire (25% less - $100k): **$27,501,704** * Hart salary: $12,000,000 * Young salary: $14,190,000 * Gabriel salary: $1,762,796 * Pels Outgoing: **$27,762,796**  ***  Obviously the Pelicans aren't getting Bradley Beal, but the financial ability to do something like this. You just need to wait 2 months after acquiring someone with the TPE to aggregate them with Hart."
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernang√≥mez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
"Kings sign Malik Monk.  Kings trade for Bam Adebayo.  Kings trade for Hamidou Diallo.  Bring in Wenyen Gabriel and Isaiah Briscoe.    Fire Walton, hire Calipari."
"thats the question... wenyen gabriel or wes uwundu?   they have the defensive guy usman garuba, yall could take him at 17..."

"Back before Wenyen Gabriel got his 2-way, I met him at this Ice Cream shop when he was still on the Stockton Kings roster and I was like, ""YO! You're Wenyen Gabriel!"" and he was so happy to have a fan and he was like, ""Yo, you know who I am?!"" and he was so happy he bought me my ice cream. It was so crazy because he was like barely making any money on the G-league, I was probably making way more money than him at the time. Now he could buy me. Lmao."
"Kentucky has had its fair share of wash-out and flop one-and-dones over the past decade too - Brandon Knight, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marquis Teague, Archie Goodwin, Trey Lyles, Skal Labissiere, Kevin Knox, Jarred Vanderbilt, Ashton Hagans, Kahlil Whitney. They've had a bunch of guys who left after their Sophomore season that flopped or did nothing in the league too - Aaron Harrison, Andrew Harrison, Dakari Johnson, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Briscoe, Wenyen Gabriel, EJ Montgomery. All of those guys were top 20 HS prospects once upon a time."
Man Wenyen Gabriel had some flashes a couple years ago and seems like a cool dude. Hope he can find a home in the league.
Good guy [Wenyen Gabriel](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/trail-blazers-wenyen-gabriels-uber-good-deed-incredibly-heartwarming)
I remember someone linked that one photo of Wenyen Gabriel in a thread about him and an uber driver
I still remember turning on a bubble scrimmage game to see Wenyen Gabriel killing my team.
"i like wenyen gabriel, hope he finds a place in the NBA"
Why is Wenyen Gabriel not getting more burn? I was disappointed we let him walk because he did a solid job on AD in the bubble. He finished well last season too I thought he might get more mins in preseason at least
Wenyen Gabriel really denied trey and naw that comeback lol
Wenyen Gabriel Blazers jersey.
"I liked Wenyen Gabriel last year, thought he deserved more minutes.  I also loved Rodney Hood, kept believing he'd bounce back every game.  He did not :(  Very happy we picked up Zeller."
"Not even close to the same team. The year we got swept by the pelicans we had just acquired Nurk at the trade deadline, the year against the Lakers, Nurk, Zach Collins missed almost the entire season, no Evan Turner, no Kanter, harkless, aminu, Curry, Layman, added Whiteside, Melo,  Wenyen Gabriel, and were playing Simons and Trent minutes for the first time."
