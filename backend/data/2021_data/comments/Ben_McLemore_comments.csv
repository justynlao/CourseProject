"I was looking for our last one and was shocked to find that Ben McLemore won it in November 2013. Then I saw that the other Western Conference winners for that season were Trey Burke (3x), Nick Calathes, and Gorgui Dieng and that kind of explains things.  Prior to that was Tyreke Evans (2x) in 2009. Boogie didn't win any the next year because Blake Griffin swept all the months. And that's it for Sacramento Kings winners."

"They are legit contenders for the bottom half of the bracket.  After the top-4 teams in the West they have as good a shot as anybody.   Wood *should* be an All-Star (might get snubbed since this is his first year in this role), and all 3 guards (Wall, Dipo, and Gordon) are looking good on both sides of the ball.  They have a ton of defensive wings and their rookies are looking good. Depth is a strength. Last year's 7/8th man, Ben McLemore isn't even seeing minutes despite Silas running 10-man rotations."
Ben McLemore is good free my mans.  Also go Pistons gotta keep the Rox out of the top 4
God the moment you get cooked by fucking Ben McLemore you know it’s time to hang em up
Good post. My favorite was the one where he kept ripping Ben McLemore until the coach took Ben out of the game.
"It's always a gamble.  Norman Powell, Otto Porter Jr,, will Barton, Ben McLemore...etc  Of course, players that are fairly consistent like Drummond will always show up and show up even better in contract years.  Everyone kind of already drafts them already."
"Duncan Robinson, PJ Tucker, Ben McLemore, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, JJ Redick, and basically any 3 and D player. It’s a literal role lmao.  As for stars, Harden in 2019 and 2020 literally shot more 3s than 2s. Another example is Steph, Dame, etc.  Not only that, but the league as a whole is trending towards more 3s and fewer 2s every single season.  There is no good argument for the usage of FG%. Not only is it terrible at measuring actual scoring efficiency, it’s also really redundant.  If you love the FG stat so much, you can just add up 2P and 3P attempts. It requires kindergarten math."
I’m having Ben McLemore flashbacks right now.
KJ McDaniels and Ben McLemore
I want the last shot from Ben McLemore imo. Ever since the bubble his shot has been lethal.
Ben McLemore
"And Some Mock Drafts had players like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Ben McLemore going 1st"
Ben McLemore from Kansas? Some Scouts said He's a Athletic Ray Allen.
literally ben mclemore numbers
"The difference between Simmons and McLemore is that shooting is the only thing MeLemore is better at is shooting while Ben is better at everything else. Only thing I’d completely give  Giannis does that AD can’t even compare to is playmaking. Defense, rebounding are pretty close. I feel like in the playoffs I’d just rather take AD over him"
"Because shooting, and we all know that Ben McLemore is better than Bum Simmons.  Just because Giannis doesn’t average 30 ppg in the playoffs doesn’t mean his impact isn’t superstar level lmao, people see 26.7 ppg and go “not mvp level”."
ben mclemore. His jumpshot is textbook form incredible to watch
I'd add Ben McLemore. His jumper looks beautiful
"so you really think that jeff green, austin rivers, ben mclemore, danuel house, etcetc are better than Jrue Holiday, pLaYoFf RoNdO, Boogie, etc?  &amp;#x200B;  or that harden shoulda been able to do more with an injured russ or an injured cp3? lmao harden did way more for the rockets than AD did for the pelicans"
Ben McLemore dishing?? Ok
Thats what happens when you guard kyle anderson and ben mclemore
Ben McLemore is one of those players where if you knew nothing about the NBA and you watched his highlights you'd think he was a superstar  Same with players like Rudy Gay and Jeff Green
That sounds like Ben McLemore early in his career. Perfect looking jumper that never went in.
"Yeah hardens shooters have always been sub par, ben mclemore is like the only good catch and shooter he’s ever played with, he was too much of a sieve to play much though, and chris Paul was another but his volume was very low. He’s always passed to mediocre three point shooters so it’s going to be insane to see him break down a defense and have kd/joe Harris/kyrie to hit shots"
"Dave Nwba, Sterling Brown and Ben McLemore being a key part of your rotation is probably more damaging than 1 guy not buying in....  Seriously, where the hell did people think the rockets were going with this roster?"
What's a klaw to a TALEN?  Ben McLemore getting PTSD flashbacks
Ben McLemore says hi.
Ben Simmons isnt good enough to get first name treatment. We talkin McLemore?
Same with Wood  Ben Mclemore just played his first game back from COVID last night. He went 5/5 from 3
"Dude they didnt violate the rules. They were exposed to Ben Mclemore as they all got their haircut together. 6ers fans are legit the biggest fucking babies in the league seesh. One game and you have your two best players, a game you CAN STILL WIN."
"Same with: Ben McLemore, Danuel House, Jeff Green"
We’re literally missing our 2nd star.  Ben McLemore and Danuel House are not equivalent to Porzingis
Ben Mclemore hasn’t played at all and he’s our best 3 point shooter
"Silas has been a refreshing head coach. MDA is an offensive genius and one of the greatest coaches of our era, but his strengths were matched with huge weaknesses and I think Silas has been better in that regard.  Take the Kings game we played yesterday as an example. Silas clearly made defensive adjustments at half time, and we came out on lock down defense with Wood in foul trouble. I think the Kings still finished the quarter on a run to keep it close, but just seeing the team make adjustments was rare under MDA. This win was also without James Harden, so he clearly can work with whoever is available (and that's especially important this year).  Offensively, Silas has had better play calls than MDA, and is less reliant on iso plays from James Harden. Like, *way* less reliant, which allows Harden to not be gassed the fuck out in the 4th quarter. In our first game against the Kings, Harden finished the game scoring or assisting on the final 11(?) points. Usually, he's exhausted at this point, and tends to struggle more in the 4th quarter. I think Silas is better about making sure Harden isn't too tired.  I know it's a very small sample size, but this Rockets team has been amazing to watch, and that all starts with Silas. Wood has lived up to the hype and then some, JaeSean Tate has been an underrated UDFA pickup, Nwaba/Wall/Cousins don't look like they're all coming back from injury, and we haven't even had Ben McLemore yet. This team is deep, and Silas has been far from a disappointment has a head coach so far. I was worried since he's a rookie HC, but he's been great."
Dudes wanted Harden to play off ball for PJ Tucker and Ben Mclemore to dribble around and make plays. It’s easy to have total garbage takes on the internet.
"This is why guys like PJ Tucker, Danuel House, Ben Mclemore and Eric Gordon didn't get offended with his comments compared to the new guys John Wall and Boogie Cousins. He gave them everything he could"
"Not really sure what people see in Reddish. I get major Ben McLemore vibes, even though Ben was a better shooter at this point than Reddish."
"Kansas  PG: Devonte’ Graham  SG: Oubre Jr, Ben McLemore  SF: Wiggins, Josh Jackson, Svi  PF: The Morris Twins  C: Embiid  The starters look good, but the bench would be awful. There are also 2 Kansas rookies this year that play PG and Center so they could fill out the roster there, but they’ve mostly just sat on the bench all year."
Turned him into Ben Mclemore
"Ah, the Ben McLemore special"
"prime lebron would have carried those teams to the playoffs. where the fuck were you in 2012 and 2013? lebron would have carried ME to the playoffs. those were actual nba players.   rudy gay, rondo, darren collison, omri casspi, marco bellinelli, seth curry, ben mclemore, willie cauley-stein. those are all functional nba players who can dribble basketballs and tie their shoes. some of them are actually good at basketball. lebron might have gone to the finals with them. you're underrating how absurd he was in his prime. bro he used to jump with his head above the rim and play defense during the regular season and he was just as smart as he is now. it was fucking crazy"
I thought Ben McLemore was going to be a star...
Reminds me of what Ben Mclemore was supposed to be
Ben McLemore
Ben McLemore
"* Apologies for not knowing John Collins' exact stat line off the top of my head, but I think what I said about him being an efficient, positive player who isn't having plays ran for him holds true. * Fair enough, but I did say injuries were an issue.  * Yeah that's not great, gotta concede on that one.  * I think Gallo's slump has a lot to do *with* Trae. He was fantastic on last year's Thunder with CP3. Why? Because CP3 is a natural playmaker who could put Gallo in good positions. This year, 50.4% of Gallo's shots come from catch and shoots. Last year, on the Thunder, it was only 45%. The year before, on the Clippers, 35%. They're using him like Ben McLemore when he's closer to Khris Middleton. Why? Because Trae has the ball so, so much. I know his sample size is small, but the same thing applies to Bogdan: on the Kings, 41% of his field goals came from catch and shoots, in nine games for the Hawks, it's 64%.  * The Bulls starting lineup is second-year Coby White, Lavine, rookie Patrick Williams, Lauri, WCJ. Otto Porter and Lauri have been injured for stretches, and they have no natural playmakers. They've repeatedly lost close games to contenders. Thad Young is the second best player on their team. Their roster talent is nowhere near comparable to y'alls, yet they're playing better. The Hawks are undeniably disappointing relative to the quality of players they've assembled.   As I said, it's not all Trae. Some of it is injuries, some of it is Pierce. But Trae has been this way since college. The ball is always in his hands, you live and die with Trae. And it makes him easy to scheme against. Look at y'alls first game against us (when most of your team was healthy, bar Gallo) and Trae was held to seven points. Why? Because when one guy has the ball, the issues of switching/rotations, tracking ball movement, positional size matchups, etc because less of an issue. That issue is magnified when the one guy who has the ball is a small 6'0"" tall guard. The Hawks should have feasted on the Hornets; we're a team that can't defend the three, has no inside presence (Capela had 19 rebounds), and a very weak bench. But if you stop Trae, you stop the Hawks, and we did it fairly effectively twice, despite missing Zeller and Devonte being in poor form."
Harden made Ben „out of the league“ McLemore and Danuel House looking like solid players
Ben McLemore- 31 points
Ben Mclemore was his best shooter but he couldn't stay on the floor since he can't play defense. Joe is a much better shooter and plays good defense and sets screens. Harden has a lot of avg. players and old ass stars never had this roster of players. I bet he does 50/40/90 this year on 11+ assists avg. 20+ pts.
We didn't do them any favors for sure but Trob was only here for half a season. Stauskas was only here for 1. They didn't do shit anywhere else after so its not just us. Don't think anyone could have made Jimmer work.  Someone like Ben McLemore though I definitely think his career would have been different with a strong organization. He had the tools to be really good.
[Ben McLemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t0ZFOmtdjI)
I though Ben McLemore would be the next Ray Allen. His shooting form looked quick and similar and he was even more athletic but i couldn't have been more wrong. At best he will be a starter 3 &amp; D guy.
"I attended two of those games in NYC when I lived there and that hot streak definitely put him on a pedestal which resulted in him getting on my favorite team, the Rockets.  I agree that he has the skills to be a decent role player in the form of Austin Rivers or Ben McLemore but not to the level of Eric Gordon when he's on a role (those are my recent Rockets comps). Speaking on Ben McLemore, the NBA has also changed and his lack of defensive capabilities (abilities) are glaring so he wouldn't be able to stay on the court unless he could light it up at the near Trae-level to justify having him out there. Nowadays it's almost as if it's better to be average-to-above average on BOTH sides of the floor rather than excellent on one side of the floor but a ZERO on the other (e.g., GREAT shooter with BAD defense; GREAT defender that's a BAD shooter)."
Ben McLemore defended this really well to force the low shot.
Good thing we prevented a Ben Mclemore career game lmao. Dude cant miss during the 1st half
"Too close to call. Pippen was a better help defender, i've never seen a wing wreak havoc like Scottie but but i've never seen anybody just snatch the ball without gambling like Kawhi does.   Magic was talking about the '91 finals a while back and he mentioned how slowly and deliberately the Lakers had to play to avoid getting robbed by Scottie and Michael on their way down the floor and how they couldn't be showtime looking over their shoulders every second.  Then again, Lebron looking to the scorer's table and cursing when he sees Kawhi ready to come into the game is some goat level shit too.  Kawhi just stands right in front of you and there's nothing you can do, he's the best man defender ever, ask Ben McLemore.  Vanilla or chocolate?  Your call."
"But if you had to rank Ben McLemore, Peja Stoyakovich, Dee Brown and Moses Malone on your All Time list of players you would have for a two on two game who would you pick in order to be on your team?  Why is the narrative that Ben McLemore is not as good as Dee Brown so prevalent on this sub?"
"Just as Lakers fans expected going into this season, they will be depending on Ben McLemore and Andre Drummond"
"The Mozgov situation doesnt help anybody tho because buyouts remain on the books of the team. The Lakers still had to work around his salary on their path to being competitive whether he was on the bench or at home. It doesnt get them out of the contract whatsoever. The AD/Bron example is nonsense. Lakers would never agree to pay top players to leave the team, the example is just infinitely stupid.   I'm not saying the buyout structure is good. Something should change, but I think you arent really understanding the financials of these decisions or looking at how this does benefit Detroit and SA. Both teams improved by getting rid of these guys (Detroit paradoxically by getting worse and getting a better draft pick) and Aldridge just didnt fit in SA and Pop didnt want it to become an issue lockroom wise. SA obviously still fighting for a playoff spot. They would have preferred to trade them, but nobody trading for those contracts. Personally, I like a rule where players who make less than say 10mil can get bought out because I think there is a lot of value for a player like Ben McLemore who is close to being out of the league to show he has value and get another deal but for Blake and LA who are already rich, if you sign huge deals, you are stuck on that team in that contract. Should be one of the drawbacks to getting 100 million+ deals but I understand, that also sucks for a team like Detroit that needs to rebuild but can't just bench a good player either. And you dont want careers to just die, especially for a player like Blake that got traded to a bad team."
Are Blake and LMA not more popular than Drummond and Ben McLemore?
Can we get a refund on Ben McLemore please?
"Lol what even is this comment? Your entire fucking system is not a failure because Ben mclemore is getting scored on for the couple minutes a game you check him in. Was the lakers entire defense a “failure” when they played mcgee/dwight in game 1 against Houston? No, they just benched the two of them, went small, and beat the brakes off us. I don’t even know why keep using “defensive breakdown” as if it’s some system failure or something, guy plays bad defense, guy doesn’t see minutes. What is so hard to understand  &gt; he says ben will get beat every time  You clearly didn’t watch him play defense in the playoffs lol. Chris Paul was dicking around with him the whole time until we subbed him out, lebron made him his bitch, you’re insane if you don’t think all the elite offensive players the lakers will face in the playoffs won’t attack him instantly the moment he’s checked in the game  &gt; other posters have commented and said how ridiculous  No, it’s literally just that Pistons dude who doesn’t understand just like you. Your take is dumb and you should feel dumb"
Ben Mclemore to the lakers makes u think this? Lol
The Ben McLemore Effect
They all getting their three point shots in before ben mclemore takes them all.
"That’s not Ben Mclemore, is that the guy from the Cosby show?"
"Again putting words into my mouth lmao. Of course having great rim protectors matters for having a good defense, the fuck. It’s just not going to save ben mclemore. Go ahead and see for yourself since you’re incapable of understanding logic"
"That’s *Sharpshooter* Ben McLemore to you, Charania."
"Just google ""advanced twitter search"" and you can easily find any tweets from Lebron with the words 'Ben McLemore"""
"People have said literally the same thing about Trez, Kuz, Gasol(too slow and out of shape) and Schroeder and they still sit as one of the top defensive teams in the league. You think Ben McLemore is suddenly going to break down the entire system?"
"Ben Mclemore is as useful is not more useful than Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge right now, where the outrage over this move?"
They sleeping on Ben McLemore. Just watch
"Hey guys, it's me Ben McLemore. Thanks for the support and the Lakers are very lucky to have me, Ben McLemore."
Ant is on pace to have a worse rookie season than Josh Jackson and Ben McLemore and y'all are proclaiming him DWade 2.0.
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"
"That says more about plus minus as a stat than it does about Harden, unless you seriously believe Ben McLemore outplayed James Harden lol"
"I'm a piece of a guy, are you a piece of guy?  Ben McLemore everyone, kings drafted a slasher, low 3 point shooter.  Same year Giannis was drafted. Stupid kings."
Ben McLemore
"since 2000 Nene, Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, Corey Brewer, Steph Curry, Greg Monroe, Bismack Biyombo, Harrison Barnes, Ben McLemore, Julius Randle, Emmanuel Mudiay, Lauri Markennen, and Coby White have all been picked at 7. Of that group Murray is one of the better players, but ""well above expected value,"" seems like a stretch."
"2013 Draft - Giannis is just another Durant nopeful.  Invest in Ben McLemore, he's a more athletic Ray Allen.  Oh boy I was wrong."
The player who turned the likes of Ryan andersen and Ben mclemore into perceived threats through his playmaking is now reinvented as a playmaker...
"I was a Rockets fan since I started actually watching the NBA. It's absolutely true.   Last year Ben McLemore was the only one to shoot 40% from 3 and it was on low attempts. In 2018-19 PJ was the only one shooting close to 40% from 3. Harden shot at almost 37 percent, EG shot 36 PG. House shot above 40% but he didn't play in that many games.   In all Harden's years they never got a single elite shooter. It was always guys that hovered around 37% and most of them were unreliable and their shot came and went."
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
"How is it this close?  The Rockets have played Kevin Porter Jr., Ben McLemore, Sterling Brown, Jae'Sean Tate, Justin Patton, Kenyon Martin Jr., Anthony Lamb, David Dwaba, and Mason Jones tonight...against the team with the best record in the league that's playing at full strength."
I’ll quote you a dumbass I saw in the rockets sub earlier.   “A good coach wouldn’t lose this many in a row”  Like bruh we are having Ben fucking McLemore run point tonight lol
PG- Kevin Porter  SG- Ben McLemore  SF- Sterling Brown  PF- Jae’Sean Tate  C- Justin Patton
I agree. I’d argue House would have a better chance of being in a playoff rotation than McLemore. I love Ben but his defense has kept him from playing in the playoffs before.
He’s Ben hated on mcleMore while he was in New York than he is now
"Ben McLemore wtf, I've loathed watching him play since his rookie year in Sac.  Wouldnt it be funny if the  rockets traded some of those guys (DIPO!) to brooklyn....."
"Huh, I guess that only applies to a buyout then.   I think trading Dinwiddie would be our only option. Houston would have to attach their least desirable, low salary guy to make salaries work.  For example: [Dinwiddie and a second for PJ Tucker and Ben Mclemore](https://tradenba.com/trade-machine) technically works.   This assumes Dinwiddie is out all year and is leaving in FA. It also assumes HOU can't get better than a second for PJ and can't get anything for Mclemore (Sterling Brown, Nwaba, House Jr., Porter Jr., and Tate also work salary-wise) which might not be true. Houston's cap hit goes up a tiny bit, but they stay under the tax."
Ben McLemore lol.  He’s still in the league?
How’s Ben mcLemore? I think the Lakers could use him if he’s consistent from 3
Armoni Brooks  Ben McLemore  Cameron Oliver  D.J. Wilson  Zhou Qi
Honestly I'm starting to think Brooks is legit. He can at least fill the Ben McLemore shooter off the bench role  I like Oliver so far but he hasn't played enough for me to say yet
And the fast break hit-ahead to McLemore. Did he think Ben was gonna jump for the oop???
Where's Ben McLemore in all this?
Move the ball to who? PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore?  The Rockets had the #2 offense in the NBA that season playing Harden iso
Sometimes it’s KCP who is playing well. Sometimes it’s Kuzma who is not playing. Sometimes it’s THT who is also not playing. Sometimes it’s Gasol who is in and out of the rotation. Sometimes it’s Ben Mclemore. Sometimes it’s Caruso.
BEN MCLEMORE!!!!
Why Ben McLemore playing for Miami rn
Ben McLemore is wide open!
"&gt;You for sure are irrelevant. You don’t answer questions and you gloss over facts. I brought up his NBA resume to show you how tough he is. He doesn’t have God giving talents like Most of the leagues superstars and yet he still became one of the best players because of his hard work and reluctance to quit. That’s roughness.   I am sure the ""toughest"" guys in the NBA aren't the best ones. If someone is a hard worker and a good NBA player that doesn't mean they are the ""toughest"". And to get to the NBA you have to be a hardworker 99% of the time and have the reluctance to quit. Do you know why other NBA players don't flaunt that? Because it's assumed.   Mirza Teletovic grew up in a war zone, Bismack Biyombo grew up often without the basic necessities in the Democratic Republic of Congo ,Dion Waiters lost both of his parents to shootings,Ben McLemore,Caron Butler was homeless and a drug dealer, etc"
"Dude, Ben Mclemore looked terrified of Kawhi, lmao. Must still remember when Kawhi stripped him twice in a row and got him benched a few years ago."
"I think he is important since he’s better than say a Ben mclemore, but he’s not gonna be the reason they win a title. He’s a piece to the puzzle but the puzzle doesn’t get finished if harden isn’t there"
"I posted this elsewhere here, but here are your lowest 20 per 36 Marvel Point accumulators (min 500 MP).   |Player|MHP per 36| :--|--:| |Wesley Matthews|8.5| |Rodney Hood|8.5| |Isaac Okoro|9.6| |Gary Clark|9.6| |Chasson Randle|9.7| |P.J.

I’ve given up “scouting” players. I’ll see someone nice in college and think they are going to blow up in the NBA and then they’re Ben McLemore.
Hes Ben McLemore.
Because Mclemore is a former King and Buddy always bested him in practice (from twitter posts/videos/etc.) so I would imagine vogel not wanting Ben to give Buddy the confidence to shoot.
"Vogel gets so much praise, but hes fucking up the team by not playing gasol enough. Also, why the fuck did ben mclemore only play 15 min?"
Probably Ben McLemore.
Ben McLemore might be the best shooter ever for Lakers fans lol
Wow I didn't realise Kent Bazemore and Ben McLemore had a son and that he's playing for the Hawks
Ben Mclemore
"Smart move Lakees, definitely need to get your superstar Ben McLemore going before the playoffs"
"Yeah and see the kings. Who knows what players like DeMarcus Cousins, Ben mclemore, and Marvin Bagley would develop like if they started their careers in say San Antonio, Miami, or Philadelphia. Unfortunately though they were drafted to basketball hell :( I’m sure that the organization has an enormous effect on a rookie’s development, and the kings have had a 10-15 year stretch of (mostly) draft misses that can’t just be consequence.  Funny enough, one of our best players we drafted was at 60th, Isaiah Thomas. Who ended up doing much much better after leaving the kings. And another one of our better draft picks was a second rounder, Hassan Whiteside. Although he needed a couple years out of the league to properly develop"
Harden is clearly an offensive system by himself.  Elite HoF passing creates crazy amount of open shots. How many players in the league can make G-Leaguers look NBA starters?  Players like Ben McLemore were literally on their way out of the league before going to Houston and shooting open 3s from Harden
"I think they definitely have gotten better. Outside of individual improvements between seasons like Kuzma and THT, the lakers basically replaced rondo and Dwight with the Shroeder and Montrezl. One was the 6th man of the year and the second was a runner up. Danny Green has been replaced by Wes Matthews and Ben McLemore. And Javale has been replaced with Drummond and Gasol. I’d consider them much deeper this year than last year. In terms of getting reps in with the full team healthy, you have a point, but hopefully with LeBron returning in this last stretch, they will begin to pick things up."

Ben mclemore on the lakers
Change from Seth to Ben McLemore lol
don't forget my boy Ben McLemore
Ben McLemore.
KCP really started playing well because his minutes were being threatened by Ben Mclemore LMFAO
"Well, the Nets with their entire squad minus Harden lost to Drummond, Ben McLemore and the Lakers G league team so anything can happen in the NBA."
"Yea in 2019 when James Harden averaged 36 ppg and carried Gerald Green, Ben Mclemore and PJ Tucker over a 2 month span when Chris Paul got hurt."
PJ Tucker who has maybe been on the court...three games all season? And Ben Mclemore does not hold the ship when all pieces of the big 3 are out most of the season
HOU would have sent back pieces w/ Harden.   There was understanding early on that Tucker and Harden would end up in the same location if it was a good enough offer. Also HOU could have very easily attached Ben Mclemore.  End of depth pieces were not enough of a worry to say no to that swap from MIA's pov.
Well just a few examples of this year alone of players that were available. So are you saying if you had that big 3 you wouldn't take those players on a minimum contract? I think any contending team would take 1 of those. Others worth mentioning Jeff Teague and one trick ponies like Ben McLemore. My point was you could fill out the roster fairly handy in a good location with a solid big 3
Ben McLemore
"Ben Mclemore and Drummond were both the best guys on the market. Casuals hyped up old ass Blake and Aldridge though (I did too, but only because I want to make Nets seem better than they really are so I can hype up LeBron's 5th championship even more)"
Ben McLemore is a solid 7-8 /10 so far. His confidence in his shot seems to have inspired our other guys to shoot a little bit more confidently as well and he has been a lot of fun to watch so far.
"Klay. After watching a few games with the Lakers, Ben McLemore too. AD's is super smooth too."
Ben McLemore too
"Fucking Jimmer could do that.  Do you watch the game or the stats? He only takes 3s, all he can do. And that's streakier than month old drawz. . Hield cant defend, distribute or even handle a pass. He's the dumbest fucking dude in the league since Ben McLemore. If he's not shooting threes hes worse than worthless."
It takes Ben McLemore 5 bricks to warm up
Ben McLemore career game incoming
Ben McLemore?!
"KCP, Wes Matthews, THT are normal rotation guys anyway    Ben McLemore and Alfonzo McKinnie will play.  Cacok will play too."
Bradley Beal is who I thought Ben McLemore would be. I had higher expectations for Nerlens Noel too and Justise Winslow
"&gt;If you think Rich Paul would leave LeBron high and dry you’re either naive or stupid.  As we have seen, James is not actually indestructible.  If he had, say, popped his Achilles last year like Bryant, Durant, Thompson, and others have, Davis was gone.  Paul wasn't leaving Davis in LA to play with Wesley Matthews and Ben McLemore, and Davis would've fired him the instant he tried.  Speaking of which, the instant Davis realizes that Paul is prioritizing another client over him is the instant before Paul gets fired by Davis.  &gt;Davis’s “agent” is Lebron’s agent.  Then why didn't Davis, or Paul, or anyone, come out and say ""AD will only play for the Lakers""?  That would've tanked his trade value, and the Lakers would not have had to decimate their roster to rent him.  Which would have obviously been for the best for James, and Davis as well.  In fact, the opposite occurred, and Davis told anyone who would listen that he would play anywhere except New Orleans... which inflated his trade value beyond all reason and caused him to be roughly twice as expensive as James Harden.  Why?"
"Very well put; while reading I was thinking of the likes of DRob, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Ben Mclemore and Trae who have perfect rhythm dips"
They should try to keep Ben McLemore.
"Johnathon Simmons, Ben McLemore, Ben Bentil shaking. Anfernee Simons formally withdraws."
"They already have Ben McLemore if they want a guy who can shoot but not defend. One way guys like that have limited value in the playoffs. That's why the Clippers traded away Lou Williams. It hurts your team too much to have a guy the opposition can target over and over like that, no matter how good of a shooter they are."
"Nah, Ben McLemore is gonna try to claim it"
"It was the night of the lottery and several hours after the fact. He tweeted ""what pick did we get?"" and I sarcastically replied ""#2, we're taking your replacement Ben McLemore so we can trade you"" (Cold Takes Exposed for sure lol. As much as ET stunk, he was in fact better than McLemore.) He quoted tweeted it and said ""Let's hope so!!!"" and promptly deleted it and blocked me.  Literally I probably haven't even thought about it at all since then until the other day when the Celtics fired Brad and I saw Jayson Tatum quote tweeted an Evan Turner tweet and I was confused why I couldn't see it lol completely forgot about it"
"The roster construction was awful this season, that's on the FO  The Harrell and Schroder signings both massively backfired.   The midseason Drummond signing ended up being terrible  Wesley Mathews and Ben Mclemore were two useless pickups too  You don't have to defend your disappointing FO just because you're a lakers fan."
Ben Mclemore watched this and had war flashbacks
"I don’t like the fact that ad being hurt is being used as an excuse. When ISN’T he hurt? You guys had defensive bigs that could protect the paint and weren’t old and slow. You also had a much better defensive backcourt with either Lebron, kcp, Caruso, Danny Green or Rondo playing. You guys replaced Dwight and Javale with Drummond who can only really rebound, Trez who’s only good in small ball lineups and Marc Gasol who’s decent in the paint but can never be drawn out on the perimeter. Then the back court was replaced by Wesley Matthews  who I wasn’t too big on he just felt like a worse kcp, Schroder who isn’t good on defense with an inconsistent offense and Ben McLemore, who didn’t play much but was dog shit and can’t play D.  None of the players you traded for or signed complimented this team at all"
Hahaha ok come on Ben Gordon?? Not even close  Ben Gordon is closer to Ben McLemore than Donovan Mitchell
"Carmelo, Ben McLemore, and Joe Harris"
"To be honest, he didn’t even storm off. There was a good 15-20 seconds between when the game ended and when the camera showed him heading to the tunnel. Ben McLemore was ahead of Lebron in the tunnel and he was on the court when the game ended and dapped up a couple people.  Lebron def didn’t stay as long as guys normally do, but he also didn’t dip super fast."
I can't think of a single good 3 point shooter on the lakers roster except for Ben Mclemore
When is Ben Mclemore being brought out.  The concession of dudes who are only good at one thing on the Lakers.
Might as well get Ben McLemore out there!!! These Lakers aren't stopping shit anyways. Vogel is fucking stupid I hope he gets hemorrhoids.
"That’s fair, but they need a second playmaker (and ball handler) to ease Lebron’s burden. Plus, they have Ben McLemore, who shot very well next to Harden in Houston. It might not be a great defensive backcourt, but I think a lineup of Harden/ McLemore/ KCP/ Bron / Davis would be potent offensively."
"Law of averages always.  Cam start out white hot like against the Heat in 2013 or dead cold, but he'll.always revert to the averages.  You can always count on his health, solid defense, steady head in the locker room and to knock down a couple threes average a game with a dime or two.  He's much better than Wes Matthews and Ben McLemore."
Lebron looks legit scared to go up hard at the rim. You’re shooters are struggling why not take it all the way instead of letting Ben mclemore brick another shot
"If you're calling on guys like Ben McLemore and Kuzma to help you win, you already lost"
I PREDICTED BEN MCLEMORE MINUTES I AM A BASKETBALL GENIUS
I would throw Ben McLemore out there in the second half. Why not
"&gt;21 y/o Herro  &gt; &gt;15/5/3 - 44/36/80 shooting splits - 30 mpg and 15 starts &gt; &gt;21 y/o James Harden  &gt; &gt;12/3/2 - 43.6/35/84 shooting splits - 27 mpg and 5 starts   21 y/o Ben McLemore  12/2/3 - 44/36/81 - 33 mpg and 82 starts  Edit: I'm not even saying Herro will not turn out a superstar, but these random player comps make fans overrate their own young guys. Raptors fans and the OG  and Kawhi comparisons are the exact same. I just don't think these cherry picked statlines are at all indicative of future performance."
The Ben Mclemore
Chris Paul jawing with McLemore...does that mean there is a nut shot coming for Ben?
Ben McLemore... JR Smith edition
Is Ben McLemore the new JR Smith?
I'd really prefer if guys like Ben McLemore could just no hit difficult threes like that.
what the fuck when did they get ben mclemore
"Right. Until game 3, Vogel had been playing a handful of players in spot mins and I think that really prevented them from gaining any rhythm. You're proving my point though. Kuz isn't needed to score to be effective on the team. He's turned himself into a well-rounded player for the Lakers. They don't need him to be a 3rd or 4th option on offense. In game 3, I think he maybe forced 2-3 shots - the rest were all the right ones to take. Just missed. In his mins, he crashed the boards, drew the defense to make the right passes, and played solid team/iso defense.   Going back to last season, Lakers have a weakness in guarding bigger wings - their guards are too small and their bigs are too slow. So, they'll always assign some of LeBron and AD to guard players like Kawhi and Tatum. Kuz is a great option for those with his improved defense. Vogel is very stubborn in playing offensive players when they can't defend - why he won't play Ben McLemore unless he's desperate. That's not a worry with Kuz at this point."
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
I was convinced that Ben McLemore was gonna be LEGIT when he left Kansas.   Im glad I didn't bet on it
We have Ben McLemore on the bench lol
When he threw a pointless behind the back bounce pass to AD waaay out of bounds I was baffled he was even in the game  Then he came back down and did it again lmao. He needs 0 minutes; we should play Ben McLemore over him because at least he’s a proven shooter
"Speaking of which, where's Ben Mclemore?"
Vogel needs to give Ben McLemore some minutes over KCP in the second half. McLemore fan legit make 4/5 threes in a 7 minutes span but Frank insists on the player who’s hesitant to shoot anything
"Was Schroder there? Was Drummond there? Was Gasol there? Was Ben McLemore there? Was Matthews there? This team is radically different than last year. I agree last year's team had much fewer whiners and AD wasn't quite as deep into his feels about being scared of injury. But now that he has his ring... he's completely mentally checked out.  So no, I don't think it's the same team at all."
"too much locker room drama. schroder is whining about not being paid $100M, AD is whining about having to play 5, Drummond is whining about not getting enough touches, Gasol is whining about having to sit and watch Drummond play like ass. The only dude out there working is Caruso.   If I was Ben McLemore, I'm wondering why the fuck you brought me here anyway watching Pope, Kuzma and Matthews clank every wide open 3 they take. McLemore would make half of those.   And then pouty faced LeBron who is great when things are going great and can use positive reinforcement to fix little mistakes on the court to turn a good team into a great team - but has no idea how to deal with the major problems off the court that make a good team into a shit team.  Vogel sucks ass as well but he's probably being ordered to play Drummond, dealing with all the drama (which he's proven he's incapable of dealing with on the Pacers numerous times) and then LeBron up in his ass every day of the week passive aggressively reminding him of every coaching mistake that led to the game 1 loss."
Like you said Gasol needs to play more and Ben mclemore too
I saw Ben McLemore was injured in a accident
"Vogel proved he could coach at Indiana. Ty Lue so far has only proved he can coach Lebron, and even then there are tons of videos from timeouts where it looked more like Lebron was coaching Lue.  Hell, Lakers ranking in defense without Lebron and AD this year proved he can coach. He milked a top defense out of Kuzma, Harrell, Andre Drummond, and Ben Mclemore. (I know Gasol, Wes, KCP, and Caruso are good defenders regardless)"
"I respect your opinion but definitely disagree. Sure it would be better for college hoops if A-list players still wanted to play 4 years, but I think the sport is still intriguing and fun to watch even with a couple of the big powers (Duke and Kentucky primarily) being 1&amp;Done factories. I would certainly disagree that the NCAA hasn’t been “relevant” in decades, I’d say as recently as 2019 with Zion the NCAA was immensely relevant. Duke was all over SportsCenter and everywhere else. Plenty of good college teams are still built on the backs of numerous 4-year players. This year’s champ, Baylor, was an absolutely incredible squad that shot over 40% from deep *as a team* and featured 6 upperclassmen among their most prominent ~8 players, and no freshmen. I personally am a Kansas fan and though we’ve sent some 1&amp;Dones to the league (Josh Selby, Xavier Henry, Ben McLemore, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre, Josh Jackson come to mind), most of our actual best players over that time frame have been 3-4 year guys like Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Thomas Robinson, Tyshawn Taylor, Perry Ellis, Devonte’ Graham, and Frank Mason. Idk, it probably helps that I grew up a fan of a blue blood, but I love college hoops. I think if anything, what threatens the quality of the sport long-term is the newly relaxed transfer rules. I also have a hard time knocking them though because the kids deserve flexibility, but that will definitely threaten team continuity more than the 1&amp;Done trend."
"Speaking of Ben McLemore, what is Lebron's infatuation with teammates who are streaky shooters and wild as hell like Jr, Shump, KCP, McLemore, Lance Stephenson, Jordan Clarkson, Dion Waiters, etc. Man always picks the strangest dudes as his personal ""shooters"""
Play-in Ben McLemore is the Lakers best hope
"He shot really well from 3 (42% from the college line) with beautiful form and measured a 42"" vertical at the combine. He was getting [Ray Allen comparisons](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/ben-mclemore/) on draft day. Like was said, he had all the tools but it just never really came together."
"Not the last 5 years but I thought Ben Mclemore was gonna be an all-star when he was drafted.  To answer your question though, Markelle Fultz."
Ummm are you unable to understand the context? Ben Mclemore tried to get a kobe challenge and obviously he didn’t respond(why would he?). The context of the funny thread was that Kawhi stripped him in two possessions in a row effortlessly. Do I really need to explain more?
Why tf you talking about Ben McLemore?
You missed Ben McLemore OP
Then Ben McLemore over CJ McCollum
Ben McLemore out here carrying the Lakers.  (in a loss to the Mavs)
I mean look at the Kings who passed on Dame for Thomas Robinson and [then the very next year passed on CJ to draft Ben Mclemore despite promising CJ they'd draft him.](https://sports.yahoo.com/c-j-mccollum-kings-promised-170042877.html)
Can’t believe nobody mentioned Ben Mclemore getting stripped twice in a row by Kawhi and got benched right after
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
"Also the Kings drafting Bismack(traded for Jimmer) over Kemba and Klay, Thomas Robinson over Dame, Ben McLemore over CJ McCollum, Stauskas over LaVine, WCS over Turner and Booker and Chriss over Sabonis all in 6 years."
"100%, he's the only player in the league I dislike now that Zaza's retired. It's just bad for the game. And it's been happening since college too  Julius Hodges: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F3tptzEWmM  KD: https://youtu.be/i9SUoe9Tzi0?t=58  Ben McLemore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTkTi-dUoTE  Westbrook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voNkjbHc9yc  Chris Kaman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj8LNFTJX4o  In isolation these don't look too bad, but at some point it becomes a pattern  Not to mention a litany of other things like [tripping Harden](https://twitter.com/LBJamesHarden/status/1296900112409600000) or [randomly elbowing KD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zW_mIl93sc), or today's shove on Giannis in midair, or his shove on Collison in midair, or his shove on Danuel House in midair...list goes on and on"
"It was a clean foul, Kawhi does these kinds of plays all the time.  He grabbed all ball and Bookers hands, the offensive players hand is part of the ball.  Once he had two hands on it, its fair game for who out muscles the other for possession.  If you think this is a foul then I guess Kawhi's two steals in a row on Ben Mclemore years back were fouls too?  Blame Booker for going too deep in the paint against 3 guys rather than pulling up from the free throw line/mid range where he was lethal."
"I would only take Drummond and his brick hands if we could send him down to the G League for practice.   Sign and trade Schroder for anything.   Retain THT and Alex Caruso, ideally Ben Mclemore on a minimum as well.   TJ McConnell would be a nice pickup on the MLE, but I don’t know if he will come that cheap.   Figure out some sort of way to trade for Myles Turner or Buddy Hield if it’s possible"
Nah bro. He wants Ben McLemore one spot ahead of Noel lmao
"So Lowry was actually healthy for the second half and the ""injuries"" were faked just for tanking? From the outside, all we saw was Lowry being out for like a week, coming back to light us up, then being out 2 or so more weeks after that.  If that's the case (that the injury was fake), then sure. Otherwise, those absences alone would have tanked us out of the playoffs because our guard rotation for that entire duration would be Alex Caruso, Ben McLemore, and not even a third stringer on the roster to dribble the basketball."
"I’ve thought this for a while (because it was true forever) but when I looked into it the other day, pretty much the only player in the past 3-4 seasons that went from the kings to another team and notably improved is bogdanovic, and he showed potential in sac anyway  Kings player development has been a joke forever but now at least it seems more in line with the rest of the league, but then again idk we don’t have much to judge off of besides Fox and maybe Haliburton  You could also make the argument that a lot of our young players were just ass anyways, I mean Ben McLemore, papagiannis, skal labissiere, Malachi Richardson, I don’t know if any amount of player development would save those guys  Anyway it’s just nice to have a bit of faith in the FO moving forward and especially into the draft"
"There were plenty of people who questioned the Schroeder, Drummond, and Harrell acquisitions when they happened. It didn't take a genius to see that those were problematic. Shooting was one of their biggest problems last season and they signed... Wes Mathews and Ben McLemore to assuage that issue while using the MLE on a 73rd center."
"The year prior we fired Mike Malone after what still is the best start of our current record-breaking playoff drought. Boogie got along well with Malone, who was eventually replaced with Karl. Karl &amp; Boogie hated each other, with Karl frequently going to the press and publicly dragging Boogie. Malone got fired by our GM Pete D’Allesnadro, who was hired after Malone and who was evidently looking for an excuse to can him from day 1, brining in Karl who he knew from Denver. This was part of a broader culture of infighting and backstabbing throughout the organization. The year started with Divac doing the same maneuvering to get Pete out, and then immediately selling the farm (shipping a 1st to Philly for cap space lol) to sign Rondo and Bellineli. Karl spent the off-season trying to force a Boogie trade, which is when the famous Boogie “snake in the grass” tweet went out. Bear in mind this is all *before* the season started, yet we decided to roll with Karl and Cousins for the entire year anyways  Gay Rondo &amp; Rudy are all decent rotation players but none are a second star to Boogie. So you have an all-NBA player and 3 average / decent NBA rotation players. The rest of the roster was mostly trash. Seth was basically in his rookie year (had bounced around but we were the first team that gave him regular minutes) and got very little burn. Willie Caulie Stein and Ben McLemore were regular starters with Omri Casspi and Quincy Acy being major rotation players as well.   So we had Cousins, an incredibly thin roster, a franchise that was always setting itself on fire, and an old ass coach at the end of a decades long career who very obviously didn’t give a shit and was constantly fighting and attacking his best player. I’ll admit as a Kings fan we all had cautiously optimistic hopes with Rondo and Gay onboard, but it was truly one of the most Kangz seasons ever. That roster maybe fights for the 8th seed if everything goes right with strong team chemistry and coaching, but as it was the season was a complete dumpster fire and with that thin of a roster there was zero chance anything good was going to happen"
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.

Ben McLemore wore it this season in Houston. He finished the season on the Lakers with a different number.
"It’s hard to judge Ayton and Bam vs Cousins in his prime bc they play different roles on their teams and Cousins is the only one of the 3 being a number one option all those years in Sac and what could have been his peak but derailed twist by injury in Nola.  But as far as impact goes, Ayton and Bam benefit too from able to do a lot more than just sheer scoring and synergistically fit greatly with their teammates, whereas Boogie in his prime was playing with Omri Casspi, Ben Mclemore, Jason Thompson, Matt Barnes with a different head coach every other year lmao"
"Boogie’s starting 5:  G: Rondo  G: Darren Collison  F: Rudy Gay   F: Omri Casspi  C: Cousins  Bench: Willie Cauley Stein, Ben McLemore, Quincy Acy  Westbrook’s rosters have ALWAYS been WAYYYYY better than that.   Westbrook had Oladipo, Sabonis, Jermai Grant, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams, and other great role players in the year he “dragged” them to the playoffs. Later had Paul George."
I mean I love CP3 but just last year he punched Ben Mclemore in the nuts in the playoffs. https://youtu.be/sTkTi-dUoTE
I live in Sacramento where we had Vlade Divac draft Marvin Bagley over Luca Doncic who came from Real Madrid which he used to be the head of operations for.   A couple years before that the Kings had Geoff Petrie who picked Ben Mclemore before CJ McCollum and Giannis. The year before that he took Thomas Robinson with the pick immediately before Damien Lillard who is from Northern California.  I wish the Kings had a GM that bad
"Others also projected Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Ben McLemore at Number 1"
"Caruso- 27 yo- not old.  Schroder- 27 yo- not old.   Ad- 28 yo- not old.  Horton tucker - 20 yo- not old.  Kuzma - 25 yo- not old.  Kcp - 28 yo- not old.  Wesley matthews- 34 yo- old.  Marc gasol- 36 yo- old.   Drummond - 27 yo- not old.   Lebron- 36- old.   Ben mclemore- 28 yo - not old.   Trez- 27 yo- not old.  Markieff morris- 31 yo- just in between.   So in conclusion out of 13 players in the rotation only 3 are old. and other than lebron theres only Mathews and gasol who are old and both were healthy and didnt play big minutes.    So yes, again-everything you said was untrue- their age had no part in what happened.   Did giannis age played a role when he got injured? Murray? even donovan and trae are getting mild injuries. And they both are young players."
&gt;  Fizdale was trying to throw away the old style of Memphis and Gasol was trying to keep it.   That's not quite what happened. Gasol was quite happy to incorporate Fizdale's style into his own game. He had taken 66 3s prior to being coached by Fizdale and took 268 Fizdale's first year. Marc's best passing and scoring year was the first year under Fizdale.   Then the second year Fizdale pushed Zbo and Tony Allen out and replaced them in the rotation with a bunch of 3 and no D scrubs like Ben McLemore and Jarell Martin or Fizdale's buddy Mario Chalmers.  Mike Conley goes down and suddenly the team is reliant on Marc and a bunch of scrubs plus a bunch of passable roleplayers like Tyreke Evans and Jamychal Green.
"I'm in favor of a hard cap plus a ""Superstar exception"" contract that doesn't count against the cap. However, all Superstar Exceptions are the same cash per year (maybe whatever 40% of the hard cap is) and players on Superstar Exceptions can only be included in a trade if the return includes another player on a Superstar Exception.   Teams can choose to convert a Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract, but only if they have the cap space to take the contract on (e.g., they need 35% of their cap space available to convert their Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract).   You may be wondering why a player would sign a Superstar Exception when they could take 50% of the cap. But I think a team with 50% of the money going to one player is never going to be a contender, especially against a team with one dude not counting against the cap at all, letting them spend literally twice as much to build out the roster. And so no smart team would offer that kind of money, and if they did, they wouldn't win anything.  It would be like having Lebron on 50% of the cap, AD on a Superstar Exception, and absolute scrubs vs Steph on a Superstar Exception and a good roster. Like it would be something like Grant Williams / Ben McLemore / Lebron / AD / Aaron Baynes vs Steph / CJ McCollum / OG Anunoby / Draymond / Christian Wood. Spending huge on two stars may look good, but the rest of the team will be so bad, the better constructed team with just one dude on the Superstar Exception (and no guy on 50% of the cap) gives you a better team."
Ben Mclemore
Fuck it. It might be Ben McLemore
I typically don't like doing the retrospective draft game because so many great players fall when they shouldn't. But man the Kings took Bagley and Robinson over Doncic and Dame. That's pretty surreal. The other years there were good players taken after their picks but they were a bit more like unpredictable like Ben Mclemore over CJ McCollum or Stauskas over Lavine.
"&gt; They just drafted a center last year who made All-Rookie, getting Wiseman just stunts both of their development.  You don't draft for fit. Take the best player available. Particularly the Pistons have no reason at all to cater around their current roster.   &gt; \#7 and #14 are also nowhere near enough value for Cade. I don't consider him a ""generational talent"", but he is All-NBA potential.  I think of it more probabilistic. #1 pick has an some chance of turning into a franchise changing player. A #7 pick has a slightly lower chance, and #14 lower. But I don't think it's crazy that #7 + #14 + Wiseman collectively have more odds than Cade.   Let's say conservatively Wiseman is worth #15. If you look at past drafts in the 1-and-done era, around half the time #7 + #14 + #15 is better than #1:  - **2007: Yes** (Brewer + Thornton + Stuckey &gt; Oden) - **2008: No** (DRose &gt; Eric Gordon + Anthony Randolph + RoLo) - **2009: Yes** (Steph Curry + Clark + Daye &gt; Blake Griffin) - **2010: No** (Wall &gt; Monroe + 2Pat + Larry Sanders) - **2011: Yes** (Biyombo + Marcus Morris + Kawhi &gt; Kyrie) - **2012: No** (AD &gt; Barnes + Hensen + Harkless) - **2013: Yes** (McLemore + Shabazz + Giannis &gt; Bennett) - **2014: Yes** (Randle +  TJ Warren + Adreian Payne &gt; Wiggins) - **2015: No** (KAT &gt; Mudiay + Cam Payne + Oubre) - **2016: Yes** (Jamal Murray + Denzel Valentin + Juan Hernangomez &gt; Ben Simmons) - **2017: Yes** (Lauri + Bam Adebayo + Justin Jackson &gt; Fultz) - 2018 onwards: too early to tell (eg MPJ vs Ayton)  So if you look at the 11 year span from 2007 to 2017, you have 7 times (64%) where it's better to take #7 + #14 + #15."
I thought Ben McLemore would be a star with the Kings and Jimmer Freddete would be what Buddy Hield is today.
Whats the shot quality? Percentages matter based on what kind of shots hes missing.   If he getting the opposing teams best defender every night on a bad Brooklyn team then it doesn’t really mean that much  Kind of like how Ben Mclemore was 33% shooter in Houston this year
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"
"At the top would be Kawhi taking the ball from Ben McLemore. Even now in pickup games, McLemore doesn't dribble because he thinks Kawhi will show up and steal it."
"Nope. The lottery and the NBA for that matter is a lot like life.  It’s not fair.   When we start creating rules to allow for equal outcome rather than equal opportunity, we are opening up a can of worms that we wouldn’t be able to come back from.   You want to complain about the system? How about complain about the front offices of the Kings and Magic that can’t build a winning team after many years of top 10 picks.   It’s not the Cavs/Raptors fault that the Kings drafted Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson with top 10 picks in the recent years.  It’s also not their fault that the Magic selected Mo Bamba, Mario Hezonja and a bunch of good but not great players for them like Jonathon Issac, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo all in the top 10."
Same thing as Ben Mclemore. Out of the league. Again.

"Jimmer, Thomas Robinson, Ben McLemore, Bill Cauley-Stein"
What’s the meme about Ben McLemore?
The disrespect to Ben McLemore
If I’m remembering correctly the GM of the Cavs didn’t even want him. He was leaning Ben McLemore or Oladipo and he got out voted by people in the front office late in the draft process
Ben Mclemore
1. Ben McLemore 2. Ben McLemore 3. Ben McLemore
Ah Ben McLemore?
&gt;*There hasn’t been a player who used 16 came to us and was forced to change*  Ben McLemore wore 16 with the Rockets before being traded to the Lakers last year and then switching to 7.
"Patrick Beverly, Ben McLemore, Caleb Swanigan, Ben Simmons, Bismack Biyombo."
"&gt; Funnily enough it was meant to be December 23rd but because Harden broke covid protocol the game had to be postponed.  Not just Harden.  Three players either tested positive or inconclusive for COVID and 4 other players were already quarantined.  I think John Wall was quarantined because he went to get a haircut or something like that.  Ben McLemore was part of that group too.  &gt; If the Nets trade was the only one, then that would be fair but Harden had also been considering Miami, the 76ers and apparently the Bucks (though I find that unlikely since Bucks never had the assets to make that trade).  Realistically he wanted to be traded to the Nets and that's it.  Those other teams were used for leverage at best but pretty much everything points to Harden wanting to go to Brooklyn.  In the article I linked, they talk about how he and KD celebrated together before the trade happened (like November 17th-ish) because they came to a verbal agreement with the Nets about the trade."
The Raptors won because Harden didn't beat them but they ultimately lost because Ben McLemore said imma get 28 real quick haha.
"Yeah, fuckin' Ben McLemore dropped like 30"
I remember this game as the time the Raptors perfectly executed a game plan to take the ball out of Hardens hands and make someone beat you. The only trouble is that Ben McLemore accepted that challenge and dropped like 35 points to beat Toronto
Ben McLemore would like a word
Ben Mclemore
Ben McLemore. That dude was gonna be a baller. Decent role player though 🤷🏽‍♂️
Same team.  Ben McLemore.  Sweet 3 point stroke like Ray Allen and could jump out of the gym.  That guy just could not get those shots to fall even though they looked money every time
I was huge on Ben Mclemore
jimmer fredette thomas robinson ben mclemore nik stauskas willie cauley stein georgios papagiannis marvin bagley
yoo ben mclemore thats the dude who got drafted ahead of giannis!
And Ben McLemore hasn’t done shit since
"I’m so tired of this narrative behind pushed:   They added Ben McLemore, Cody Zeller, and Tony Snell aka The Needle Movers"
And dame is stuck in the west with CJ and his FO got him cody zeller and ben mclemore after years of disappointment. Oh and he's 31.
Blazers: we got Ben McLemore is that enough help   Dame: yeah totally bro
"&gt;He strikes me as unique due to his dominance on defense and insanely efficient offense, but at what point is “unique” just a combination of solid fundamentals?  You address this well in your original post by acknowledging that this is rather subjective. Part of why I'm less eager to call Kawhi generational (relative to others on a very esteemed list of course) is that his defensive prowess has waned while his offensive load has waxed. Part of the reason he was able to be such a defensive force during his Spurs days is because he carried less of an offensive load. [I love when he did Ben McLemore dirty be stripping him twice in a row.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vwNcbLG02g) As Kawhi has grown as an offensive force, he has pretty clearly put forth less effort on defense and instead picks and chooses his spots. This is clearly strategic because it's essentially impossible to play maxed out on both sides of the court for 35+ minutes a game. (And his quad injury has obviously not helped either.) To be clear, all the other great players are like this to. They consciously conserve energy when they can (usually on defense) in order to be exceptional when it mattes (usually on offense)."
"Ima go with their ceilings:  Melo: All NBA second or third team, second best player on a contender  Zo: borderline all star  Gelo: Ben McLemore"
Like who..? Outside of Ben McLemore playing like an okay rotation player for a year with the Rockets I can't think of any Kings draft flops who've looked significantly more competent elsewhere.
Ben McLemore 😞
Dame PLEASE LEAVE PORTLAND. They signed Cody Zeller and Ben McLemore🤣🤣. Portland front office is wasting such a great talent with Dame. Sorry Dame get ready for another 1st round exit
Anyone better than Tony Snell or Ben McLemore
What do you mean? They got the missing piece in Ben McLemore
"I understand why fans thought that, fans always overvalue draft picks. But a scout should know that they always call the first pick the best prospect since (*most recent MVP candidate drafted), and the draft is always the deepest draft since 2003, almost every year. The people comparing Simmons to Lebron were just getting carried away like they always do. Look at this years draft: ESPN says Green and Mobley would have been the first pick in any other year, and they compared Sengun to Sabonis and Jokic. An all star and an MVP are their comps for the 16th pick... Ben McLemore was supposed to be the next Ray Allen.  In most years if you get a better version of Rondo for the first pick, you got good value. People just have unrealistic expectations every year."
"Who’s better, this guy or Ben Mclemore?"
"pretty much any 2012-2013 college star who never panned out. Jared Sullinger, Thomas Robinson, Fab Melo, Ben McLemore, Tyler Zeller, etc."
"They also lost Zach Collins and Enes Kanter, and have brought in Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, and Ben McLemore. So, they have made some other moves, as well as re-signing Powell, but the question is if these move the needle for Dame. Either way, I think he lasts there until at least the trade deadline, if not into next offseason."
Damn how much help does Dame need?? Ben McLemore ain’t enough to win??
"In terms of Lebron James' name, 2 of the 11 letters are Le, which comes out to 18%. For Ben McLemore, 2 of the 11 letters are also Le, which also comes out to 18%. Dude's literally on par with Lebron James and Dame still claims to have not enough help smh"
Wow how much help does Dame need. Ben McLemore ain’t enough???
"Sorry I was busy with stuff.  Beal was obviously their prime target, but apparently he doesn't want out. If that's the case, they should probably engage Toronto on the Siakam front, or they maybe should've even kicked the tires on Derozan (who graded out by Bball Index's LEBRON metric as a better overall player than Wiggins last year).   Those are, of course, bigger signings, so if we look at smaller ones, what about Danny Green? Paul Millsap? Ben Mclemore? Victor Oladipo? Just guys who can come in and contribute more easily than others. Frankly I think they should've just traded Oubre earlier for something else, but that's a different story altogether.   The initial point of discussion I wanted to bring up was that I think the Warriors FO isn't doing right by Steph, and that they should really be cashing more chips in on winning now as opposed to threading the needle. At the very least, I personally think they should be erring more towards winning now. You guys might disagree, and of course who am I but a random guy who doesn't work in any NBA FO, and that's all fine. It's just my opinion."
Lots of overreactions to Monk. He’s still young but he’s most likely a Ben McLemore type player (who was also a former lottery pick). That’s solid as a 8/9th man but it isn’t some groundbreaking signing.
"&gt;I am not going to take anything from that Suns series it was a shit show for everyone.  The Lakers went six games with the second-best team in the league, despite being heavily injured.  That's not bad at all, and had they not let Matthews on the court, they might've even pulled off the upset.  &gt;so saying McLemore was better doesn't really mean much.  It means McLemore was a ton better at 28 years old than Matthews at 34, and that situation is only going to get worse for Matthews in every subsequent season.  &gt;And Ben played 21 games for the Lakers vs 58 for Matthews who had a lot of adjusting to do in a new system  What the hell are you talking about?  Matthews had training camp, and a full season of practice.  McLemore did precisely not.  &gt;Ben was basically allowed to just shoot and not even really try to defend.  And McLemore did both miles better than Matthews did -- which is the entire point."
"I am not going to take anything from that Suns series it was a shit show for everyone.  Nobody played well outside game 2 and 3 so saying McLemore was better doesn't really mean much.  And Ben played 21 games for the Lakers vs 58 for Matthews who had a lot of adjusting to do in a new system and having to come in on a lot of wonky minutes.  His usage was not ideal (aka the Kuzma).  Ben was basically allowed to just shoot and not even really try to defend.  He was brought in to be a bench guy, started 10 games for injury, and was pretty awful in a lot of games.  Individual defensive rating stats are kind of useless."

Im not really sure why you guys are arguing with me considering your superstar is literally demanding big moves in someway and you guys signed ben Mclemore lmao. Im literally saying they're gonna make dame leave.
"I feel like you answered your own question when you typed out Cody Zeller, Ben McLemore and Tony Snell tbh."
Ben McLemore
This is why you don’t sign Ben fucking McLemore on the first day of free agency.
"Interesting that Ben McLemore didn’t go to the Lakers. I’m curious whether the Lakers wanted him or not, and if they are still in the mix in getting better players?"
Dame: I need help  Blazers: here’s Ben Mclemore
Hey cmon now we signed Tyler Zeller!.. and Ben!..... Mclemore...😔
Bro you signed Ben McLemore and you have the nerve to talk shit about our FA lmao
"Is Powell, Zeller, and Ben Mclemore enough for Dame?"
So Dame wants to win and Portland traded Melo for Ben McLemore and got a new coach huh
Never forget that Ben McLemore forgot to bring sneakers to his workouts and had to buy some day of. And kings still picked him.
"Welcome to the club. That franchise ruined Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson. I feel bad for the tens of Kings fans that I'm going to offend here, but I'm glad your franchise is the most forgettable in all of sports. They take promising young players, fail to develop them, suck, then pick high in the draft so they can fail to develop more promising young players."
"Not saying I disagree but Thomas Robinson and Ben McLemore were widely thought to be great picks at the time. So even though they didn't work out, I don't feel bad for us drafting them cause most teams in that situation would've done the same thing."
"No...you don't understand, we're the Kangz.  No matter who we would have drafted it would have been a bad pick and a meme.  We have earned that reputation though by drafting people like Spencer Hawes, Jimmer, Thomas Robinson, Ben McLemore, ""It's Not Pizza, It's"" Papagiannis, and Marvin Bagley (who hates it here and he and his dad bitch every single week on twitter about it) over Luka."
Did they talk about who was going to shoot treys? Ben McLemore?
"Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Jeff Teague, Kent Bazemore, E'Twaun Moore, Mike Scott, Langston Galloway, Wes Matthews, Ben Mclemore...   Really not as hard as you're making it out to be to just grab some cheap guys to shoot open 3s"
Lakers will be fine. Wade wasn't an elite three point shooter. Lakers should resign Ben Mclemore tho.
"You haven't seen Troy Daniels, Quinn Cook, Wes Matthews, or Ben McLemore?   The idea that the Lakers FO hasn't signed shooters is a myth. They did. Vogel just didn't play them very much because (other than Matthews) he didn't trust them on defense. Getting guys who can shoot and defend at the level the Lakers expect is really hard and those guys make a ton of money."
Did Ben Mclemore die?
Yeah it really helped them get \[checks notes\] Ben McLemore and Wesley Matthews
&gt; they will find shooters  Who gets to be the 2022 versions of Wes Matthews and Ben McLemore?
"I want to point out what the absolute max the Lakers can pay some of these guys would be:  * Wes Matthews - $4,347,600 (using non Bird rights)  * Markieff Morris - $10 million (using early Bird rights)  * Andre Drummond - $5.9 million (using MLE)  * Ben McLemore - vet minimum  * Dennis Schroder - 5 year max starting at 30% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Alex Caruso - 5 year max starting at 25% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Talen Horton-Tucker - full MLE (Arenas limited restricted free agent using early Bird rights)  These guys won't all get the max the Lakers can pay them, of course, but this is how they can fill out the rest of their roster even if they have LeBron, AD and Westbrook."
Lakers would looks to try to bring back   Ben McLemore   Markieff Morris   Wesley Matthews   And maybe try to poach Jeff green from the nets   Theres chatter about Melo going to LA too
Ben McLemore and Wes Matthews I guess lmao. Really hoping we can add shooting somehow
"&gt;Ben McLemore, Danny Green and LeBron James will carry the weight of shooting for the Lakers.  lmao"
1. Nerlens Noel  2. Victor Oladipo  3. Otto Porter  4. Ben Mclemore  5. Alex Len  It was a shit class in general lol
Ben McLemore had a small sample size i wouldn't count him.  And again we are talking about when we sign people who are supposed to shoot threes.  Rondo actually decreased his percentage from New Orleans in the yeat we won that championship.
Marc Gasol increased his three point percentage.  Ben McLemore increased his three point percentage.  Lance Stephenson increased his three point percentage.  Rajon Rondo increased his three point percentage.
I remember when Rondo spent a year with the Kings he was always spending extra time working out with young guys like Ben McLemore
I guess it's possible they could get Ben McLemore to come back as one of them? It would really depend exactly what this hypothetical trade would be. Maybe KCP or Caruso would still be with the Lakers after this? If not I guess it would be whomever is available for cheap.
"&gt;Ben McLemore  Damn, I remember back when people thought he was going to be the next Ray Allen.  Guess it never really clicks for some players."
It’s a miracle we got CJ in such a terrible draft. Sacramento promised him that if he was available at 7 they would take him. They took Ben McLemore.
"Idk if Collin Sexton counts? I never thought he’d be good, but even though he’s fairly good now, I still wouldn’t want him on my team.  Ben Mclemore too....I thought he’d be a great scorer in the league."
"Anthony Bennet, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlins Noel, Ben McLemore for Luka. You still game? You would need the top 27 picks of the 13 draft to have a playoff team."
"for reference, up until maybe January, we were all just like “so i guess uh… Ben McLemore is gonna be the first pick?”"
what even made the cavs consider him? i thought nerlens noel or ben mclemore would’ve gone #1. i didn’t even know who he was until they took him
"ben mclemore should’ve been first pick, a true nba legend"
"Damn, I thought Ben McLemore was like an old vet. Didn’t realize he was in the same draft class as Giannis"
"“Hey Kob, it’s me, Ben. Ben McLemore. I’m in the league too. I play-well, I’m on a roster but i do practice. You got any more of them challenges? Really need some motivation.”  Read at 8:14PM"
And Kobe didn't reply to Ben McLemore. I still find it so funny.
Not sure why Dallas would want Ben McLemore but I think Portland definitely pulls the trigger on this
Klay would be living like Ben mclemore
"You earned the ire, no hiding now. Ben Simmons doesn’t come, then Rich Paul will take it. Rich Paul doesn’t come, Chris Paul will take it. CP3 doesn’t come, Ben McLemore better be prepared. Even retired Paul Simon. We are the Sixers fans."
"People overrate how big of a reach he was.  The top like 6-8 players were all viewed as interchangeable more or less.  The closest thing to consensus 1 was Nerlens and he even fell to #6.  Dipo was viewed as a “safe-ish” top 3 pick with higher floor and low ceiling.   On paper his upside is intriguing.  Elite rebounder who can stretch the floor.  Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlens Noel, Ben McLemore was your top 7  Basically everyone high lottery was fucked in some way"
Ben McLemore and Noel were the two top guys and they ended up 6 and 7.
"We are laughably slept on this year. Like people really have the fucking Mavs ahead of us😂 dame/cj/norm/RoCo/Nurk was the 2nd best rated line up IN THE LEAGUE last year. And we should expect career years from both Nurk and Powell this year.   Our most significant means of getting better this offseason was actually addition by subtraction. And that says a lot considering we locked norm down for his entire prime, traded an obsolete DJJ for 6MOY candidate Nance, and added proven bench pieces in Zeller, Snell, and McLemore. No. What we really did that turned us into contenders was:  1. a) Firing Stotts - To say our core of dame/cj/Nurk/Stotts has gotten stale over the last couple of years is an understatement. Stotts didn’t hold players accountable, especially dame and cj on defense. I believe he wanted too badly to uphold his job and his reputation as a “player friendly coach”, giving dame and cj all the leash they want on either end. And taking absolutely no risks in his scheme and making zero adjustments in the playoffs. Plus he didn’t know how to coach defense and you can’t argue me on that. So that shit had to go.    b) hiring Chauncey - his ceiling as a coach is incredibly high. He came into the league as an underdog, won finals mvp and played on one of the greatest defensive teams in league history. Our offense should pretty much take care of itself like it always has, so if Chauncey can use this roster right to make us a top 10 defense, we’ll be instant contenders. Roco/Nance = Ben Wallace/Sheed???? (Not really but let me dream)  2. Letting Melo and Kanter walk, instantly improving our bench defense and space+pace on offense.   And all of this is not even factoring in the possibility of a major leap from Simons or little, or a mid season trade to improve the roster.   We may not be championship favorites right now but to bet on us to finish without home court would just be short sided and likely media biased imo. This team is dangerous no matter who they go against."
Ben mclemore not ben simmons🤣🤣🤣
nah we gonna give you that man ben mclemore for ben instead
The ceiling of Ben mclemore
Ben McLemore could still one day be the leagues best shooter. His shot &gt;
My first two posts on reddit were on Lakers and Rockets sub saying Ben McLemore would be great flyers for both teams.   He ended up playing for both Houston and Los Angeles.   I know right!!!
"Unless you're Ben Mclemore, then it takes you 4 years to recover."
The real G.O.A.T is Ben McLemore
Ben McLemore averaged 32 on the 2018 Cavs?  What the fuck is this page
Ben McLemore played really well next to Harden
You mean Blazers legend Ben McLemore?
He also said teams were “sleeping on Ben Mclemore” on draft day
"I was thinking about it more and it was Simmons, Thybulle, Springer, and Reed for CJ, RoCo, and someone I think (McLemore? I can't remember).  Reasons this is bad for Portland: we're giving up 2 starters including our best forward and our best SG.  Additionally, we're acquiring Ben Simmons while giving away 1/3 of our spacing.  CJ would be gone either way, so if you ignore his 40% 3pt% at near 10 3pa (what he was averaging pre-injury), we're still losing our 1 out of 2 bench shooters and our only forward who's a legit shooter in RoCo (not to mention our best defender atm and would-be 2nd best if we got Simmons).  RoCo is the only forward we have which could share the floor with Simmons without a detriment on offense due to his outside c&amp;s ability.  Thybulle obviously is a great defender, and in a vacuum I'd take him on the Blazers.  However, the reason he can't get more minutes is his lack of offensive ability.  In a package giving up 3 shooters for 2 non-shooters, we're shooting ourselves in the foot here.  The garbage contracts they're sending are irrelevant outside taking up 2 roster spots.  So yeah.  There's why the trade is bad.  Our fan base is definitely torn (I did a poll on our sub yesterday about it) about Simmons, but the mild consensus is a CJ-Simmons swap.  The rest of the trade ruins it.  The same is true when someone proposed CJ+Simons for Simmons+Maxey (after the report Rich Paul wanted Maxey out).  I said no to that, too, since we kill our outside shooting.  Maxey could very well be better than Simons, as early as this season even.  But Simons' 40+% 3pt shooting is what makes Simmons even an option for us.  Replacing him with an undersized SG with 30% 3pt is just making us worse."
"Nah. He’s an abysmal agent. You could ask a hobo to wear a suit and the results will be the same. Murray at 4/64 doesn’t even have to be negotiated. The NBA should already ban that clown from representing anyone. You look at the careers of Dion, JR Smith, and McLemore who went nowhere after Rich Paul. Dude’s so bad at giving advice that Ben Simmons plateaued at a young age. He should take lessons from Rob Pelinka while LeBron is with the Lakers so that he actually knows how to be a real agent and not just ride LeBron’s coattails."
"Thomas Robinson, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Nik Stauskas, Willie Cauley-Stein, MARVIN BAGLEY to name a few"
"But he wasn't out of the league...there's a massive difference between being out of the league and ""damn near out of the league.""  Ben Mclemore has played every single year since his rookie year and even started over 20 games in 2020.  So that doesn't really make the point"
Ben McLemore was basically the same player his 2nd year and then was damn near out the league 3 years later
He’d snatch it from you like your Ben McLemore
Ben Mclemore best looking shot that doesn’t go in
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
Thought Ben Mclemore was going to be a guaranteed superstar
You’re gonna let Ben McLemore off scot-free?
"and Drummond, Ben McLemore"
A couple weeks later at a news conference Morey will be introducing Beasely and Dlo or Ben Mclemore and CJ as a difference maker and an all-star.
"This is fairly obvious in hindsight but it's amazing how many people on this sub didn't rate Luka at the time of the draft, it was crazy how many archaic takes about how ""you can't teach size"" and ""you gotta go with the center #1.""  Worst 2 that I was so incredibly wrong about were Trey Burke and Ben McLemore. Oof."
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
OP how tf were you high on Giannis? Nobody knew who he was and he had no film lol.  I was very right about Jamal Murray and Booker. I was very wrong about Ben McLemore and Jabari Parker (partly due to injury).
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
"Jimmer Fredette, Thomas Robinson, Ben McLemore, Nik Stauskas, Willie Cauley-Stein"
"KU could put up something like:  PG - Devonte' Graham  SG - Ben McLemore  SF/PF - Morris Twins (maybe not ideal, but come on)  C - Joel Embiid"
Ben Mclemore wore 16 when he was playing for the Rockets but wore 7 when he played for the Lakers last season
"Let’s say instead, Philly drafted the player that was immediately picked after their pick. Would this be a better team? Ben McLemore Steven Adams Aaron Gordon Zach Lavine Kristaps Porzingis Brandon Ingram London Ball"
Ben McLemore
Pelicans  2011: Josh Harrellson -&gt; Andrew Goudelock  2012: Anthony Davis -&gt; Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2013: Nerlens Noel -&gt; Ben McLemore (pick was traded for Jrue Holiday)  2014: No Pick  2015: Branden Dawson -&gt; Nikola Radičević
Ben mclemore
"I'm a little late but Ben McLemore. Came in perfectly timed to replace Ray Allen as the cleanest jumper in the league, but never actually hit the 3s."
"I predicted Ben McLemore picked first back in 2013, I swore he was gonna become special."
Ben McLemore.
wow man i miss this team   also i’m even more sad i’ve heard nothing from my boy ben mclemore
For a while every semi athletic shooting guard with a decent jumper was Ray Allen (Ben McLemore comes to mind)  Every small PG who takes deep 3s is Steph Curry
"Yea, the infamous Ben McLemore game is probably a prime example of this, as it limited Harden but led to a role player going off.  With the Barnes/Banton picks, it looks like Masai is trying to build a squad full of long switchable defenders to pair alongside OG/Siakam, that can close out on the open man, and help maximize Nurse's defensive schemes.  Unfortunately, a majority of this squad is still pretty young, and there are still some notable holes within this squad."
"The most hilariously bad Kings season was the ""Nick rocks!"" season, right after Vivek drafted Nik Stauskas, during which they fired GM Pete D'Allesandro and Coach Mike Malone, who now run the amazing program at Denver, Vivek also fired HOFer George Karl and Ty Corbin IN THE SAME SEASON, both so he could defer to keeping the sandy-vagina of Demarcus Cousins happy, all in one season, right after drafting Ben McLemore.  Ownership is the problem."
"Just about everyone in the oration was a great defender. Kuzma was solid, Danny green was good, Avery Bradley is above average, Wes Mathews was okay, plus all the people you mentioned. The only truly bad defender was Ben McLemore who barely played for that reason."
"Some heat fan replied  ""KPJ is more likely to become Ben McLemore""  Lmaoo"
Surprised Ben McLemore only got 2 AST from Bron. Even though it was a short time it looked like Bron was giving Ben open looks
1 snatch off KD &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 snatches off Ben McLemore
KD's Ben McLemore moment
"Whoa.  Okay, so obviously I was wrong about you not watching him. I apologize for that. My bad. I still disagree with your take on his skills coming out of college, however. Why they haven’t translated to the NBA, I dunno. But I believe they were there in spades as of his time at Kansas.  As for pure athleticism, I have it on pretty good authority that by the numbers McLemore was actually the best pure athlete to play for Self at Kansas. Then Wiggs, and then probably Josh and a few others. Ben just didn’t have close to Josh’s skill level. I feel like he’s a much better example of what you’re describing, in terms of just out-athleting everyone. Ben really was just a spot up shooter, fast break scorer, and lob catcher in half court sets."
"I’m still not sure how many of his games you actually watched when he was at Kansas, and I don’t mean that as an attack. Unless you’re a Kansas fan, I don’t know why you’d watch him night in and night out. But that view of him just…I dunno, man. It seems like it’s filtered through an awful lot of hindsight as he’s struggled to make the transition in the League. For example, your description of his success on the break being due to pure athleticism - Kansas has had better pure athletes at his position in recent memory. Mostly notably Andrew Wiggins and Ben McLemore. Neither of those guys were close to as good on the break as Josh, because he instinctively understood the value of spacing and had the feel for when to give it up and when to take it himself.  If anything, I think his natural understanding of the game was so good he seems to have had a hard time adjusting to NBA schemes and playbooks, because so much of what needed to be coached before he just did naturally. His mistakes on the floor now often look like the mistakes of a guy who is thinking too much instead of just trying to play basketball.  Just my opinion tho."
Ben McLemore was the real idiotic signing. Another fucking 2 guard. And then DSJ (who's at least actually looking decent). Having someone like Hartenstein for the min would make 1000x more sense than McLemore.
"He didn’t really break out until year 5 and was on his 3rd team at that point.               Nerlens Noel, Cody Zeller, and Ben Mclemore spent time as the #1 prospect. That draft class was so bad at the top."
Lebron and myself both took far too much Ben McLemore hopium.
