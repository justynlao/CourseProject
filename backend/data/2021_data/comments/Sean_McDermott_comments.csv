"I can’t tell you how much these wins mean for this team and its fans. The Spurs for years have been Grizz killers, and finally we’ve begun to figure them out. But they spoil Ja’s career high 44 points in our season opener, which started off our season sour and we began 2-6. We took a five game winning streak into a two week park. Then we got SAS twice in a row to see if we got rest or got rust. Short-handed.  Injuries for Grizz: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valanciunas, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Jontay Porter, Killian Tillie, Sean McDermott  Spurs: None  First game: Grizz W by 17  Second game: Grizz W by fuckin’ 31  Grizz Next Gen, YOU HEAR ME?!?"

Are Sean McDermott not relative to Doug?
"Congratulations, Lakers. You came out not wanting to play basketball and we scorched you 22-2.   Then the referees decided to get involved.  It shouldn't take 29 to 8 free throws for the reigning champs to hang with the Grizzlies playing without JJJ, Justise, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Deanthony Melton, Sean McDermott, and Killian Tillie."
Is it too mean to say that Dillon Brooks is the player Sean McDermott thinks he is?
I love me this whole squad. Even Sean McDermott.
Buffalo Bills HC Sean McDermott?
"Sean McDermott, da butler bulldog"

"I would argue that Kyle Anderson is better than Pat Bev. Yves Pons is on an exhibit 10 deal. Sean McDermott is currently on a two-way deal. It would be unreasonable to consider either of those players to be ""on their roster"". Xavier Tillman is mostly a Center, so he's not really a guard/forward.   I'll agree that Pat Bev is better currently than Sam Merrill, John Konchar, and Ziaire Williams, so he's better than 3/10 of the G/Fs currently on the Grizzlies roster. But now we're talking about dudes that are out of the rotation, and if they aren't playing anyway, I'd rather have youth sitting on the bench than a 33 year old dude."
"Looking at their roster on NBA.com Pat Bev is better than Kyle Anderson, John Kochar, Sean McDermott, Sam Merrill, Yves Pons, Xavier Tillman, and Ziare Williams. He’s a better role player than 7 out of 11 guards/forwards. So yes, it simply is true"
"Sources: Sean McDermott asked kelvin benjamin to join a catching drill today. Benjamin refused. McDermott asked again. Benjamin said no again. McDermott then told Benjamin he should go home, and Benjamin dropped the Popeyes biscuit and left."
Now Sean McDermott can just focus on coaching the Bills.
