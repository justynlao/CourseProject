&gt;Danny Green  [laker fans](https://media.tenor.com/images/23f59bde33dddae0a28a13837db05362/tenor.gif)
Danny Green and Patrick McCaw ought to be up for a ring
"If we can also both appreciate Danny Green, we have a special bond."
"Danny Green was great in 2019. His 23pts would’ve moved him onto the 2nd round in any other contest, unfortunately the minimum that was needed in the 2019 contest was 25, which is absolutely insane."
Danny Green did ok in 2019
"Not sure where his lack of confidence comes from but he'll need sooner or later to get his shit together.  He's almost as inconsistent as Danny Green, without the defense to make up for it!"
And next Pippen in Danny Green.
“Overrated” sounds like you people don’t even watch basketball. Look at the guards of the last 5 championships:   Kyrie and JR both not good but not trae levels of atrocious  Steph and Klay (Klay is an elite defender)  Steph and Klay  Lowry and Danny Green (both great defenders)  KCP and Danny Green (both great defenders)  Guard defense is still very important especially in this era of switching.
"haha we really were able to get rid of him for just a first rounder, AND get Danny Green back for him"
No Danny Green almost won FMVP. MVP’s are usually top 5 players in the league
Tony bradley danny green and seth curry and a churched up 2nd round pick for lowry. Masai shoves you off the phone with that offer
"Oh she undoubtedly will. Fans can be shitty enough to send stuff like that to our very own players (Danny Green), so I can almost guarantee the same deranged people will do the same thing to this random woman who got into it with LeBron James of all people."
You aint seen Danny Green and Lebron Cleveland days?
Stocky Danny Green.
"I agree Danny Green would be one of the better defenders, the steps Caruso has taken as a defender have made me feel better about the loss. Not sure how how much credit he got for this, but he saved the game against the Celtics a few days ago by defending the easy layup from Jaylen Brown causing Kemba to miss the game winner. Also Danny Green was so frustrating in the playoffs last year I’m not sure my blood pressure could handle too much more of that Lmaooo"
Matthews was/is supposed to be a plus defender but he’s been very bleh.   I’ve seen him hit like one three all year. Dude has shot worse then Danny Green last year and that’s saying something.
"Danny Green was probably the Lakers' 3rd-4th best defender, and the Lakers were a hugely defensive minded team. On this roster he would be the 3rd-4th best defender as well, he'd probably get at least 25 minutes a game tbh."
&gt;He’s not Danny Green level bruv.   When he tries to dribble he's not far off. There's a reason they don't let him iso.
"I’m not sure how much Danny Green would be playing even if he was still around. He was a real offensive liability and with how Caruso has been recently I’d rather have him 9 times out of 10 over DG.  Lakers are a lot deeper this year, we will see how it translates in the playoffs"
Where's the fan that called Dillon Brooks Fat Danny Green last game? Because now I can't unsee it.  D:
Klay has that pull up mid range off screen and post fade away tho. He’s not Danny Green level bruv.
"We don't even need guards anymore. The only real hole in the roster who plays center when embiid sits, and we're not winning shit when embiid sits anyway so it hardly matters anyway. I think we could upgrade from Danny Green but there are guys in shake, Furkan, Thybulle, and maxey on the roster who all want those minutes.   I like Kyle Lowry he's just too old to give up anything serious for him. Him and Ben also hate eachother so there's that."
&gt; maxey+ 2 1sts + danny green + vincent poirier + mike scott for lowry.  Lmao
"matching his 30 mil would be a bit of a prob though. Danny green would have to be included at the least, which would be unfortunate filler for us cos i like him personally."
Promising rookie + 2 firsts + Danny Green for an expiring 35 year old Lowry.
"&gt;Explain what you value  I don't really understand why people would have a different opinion than me on this.   When you're ranking players currently (obviously accolades *matter* in all-time discussions), NOTHING that happened more than 3-4 years ago has any weight whatsoever.  This year matters. Last year matters. Two years ago matters...three years ago? Starting to not matter.   Second, you have to understand the goals of the team, and the role of the player. Just because somebody's inefficient doesn't mean he's bad *if* the alternative to his inefficient shots is worse.  Low-volume, high-efficiency players are useful, but you can't shoot your wad about Danny Green or Otto Porter or Jae Crowder being ""legitimate all-stars"" or some other nonsense. They're good. They're useful. They're not going to suddenly become go-to guys on good teams. Efficiency doesn't always scale. The somewhat inefficient bench guard taking bad shots in the half-court is still probably better than letting Danny Green dribble, or expecting Otto Porter to create his own shot.  Third, and maybe most importantly, after a certain point, skillsets and potential and all of that stop mattering. At some point, you are basically who you are, and if that trajectory is flat...it's time to stop pretending a guy is an umolded piece of clay. The major exception to this is guys who have never really had a role."
"We also got their 34th overall that draft, Theo Maledon. So just barely not a late a first. And he looks like a super solid contributor already. Seems like a solid return. Green was an expiring and we had absolutely no use for him, other teams can see that, and unfortunately it's going to lower his value a bit unless a bidding war breaks out, and I can't see that happening for Danny Green."
I wouldn't call Danny Green worthless in this scenario. could be worth something in the deadline to several teams.
"Boris was definitely great in 2013 and 2014 but was he a role player ? His versatility allowed him to do a lot of things. Danny Green played 3D, Belinelli was a spot up shooter but I would have a hard time defining Boris ""role""."
"&gt;Looking at them separately gives you more information, not less, and even those have to be looked at with context.   No.  Nominal stat splits are partial components of BPM, and it leaves readers who have strongly varying degrees of credibility try to analyze what those stats mean to the bottom line of a player's incidence of getting his team points while stopping the opponent from doing the same.  It's as if you had a taste test for a food dish, but instead had contestants taste only the ingredients separately, and even leave some ingredients out.    I reread the entire thread from the start of your retort.  It's weird that you use an intelligent phrase like ""biggest fallacies in statistics,"" but then make contradictory and confusing arguments, with the only common denominator being that you don't think stats with any kind of subjective component is credible; this is a personal incredulity logical fallacy (""*because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you made out like it's probably not true*"").  You've implicated that box stats are credible (stat splits) or not credible (BPM) in different posts.  BPM's not not credible just b/c you don't understand it.    And, despite criticizing subjectivity bias, you implicate your subjective opinion that NetRtg is a particularly credible stat, even in small sample sizes.  No it isn't.  I just did a little bit of research; Danny Green was the team leader in the stat last postseason, and by a lot; he wasn't even close to the best playoff performer on the team, if you watched their games.  Since the stat only looks at team scoring while a player's on the court, you need really large sample sizes for the stat to mean anything, and even then it can be janky.  If your grandma shared the exact court time with Michael Jordan, they'd have the same NetRtg; RPM wouldn't show such.  From earlier...  &gt; not sure why you think advanced stats portray LeBron badly.   Basic box stat measures like BPM suggest AD and LeBron have had about the same impact, when it's clear to anyone who watched a number of games (at least last season, I haven't watched any this year yet) that LeBron is clearly the more valuable player; no regular in r/Lakers last season would've disputed this.  The team was 5-2 when LeBron played and AD was out, further lending credibility to RPM, along with the fact that AD's teams never did particularly well, until he joined LeBron."
Danny Green is 0-3 in my book.  13 owned by chris bosh  14 cheated by turning off the A/C  20 switched teams in the finals
"You are wilding. Kawhi has 0 regular season MVP worthy season, where a case can be made. His first title he wasn’t the top dog, he played in a dynasty, but stepped up massively in the finals, his second title they beat a completely broken down Warrior team without Klay for 3 games, and KD with a torn Achilles. The only series in either title run where he dominated was vs the Sixers. Titles are as much a product of timing as of individual skill. If Ray Allen doesn’t hit that shot, Danny fucking Green has a shout for FMVP, he was immense in G5&amp;6."
Kinda over Danny Green if I'm being honest
"Also tried to kick danny green that game, and tried to pull kawhi's arm out of socket that game as well.  Was insane how he wasn't ejected for as long as it went on.  Think he might of got kicked out at some point way too late eventually though."
Reddick and Kemba aren't terrible matchups for players like Danny Green and Seth Curry. Jaylen and Jayson on Ben and Tobias; and then whatever center is up next to be tooled on by Embiid. It's a good player archetype to have in the toolbox.  Otherwise he can run in lineups where it's normally Jaylen or Jayson + bench mob. Or lineups where it's Jaylen or Jayson + Smart + bench mob.
"I think they suggested A) two of Thybulle, Joe, or Maxey plus Harris and 2 first rounders or B) Danny Green, plus other expirings instead of Harris."
"Between Curry, Green, Maxey, Thybulle, Milton I don't see him getting any playing time. I also don't see why we would give anything up for a 37 year old. Outside of an easily replaceable Dwight Howard and a pretty good Danny Green we have a very young team with many years to compete if it stays together. Giving up anything at all for a guy who wouldn't see the playoff rotation makes no sense."
"You mentioned Danny Green and Seth Curry as how you address weaknesses and build a team.  Jrue has been a bigger upgrade over Bledsoe than probably expected.  Difference is Bucks have lost more games since the defense fell off after the pandemic, the bench guard play has been awful, and the Bucks bad shooting games have aligned with good opponent shooting games."
"I mean, are Seth Curry and Danny Green those guys?  Not sure why you are holding 76ers as a model of team building when they haven't addressed their lack of shot creation.  I don't think the Bucks are winning it all, but I think their far superior shot creation to Philly is an advantage come playoff time.  The Bucks offense has actually been better than Philly's this season.  Awful postseason production from the PG position was an issue for the Bucks in the past and Jrue could help address that."
"Last night should be crystal clear to the green teamers that Brad Stevens and Danny Ainge are not fit to lead this franchise, but they will continue to scream until they are red in the face ""the future is bright"" ""next year is our year!""  Brad Stevens is the Celtics equivalent of Scott Brooks/Mark Jackson and should be fired ASAP because he's holding the team back. Danny Ainge has not done a single good thing for this franchise after drafting Jayson Tatum. He's getting old and should retire for both the sake of his health and the sake of this franchise."
"My dude, there is no way our offense is worse than last year. Rondo doesn’t even play in the reg season and Danny Green was mediocre all season long. Dennis and Harrell are clear upgrades offensively. Our offense is not clicking right now because of the obvious coasting by some players. Vogel is experimenting with lineups that includes THT. This is clearly like the reg season bubble. I agree with Dennis needing to play more in control though"
Holiday just isn't someone that addresses their issues.      Seth Curry and Danny Green addressed Philly's weakness of shooting for example and that's why they're more successful this year. That's how you build a team.       Milwaukee replaced a borderline allstar with all defence level D that can't shoot...for another borderline allstar with all defence level D that can't shoot.
Danny Green - injuring Klay and ending our dynasty
"yup our development of guys that other teams cut shows the player development aspect.   guys like patty mills, gary neal, danny green, aaron baynes, etc. were all nobodies and ended up playing a huge role in the playoffs"
"I mean the real 3 &amp; D guys are still very valuable to contending teams.   Look at guys this season like KCP, Batum, Bridges, PJ Tucker, and Danny Green etc. Very important to the team"
"oh yea I forgot about them! People that come to mind include:  1) Aaron Baynes who we brought over from Australia and literally no one had heard of him  2) Patty Mills - never really played any meaningful minutes in portland and now is one of the best 6th men in the league  3) Danny Green - got cut from a really bad cleveland team, now is one of the premier 3 &amp; D guys in the league  4) Boban - enough said"
"Call me crazy, but I think Gordon is definitely above league average and Crowder is JUST a smidge above. Maybe Danny Green a few years ago too. I also don’t hate Plumlee, but he definitely is what he is"
DJ Augustin  Eric Gordon  Danny Green  Jae Crowder  Mason Plumlee  Actually has solid spacing and is solid defensively.
"I think the top 5 playing now are: Rudy Gobert, CJ Mccollum, Hassan Whiteside, Danny Green, and Fred VanVleet"
"Sixers connections to the g league are deep: Robert Covington spent a full season in the g league, Danny Green hung around there a couple months too.  Shake Milton putting up 15 a game this year after spending most of two seasons down in Delaware iirc."
Danny Green didn't START in the G League but he's in every fucking commercial
"I like this mentality, I think Danny Green did it before and it really helped him"
"Sixers preferred having in season flexibility with the MLE for the buyout market.   Had essentially no cap space and while he was definitely good, don’t think he really improves the team all that much one way or another.   Shake Milton is under contract for years cheap, and it’s more worth it to give him mins to develop. Korkmaz, while extremely limited, can play a bench shooters role. Drafting Maxey, giving more mins to Thybulle, trading for Danny Green and Seth etc. also factor in.   Sixers prioritized having a bench big so they signed Dwight.   Would’ve been happy with Burks back, but doesn’t change all that much"
? AD’s legit one of my favorite players but his defense and offense have realistically been inconsistent this season. He let Danny green blew by him ffs
Huh? We played games with 7 fuckin players lol. Our only available starter was danny green.
Matisse has been a straight up terror on d this year. Once his shot gets better Danny Green will be out the lineup.
Embiid could own them on the inside and Simmons is a lockdown defender that could guard one of their stars.  Danny Green and Thybulle are solid defenders and Philly has shooters so it's definitely possible.
"He’s my favorite target for the Sixers this year, I think he would seriously kick them up another notch to being a legit contender.  We can cobble together the salary with Danny Green + back end guys (Poirer, Scott, Ferguson, etc.), and then it comes down to the actual assets.  I’d start with Matisse and a 1st as the base, but I don’t think that gets it done. The Sixers likely wouldn’t want to give up Milton or Maxey, but I think either makes it enough for the Raptors. Does Isaiah Joe/Korkmaz and a high 2nd (we have the Knicks for this year) push it over the edge? I don’t know, probably not.  It’s tricky cause Lowry’s really good, but is also very old, and expiring. The expiring matters less to me since I think he’d happily resign in Philly, but it makes his value hard to pin down. I’d be curious to hear Raptors fans opinion on it."
Because Kawhi and Danny Green left
Smh.. Danny Green?
"PHI receives: Beal  MIN receives: Simmons  WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Danny Green, PHL 2023, 2027 FRP, MIN 2021, 2023 FR swaps"
"Imagine Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Joel Embiid.  Fuck..."
"And people also forget that, while other teams were having games canceled, the 76ers were forced to play with only one healthy starter (Danny Green), and only 7 healthy players. Their record would quite possibly be a bit better too if half the team wasn't out (or if they weren't forced to keep playing with only 7 guys)."
You mean you won't accept Danny Green + our scraps and some shitty firsts for beal?   bullshit
"Imagine the 2020 Lakers with AD, Bron, Dwight, and Rondo. And Danny Green would actually make shots."
"Then why would you rather have Danny Green who completely collapsed in the playoffs last year? If we talk TS%, he shot worse than Dennis this year in three straight playoffs.    Yes, TS% is an important stat, but let's not forget sometimes players figure it out at some point, especially after going to a new team"
"09/10 Cavs had LeBron and Shaq, and we also would have had prime Ilgauskas (before all the broken feet and fused bones), Antawn Jamison and Danny Green."
I would honestly rather have Danny Green and the pick at this moment. Danny has straight up been better than Dennis this year.
OKC won the Danny Green trade
"Sixers get 2011 Dwight , 2014 Danny Green, and rookie Ben Simmons"
He's improved defensively those last 2 years so he's still a decent player but I wonder if the Lakers won't have to go back to last years model with Matthews in the Danny Green role (or even Caruso) in the playoffs.
"The 2012-13 Spurs would be up there.   Duncan, Manu, Parker, Kawhi, Stephen Jackson, T-Mac, Diaw &amp; Danny Green. They also had ARON BAYNES."
"Last year when the Lakers had Dwight, Danny Green, Rondo, I would’ve said them.  For this season, I gotta go with the Rockets. Prime boogie, Wall, Oladipo, Gordon, and Wood.  Perfect spacing. Elite perimeter defense with above average rim protection. Playmaking, half-court, full-court, inside out, whatever you need, this team has it.  And if they still have Tyson Chandler or Kenneth Faried or Nene, throw them in to"
"Yes, I picked the Lakers to win it all last year before the season as much as I hated it. Playoff Rondo, Danny Green, and rejuvenated Dwight were all guys with playoff experience. KCP I didn't trust yet, but he had the makings of somebody who would succeed with LeBron. Even somebody like Caruso who was an unknown at the time, seemed like somebody who could be a positive impact player because he was aware of his limitations, and played his role.   The only 2 players that I didn't trust last year on their team that played in the playoffs were Kuzma and Kief.   This year, there's only 6.5 guys that I trust on their team: LeBron, AD, Gasol, KCP, Caruso, THT, and Schroder is the half, because he's going to have good games where he looks great and really helps them, but he's also going to have bad games where he's unplayable.  Obviously I have faith in LeBron, he's the most trustworthy player maybe in NBA history, it's more the roster around him that I have an issue with."
"&gt; Schroder can play in the playoffs  He definitely can, but I wouldn't close games with him, if they are playing the Clippers for example, Kawhi can just mismatch hunt him.   If I were them, I would close with Caruso/KCP/THT/LeBron/AD (I acknowledge that's putting a lot of faith in THT), because that's my strongest 5 defensively. It's putting a lot on LeBron's plate offensively though.   &gt; They need another big man  Well, in theory they could just not play him, and exclusively play Gasol and AD at center, though that means they have to play more of their perimeter players, who as we've acknowledged, are not very good, and Harrell might cause chemistry problems if he's not playing or plays reduced minutes.   I think last year people underestimated the veteran experience of Rondo, Danny Green, and Dwight, all 3 players had played hundreds of playoff games before, and knew what their role was and stuck to it. The only player they brought in this year who fits along those lines is Marc Gasol, and to a lesser extent Wes Matthews, though he might be washed.   /u/kobmug_v2 your thoughts?"
Danny Green is just as IcyHot as ever though.
Crazy to think Kawhi and Danny Green were also with those guys.
"Lmao spot on, seeing Danny Green dribble is a scary sight."
"They need to drill that into Oubre, like no ambiguity about it. Get the ball, not open? Give it back to Steph. Wide open? Take the shot.  The dude is straight-up a moron when it comes to playmaking, he has the Danny Green syndrome where every dribble he takes exponentially increases the chance of him doing something stupid."
That UNC team with him and Danny green had some serious shooting for college ball.
"I say 3. I recall seeing Danny Green pulling up from the top of the arc and ending up landing at the key due to his momentum, that's still a 3"
"Starting him over Danny Green or Seth Curry would absolutely be the move.  At this point you really aren't giving Murray enough credit, imo.  Murray, Green, Simmons, Harris, Embiid would be an insane starting 5.  There is more than enough defense on that floor, and Murray is capable of being at least average on that end, and the offense is probably the best in the league.  Like come on dude"
Blake 'Danny Curry Green Steph' Griffin
"He can start over Danny Green. Move Curry to the 2, Tobias at the 3 and Put Draymond in 4"
"Klay Thompson going lava hot in Game 6, 2019 Finals only to have Lopsided Head Azz Danny Green ruin him on a fast break"
Facts it’s actually annoying to watch. It’s ok to have bad shooting nights but even when he’s playing dude gives no effort. He got blown by by fuckinf danny green somehow
"Compared to last season's lineups with Caruso, KCP, and Danny Green, it's basically added offense and scrambling defense. Lakers do lose out on size with Dennis in the lineup and can't switch as effectively but they're quicker and more potent offensively."
"Danny Green was an atrocious 3PT shooter in the finals last year with LeBron and AD providing looks and spacing. Sometimes shots aren't falling. Like Green missing shots doesn't mean LeBron was bad, same can be said for Luka and having Iwundu and Green bricking wide open 3s."
"danny green, mike scott, maxey, isaiah joe and all our picks who says no"
We didnt get Dennis to play defense we wanted another scorer if defense is the vase we would have kept Danny Green. He scored 0 in the first half.
Dennis was really good in the second half last night. Took Danny Green out of the game because he couldn't hang and played good defense on the other end.
Watching Danny green take that 3 was like no no no no no no okay.
2013 Finals Danny Green was the most bezerk shooting stretch I’ve ever seen in a championship series (until he went ice cold in the last 2 games)
also when they have seth curry and danny green instead of average al and jrich
This guys a moron btw. He was saying in another thread Danny Green shouldn't get a ring. Lmao he's a bronsexual.
"I couldn’t believe Tobias didn’t get the ball the previous possession too. He had the same matchup vs Caruso and would’ve been able to get off a good look, but instead Simmons passed to Danny Green in the corner who attempted a very contested three."
*Danny green is subbed in for Seth curry.* Every other team in NBA: PACK THE PAINT
"How is it unrealistic? Lowry is 35 and expiring, Danny green and a pick or 2 should get the deal done. Lowry is gonna walk and the raps aren’t doing good"
Fuck danny green :( 2 years of Klay for one contested dunk.
"Some of these deals are really bad for WAS. The price for Beal should be similar to Harden’s. He’s not as good but he’s four years younger.   PHL receives: Beal  MIN receives: Ben Simmons  WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Danny Green, MIN 2021 FRP, PHL 2023+2027 FRP, PHL first rd swaps in 2024+2026."
Pat McCaw and/or Danny Green won the last 5
Well Kawhi couldn't get traded back to the Raptors so he's just bringing them to LA one at a time. Only Siakam left and it's a full reunion. Except Danny Green screwed up and joined the wrong LA.
"I think what you meant is ""Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, or JR Smith have won the last 9 NBA championships."""
Danny Green and not contest Klay
2013 Derrick rose could guard Danny green
That doesn't mean you aren't wildly underrating him. Danny Green is a high level NBA starter and Jordan will be qualifying for Medicare in a few years. This comparison is ridiculous lmao
Jordan is nearly 60 years old and probably out of shape. Danny Green was just a key starter on two consecutive NBA championship teams and is currently a key starter on the \#1 team in the East. Stop the disrespect lmao
"Bro how does that makse sense lol? Did you predirct Kawhi being on the raptors in 2017? Did you predict them acquiring gasol, danny green or even jeremy lin? Yet you act like its a forgone conclusion that if Kawhi stayed, the raptors roster would some how still be like this. And I don't need to be in his head to know that he wanted to go home. He, his agent and family literraly made that quite clear over the last 3 years by SAYING they only wanted to leave the spurs for LA, and by ONLY meeting with LA teams in free agency when much better teams were potentially available."
"Danny Green, let Klay make the layup without contesting"
Marcus jordan is ass Danny green would cook him
anyone can guard danny green
Counterpoint:   2012 - James Jones  2013 - James Jones  2014 - Danny Green  2015 - Shaun Livingston  2016 - James Jones  2017 - Shaun Livingston  2018 - Shaun Livingston  2019 - Danny Green  2020 - Danny Green
Kyrie Irving and Danny Green
"and danny green, and the tobi-whisperer"
I'd take him over Danny Green or Lou Williams
Danny Green literally waited until Kawhi signed in FA because if Kawhi re-signed then he was also going to and if he didn't then he was going to take the biggest offer
"It’s not a given at all that Danny Green would be on the team, and id still take the Clippers supporting cast any day. PG is much better than anyone the raptors have.  regular season success also means virtually nothing. They lost to Boston in 7 who had a worse record."
Danny green has one more ring than kawhi so kawhi doesn’t even need to be here tbh
"LeBron, Curry, *Danny Green"
Danny green
Why isn't Danny Green playing?
Trust me come playoffs you’ll want Ben to have those shots over Danny Green.
they shoulda put him up against danny green i woulda been into that
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3. Bobby Simmons 4. **Matt Barnes** 5. Grant Hill 6. Lamar Odom 7. **Jared Dudley** 8. Danny Granger 9. Antawn Jamison 10. Stephen Jackson 11. Hedo Turkoglu 12. Reggie Bullock 13. Dahntay Jones 14. Jordan Hamilton 15. **Paul Pierce** 16. Lance Stephenson 17. **Jeff Green** 18. **Wesley Johnson** 19. Josh Smith 20. **Luc Mbah a Moute**"
Blake going to the nets doesn't make them any more of a superteam than they were previously though. Like I'm pretty sure adding Danny Green would've been more impactful
"Philly can’t just offload people. Tobias is a huge contract and not taking anything back salary wise for him, is next to impossible   And they would only have 29m left on the books. With 7 players on the roster, 6 of them guards.   They won’t improve this way.   The only way for them to improve, is to trade Danny Green and an asset(s) of some kind, for a player somewhere within Danny’s salary range. Then they can have all 4 of Ben, Joel, Tobias and whoever this player is."
No. Most people thought the spurs were a surefire playoff team when we traded for DeRozan considering the trade was basically Danny Green for Jakob Poeltl and DeRozan since Kawhi didn't even play the year before.
at least we'll get Danny Green back Sadge
"&gt; . A ball handler   ehhhhh  But I'm all-in on a DG for Patty swap. I love Danny Green, and he'd be a better fit on this roster anyway."
"Depends on the night, idk if there is much rhyme or reason to it. He didnt guard beal and didnt spend a ton of time on booker or dame until later in those games.   Doc seems to send Danny Green out there as a human sacrifice in the first half a lot of the time."
"No they shouldn't. That idea is beyond terrible.  1. The difference in talent between the NBA and the D League (fuck Gatorade) is so large. Danny Green would be one of the best players if he was sent down.  2. Guys on bad teams are trying. If you do bad at your job you are just a mediocre employee, if an NBA player is bad at his job he gets replaced. Why would guys want to get replaced? Tanking happens when you build a team of bad players.  3. All this would would just waste the careers of guys on bad teams.  4. Going back to #1, the team that was relagated would be promoted back every year and the team that was moved up from the D League will move back down every year.  This is dumb"
"Yeah, that's the one. It doesnt seem particularly creative I think Embiid just doesnt have his priorities straight there.   The screen assists thing definitely gets overhyped by some but when your best perimeter defenders are a 6'10 guy and the ghost of Danny Green its a big factor for sure.   Have you noticed any teams defend that particularly well? I feel like you just have to have the center come up higher but idk if embiid is ever going to be super willing or able to pull that off."
"Yeah I dont want to become the thing I hate hyping up Gobert screen assists but it was definitely a factor. I would agree that Ingles one was on Simmons. There was another play just like that one in the first quarter Ingles walked into a wide open 3, Danny Green was the one who couldnt get over the screen that one though I thought was more on Embiid in that situation shouldve gotten up more.   This [might be hte one your talking about](https://go.nba.com/dnbc). I actually dont think Utah did that much out of the ordinary or that was particularly creative but yeah the threat of it is enough to get a defenders attention."
"Doc runs defensive schemes like he will in the playoffs vs Teams with multiple stars. For example, when playing the Nets without KD, Danny Green was on Harden, and got absolutely torched whilst Simmons guarded nobodies. Then to close the game Simmons switches onto their best player irrespective of the playoff matchup."
I still love Doc and I'm a UNC fan so I love Danny Green so you guys have that going for you
"Yes hello, the sixers offer Danny green and some picks"
"honestly your team - Danny Green + a late 1st. But I love Josh Hart and would love to plug him into the Sixers starting lineup at the 3, and would trade a late 1st for him straight up even without the other two. Also, even though JJ looks washed this year if you're gonna have a shooter off the bench I'd still rather it be JJ than Green. Also some sentimentality with JJ if I'm being honest."
I dont think so.. its hard to downgrade from danny green
"Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, and a 1st"
"Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Top 20 Protected 1st"
Ben was on westbrook and Danny green was getting torched all night.
Yeah Wes is definitely a huge downgrade from Danny Green
Danny Green lol don't even have to think about it
TLC 36.3% from 3 getting paid $1.8mil  Danny Green 37.6% from 3 getting paid $15.3mil  ..I know which one I would rather
Don’t forget either Embiid or Simmons frantically dribbling the clock out and driving just to kick it out to Danny Green for a contested 3 that ends in a brick and the Nets win. Gotta love 2K logic
He’s really bad...ya’ll want Danny Green and some picks for him?
"Danny Green was washed, uninformed fans keep acting like he was a huge loss. He nearly cost both the Raptors and Lakers a ring, and they won in spite of his playoff performance."
"For Sure man, hope y'all win it all if we don't to further the Danny Green agenda."
"If he’s not scoring, he’s a huge liability. Like Danny Green but without the on ball/help defense. Glad he got paid, but the Wizards made a mistake paying him that much."
"I was expecting a step down from Danny Green in the 3 and D department, but he looks fucking terrified of shooting or even *touching* the ball. He has been outplayed by Alfonzo McKinnie the last couple games; by a wide margin."
"Literally comes down to either Danny Green being able to turn on the defense in the playoffs (as currently constructed) or what Morey does. Much more hopeful about the latter.  But between Simmons, Tobias and Embiid (and potentially Thybulle if he can make enough of an offensive jump to be viable for playoff minutes) Sixers probably stand the best chance stifling the Nets out of all the East teams in a series.  I'm more worried about the poor 3 attempt numbers because trading 2s for 3s against Brooklyn won't cut it."
"wow, was that a Danny Green three?"
If Danny green keeps shooting I'll be happy.
Danny Green pulling up for 3 when Embiid is running into the paint alone is a big W for the Jazz
ok I think we've seen enough Danny Green today
When Danny green is cold hes sooo cold
"I'm guessing that we're seeing Danny ""Icy"" Green tonight."
Danny Green is quite bad every time I watch him play
Danny Green being a good vet by rubbing off on Joel
Ngl this just made remember when the Spurs PA team introduced Danny Green before Leonard in an attempt to stifle the booing lol
"Terrance Ferguson, even though he’s not on my team anymore  He could have been a more athletic Danny Green, but instead he is literally too scared to touch a basketball. When it’s passed to him, he doesn’t even look at the basket. He just passes it right back. No confidence whatsoever"
Danny Green
Danny green takes at least one shot per game that just makes you scratch your head
"Biased take... Rob Pelinka? Kinda obvious if you think about it.   Lost McGee, Dwight, Rondo, Avery Bradley, and Danny Green.   Gained Trez, Gasol, Schröder, Wesley Matthews  Drafted Talen Horton Tucker who has broken out for us   Recently signed Damian Jones who has been doing really well"
And Danny Green
"About Danny Green and some seconds for both Gordon and Tucker, no thanks"
"Heavy disagree, that sounds an awful lot like hindsight talking. Danny Green had one foot out of the NBA and was on his last chance (and had already been cut by the Spurs once) when he finally flourished, Bertans had never averaged more than 12 ppg and had questionable defense even in Europe, even Mills had only shown abilities as a scorer internationally but looked like he’d be another undersized shooting guard eventually forced to play his career internationally when the Spurs added him.  Samanic is the youngest project the Spurs have ever taken on, but he absolutely had flashes of potential in his (relatively few) games as a teenager in Europe. His biggest flaw as a prospect coming in was sample size, but he clearly had athletic potential for his size. His first summer league stat line was also basically equal to Keldon’s (in the same year no less) which further shows that he wasn’t just some random tall dude that the Spurs reached for.   It doesn’t mean the guy had 0 basketball talents of any kind coming into the league just because you haven’t seen the Spurs play him a great deal in the last 18 months to avoid setting him up for failure. In the same vein, just because all the names I listed above became strong NBA role players doesn’t mean they all didn’t have several question marks about their ability to hold an NBA job before developing with the Spurs."
Thanks for posting. I want to make sure I understand this correctly. Danny Green....posted that....1 day ago?
I’d also like to point out that the Nuggets got a freebie against the 76ers where all of our starters besides Danny Green were out.
"we gotta start bullying KCP again, and wes matthews lookin worse than danny green last season lol"
IM GETTING PTSD FROM DANNY GREEN MISSING THOSE 3S FROM THE BUBBLE
"kcp is almost a net negative at this point. before the season he was considered the lakers best 3 point shooter, pretty much the only premier 3&amp;D player LA had. and now he’s danny green. wtf happened"
Wesley “Danny Green” Matthews
"Lol 100%. I almost did a spit take thinking cov was a joke. He is like those opposite of who I think about when I think skills challenge. Who are they gonna recruit next, danny green?"
"Lol Hield, 40 year old dirk, seth curry, danny green and joe harris   &gt;all stars"
"That is clearly way weaker. Average fans don’t give a shit about Danny green, Seth curry, buddy hield and Joe Harris"
"Um 2019?  Steph, Dame, Kemba, Hield, Middleton, Dirk. And then Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the Champion Joe Harris.   The 3 point contest is consistently star studded nowadays this is absolutely no different from the usual."
"Probably not, but it’s hard to say for sure. This results based analysis of individual players’ games is idiotic. Hakeem Olajuwon was not better than James Harden is *because* he won two championships.   The guy is acting like someone said Danny Green is better than Hakeem Olajuwon."
"The validity of the plan depends entirely on who the role players are. Last year it was a great plan, our entire roster was questionable from three.  This year those role players are Seth Curry and Danny Green, leaving those guys open is a lot more dangerous."
"&gt; Having 30 mil in cap for the Hornets is different than a team like the Lakers having 30 mil in cap.   Just FYI, the last time the Lakers had $30 million in cap space they used it to sign free agents Danny Green, KCP, Boogie and Javale McGee."
Nah it looked horrible at the time of the trade and it looks horrible now. Especially when a decent Danny Green was also a part of that package
"We're starting seth curry and the corpse of danny green. As much as I love the team's current composition, team defense is all five players. And neither of those guys can stop players from driving at this point in their careers. Plus fast break defense against quick players has been atrocious with everyone outside of ben simmons and thybulle."
"I think you're trying to turn them into some scrubs when they were basically the best defensive playoff team since 2004. I'm sorry, but who did the Warriors have besides Draymond who could even exist within 10 feet of Lebron, much less defend him? Igoudala? Meanwhile the Raptors had the 3 above, plus Danny Green and Ibaka who could all play very physically. And OG didn't even get a chance to play because of appendicitis."
He’s not like either of those players. He’s a 3 and D player with strong passing skills. Danny green can barely dribble and JJ is not known for his defense or his passing abilities.
Redick creates his own looks very often. You mean Danny Green
Why is everyone who talks about this trade leaving out that the raptors also got Danny green. He was a key piece in the trade and a starter on the championship team
No Danny Green so they probably wouldn't win the chip.
I’m thinking Danny green and Tony Bradley for Zach Lavine. Who’s says no? /s
Danny Draymond Green
Anyone Danny Green was guarding Lowry can cover as well or better.
"Yeah true, the only reason I think it's a bit more is that they literally did have Mikal Bridges but then traded his rights for the rights to Smith.   So at the very least they could've had Bridges, who is starting and playing very well for an elite team this season. Having him instead of Danny Green out there (assuming everything afterwards played out the same way) would be a pretty big upgrade."
Mentioning how trezz was killed in the nuggets series but not how mcgee was also played off the floor is bad faith arguing lol. Gasol is a better defender than dwight or mcgee who all get killed in space against quick players and fits better around AD because he can space the floor. Kuzma got 8.6 mil a year which is perfectly fine like that's not killing anyone's cap. Schroeder was a good pickup considering what they gave up its not like you can get a elite pg for danny green and change lol.
"I mean, Nate Duncan has some bad takes, but these aren’t THAT bad with the proper context.   They were super high on Smith coming out of the draft as were a lot of people. The Mavericks, a very smart organization, allegedly celebrated when he fell to their pick at 9. At that point, Booker wasn’t much other than a talented scorer who had real weaknesses and didn’t seem to be someone who drove winning (to he was the 13th pick in his draft, it’s not like he was some Zion-like prospect). I don’t fault someone for thinking Smith was a better prospect at that particular point. Clearly wrong, but not laughably stupid at the time. Especially since Duncan has definitely admitted to being wrong on both fronts.  And Danny Green WAS arguably a better shooting guard than Booker when Nate said that (I’m guessing probably a few years ago, although I could be wrong). Booker is WAY more talented, obviously, and is way better offensively, but Green’s defense was a huge reason why he was the starting SG on back-to-back championship teams. If you just wanted to win a playoff series, having Green’s defense and supporting skills on offense is probably more valuable than a very good offensive player who’s ‘bleh’ at best defensively."
"Kcp and Danny Green are 3 &amp; d, you think klay  fits in this group?"
Yeah Gordon is also a legit floor spacer regardless of what his %s are teams guard him. The anti Josh Richardson per se. Solid on ball defender who can switch actually like him better vs quicker guards than Danny green. He has issues never passes not good at quick decision making and injuries are also a concern. But still I think it’s worth it   Lowry is hard to gauge he’s an FA after this year but my guess is he won’t be a raptor next year. I actually think Toronto would listen even with their recent streak if someone made a legit offer.
"""Dennis Smith Jr is a better prospect than Devin Booker""  ""Danny Green is a better shooting guard than Devin Booker""  I'm okay being a low-IQ fan if those are high-IQ takes."
"Yeah, Embiid was able to hedge on screens since bobi isn't quick enough to take advantage of the space. The mavs tried to adapt by bringing in johnson to start the second half but it wasn't working either. Luka got going a bit when they were able to get danny green to guard him after quick transitions or off ball movement/screens. Ben is also really good at dodging screens and not letting Luka get the switch most of the time."
I think I would also if Kyle Lowry isn’t available and no deal is to be had there   Gordon is frankly better than Danny green. The issue is the tax whatever ownership says publicly it’s always on any owners mind. This is frankly part of why the curry/Richardson deal happened they knew Richardson would cost a good bit more than Seth after 2021. Still if they aren’t cheap I would do it
&gt; do people still think Dwight is good?  Depends how many more blowouts on national tv there are for Dwight to eat vs backups in garbage time like last night   What about Danny green for Eric Gordon? I would do it if I were houston. It’s a gamble if your Philly that contract could end up sucking again as soon as next year. But i think Gordon would help them more than Danny
"Yeah but who is on Harden, that’s why the Nets are so tough, we would have to put like Danny Green on him."
If only Danny Green is two steps late...
Danny Green decides not to go for the block and take out Klay.  Or a pump fake on the iggy layup would’ve been nice
No TD was a scrub getting carried by Danny Green trust me
"All nba center was the weakest position for half a decade hence why deandre jordan was all nba first Team one year.  And no, Danny Green would have been the fmvp."
Danny Green. Always been on winners. 3 rings with three teams as a starter. Paid well.
"As a coach he's great but as a President of Basketball Operations he's terrible the last few years. The Kawhi trade was inexcusable. He has a conflict of interest that makes him prioritize short term gains (having the team not suck) over long term goals (which may require tanking).   Getting DeRozan for 3 fucking years on the max was a terrible move by a coach that wanted a team that will be good no matter what, even knowing it can never contend. It was guaranteed mediocrity. That we lost Danny Green in that trade is even more perplexing."
Danny green is the new Patrick McCaw. Philly winning it this year
I member. As good as the day fucking Danny green tried to block already done dunk and injure Klay.
Danny Green + McCaw is a powerful combo
Maybe you didn't watch the series but we were a danny green 3 away from winning in 5. Gg tho.
"Somewhat relevant: One funny thing LeBron gets criticized for is passing to open teammates late in games (like Danny Green in Game 5 last year). But even Jordan did it too at times. We know about the Kerr shot, but in Game 1 the 1997 Finals MJ passed to Luc Freaking Longley for a game-tying shot (which he made)."
Danny Green on Klay in the finals twice     Kawhi shoulder checking Looney out the finals
"I think they would have repeated. They were on fire for most of the year. They had an amazing defense, great offensive threats, a really deep team, and one of the best coaches in the game that maximized his talent every night. The Raptors finished with the #2 record in the NBA last season without Kawhi and were one game away from making it to the ECF, despite Siakam playing terrible in the bubble. Kawhi is one of the best ceiling raisers in the league, and Lowry, Siakam, and FVV, could play more of their natural roles on the team, with Kawhi being the main scoring threat on the team. I think they would have beaten Miami in 5 or 6, with Kawhi on the team last year.    Remember in the regular season, when the Raptors shut down the Lakers twice when they played them? They were the best defensive team when on, and were an incredible team without Kawhi, so imagine if they actually had a top 5 player in addition to their already great roster? Gasol, Siakam, Lowry, FVV, Powell, Boucher, Ibaka, OG, etc. Danny Green would have also resigned with the Raptors, as he was waiting for Kawhi to make his decision and he took too long to decide IIRC, and that made Green go to the Lakers.   They had the perfect defense to beat the Lakers. Enough offense to beat them as well. And I think Nurse could have outcoached Vogel in a playoff series."
"I think the missing link here is what the Lakers roster looks like in response.   In the hypothetical, does Kawhi re-sign early, leading to Danny Green re-signing too, and the Lakers have most/all of free agency to use their cap space?  Who do the Lakers sign instead of waiting on Kawhi then picking up Danny Green?"
"I think Raptors take it in 6 or 7.    This is if Danny Green stays as well, meaning Lakers would've had to replace him with someone else.  Not sure who, but Danny was a major piece in winning for the Lakers who knows how to fit into any system as a solid veteran.    The Raptors would be able to keep the role players at bay while letting Lebron/AD have their share.    I think the other guys on TOR struggled last year because Kawhi left and their roles weren't as solidified.  Siakim would've been better as a #2 or #3 and OG would be another solid body to throw in there.  I don't think any team was close to being as good as that potential Raptor team in the East last year"
"I mean, I don’t watch the timbs either, but 15th man on the worst team in the league? I’d say bust for someone who’s supposed to be a kcp/Danny green with handles"
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
Never forget that Danny Green did [this ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQqSRWsx9ErOxOKjYEO0uKTdyCKKUgIiPMz9g&amp;usqp=CAU) in front of the holocaust memorial.
just don't compare Manu to Danny Green please  such an insult
"If being a role player on championship teams is what make a player great now, I guess Danny Green is better than Charles Barkley. Manu never could have led a team to the WCF as the #1 option like Jokic did last season, he’s already way better than Ginobli."
"I think he's saying you're more able to get into a rhythm if you're shooting a bunch of free throws in a game. Hence why a guy like Danny Green bounces all over the place from 68% to 87% season-by-season but is an 80% FT shooter for his career, cuz he only shoots free throws like once every 5 games lol"
"? I mean you guys definitely have a shot. Embiid, Simmons, Tobi, Danny Green, Dwight, &amp; Seth is a hell of a lineup on both ends."
Sixers playing 4D chess. Steal and overpay Horford then trade him away for Danny “Steph Curry” Green.
Wait in that first one they doubled away from Danny Green and let him shoot? Fucling why?
"Danny Green, baby. All he does is win Championships."
"There's a reason why he's called Icy Hot. Every single year there is a \~10 game stretch where he looks like the third Splash Brother and everyone says ""Danny Green is so underrated, he's really proving his value"" and then he immediately falls off a cliff.  Like clockwork. It happened in San Antonio, it happened in Toronto, LA and now Philadelphia. He's a great player if he's your 5th-6th most important piece, he can win you a game in the playoffs just by himself. But if you have to rely on Danny Green to be consistently good, that's not a position you want to be in."
"Ex-Laker shooters. For some reason Lakers shooters are shit, but when they leave and play against us, all of a sudden they are fucking Seth Curry, IE Danny Green"
"the sixers added danny green, seth curry and dwight howard, and tobias harris got good again, and the celtics kinda don't play as a team anymore i guess i dunno, they're weird"
Danny Green is good enough to make you wish he was better. He's just such an inconcistent player because I am not fully sure he knows how to dribble. All of his shots are difficult shots and sometimes they don't go in for a game or a week.
Evil Danny Green.
"Danny Green, Shane Battier, Robert Covington. 3&amp;D are still underrated.   Also: Rudy Gobert"
Danny Green. Raptors fans clowned me when I said he’s a big reason we’re hesitant on a Lowry trade. But since the trade deadline he’s shooting *53%* from three so...
He much better and fatter then Danny green and looks like him too
Saw a comment earlier calling him evil Danny Green
Danny Green isn't the GOAT
"They overachieved and hit a wall. I'm not asking you to list what they've done I'm asking you to look at the fucking roster beyond Brown and Tatum and most of these guys are hardly NBA level players currently. Why WOULD you expect them to make a run? Philly added guys like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard. Real experience and depth. Boston lost Hayward and added more rookies, the ghost of Jeff Teague, and a Covid ridden Thompson."
Danny Fucking Green
"Sixers have better role players than they used to have with Danny Green and Seth Curry; Harris is playing much better under Doc. Celtics really don’t have a replacement for Hayward. Their bench lacks scoring (maybe Fournier can help) and then Marcus Smart has been taking WAY too many hero shots as well as making dumb turnovers. I think with Rob Williams and TT healthy they have the talents. But Kemba and Smart have to play significantly better. Brown and Tatum, but mostly Brown have to be more consistent stars and then Fournier and another player need to step up as scorers for them off the bench."
Mirror universe Danny Green
"Danny Green is so fucking good man. Also, looks like Ben Simmons remembered how to finish"
"Haha, cooked by Danny Green."
"Haha, carried by Danny Green"
"By ""Bleed Green"" do they mean bleeding points to Danny Green?  Also the Eagles have bleeding green nation so idk why the Celtics would even try to use it"
Evil Danny Green
wait so you actually don't think Danny Green is a role player or?
Is Danny Green not a role player?
"I forgot you have Fournier now. He's great. But Timelord is a bench big at this point in his career, Pritchard is like okay. Langford stinks. You're making my point listing these guys as good 5-9 guys. Other than Fournier are any of those guys as good as Danny Green, Seth Curry, Shake, Thybulle? Dwights better than Williams or close enough that the fact that shes the backup vs the starter makes it negligible"
"Unlike previous years, we have Danny Green and Seth Curry sitting on the 3pt line as well."
Omg if you think James worthy was better than Magic Johnson the year he won finals mvp than your out of your mind. And if you think Danny green has any kind of argument to be a better player than Chris Paul in 2013 I just don’t know what say
Danny green is legit rn
Curry decided to give all his shooting powers to danny green.
What are we doing here if smart can’t even be bothered to close out on Danny green
I love Danny Green (except for when he puts the ball on the floor)
"We obviously were never serious about trading Danny Green. Smoke and mirrors, all of it."
"&amp;#x200B;  ||Worthy|Magic|Kareem| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Game 1|19/3/3/1|28/8/10/2|8/2/1/1| |Game 2|26/10/6/1|23/7/11/2|15/1/1/2/1| |Game 3|24/9/3/1/2|18/6/14/3|12/7/1/3| |Game 4|7/1/1|23/4/6/1|13/2/4/1| |Game 5|14/2/4/4/1|15/6/17/2/1|26/3/6/1| |Game 6|28/5/9/4/1|22/4/19/2|14/6/1/1/2| |Game 7|36/16/10/2|19/5/14/2|4/3/2|  &amp;#x200B;  So Worthy had a 36 point triple double in game 7, and averaged 22/7.4/4.4. He also led the playoffs in scoring.  I can see the argument for Magic to win it but 39-year-old Kareem wasn't even in the conversation. So you saying Kareem was better just for name value doesn't help your argument at all.  Danny Green set the 3 point record for the Finals and played incredible defense. He also led the Spurs in scoring in games 2 and 3 and it was between him and Duncan."
"He was good at the 5, and awful at the 4. Got us Danny Green, and then you guys got rid of his replacement. Could've been worse all things considered"
And yet Tim Duncan was still the better player and the man on that team. I mean I guess James worthy was the better than Kareem and Magic the year he won finals mvp. Or Danny Fucking Green would have been better than Chris Paul if the Spurs won the title 2013. There’s no version of Tony Parker that’s better than Chris Paul after like 2007
What is Danny Green supposed to do there exactly?
Danny Green really got his Lakers ring before the Raptors ring
Dark Danny Green without the 3 titles and decade of playoff experience. 2 years $12 mil.
Danny Green only performs in odd years. Advanced analytics
Two good example of 3 and D player's in the NBA would be Klay Thompson and Danny Green.
Danny green
"I respectfully disagree. Presti acquired Horford by trading Danny Green, who he had just acquired in the Chris Paul trade. The teardown was well underway at that point. Horford wasn't brought in to help the team; he was brought in because Philly gave us a first round pick to take him. Nothing substantive has changed about OKC's circumstances in the time since the Horford trade (except that some of our young players appear to be better than we expected)."
Danny Green
Bullock  Danny Green  Troy Daniels  Ellington  Schroder  Wesley Matthews
Danny green is always like this tho. He’s wildly inconsistent. He did this in San Antonio too.
"Danny Green shot 45.5% on the Raptors, 36.7% on the Lakers, and now 40.7% on the Sixers"
Probably Wes Matthews. Thought he was gonna be an upgrade from Danny Green last season but dude act like he can’t shoot
Danny Green. 3 pt shooter and good defender.
Prime Danny Green
"How's not liking one player make me fake yall wild  You don't shit on Lakers fans for shitting on KCP and Danny Green but this u do  Flair up hoe, what's your team"
"You have to be delusional to think anyone would win against the Lakers that year, even with Jimmy owning what, 2 of the best finals games of all time by game score?  Hell, if Danny Green didn't miss, good chance it would be a loss in overtime"
Remindme! 5 months  Headline:  “Danny Ainge and the Green take a CHANCE on 4x All-Star Demarcus “boogie” Boogie Cousins. Signs a 1 yr/30 m contract.”  Sounds about right to me
"It might be what gets them there, but it isn’t what keeps them there.   Dion Waiters is a better player than Danny Green or Patty Mills, but he will never last longer. Guys who understand and excel in their roles will always have a longer career than a third wheel who thinks he’s first."
Lul zero rings and sub 35 wins every year. Jimmy Butler carried your bum ass franchise to the playoffs once and your bum ass team couldn't do shit since them lmaooo. Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green left and the season after was still more successful than all but one of your shit team's years.
"Schroeder isn't a better defender than Danny Green if you look at defense only. But the biggest improvement is his turnaround from defense to offense. When DG got the ball, he would pass to LeBron or Rondo and they would start the offense. With Schroeder we can kick off fast breaks sooner, and that tends to more than make up for any difference on defense. Also, the gap between them on defense isn't too large given how DGs athleticism has dropped off."
Genuine question: Adding Schröder helps in comparison to Danny Green and Jaden McDaniels? I haven’t watched many Laker games this year.
Hmm what was Danny Green doing in the Warriors locker room
"He can start games depending on matchups in the playoffs, but he should not be getting starter minutes.  His skillset is too limited, and Danny Green can fill his role for now.  He plays just as good defense but is able to hit the 3-ball consistently (when hes hot of course)"
"hundreds of idiots  for the last 2 years here saying they would rather have Danny Green than Derozan  After that, I don't take anything anyone here says seriously"
"Perimeter: Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, Kawhi, Butler, OG, Draymond, Tatum  Paint: Gobert, Davis, Draymond, Embiid, Bam, Noel, Capela  Giannis does a little of everything, so I couldn’t really classify him for one of them. He’s more of a freelancer, but he’s very good at it. Clearly the defensive anchor for a top team.  Edit: I didn’t want to add him because it’s kinda of a homer take, but RJ Barrett has really impressed me as a perimeter defender. He’s shown that he can hang with the best in 1v1 situations and make it difficult for them."
"How easily he transitioned from point guard to off-guard showed his versatility.  Stars who can play multiple positions on both sides of the ball and shoot the lights are incredibly valuable, even if they do it at the level of KCP, Danny Green or JR Smith.  Booker is a top fifteen player no doubt imo."
"Tanking aside, one could easily argue it's legitimately better for the team to dedicate all the PF/C minutes they can to their many young guys who actually need the PT to develop. And by god, they have so many of them:  1. Developing Poku should be their #1 priority in the frontcourt. Very exciting player. 2. Isiah Robi looks promising   4. Darius Bazley is quickly turning into a potentially great stretch big who can get you 15/10 every night  3. Moses Brown is young and needs minutes 4. They also recently acquired Tony Bradley from Philly, and he's been averaging like 20 MPG over the past 4 games, minutes he needs and certainly wouldn't get with Horford back in the rotation.  Horford is not really much of an asset for the squad, he was traded to OKC as a salary dump for Danny Green. At best, you'd call him ""salary _filler_ for Danny Green"", but even then you'd be disingenuous. The main assets OKC got were Theo Maledon and the future first.  I would argue sitting old man Horford isn't about tanking necessarily, because if OKC didn't even have their pick, they still wouldn't play him much (if at all). Whose young guy from that list would you take away minutes from?"
"Simmons, SM, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Embiid"
"You make no sense. MJ takes a tad more shots, but he also scores more. The reason why he took more shots is because he KNOWS he's the GOAT and the GOAT scorer on the planet. Him taking shots are the most efficient form of offense. 6 out of 6 proves that. He wins when he's the scorer. That's why he's the GOAT offensive player because he puts his team on his own back and bring them chips.   Not passing it up for a Ray Allen, danny green, Kyrie or ad to take shot while sitting in the corner like LeBron. That ain't offense. That just means LeBron isn't even the best offensive player on his team. don't compare him to MJ.  It's so ironic that you're staring at a 37 PPG on incredible efficient GOAT and acts like he isn't the best offensive player. MJ IS the epitome of basketball offense."
He had help until your try hard chasedown blocker (srsly when did he become known for chasedown?) Danny Green ruined his knee.
"Lets just say JJ Redick and Seth Curry is a wash. Are you saying if right now you have a choice to choose between Jimmy Butler and Danny Green + George Hill, you will rather have the latter on your team because of better spacing in regular season? Playoff is a different animal and Jimmy left. You'd love to have him back of you can let's be honest here."
"&gt;The 3 pt% for Ingram doesn’t matter much on so few attempts.  Yes, it does.  A percentage is a percentage, and it is not easier to shoot less frequently.  In fact, it's way easier to shoot when you are the unquestioned number one option on a team, and cannot be benched -- both luxuries Ingram never had in Los Angeles.  &gt;Ft% is the best indicator of shooting and he jumped from high 60s in la to 85% in no.   Not if the player still misses from the field at the same rate.  The best indicator of shooting is the percentage the player shoots -- Ingram's effective FG% rose less between his 3rd and 4th seasons than between his 2nd and 3rd.  &gt;They be deeper but not better offensively. Ball and hart don’t add that much offensive value and are taking away minutes from others.   Ball ( 12/7 on 55% effective ) is an upgrade over Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, and Dion Waiters.  Hart ( 10/2 on 53% effective plus 7 rebounds ) is better than a couple of those guys, too.  &gt; New Orleans but he didn’t have great help most years outside jrue   Anderson/Evans/Gordon/Holiday should be enough for Davis to reliably make the playoffs.  It was not.  Most years, they weren't even close.  &gt;  If ad misses a buzzer beater it’s 3-2.   And if he shoots better than 11 for 23, a buzzer beater isn't necessary.  More to the point, there's no reason Ingram, Ball, Hart, or some other Laker could not have hit those shots.  It's not like Davis is a good three-point shooter -- he's worse than all those guys.  &gt;There is nothing to outbid for Miami, butler got a max contract with them.   There was still a trade that required matching or beating.  The point is, Butler would've been a Laker if Davis wasn't.  And no one was beating James + Butler + Ingram + the deepest team in the league.  They might've swept the playoffs.  And that team would be even more unbeatable this season, and for years to come, and would still have most of their draft picks.  &gt; traded is irrelevant, brogdon wanted to go there.   Apart from a few years of the Kobe Bryant era, no player has ever not wanted to be a Laker.  In the unlikely event that Brogdon did not, the Lakers still had tons of depth and assets to trade for a litany of other players."
You replace Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick with Danny Green and Seth Curry and you are better ? Do you really believe this?
Nobody questioned that for the Raptors. Getting Danny Green on top of it was considered an obvious fleecing and not typical for a Spurs trade at all. It was questionable for the Spurs because DeMar is nowhere near Kawhi and Green and Poetl seemed very raw.

"Haden PG, Kyrie Shooting Guard, KD Shooting Guard, everybody is a shooting guard!!!  Damn just think about a Harden-KD pick and roll. What do you do? KD can actually make the alley hoop like a big, he can finish like a guard and if he pops he can hid both the midrange and 3. Meanwhile Harden is absolutely lethal in penetration, have added the floater in recent years, and of course his step back is always there...  It's the only combination that I think is more lethal than the Lebron-AD PnR in the league right now. It's literally unstoppable, and the main difference is that if you just pack the paint for AD and Lebron, you have a brickfest with the Lakers (Poor Lebron keeps setting them up and they brick it...); With the Nets, you have laser shooters like Harris and Kyrie, and Kyrie is also an elite dribbler so you can't just treat him like Danny Green and have a random person stand in his space.  We've never seen anything like it offensively."
happens when you go all out 100 percent of every game on BOTH SIDES OF THE FLOOR... Kat takes 50 percent of the game off and decides to guard danny green over joel because foul trouble from embiid lmfao.
I guess Danny green doesn’t move like a guard because he dribbles off his feet in traffic. See how that argument falls apart? You’re restricting your definitions of “guard” using vague and extremely specific qualifiers for what guard movement is. I’d say KD is great in traffic and has good body control as well.
He didn’t put up 39 1-1 most of his point came while embiid was on the bench lmfao also kat shied away from guarding embiid and somehow ended up on Danny green towards the end of the game
he would if he didnt choose to guard danny green most of the game lol.  Literally he was out guarding green 90 percent of the time joel was on the floor. That is why the wolves dont win games.
And Danny Green
They were trying to work to to where we lost Danny green too I think
"Yes, Thybulle is an all defense caliber defender. I’d definitely part with Maxey and a first or two but parting with our immediate future for a *35 year old guard* is fucking stupid. Also Danny Green going in the deal on top of everything leaves a hole that basically makes it a lateral move imo"
"In the game while ago, they let Danny Green guard Jimmy then Ben guard Bam or idk I forgot the other player. I dont know why they put danny green on Jimmy butler when Ben is better than Green when it comes to defense.     Was there bad blood between Jimmy and Ben? Is there drama? Something happened between them?    I feel like Jimmy doesnt like Ben cause Ben’s too much(?) for him? I mean he knows Ben is good but Ben isnt working as much as he should to improve his game. And Jimmy wants everyone from the team to work twice as hard but I think Ben’s like chill you know"
Also Seth Curry and Danny Green that are shooting incredible this season
You can really tell who actually watches the sixers and who reads bbref statlines based off their opinion of Seth Curry.  Danny Green is a far better player than him and his shooting percentages are highly inflated by his refusal to shoot anything but picture perfect looks.  He is the most deceiving 40% 3PT shooter I have ever seen
No nba player reminds me of myself more than Danny Green dribbling in the open court
He literally hasn’t guarded him once. He has Danny Green and Tobias on hom
"You say ""wasted"" but 20, 4 and 5 isn't wasted. That is a decent player.   The 2018 Celtics were a few minutes from making the finals with TWO max contract players not even playing.   But you're talking as if it would have mattered last season if Danny Green made $36M instead of $15M. It wouldn't have, once the team is constructed.   If Kemba can average an efficient 20ppg then Boston's ability to contend comes down to health and the development of young players. Tatum and Brown developing to reliable superstars. The likes of Williams, Nesmith and Pritchard developing to starting quality players."
The Sixers are definitely hoping he can be the Danny Green replacement. Has to learn how to make 3s first though
"Yeah people were saying the Sixers were screwed long term with the Harris/Horford contracts. People were saying that one of Embiid/Simmons had to be traded and the Sixers needed to rebuild.   But the biggest change they made in that offseason (other than upgrading from one of the worst coaches in the league to a solid one) was that they got veteran level players to put next to Simmons/Embiid. Guys like Danny Green, Dwight Howard, George Hill, Seth Curry, etc.   I think the Celtics have the assets to do that if they choose to, I'm curious to see whether they'll decide to go that route or not. They have their core group of players now they need to trim some of the fat to build around Brown and Tatum. Maybe that involves trading Kemba, maybe that involves trading Smart, but there are moves out there that could change the outlook of the team and we still have the assets to do that."
"yeah, i was just adding that its pretty normal for any team to be average when you take away their top 10 player. its not like the rest of the sixer roster is bad, its just you need that top 10 player to be a top 5 team. Similarly, we are about a .500 team when Simmons rests (actually slightly worse believe it or not). Even though he's not as good as Embiid.  And i'd probably disagree a bit with the roster management. Like having a starting spot and 20 mil taken up by horford last year was just never going to work in the playoffs for us, having danny green and seth outside of jo makes a pretty big difference."
39 minutes of Danny Green is going to piss you off just wait.
You make it sound so simple. Dude carried the team against Philly. That's a series previous Raptor teams would have folded in half. Shit would've been a sweep. Kawhi had a swagger the team fed off too. This team always used to get shook in the moment. Not Kawhi. The team even talked about it. He was a leader in his own way. Also Danny Green doesn't get nowhere the credit for that season. He was probably the best role player in the NBA in 2019. At least in the regular season
"Wow Nurse is so smart. Man who would’ve really thought keeping Giannis out of the paint was the key. Casey also coached the defense for the Dallas Mavs when they shut down Lebron, D Wade, Chris Bosh to win a championship. I’m sure if he had Kawhi and Danny Green and Marc Gasol he could’ve had the same outcome."
"I was curious and did the math...  MJ, Kareem, Bob Cousy, and Danny Green rings = 21. NYC square miles = 302.6mi. That's 0.069 (nice) rings per square mile.   Tim Duncan has 5 rings and St. Croix is 82 sq/mi, which comes out to 0.061 rings per square mile.  There are likely several more ring holders from NYC, but those 4 guys combine for most of them."
It’s actually pretty easy. Just trade a player not in Kawhi Leonard’s universe for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Casey should’ve tried that.
Speaking of did Danny Green ever get his ring?
Some say he was a failed cloning experiment of Danny Green
The beautiful game didn't start until they got Danny Green (corner threes) and Boris Diaw (fluid offense). TP and Manu were part of the slow and boring Spurs and the fun Spurs. It's ok it was long time ago kid.
Anyone else remember Danny Green having to call Pop for a second chance? Dunno if JTA will reach peak Danny Green but it would be nice haha.
We already established that Danny Green is the goat.
"If LeBron hypothetically was surrounded by a Danny Green, then doubling him be more productive. Alright I’m kidding, but my point still stands in that constantly getting doubled is a bitch and a half to work with"
Danny Green time
oh shoot Wes pulling Danny Green offensive rebound
"He did and turned the series back around and made it a 3-1 lead. Jimmy from then on called for a switch every play to get off AD, and he got it enough to where he eeked out a win. Danny Green brickin that game winning 3 also didnt help  This is a complete casual take lmao"
evil danny green
The ball definitely went off Danny Green's head. The Sabonis called could have went either way. The Danny Green play was looked at under replay.
So you’re telling me you think that ball went off of danny green and that sabonis tackling Ben is an offensive foul lmao
"&gt; Danny Green did NOT touch that block.   I dunno, I thought it was pretty obvious on the review that Green touched it last."
Someone gotta post a highlight of that Danny green overturn plz
"I give you Ben's but come on, that Danny Green call was ridiculous. Not to mention the amount of soft calls you got vs no call for us in the other end. It was just constant, the Danny Green call was just the icing on the cake."
"Justin blocked Danny green and the ball was still in his hands (barely) after he stopped touching it, they just are mad replay fucked them."
"&gt;These are all suggestions that are not the auction. “Aside from the auction \[the NBA\] can adopt some of there several other policies”  How is your proposed reset going to work without an auction?  How will you redistribute all the players?  &gt;You can have multiple schools in the same city, but if there were academies they can easily get enough talent / players who couldn’t get into the NY or LA ones.  Great, so the small market teams get to pick from the leftovers who couldn't even get into the better academies.  That sounds like a recipe for competitive imbalance.  That'd be like restricting the small market teams to only drafting D2 and D3 players today -- which would of course cause them to fold in no time.  &gt;Football is a team sport and many players get shuffled around constantly.  American football players do not.  &gt;These plug in play players get paid well in the NBA too (Danny Green got $15 mil a year for being a 3 and D. Klay got a max etc.)  Klay Thompson is a Warrior lifer, so far.  Maybe you were thinking of someone else.  Danny Green struggled to one of his worst career seasons when ""plugged in"" to the Lakers last year, after his best season in Toronto.  &gt;Having a rental player is also how a finals team has been built since 2011.  No.  Not single-season rentals, first of all, only Toronto did that.  And the '14 Spurs, '15 Warriors, '16 Cavaliers Champs were not led by any rentals.  Arguably, the '20 Lakers were not led by Davis, either.  Among Finals losers, the '20 Heat rented no one, and neither did various other Cleveland teams, or the '13 Spurs.  &gt;Look at basically every Lebron team where is the ultimate plug and play star and basically surround him with decently capable players on short contracts while he’s there  Wade was nearly a Miami lifer.  Bosh only played for two teams in his career.  Irving was not rented by Cleveland.  Love has only played for two teams in his career.  I don't think you have any idea what you are saying.  &gt;Again just to emphasize no auction. \[snip\] Every 10 years or so there’s a big reset where everyone becomes available.  See first question above, again.  You are missing something critical here."
"Absolute JOKE officiating to swing that one to the Pacers in the 4th. Sixers-Heat ESPN Thursday, they clearly wanted ratings for that one.   Danny Green did NOT touch that block. Sabonis plows over Simmons and pulls him down? Offensive foul on Ben. Harris/Maxey want to drive to the lane and get clobbered? Nothing.   What an absolutely disgraceful officiating effort tonight, but no ones going to care because it was buried in a meaningless game."
There's a reason why Dillon Brooks desire the dark power and become the evil Danny Green
locked up by evil danny green
Lmfao.  I love every title involving Evil Danny Green.
"These are all suggestions that are not the auction. “Aside from the auction [the NBA] can adopt some of there several other policies”   You can have multiple schools in the same city, but if there were academies they can easily get enough talent / players who couldn’t get into the NY or LA ones. Each team can have several feeder academies. You don’t just get one feeder system.    Many few agent sign short term 1-2 year long deals. Aside from rookies who get stuck with basically 7 year long deals if they are lottery players most players (second rounders get 2 year long deals, several vets on 1 year minimums, free agents max deals are typically 4 years max etc.) Which isn’t that much longer than the 3 year deals you can sign players to anyway. Football is a team sport and many players get shuffled around constantly. If a star player cannot adapt into a new team quickly / his skill set needs several teammates to adjust to him then guess what? He won’t be a star anymore compared to a person who can easily fit into a teams system. These plug in play players get paid well in the NBA too (Danny Green got $15 mil a year for being a 3 and D. Klay got a max etc.) plug and play is gonna be a new required skill set for a “star player”   Having a rental player is also how a finals team has been built since 2011. Look at basically every Lebron team where is the ultimate plug and play star and basically surround him with decently capable players on short contracts while he’s there. A bunch of ring chasers joined the Nets this year / the Warriors during their dynasty too. It’s extremely common. The players who stay “a long time” are already extremely rare anyway.   Again just to emphasize no auction. Simply hard cap, each contract is one year and the player at the end of the year negotiates a max 2 year extension. No player movement during your contract. Every 10 years or so there’s a big reset where everyone becomes available.  Have several feeder academies to supplement you with new players that are cheap and give you easy access to fans from that area. Spend big on the free agents you want."
Danny Green
I’ll do this era  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: AI  SF: Danny Green  PF: John Collins  C: Myles Turner  I tried to make it semi-realistic but I don’t know how realistic it would be. I tried putting 3 good defenders around (and John Collins isn’t terrible) as well as having good spacing so AI can have open lanes. Collins is also a great lob threat for him
"iverson  klay  danny green  gordon hayward  rudy gobert  all in their best season, would be a nice team"
"This narrative that Clips fans are trying to force that we let go vets in favor of toxic players and that now we’re worse is so forced and you guys projecting your failures onto us  Outside of Dwight, everyone we let go was either gonna go no matter what or was upgraded for something better. Rondo, Danny Green, Javale and Dwight carrying us while Bron and AD were injured would have us out of the playoffs entirely because they sucked in the reg season outside of Dwight, and in the playoffs only Rondo and Dwight were good for us (and only in at certain times; Dwight vs Denver and Rondo vs Houston &amp; Denver).  We’re better if healthy, but AD has been hurt all year and even them we *still* started 21-6 with a new team, an injured star and the shortest offseason ever. We’re the best in the West if we can get more healthy, and the Clips matchup worse than us because you can’t guard AD and we’re gonna abuse every defender you got except Kawhi &amp; PG"
1- iverson 2- thybulle 3- Danny green 4- Tobias harris  5- embiid  😤😤😤
Embiid  AI  Simmons  Harris  Danny Green
"Danny Green, he runs pacers well"
Dwight was on the absolute scrap-heap. Any team at all could have signed him. Same with Rondo. McGee was not sought after either.   Danny Green was going to go to a contender and the Lakers happened to be one of the only contenders with room to sign him.
"Didn't the Lakers just win a Championship by signing Dwight Howard, Rondo, Danny Green, and Javale McGee? Also while not in free agency, when a star forces a trade, they always request to be traded to a large market."
"Homer perspective but I think Embiid and Jokic’s leaps as two of the best players in the league were interesting. Also was def surprising for me to see Danny green be an elite role player for us, as lakers fans had everyone convinced he was washed"
The Knicks' sustained success.   Danny Green and Dwight Howard not being washed.   All the heat transactions.   Magic actually blowing it up.
Insane defensively tho lol. 5 elite defenders.  You could replace Thybulle with Danny green. He’s 6’6.
"So if the Clippers were title contenders but the Raptors had a MUCH better season than them, the Raptors were not title contenders? And come on. Bucks were title favourites for the longest time. Bucks were 52-8 at one point (on pace for 70-wins). Raptors outplayed both of them last season and should be given some respect. Raptors were title contenders. Btw second best team in the NBA even tho they just lost Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard."
"It would have been the exact same thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, there isn't a major schematic difference between Brett and Doc.  The only major changes are on defense with Embiid playing less drop coverage.    The main difference between the Sixers from last year to this year are spacing that Danny Green and Seth Curry provide that Al Horford and Josh Richardson do not.    If anything Butlers lack of consistent 3pt shooting would have led to the problems we had last season and the season prior.  Tobias wouldn't have space and opportunity to post up.  Joel would have very little space to manuever and harder double teams to face.  Ben would still stuck in the dunkers spot."
I watched every Lakers game on stream last season and the things said about Danny Green in those chats wouldn't even fly in an xbox 360 era mw2 lobby
"In my eyes, you're the crazy one giving out death threats when Danny Green missed that 3 versus the Heat in game 5 of the NBA finals. You're caring about the wrong thing.    I don't care what happens at your job. Its just confusing to me how you can be high-horse about something. Make negative claims about something. Have yet to experience an atom of it. And then can't hold yourself to the same standard you're holding the directors of the documentary to.      It's backwards and stupid. It's not really unethical if it doesn't impact anyone in any ethical way to begin with. You're caring about the wrong thing."
"31 PPG / 9 RPG / 4 APG on 49/38/88 and elite defense  +156 on the court  Is the only reason they made it to the Finals and won the Championship instead of just losing to the Sixers or any other team they faced   Won Finals MVP  Nah he carried. Raptors had a good supporting cast (Lowry, Siakam, VanVleet, playoff guys like Danny Green/Ibaka), but every single championship team has a good team. I qualify it as a carry when the Raptors would not have gotten near a championship without him and he had an unbelievable playoff run"
Not surprised. Out starting lineup is a joy to watch. Have to say Morey pulling off Danny Green for Al Horford is legendary
"And the Thunder turned around and turned Danny Green into Horford, Theo Maledon (who's getting drafted top 10 now in retrospective drafts), and rights to Vasilije Micić when he comes to the NBA next season."
This lol  Most people on here thought Danny Green was washed and getting Schroder was a massive plus. Losing Rondo was the thing that really hurt though.
"We TRADED Danny Green (a dude everyone wanted off the team) for Schroder. If you asked anyone after the finals what they thought of the move, they would've said that was a steal."
Danny Green
"Send CJ to the Celtics in a deal for Marcus Smart. Throw a bag at Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, and Richaun Holmes. Make some other moves with their younger guys.  Starting Lineup would be Dame, Smart, Covington, Holmes and Nurkic with Green, Iggy and Melo on the bench. Are they top contenders? No but defensively they are much improved."
I think Rob was anticipating our key guys missing a bunch of games or needing rest because of the quick turnaround. Last year's team would've been significantly worse than this year's team without LeBron and AD.   Trez and Schroder at least kept us competitive where relying on Javale and Danny Green would've been awful.
Need Danny Green to comment next
Just because his 3pt percentage is around league average does not make him an average shooter. He is the first option and primary shot creator for the Mavs. There is a huge difference between Luka/Harden/Beal getting doubled every possession and shooting 35% from 3 on high volume and Danny Green/RoCo spotting up and shooting 35% on wide open 3s. Those are the actual average shooters.
"Celtics still had Bird, McHale, Parrish, Dennis Johnson, and Danny Ainge in 88. LA still had KAJ, James Worthy, AC Green and Michael Cooper to go with Magic.  But sure, lets pretend Magic and Bird were on their own."
"Danny Green has a 107 defensive rating this year which is the second highest of his career, and higher than the Sixers as a whole defensive rating which is still dragged down by the end of the bench guys in blowouts.  George Hill has a 111 defensive rating which is significant worse then his career average of 106.  They are both old and regression on that end, it is no narrative, it is facts."
Lol I see we're now saying Danny Green and George Hill are poor defenders to push your narrative
"Seth Curry and Shake Milton are both really really bad (especially Shake), Danny Green has been pretty meh this year and George Hill falls under that too now that he is there.  The Lakers have one guy that could be considered really bad, Drummond, and he isn’t even on Shakes level.   Why is this concept so hard to get man"
Klay is a star they just needed like Danny Green or someone decent
"This would hold up if we were talking about 1 or 2 people, you are saying there are 3 individuals better than anyone on the Lakers. Not to mention the Sixers are also rolling out Dwight Howard, Danny Green and Tobias Harris to round out their rotation.   The only negative defenders in their top 8 rotation are Seth Curry and Shake Milton, both guards."

Honestly he has to cool his motor down sometimes. He’s a more active Danny Green sometimes
"honestly if the knicks added westbrook, danny green, and duncan robinson this offseason, they’d have a realistic path to getting really, really good. all three have a reputation that would fit really well with new york’s culture under thibs, russ would instantly solve the lack of playmaking the knicks have had this season and then some, and green/robinson would massively boost their spacing. idk if washington would be willing to give him up though, this man is single handedly restoring dignity to the franchise."
Turns out Danny Green was the glue guy on these championship teams after all.
"i am not disputing star impact, but SUPERSTAR impact if you get what i mean  i love old duncan, he was still a very impactful player. so was young kawhi or danny green  but they were not the top guys that this debatw talks about"
Danny Green with a plus minus of +26 after talking about how the 76ers need to be crushing teams like this.  Respect.
"We would have had to give out Danny Green, Maxey, Thybulle and Picks. Lowry would be great, but that's simply too much."
we'd have to match contracts using danny green correct?  might sound silly but green is playing so fucking unreal for us i'd be hesitant to let him go. he's sort of exactly the role player we need. shooting absolute lights out.
"im confused as to why you're downvoted. Unequivocal is claiming the Green is ready to injure star players on other teams.  ""6ers are lucky to have someone like Danny who can injure a star if they’re heating up"""
"Danny ""Gregg Popovich's whipping boy"" Green"
Detroit team is a myth. A defensive number 1 is almost as valuable as an offensive number 1 especially when that defensive 1 is ben Wallace. That combined with 3 other elite defenders and good offensive players on those pistons teams and they were stacked to high hell. Easily could be considered a 3 or 4 all-star team (which is what they were).  Siakim and Lowry were weaker offensively than most number 2s and 3s but were far better defensively. You add that to how absolutely stacked the rest of the roster was and it was pretty easy to see why they could win. They also had Danny Green who I neglected to mention before.  Other people matter but they don't matter to championship contention if you don't have 2 or more stars 95% of the time.
Danny Green better
Im sorry Danny Green and Thybulle you happy lmao
Danny Green going for a 3-peat!!!
Danny 'You know I had to do it one time lol #Holocaust' Green
That's fucked. Now I hope the Sixers win just for Danny Green
"lol this guy clearly didn’t watch the Lakers in the playoffs, for the most part Danny Green was pretty terrible for us, ok defense that’s about it, and Dwight was only relevant for 2 games against the Nuggets. The only real difference is having Schroeder instead of “playoff Rondo”."
"I added nuance, you just dont have an answer for the drop coverage leading to the open threes/midrange Embid will give up.  You baselessly said Claxton wont play in the playoffs and said he woulndt see the floor with Aldridge even though he played the very first night Aldridge got there and DAJ had a DNP. You think Joe Harris will only play 10-12 min a game in the playoffs LOL. You think a team with better shooters than Harden's previous Rockets has worse spacing despite the Rockets also having no off ball movement lmao(two of those shooters being KD and Kyrie LOL) because teams wont collapse on Harden which is bullshit LOL.   Despite having only two guys who can guard him(one of which is an offensive liability in Thybulle).Danny Green cant guard Harden and Thybulle will not see the floor because he's terrible offensively(51 TS% this year). Also Philly is going to have fun hiding Seth curry.  You said Harden couldnt beat a team with a great rim protector despite Harden beating Utah twice. The second time  it cost them 2 games trying to implement their strategy to stop Harden. You also tout bullshit narratives about KD and Harden despite them playing together previously and wanting to play together now.  You see this team as the Clippers despite being vastly more talented.   Oh and btw one more thing you were wrong about, Curry's efficiency was never lowered playing with Durant, he had the highest TS% of his career playing with Durant. So that's another thing you were wrong about.  &gt;For the final time, regular season doesn't mean anything. Harden always manufactures regular season wins  2 WCF appearances. One of which took your team to 7 Games and would have beaten you had Chris Paul been there. Check Harden's last three playoffs if you think he doesnt generate wins. And name me another superstar in the Western Conference who's had more success than Harden in the playoffs besides the Rockets while the Warriors were around. You are so full of it bro."
"Eh i think you can add way better role players, PJ was good in the that small center role and Draymond needs the ball on offense   If you add in a legitimate 3&amp;D instead of Ariza who decided to shit the bed it would be way better  Say someone like prime Danny Green 2013 finals"
Game 2 and Game 6 Danny Green was guarding Klay when Klay got injured but nothing Green did was sloppy or careless. Game 2 Green defended on the 3 pointer and passed Klay. Klay just landed awkwardly on his shot. Game 6 they met in the air and Klay's knee just buckled on when he landed. He was making a play for the ball.
Or Danny green going off in the finals
Danny Green is the textbook championship role player.
"I'm talking Danny Green and their 6/7. You're definitely right, the Sixers have great individual defense. I think for me it's great offense &gt; great defense here. The only matchups I'm aware of so to speak is Ben and Matisse, the other guys are weaker defenders comparably and need to step up.  Seth will be hunted on defense every time he's on the floor, and the Nets passing should be good enough to get out of double teams/find the open man under the basket.  Man Harden is the guy that teams literally had to double at half every time he had the ball. It worked, because he didnt have reliable guys to pass to. Now he has Kevin fuckin Durant and Kyrie Flat Irving. This will not be an easy matchup for any team."
"&gt;  I mean a great look at the rim over a weak defender.  And....who would that be?  The only weak defender who will get any minutes will be Seth Curry, and you can expect he'll get fewer minutes in this matchup.  You're talking about ""weak"" defenders when the Sixers are running:  Embiid, Simmons, Danny Green, Thybulle, Harris.  Those guys are all somewhere from good to elite on defense, and their backup center is Dwight Howard.  The rim is untouchable and the switchable, long defenders will be contesting 3's."
This is what he provided to the raptors and lakers. Raptors fans will never fully appreciate Danny green cuz he would go cold. Real ones know he provides that championship experience.
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
"At some point the coach needs to take some blame for the way they play.      Roster construction doesn't determine the effort they are willing to put into the game when it's being played. THAT falls onto the head coach. I know Brad is good and everybody likes him, but he gets pass after pass when he quite frankly doesn't deserve them anymore. There is no reason for this team to be struggling the way that it is right now.      Roster construction can and should also be talked about. Danny missed on a lot of windows that could have launched the Celtics into championship conversations in a legitimate way.      I live in the New England area and I think it's their jobs are still safe, but the tide may finally be turning on them. Even the most hardcore green teamers seem to be recognizing that there are problems here."
Danny Green needs Kawhi and LeBron to win rings
Danny green can never dribble but he usually knows his role. Its important for people with his experience to call this stuff out and address it with the team prior to the playoffs. Winning vs bad teams in bad ways can lead to and habits for many teams before they make their run especially when it isnt a seasoned team like a lebron led team or gsw during their runs or whatever. Sixers solid on both ends so shoulf be fun to see if they iron out a few things which they have the talent to iron out
"[Apparently not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_players_with_most_championships).  Only Horry, John Salley, LeBron, and Danny Green have won championships with 3 teams."
I would put more of their improvement on swapping horford and jrich for players that fit better in seth and danny green.  Dwight as pure backup makes more sense than horford at that price clogging the floor as the slowest PF in the league.   Then again I usually look to personnel before coaching.
"&gt;  He's gonna have to. There is a reason Gobert has never done well against the Rockets lmao. Its because his drop coverage gets him played off the floor. Kyrie, James and KD will kill him that way, be it easy mid rangers or pull up threes. Harden will get possessions with him on the perimeter. They simply do not have enough to slow them down.  The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen.  If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint.  Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  &gt;  Lmao and if one of Harris or Thybulle are in there, either there offense suffers or there defense suffers. Danny Green also cannot guard Harden one on one either. He will absolutely be pulling that extra defender be it iso or pick and roll, never mind that in your scenario Kyrie or KD(two of the best iso players in the game) are still getting one on one coverage at the end of the day lol.  I'm more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers.  Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender.  If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all.  You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster.

If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  &gt;  Yes it is, that's literally what spacing is, what are you talking about. We had decent spacing in Houston, not great. Turrets? We had average to below average shooters who took a lot of 3s. That was pre floater Harden and Harden being the only all star on his team. Damn...its a shame Harden has never beaten a team with a great rim protector....Gobert lol. Kyrie and KD dont have to run around any screens, we didnt do that in Houston. Harden can get them open looks by them standing still. But just to be clear, KD and Kyrie to get around screens that;s a lie. Harris will be playing plenty of minutes.  No, that's not what spacing is.  Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping.  And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot.  If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers.  You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule.  Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team.  Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  &gt;  This is lazy take bro. This is essentially ""there is only one ball""  It's not a lazy take.  The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense.  We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it.  Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game.

"I disagree  You guys have way better depth to fill the void  Our replacements for Danny Green (a good 3&amp;D roleplayer) are Korkmaz (just 3) and Thybulle (just D) minutes  Either way I think its close enough to not really be part of any argument, its not like Nets Bucks where the Nets are obviously more hampered"
I’ve been repeating this over and over since the regular season. The sixers blow so many 4th quarter leads playing 10 deep for absolutely no reason. I hope he figures it out but it looks like it gotten worse without having Danny Green
Eh. I’ve always thought this 76ers team was a bit lacking in talent to be honest. The fit is great but if you take the roster one by one. Simmons can not shoot to save his life. Seth Curry can’t play defense to save his life. Thybulle is a bad shooter. Tobias is a bad defender. Korkmaz also can’t defend. Too many specialists. They need a few more balanced guys. At this point the only true 3 and D players they have are Danny Green and Embiid. Granted when Morey got the team it was a mess. He did a great job but from the position he was in you can only do so much. To me they’re a Mikal Bridges (in place of Korkmaz) away from being a complete team  Granted Doc wasted the clippers last year
At this point in their careers Hunter is a much bigger loss than Danny Green
Danny Green definitely
Really miss Danny Green.
Contracts wouldn’t be close to matching. We’d need to include more for salary matching purposes. That’s the whole reason Tisse and Danny Green would have to be a part of that trade.
"Toronto West. All you need is to trade your franchise borderline superstar for Kawhi, he can play alongside a grizzled vet PG and a Euro big man. Also get Danny Green in there"
Some Danny Green ish
Probably a 3 &amp; D guy. Like Danny Green or some shit.
So would you rather have prime Danny Green or Rookie Ben Simmons?
"Yeah agreed, while the Sixers could have used Lowry the required price due to salary matching and assets was STEEP. And arguably would have left the Sixers in a more of a risky place.   To get Lowry they would have needed to trade Danny Green, and let’s assume the Raptors would take Maxey and not Thybulle. Sixers would still need to add 8m worth of salary, which means trading Mike Scott AND 2/3 of Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, &amp; Shake Milton. Which cuts into their already not exceptionally deep rotation. And then asking for a FRP plus another second? That’s an absurd price to pay and leaves your roster extremely vulnerable to injuries come playoff time.   Asking for picks and a young player is a fair price for Lowry, but in the Sixers case the salary matching requirements would have cut too deep into their rotation IMO to be worth it. And might have harmed them as much as Lowry could have helped them come playoff time. Not to mention the commitment of future money to an older player required with Lowry, the loss of picks that could replenish that depleted bench roster, &amp; the issue of roster space for the Raptors (even losing TD2 and Matt Thomas would Have left us needing one more roster spot).  Deal would have been tough, and might not have helped the Sixers as much as originally hoped."
"Depends, all things being equal Ben Simmons is a moderately better player than Danny Green ever was. However, Ben Simmons is on a max contract. Danny Green almost won FMVP while making $3.5 million per year.  edit: he also made an all defensive team while making $10 million per year"
Lowry. Oh wait they didn't trade for Lowry because Danny green and Maxey and Thybulle is too valuable
most nephews wont remember prime danny green. played for the spurs. hasn't been all that good recently. but prime danny green was a bonafide STUD that spaced the floor like a god and could hound players defensively. ben Simmons will be extremely lucky to come close to prime danny green
"He did a great job, guy got rid of Horford's terrible contract for a 2025 protected first and some nobodies. Turned Josh Richardson into Seth Curry, and brought Doc Rivers who was a huge upgrade on Brett Brown. The Danny Green signing was also a shrewd one but unfortunately he's hurt right now. The Sixers got the goddamn #1 seed this year, it's not his fault his players and cosch are suddenly atrocious when it counts."
For my team? 2014 danny green and we are unbeatable.
Danny green. In his prime he’s better player than Ben Simmons too he’s more helpful to his team
I would rather have current Danny green than rookie Ben Simmons.
A Danny Green is needed to advance to the next level
"Docs Rivers said Ben Simmons is good at defense, and he found out in game 5 that defense brick 10 FTs out of 14 attempts. He is a good player, and can make an impact to a championship team. This current team does not maximize what Ben Simmons does well and hide his glaring weaknesses. What so great if he can defend, rebound, and pass but if other team can attack his weaknesses leave him to be the scorer and foul him to put him on FT line when he is on the floor. You can put him at the dunker spot and screen, but Joel Embiid operates there to be his best which mess with the spacing with Simmons. Seth Curry is only good shooting threat, and maybe hot Danny Green to provide space. If Simmons is not going to score by seeking it when opportunities present itself, shoot jumpers, and shoot poor FTs he is just a big man who needs to operate in paint who can handle the ball. To me if he is not going to be aggressive in seeking to score he needs to be in situations similar to Draymond Green in 2014-2016 team where he surrounded by 2 great shooters to provide space and player movements carrying offense load from perimeter."
"Agreed. I watch Sixers games and he’s not even  giving the shooters good looks.  Danny Green, Harris, Curry and Korkmaz are just really lethal."
"It’s not their fault Danny Green got hurt. They don’t deserve the boos. Had Danny been in, series would’ve been over by now. Sad that God works in mysterious ways"
Kyle Kuzma/Danny Green/1st round pick for Tobias Harris who says no?
Sixers are 0-2 since Danny Green got hurt 🤷‍♂️🤐🤌
They surely missed Danny Green presence out there
The Danny Green point is crucial
"Sixers ain't winning without Danny Green, he's the voodoo charm teams need to make it to the finals."
Why does Collins look like Danny Green from afar?
"The Nets win with a hobbled Harden and without Irving, while we can’t win without Danny Green."
usually splits minutes with danny green.

They keep flashing to Danny Green on the bench like he’s not Danny Green
"There's been injuries to role players as well, they just don't get nearly as much attention. But Danny Green, KCP, De'Andre Hunter, Donte DiVincenzo, Alex Caruso, Will Barton, Serge Ibaka, etc all have missed time with injuries in these playoffs."
"To be honest, was not expecting this much Danny Green"
Danny Green delivering pizza now
The Sixers should trade Danny Green and sign you as his replacement
Danny Green with the Noob Saibot mask
Danny Green seriously invested in that mask. Looks great for wildfire season here in CA
Danny Green finna be the next Horry.
Why is Danny green wearing that goofy ass mask
"i have that same mask as danny green, which basically means I'm as good as he is at basketball"
I don’t give a shit about Danny green picking up a seat cushion show me what they’re booing about 💀💀
I fuckin love Danny Green. Fuck the haters
Danny green asking the ref if he can dance at half court during the time out
The Danny green story nobody wanted
"I mean it's too early to write off anyone after 1 season. Wiseman could have really used the G-League, but due to the pandemic that development was slowed. Maybe he'll pan out, maybe he won't. Ayton definitely has taken a little bit of time but starting to show things, finally. Trae Young as well this post season also doing a lot of work.   Tyreke Evans was the 2009-2010 MVP. Not saying it's the same scenario with Ball, but just to show it's not always an indication that team ran away with the best player (or that there were other issues). Blake, Harden, Rubio, DeMar, Curry, Jrue, Jordan Hill, Pat Bev, Danny Green, Patty Mills, Brand Jennings all came out of this draft too."
Danny Green asked for the Bane x witch doctor mask combo
Danny green teaming up with Joker?
"With all the injuries to other teams, Danny Green could seriously win 3 titles in a row bruh"
Why Danny Green wearing a muzzle 🤣🤣
Danny Green actually hurt himself fighting Batman
Wtf is Danny Green doing. Goofy mf
Nah danny green chill you not on dancing with the stars lol
Danny Green was born in the darkness
Replaced Rondo and Danny Green and Dwight Howard and Javale McGee with Schroeder and Gasol.
We need Danny green to make a come back
Hunter is way more important than Danny Green
"If Embiid is healthy I'd have them as the favorite regardless of the Net health situation. But is he?  EDIT: Actually I forgot about the Danny Green injury, maybe Nets are slight favorites. Sixers would have homecourt though."
Danny Green guarded Trae Young in game 1 for a half
Embiid has 2 more field goals than Danny Green camera shots but it’s not over yet
i love danny green but i will never forgive him for being a grown ass man walking around playing a boogie out his phone speakers
Stars...Danny green...pick one
Bucks should just go ahead and hire Danny Green as their coach
All these stars getting injured and no one cares to mention Danny Green. smh.
im just imagining danny green in korkmaz's shoes and them bricks instead of made shots early
Same can be said for Danny Green
"Klay’s injury was from Danny green hitting him midair causing him to land with his knee in an awkward position. Not sure if the hamstring impacted it, but it seems like anyone would tear their ACL with a fall like that"
Everyone sleeping on my boy Danny green
Some injuries are just freak accidents. Klay tore his acl from a Danny Green tackle.
Bucks have DiVincenzo out.  Danny Green for Philly.  Hunter for Hawks.  Everyteam is missing a starter it seems.
"Yep. If anything has ruined these playoffs and the product on the floor it's the injuries to the stars. The injuries to guys like Danny Green and Donte DiVincenzo and KCP suck too, but what's ruining the playoffs is the way the stars are dropping like flies out there."
Yes they won a title and in the 2020 NBA playoffs AD was 38% from 3. Rondo was 40% from 3. KCP was 37%. Danny Green was 34%. Markieff Morris was 42%. LBJ had shooters around him in 2020.
Good shooters get paid.   Why keep Danny Green to play good defense and have lots of bad shooting nights when you can barely pay Wes Matthews to play some defense and do the bow and arrow celebration when he’s shooting 1/5 and down 10
You could count Danny Green as well
76ers missing Danny Green
Thanks Danny Green
Might as well include Danny Green
The disrespect to back to back champion Danny Green is unacceptable
"Brown is a SG/SF and Simmons is a forward who runs point. If you disagree, which of Seth Curry and Danny Green is the other forward alongside Harris?"
"I’m furious about a lot of decisions the coach and players have made, but that’s really not even near the top of the list. Trae has been pretty well defended other than the first half of game 1 with Danny Green on him.   His shot is kinda off and we have the length to make him rush shots even going under. Chasing over is also dangerous. He will absolutely do whatever he can to try to turn that into 3 FTs, and when he doesn’t, he is going downhill into the floater/lob threat, which puts way too much on Embiids plate even if he was healthy.  I put a lot of the blame for games 1 and 4 on Doc tbh, I am not happy with him at all. I’ve never been a big Doc fan, but a lot of Sixers fans are in denial about him. If Brett Brown was making some of these decisions I can’t imagine what we would sound like lol."
"I think that's likely, but I also think it's likely that Joe Harris doesn't shoot like Icy Danny Green. I think that's most likely to even out to about the same production between the two players.  If the Bucks don't hunt Harden off the floor, then I think it's a game, but the Bucks should be going after him, and hitting KD with as many screens as is humanly possible, in order to wear them down."
"Bucks have divicenzo out, but hes like their 4th best player at best. Jazz have bad injuries to both their guard positions.   And hawks have had 2 hunter and reddish, tho i dont think theyre top3 on the team. But they r the best defenders on the team.  6ers have danny green out. And embiid is hurt/injured"
"""Oh shit...I thought I was DANNY Green. My bad y'all, I'll rein it in next time!"" -JG, probably"
"Yeah, in the past I’ve seen some Warriors fans still say Danny Green did a dirty play on Klay causing him to get injured even though it was a freak accident and clearly not his intention."
"yeah but that is in the final couple of possessions. typically the best non-star defender will guard the best player on the other team for the rest of the game e.g. Danny Green in Toronto would guard the best player until the end of the game, and then Kawhi would switch on."
You mean Danny Green
every team left has someone out/hurt.   jazz-conley  hawks-hunter  sixers-danny green  suns-cp3  clippers-kawhi  bucks-divincenzo  nets-kyrie
"You guys are missing Danny Green. No doubt Embiids knee doesn’t feel 100%, but I also doubt a guy scoring like he did in games 1-3 is having it massively affect his game either.   Hawks and sixers and bucks have dodged the injury bug somewhat.  Hawks missing one starter and one backup in Hunter and Reddish.   Bucks missing Divincenzo."
Danny Green
I need Danny Green to 3 peat for 3 different teams.   Pushing his case for the HoF 😤🔥 gotta do it one time
"Even with ba roster construction, a good coach could  make it work. No one says that to the Kawhi-led spurs. Only Danny green was the shooter in the starting lineup. You have 2 mid range shooting bigs, who doesn't really contribute to floor spacing and a point guard who isn't know for it's shooting. That's a fucking bad roster construction, but because they have a great coach, no one questions it."
"Kawhi didn’t guard KD in the 2016 WCSF. when the starters were on the floor, Kawhi was on Russ and Danny Green was on KD"
"I'm not willing to EVER hear how Joe Harris is the Nets 4th star, they being Big-4, etc.  He looks good for one reason, and one reason alone - zero pressure and shooting wide wide open threes. He's not bad, he's a role player, and that's the kind of games / series role players have.   Just like you can get a Danny Green amazing series then 2 series of shit, this is no different."
Jeff playing like prime draymond + danny green rn.
"Jeff ""Danny"" Green"
lol no danny green has 3 rings
" they got a top 5 player in Kawhi and Danny green and Marc gasol , put lebrons cavs up against that team in the second round. You can’t just say they upgraded the sf position haha common"
Joe Harris the second coming of Danny Green?
Joe Harris getting some of that danny green treatment on Twitter rn
I remember comparisons of Danny Green vs Middleton in the Spurs sub. Even back then he was ballin.
"&gt;Dame hurt in R1  I appreciate that you note that none of these injuries really tilted things from against the Lakers to the series suddenly being in their favor. [The Dame injury](https://youtu.be/4DbQEeSmEL8) in particular was really irrelevant, as he got hurt in the second half of Game 4, when the Lakers were already up 2-1 in the series, and at the time of Dame's injury the Lakers were up 92-56 in the game. Lillard stayed in the game for two more minutes, and when he exited for good the score was 96-66, so I don't think if Dame stays healthy the Blazers win that game, meaning they'd have been down 3-1. The Blazers ended up losing that game by 20, after losing Game 2 by 23, so that wasn't a particularly close matchup even before the Lillard injury.   It's also important to note that Avery Bradley did not go to the bubble with the Lakers, Rondo missed the whole first round with a broken finger, and Danny Green played most of the playoffs with a hip injury, which really affected his offense, so it's not like the Lakers had no injuries or absences of their own to worry about."
"&gt;That was one of the greatest defenses of all time and it was the same season Ben Wallace and the Pistons won the title. Duncan led his team to a better year defensively than even that Pistons team (until the playoffs haha).  Led? He wasn't even the best defender on his team in 04 or at the very least it wasn't clear that he was the best defender. Bruce Bowen was first team all defense that year and he also finished higher than Duncan for DPOY. In fact, Duncan got a total of 8 points in that vote. He wasn't even the best defender on his own team for a long portion of his career. He only occasionally was the leading DPOY vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard, Duncan's Spurs were unremarkable defensively -- even with Danny Green ( and Popovich ). Robinson was better without any of those players, or Popovich. Which is why Robinson won DPOY and Duncan never came particularly close. Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated Spurs defenses without Duncan. Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th in the league. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners(one being a two time winner), and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"It was Maxey, Thybulle, 2 first round picks, and Danny Green - at least, that was what was being reported at the time."
"Danny Green shot 40% from deep on 6 attempts. Lowry shooting a few more isn't radically changing our spacing when Tobias and Ben are still on the team. That's the point, if teams can double off Tobias in the corner, not care about Simmons in the dunker spot while staying tight to Curry and Green, they'll do the same with Lowry.  I don't think the sixers get past the elite teams unless it's a Dame/Harden or maybe a Beal level scorer running PnR with Embiid. You have to open up the floor for Embiid and I think as long as you have Tobias/Ben on the floor with him Lowry isn't fundamentally changing what we struggle with."
You mean the lakers circle jerk? Every single quote by Kuzma and Danny Green was posted for three weeks straight during the finals and after lmao
Danny Green also.
"Tbf to Danny Green, players miss 3s all the time. George Hill missing a freethrow is way worse but even that is still understandable"
"it was maxey and a pick or 2, Danny green included for salary"
Pels sign Danny Green just so we can watch Lowry/Zion/DG all diaper jog down the court at the same time.
harden stuttering the open three and then passing the ball away.   pg hitting the backboard. passing to nobody.  ben simmons missing 3 straight after the whistle layups.   russ bricking a layup and missing a dunk.   danny green game winner miss last year. i can’t remember more
"This wasn't something new or radical...in most of the matchups with the Lakers in 2019-20 that I watched, Danny Green was the primary defender on Porzingis. This is a problem that the Mavs should have been working on for awhile to fix, and if they tried and weren't able to fix it, that's it's own problem right there."
"Thats right, Dwyane Wade and Danny Green are exactly the same: 3 rings each."
Noah barking may have led to Danny Green getting released lol. He was the one who got LeBron to start dancing which then got a bit out of hand
2020 was awful…it was 3-1  and would’ve been 4-1 if Danny Green made an open three. Plus Bam and Dragic were super hurt.
I didn’t say Danny Green is a dirty player  But F@ck Danny Green!  Stiil remember that chase down block on Klay… which we all know Danny Green cant jump!  Any play you are beaten just let it go!  Giannis to Booker dunk that is another dangerous play!
Losing Danny Green is what made it hurt for me. Knew Kawahi was gone
"I think there was this expectation that swapping Korkmaz in for Green is boosting offense at the expense of defense, but when you actually look at Korkmaz closer, he's basically just Danny without the defense."
Spurs definitely got fleeced  Especially when you throw Danny (dude just running around) Green
"And Danny Green went on to lead them to their first ever NBA title, then lead the LA Lakers back to glory"
You forget how deep was that team. Every player in the top6-7 rotation of the Raptors could give you 20 and play defense on an elite level. They lost Kawhi and Danny Green next year and were still 2nd seed and very close of making the Finals.   That team is certanly a top tier Championship team
ben  despite his awful offensive performance he was fantastic against trae from the second half of game 1 and on when doc took danny green off him. and he was DPOY runner-up and the consensus best perimeter defender all season
"Pat ""Spurs Danny Green"" Connaughton"
Giannis tried to danny green Booker's dunk.  So dirty.
"If not the max, pretty close to it. I mean, theres always a chance he falls off or its one of those summers where no one has the right fit of need and $$, but Ill put it this way-- if he stays being a defensive on ball menace who's a plus shooter, 20 million/yr would be fair and reasonable.   And theres always some team willing to go 25% over fair and reasonable.    (Although the argument against me would be Danny Green.  Hes a similar player type who always seems to get less than Id expect)"
"Al Jefferson was a better prospect than Bynum,  and Odom was damaged goods at the time.   People forget that Jefferson put up 23-11 at age 23 and 24 for Minnesota before he got hurt.   Wolves also got role players Ryan Gomes and Ratliff,  20 year old Gerald Green, Telfair who was a first rounder and 2 other first round picks.   But the highest upside player in either offer was Jefferson at the time.   Also Danny and Kevin are friends and hate LA"
"When people don’t understand that shooters have hot and cold streaks, they’ll have hot games and cold games, hot quarters and cold quarters.  When I see people complain that a guy like Joe Harris or Danny Green lost the game for their team on a cold shooting night it annoys me so much. You live and die by the jump shot, it is literally their job and their role is to take shots when they’re open."
I read this morning some Redditors are considering Danny Green for the HOF. Haha
Idk CJ is an upgrade from Danny green
"In my mind HOF means you were at least on several all-NBA teams, at one time or another in your career opponents were terrified of what you could do.   Danny Green checks zero of these boxes. I looked up a comparison player, Robert Horry. Similar story with the championships. Similar stats. Somehow on Simmons’ pyramid of basketball, but not in the HOF."
if Robert Horry isn't making it in than Danny green sure the hell isn't either
"I thought the worst Danny Green take was that he was going to be FMVP, but you just had no regard for human life."
Even Kyle Lowry is pushing it even though he might just sneak in and you want Danny Green lmao ?
Danny green isnt making hall of fame but if iguodala returns to the warriors and he wins another one he may make it
danny green and hall of fame? are you out of your mind
Danny Green for sure
"Wiggins *was* a bad max.  He has been great for the Warriors.  CJ isn't a bad max.  20+ a game while providing some of the league's best spacing for their offense and punishing teams that double Dame?  Look what Seth Curry did in the playoffs with Embiid pulling defenders into the key.  Now imagine CJ, who is a better all around player, on that squad.  Ben Simmons is a bad max because he lost it mentally and because they don't have the roster to support a PG who can't shoot.  Most rosters can't support that, tbh.  Simmons never should have been maxed.  He's an elite defender, a great passer, and they have some pieces like Seth Curry and Danny Green to cover for his lack of shooting, but it's not enough, especially when he won't even go up and dunk.  We thought CP3 was a bad max but he's been great."
"&gt; Stop pretending Lonzo isn't even close. Every other season Danny Green drops below 37% because he's so mind numbingly inconsistent. Lonzo is way more consistent and also has 10 years of less practice on his form than Green does lmao.   Uhh, what? Lonzo’s more consistent based on what? Two back to back seasons? Danny has a stretch of 8-9 seasons shooting like that while also dealing with entirely different defensive looks than Lonzo has garnered so far in his career. What a wild statement.   Lonzo’s form is also, still, pretty poor. So the question of “can he be a consistent shooter” is still out there.  &gt; Just because you hate Lonzo's dad doesn't mean you have to keep calling him trash.  Good strawman, no one mentioned his dad nor did I call him trash."
Lonzo the last two years: 320 makes on 37.6% in 118 games.   Danny Green the last two years: 295 makes on 38.9% in 137 games.   Stop pretending Lonzo isn't even close. Every other season Danny Green drops below 37% because he's so mind numbingly inconsistent. Lonzo is way more consistent and also has 10 years of less practice on his form than Green does lmao.   Just because you hate Lonzo's dad doesn't mean you have to keep calling him trash.
"Their  team would still be loaded. Not to mention come playoff time, it's usually just a 7 man rotation.  Lillard  Seth curry   Danny green  Harris  Embiid  --  Korkmaz, howard, George Hill.   That's a contender my guy!"
"Blazer line up:  Danny Green, Thybule, Maxey, Nas, Nurk, CJ, Norm, Simmons, ...  Thoughts?"
"Petition to nickname Danny Green ""The Ring Wing"""
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"I’m sorry you only define an era by “when I started watching the nba in 2015”. All of your comments are displaying a ton of ignorance of teams or players less than a decade ago. You couldn’t even remember the fact that Danny green was the starter for the Spurs runs or that Kawhi was not a dpoy level player yet. Danny green at the time was the best transition defender in the league, was historically good at it even."
"2012-2014 Spurs deserve a shout. I think I read somewhere that one of those teams has one of the best net ratings ever, they won a championship, nearly won another, and lost to OKC I think in 2012 who were their kryptonite. Danny Green nearly won Finals MVP because of how great their team ball was and how well they were balanced. During the 13-14 regular season, Parker led the team in scoring with 16.7ppg, less than double the 8th leading scorer, Boris Diaw with 9.1ppg. Six players averaged double figures for points. Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, Parker, Green, and Leonard will all be remembered past their era, and Patty Mills and Marco Bellinelli will be remembered by Spurs fans."
"summary so you don't have to endure the pain of watching it:  Toon Squad with the ball down 2 with 5 seconds left. Lebron sips his secret stuff and knows what he must do to save planet Earth. has an iso on the smallest Monstar but turns it down and dribbles into the defense, passing it to Danny Green who makes a surprise cameo  with the fate of the universe on the line, Danny Green bricks and planet Earth is blown to smithereens. with their dying breath, Lebron stans utter...at least Lebron made the right play"
"And also Dillon Brooks, since he's evil Danny Green"
shouldn't Danny Green be the star of the movie? Lebron gonna make the right play by passing the gamewinning shot to him anyways

"Difference is Jrue is one of “the” guys on his team. He’s expected to create and often that means taking shots, even if they’re not falling. He doesn’t have anyone to look to other than Middleton or Giannis, realistically. He’s not a stand in the corner 3&amp;D guy, so you’re right that the Danny Green comparison isn’t totally fair in that sense.   I want the Bucks to win and think they have the best shot when Jrue stays aggressive on offence. If you disagree, you’re gonna have to take that up with my homie Charles Barkley! Damn I miss TNT.."
"It’s down to how different websites define what a possession is — that’s why I couched it as **isn’t necessarily entirely true**. Pbpstats gives an explanation [here](https://dblackrun.github.io/2019/04/15/why-pbpstats-possession-counts-lower.html):  &gt; This season the NBA stats website started using exact possession counts instead of the estimate they had previously used. While exact counts had previously been available on some smaller sites, including my site, PBPStats, it was good to see what I would assume is the most visited site for NBA stats finally use exact counts. If you have compared numbers on the NBA site and on PBPStats you have probably noticed that the possession counts are different. How can the counts be different if both are using exact counts? Well it turns out defining a possession is not as simple as one might think. I will use game 1 of the Raptors Magic series to show a few examples of this.  &gt; At the end of the second quarter Danny Green makes a three with 0.4 seconds remaining. Orlando inbounds the ball to Aaron Gordon who fails to get a full court shot off before the buzzer sounds. Should this count as a possession for Orlando? Their percentage chances of scoring here are probably in the low single digits so does it make sense to count it the same as we would count a normal mid-quarter possession with a 24 second shot clock.  &gt; At the end of the third quarter Pascal Siakam misses a corner three. In the play-by-play Michael Carter-Williams is credit with a rebound with one second remaining in the quarter. Does that mean Orlando gets credited with a new possession after the rebound? As you can see from the video, it would take a miracle for them to score after the rebound.  &gt; At the end of the fourth quarter Kawhi Leonard missed a three pointer that would have tied the game and the ball went out of bounds with 0.5 seconds remaining. Orlando just needed to inbound the ball and have time expire to win the game. Should this be counted as a possession for them?  &gt; If you look at the stats for this game on the NBA site it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 99 possessions. On PBPStats it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 96 possessions. I don’t know exactly how possessions are counted on the NBA site, but the most logical guess I can make is the three possession difference is because the three examples above are all counted as possessions for Orlando. None of them are counted on PBPStats. Any possession that starts with two or fewer seconds remaining in a quarter isn’t counted as a possession, unless points are scored. I arbitrarily picked two seconds, but the goal was to limit counting end of quarter possessions with little to no chance of scoring.  &gt; This is why you will see the team efficiency stats 1-2 points per 100 possessions higher on PBPStats. This isn’t the only place where decisions need to be made on how to count a possession, flagrant fouls are another place (I count the free throws and possession following the free throws as two separate possessions), but it is the biggest one that would be causing most of the difference. I understand why one would count possessions the way they are on the NBA site - it’s easy to understand and easier to code, but I think not counting those end of quarter possessions give a better representation of a team’s efficiency. There is no perfect way to do it. Working with play-by-play data is always going to be messy and there will always be issues you hadn’t considered that come up. I think it’s good to have options available that make different choices and let the user decide which one makes more sense for what they are looking for."
All the nephews on the game thread talking about Jrue playing like ass are cut from the same cloth as Danny Green haters. These dudes can’t possibly fathom how a player could provide value to their team without scoring.
How TF is Danny Green valued at $19M lol??
How is Danny Green at $19 mill???

Gotta love the Crowder experience. Him and Evil Danny Green must've had Memphis fans in shambles some nights while they were together.
"Ben Wallace by far. This is mostly due fans not understanding how much coaching and team communication goes in to team defense and defensive performance. So they just look to pin all of the Pistons success on one guy because it's a lazy/easy, and one player actually does have an outsized effect on offense. So people assume it works the same for defense.   Before Ben Wallace got to Detroit be was a journeyman who wasn't anchoring any top defenses in Washington. Meanwhile before he started coaching Detroit in 2003, Larry Brown led the #1 defense in the NBA back to back years in Philadelphia, where Dikembe Mutumbo was DPOY. Similar to Wallace under Brown in Detorit.  As someone who watched the Pistons back then. It was similar to the 2019 Raptors. Where every single player on their starting 5 was playing on a string and communicating well. Chauncey v. Lowry, Danny Green &amp; Kawhi v. Rip Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince, Siakam v. Sheed, and the Ibaka/Gasol combo v. Ben Wallace.  Almost every player on that Pistons starting 5 was about equal on defense. I'd even argue Tayshaun being the best defender relative to his position and deserved one of those DPOYs. But all you ever hear on here is how Ben Wallace was a cheat code that you could swap into any team and they'd go to 99 OVR defense. Come on."
"Knuckleheads, All the Smoke, CJ's pod,  Gilbert Arena's podcast,  Danny Green actually has a good pod, Roadtrippin is interesting"
*Evil Danny Green
"Yeah completely agree which is why it would be crazy to give up 3 firsts for Ben Simmons. I think if they are willing to trade 3 firsts they should explore the market for those picks.   What the 76ers have that the Kings don't are other pieces like Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, and Danny Green that could be packaged with those picks. So if 3 picks isn't enough, they might be able to make a package that is"
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
You’re *severely* underrating Lonzo’s playmaking abilities here. He’s nothing like Danny Green what the fuck
"Tell me why the a smaller Danny Green is better for Lakers than a slashing guard for Pelicans, who sorely lacks someone to create for others."
"I made this trade in the trade machine a 3 team trade.  76ers get:  Terry Rozier  Buddy Hield  resign Danny Green  Zeller (s&amp;t 3 years 3 million each year)  2 unprotected picks from Sac. 2023 and 2025.  &amp;#x200B;  Kings get:   Ben Simmons  &amp;#x200B;  Hornets get:  Bagley  Thybulle  First round 2021 kings.  &amp;#x200B;  The Hornets get a young guys and the first, they lose their best SG in the team which it has a ton of value after last season.   76ers get 2 unprotected (that can trade to improve even more) Rozier and Buddy Hield, 2 good shooters that have a lot of value they can still trade them to improve or keep em both or one of them. They get Zeller really as a salary thing and also backup Center.  Kings Ben Simmons."
"Have they really though? Overpaying Horford was a bad move, but they were able to dump him after one year.  They got Jimmy Butler for peanuts and that very nearly led to them winning the title. It was worth the gamble.  The Tobias Harris trade worked well, and while his contract initially was an overpay, it's looking to be a fair deal and he pairs well next to Embiid.  They also have Seth Curry on a great contract, Thybulle and Maxey were great picks, Dwight on a minimum made sense, and unfortunately Danny Green got hurt, but he made sense for this team.  It's not the GM's fault Simmons cratered so hard in the playoffs.   What specific assets have been ""squandered"" and what other options were available since Hinkie's departure? Maybe Paul George, but what else? Hinkie didn't necessarily leave them with that great of assets besides the core of Simmons/Embiid, as most other picks were bad to average players."
"&gt; Streaky is a relative term. Klay’s low is higher than pretty much everyone.  He's definitely not Danny Green level of streaky (aside from 1 or 2 cold stretches he's had in his career), that's for sure."
well its Lowry and Hield which would be HUGE upgrades for them.  They get a veteran Point guard that can run the offense and they get Hield  who is a much better shooter/threat than Danny Green who they needed desperately in the playoffs.
No he isn’t.  Replacing Simmons for heild would just kill their defense against wings which is what took them out this playoffs.   Imo if they had a healthy Danny green I think they beat the hawks.
"He would actually.  Contrary to the reddit circlejerk, Ben Simmons is a perfectly fine player and wasn’t really the issue with you guys.  The issue is that you have never been built to defend against a team with multiple big wings who are elite scorers (outside of the year with jimmy).  We saw that vs the Celtics over the past few years and the hawks this season.   Having Danny green injured meant that you got your smaller players hunted too Easily.   A guy like roco allowing you to run Ben, roco, DG, tobi, embiid would probably allow you to win the East."
"I’d actually take that deal because SAC would still be a lottery team in the West and those picks could be really valuable. We could turn around and trade them packaging like Bagley and a sign and trade for Danny green to make the salaries work for someone else. Like what if you sent Bagley and 2 SAC FRPs to CLE for Sexton? So you essentially turn Ben into Sexton and Hield? It’s not horrible, given their position."
"Actually dont think Hield, Bagley and 3 firsts is a bad haul for Simmons...but I dont see the fit for Philly if Fox isnt involved. Seth Curry, Hield, Danny Green, Tobais and Embid starting? Absolutely no playmaking and way worse on D. Makes alot of sense if they can get Lowry to sign in free agency though"
"If I'm the Sixers I say, fuck you, we're getting Barnes in the salary match or no deal.  Then we can keep Danny Green in the starting lineup and try and upgrade at PG with the Bagley / George Hill contracts and picks"
"I agree that the Raptors getting a vet, the 9th overall pick, and Bagley for an UFA is a good return for them.   I also hope that the Sixers are able to acquire Luka in exchange for Danny Green."
"I think the question is less sticking him at another position and more adding literally anybody who can dribble to the starting lineup. Ben's never played alongside another point or combo guard in his career, other than TJ McConnell or Shake Milton. Teams need more than one guy who can create, either for himself or others, and the Sixers have never had that.  &gt; There were many possessions he didn't even bring the ball up the court. He'd sit around by the dunker spot essentially playing the front court role.  So I'm curious how Ben looks off-ball if there's a respectable dude handling it, vs. having Tobias, Danny Green, and Matisse desperately swinging the ball around hoping somebody magically gets open."
"Tbf Theres more to boban than just his size. It's his skill paired with his size that makes him pretty special in today's league. He's like Kanter on steroids. If he'd only be able to play slightly negative defense instead of being completely destroyed by today's Morey ball he could be a massive plus in longer spurts. He has a great touch around the rim, strong post moves, scores on very high% in the p'n'r. When Luka handles the ball with Boban on the field he'll focus on feeding him buckets every possession because Bobans offense is pretty much automatic as soon as he's near the basket and he'll almost certainly get there through his strength and general feel for positioning on offense. He's just terribly slow and can't defend NBA calibre players because of it.  On topic I feel with Thybulle he could be one of the very best roleplayers ever because of his incredible defense. Ben can't run a half court offense well and this made me think about what could be if Thybulle played next to a guy like Harden, Bron or Luka. Thybulle would only have to learn 2 things on the offensive end to be a Roleplayer with All-Star impact: catch and shoot 3s and timely cuts to the basket as he should be able to become a good slasher given his size and athleticism. There are quite a few playmakers that could max out Thybulle to the point of becoming a difference maker/x factor on a championship team and probably even a dynasty as well.  His skillset doesn't desire a lot of time on ball and this might very well be a massive plus in a league where the best players are super ball dominant. For Maxey to exceed this he needs to be very efficient on ball and gel with players that are much better than him and require him to get going without having many touches.   Idk I just think that Thybulle could be a better version of Danny Green (on a very good year) as soon as he has a respectable catch and shoot game. He really needs a playmaking veteran superstar to teach him his role and flourish in it. If he manages to develop accordingly there's fewer players able to do what Thybulle could do than what Maxey will bring to the table."
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre…. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also…. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc…."
"It is not nearly universally agreed upon.  Duncan lead the spurs in points and rebounds for the whole series and was the reason that Danny Green was open to hit those 3s.  There is no way they give finals MVP to a guy that has more fouls than points in the final game, especially when the narrative would be that the franchise GoaT put the team on his back to close the series.  When finals MVP is close, it usually goes to the franchise player (with Steph Curry as the exception)."
"In game 6 Duncan had 30 points and 17 rebounds.  Danny Green had 3 points.  If the Spurs hold on to win game 6, Duncan gets FMVP."
"will Danny Green get a cameo as the guy Lebron passes to for the gamewinning shot? with the fate of the universe on the line, at least Lebron made the right play!"
"Born in the state of NY and not necessarily in the city the Knicks get Kemba, Mitchell, Huerter, Tobias, and Thomas Bryant. Isaac, Drummond, Taj, Melo and Danny Green off the bench."
I love their vids so much and the LeBron vids are by far my favorites (as well as the cvs/Walgreens one). I especially love the one where LeBron drags KCP and Danny Green out of their hotel rooms because they each only had one point.
"Firstly, you don't know me or anybody else on here. You don't think doctors, lawyers, firefighters log on to reddit to let off some steam? Or you just think that athletes by default work harder than everybody else?  Secondly, I'm not looking down on anybody, I'm just stating an opinion.  No doubt Steven Adams works incredibly hard. That has nothing to do with the discussion here. I'm not talking about hard work, I'm talking about assertiveness.  Be honest, do you really think that Steven Adams has achieved everything that he could've been in the NBA? You don't think that if he had've had a different approach to his role that he could've had a different career trajectory?  What about Ben Simmons then? Is he doing absolutely everything in his power to be the best version of himself that he can be? I sure don't think so, and apparently Doc Rivers, Joel Embiid, Danny Green and Daryl Morey agree with me.  But maybe those guys don't realise the amount of work it takes either, and we're all just being unfair to these guys and looking down on them."
"The skill gap definitely is not as big but Canada could still easily put together 2 teams that could medal in the Olympics. They have won 3 of the last 4 gold medals where the NHL played with 2006 being the year they lost. And that Canada team went really hard into it, they had the equivalent of like Danny Green (Draper and Maltby) on the team and left a ton of skilled players at home. It's not that those guys can't hang it's that there is nothing they bring to the table that a player 5 times more skilled can't also do if they put the effort in and are less focused on scoring.  The US's general lack of big man talent does create an interesting problem. I would still describe Noel as a one dimensional role player but they could use what he brings to the table. I don't know if it is possible or reasonable for Pop to go up to someone like KAT and say ""you won't get any buckets but we need you to try really hard on D and grab every rebound"". I think until the US actually loses at the Olympics again there is no incentive for these guys to actually give a shit about international play."
"Again? OKC already flipped Schroder for Danny Green, who they then flipped into a first round pick and cash lol"
"their defense was insane period….Lowry, FVV, and Danny Green was as good as you can get for a guard rotation defensively at the time (outside of Simmons and Butler)"
"Not even just the front court, Lowry, Danny Green, Norm and FVV in the backcourt. That team was crazy"
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"The Raptors would have never asked for Curry in the trade at the deadline. Now they HAVE to ask for him. Of course they would be happy to get him, but the only reason he's on the table is because Morey punked himself and thought George Hill was good enough.  No one has a crystal ball. All you can do is maximize your chances of contention while you have a window and try to shore up as many weaknesses as possible. Morey thought he could do that on a budget, but the thing that had a 1% chance of happening happened. And now Simmons looks like shit, Embiid wasted another year of his prime and a chunk of his cartilage on another second round exit, and the 76ers are in a way worse spot when it comes to making a Lowry trade happen. And I can guarantee you that championships are worth a whole lot more than Danny Green, late 1sts and prospects.  And please stop acting like it was only one year of Lowry when it was widely reported he'd re-sign with the team that traded for him. For fucks sake, Philly is his hometown!"
"&gt;Weird without that ""lucky"" player you guys arent even in the playoffs  If by lucky player, you mean:  Kawhi Leonard Danny Green  Marc Gasol Serge Ibaka  Sure. And post-Leonard we were still one of the most successful teams in the East. Even went on our longest winning streak in team history. It's only after our team lost both centres that we went to seed.   &gt;When Demar Derozan is your ""franchise player"" you know your not a good franchise.   Pre-Leonard, the Raptors were a successful team in the East. Despite all the hate DeRozan is getting in this thread, he lead us to our first ECF. Something Embiid, so far, hasn't managed.  &gt;Upgrading from Derozan to arguably the best player in the league, ""risky"".  Lol. The revisionism is amazing. And didn't Morey pass on a perfectly healthy Harden for Simmons? Seems like it was more than just luck to pull that trigger on a superstar who hadn't played in a year, disgruntled and coming off major injury."
"Lol they didn’t even need Melo, they could’ve had Danny Green and that would’ve been a MASSIVE improvement over anything they ever had on the wings.   I’ll forever remember that team for collecting players that spanked them the year before in the playoffs. Josh Smith killing them and then signing with them the next season was just so funny.  You could tell Doc signed him just because of the previous playoffs."
Danny Green anti-American confirmed.
"&gt;  so I'm not sure why he is even relevant.  I brought up CJ Miles because you brought up the Marc Gasol trade. **""and it came at the price of two former first rounders (both drafted higher than Maxey and Thybulle!)""**. As if former draft position means anything when it comes to trading players, but your point is incorrect. JV was drafted 5th overall. Delon wright was drafted at the same position as both Maxey &amp; Thybulle. Miles was drafted later than both of them. But you didn't even acknowledge my main point of Maxey &amp; Thybulle being on rookie contracts having much more value than all 3 of those players that were traded for Gasol.     &gt; (And if you think the fact that Marc Gasol's $26m player option at 35 years old added value compared to Lowry's expiring + Bird rights, I'm not sure what to tell you.)  Where the fuck did I say that? I literally said ""Third, Lowry has much more value than Gasol did seeing as Lowry is commanding players on rookie contracts and 1st round draft picks.""  &gt; do you REALLY think Morey made the right decision keeping Maxey, Thybulle, Danny Green and some late 1sts  yes seeing as that's a bullshit offer for 35 year old lowry. If they get him this offseason it will be for salary (hill/green) a prospect (Maxey or Thybulle) and a single 1st round draft pick."
"The Raptors don't necessarily want Hill or Curry. That's just the reality of the salary matching situation now that Danny Green and Mike Scott are off the books. And now that there are other potential trades on the horizon, Morey might find something better than the Lowry deal and it'll make the 76ers even better next season.  That doesn't change the fact that he wasted a precious postseason of Embiid's prime when there was a real shot at winning the championship in a wide open year."
"He used to scare the crap outta me in any playoff game. Just was always a bench guy as he had Tony Parker, Danny Green and Manu in front of him."
"instead of booker and lavine it should have been 3 and D wings or guards  it doesnt have to be george and kawhi  Crowder,Danny green, Smart would have been good to have"
Danny Green does not like that
"Lol, catching strays from a Suns fan for no reason. Here's why I think you're off base.  1) Tyrese Maxey was drafted 21st and Thybulle 20th, both of which are equal to or later than JV and Delon. I admit, I thought Thybulle was drafted 22nd, but at this point we're splitting hairs, right? Meanwhile, CJ Miles was drafted in 2005 by the Jazz and primarily included in that trade as salary filler, so I'm not sure why he is even relevant.  2) Again, you're looking for a 1:1 comparison like these 76ers fans. That's not the point. The point is there are two teams, the 2019 Raptors and 2021 76ers, that had issues that they needed to fix by the trade deadline in order to take the next step into contention. The Raptors gave up their long-time starting center and an important reserve, i.e. functional depth, for a player that also happened to be a past-his-prime former All-Star that the front office recognized could help the team win a championship. (And if you think the fact that Marc Gasol's $26m player option at 35 years old added value compared to Lowry's expiring + Bird rights, I'm not sure what to tell you.)  Just to be clear, I have absolutely zero prejudice against the 76ers or their fans. I thought they had an excellent shot at the championship even without doing the Lowry trade, and I didn't think it was that bad of a decision for them at the time. But now that we've all seen how things worked out, do you REALLY think Morey made the right decision keeping Maxey, Thybulle, Danny Green and some late 1sts when it meant sacrificing a year of Embiid's peak and like half of Simmons's trade value to the 2nd round meatgrinder? If so, why?"
Not evil Danny green!
That Danny Green dunk on the hawks. Super unexpected and also Green is one of the most likable nba players ever
Schrodinger’s Danny green
I don’t think good Danny green has been found yet. The one on the sixers is neutral Danny Green
Philly should trade for him to see what happens when good and evil danny green are on the same team. The multiverse might just collapse
No not evil Danny Green!
I liked the idea of Eric Gordon for Danny Green as a fake trade at the deadline before Gordon got hurt....but alas that's always the problem with EG. Im not a big Tobias guy either but this is probably selling too low
"This is how I felt about Danny green on the Spurs vs the heat, made me want to strangle someone"
"He took contested 3 pointers. He didn’t have the benefit of a Kyle Korver or Danny Green to get the ball kicked out to for open 3s.  That being said, Kobe was a good 3 point shooter, not a great one. He was very streaky. If he caught fire, he looked like Reggie Miller. If he was cold, you questioned why he was even taking those shots.   In his prime, he typically shot around 35%. Which at the time, when you pair the fact that 3s weren’t as prevalent today + he demanded double teams/tight coverage, it’s actually decent.  Overall, he was good enough of a shooter where you didn’t sag off him. It was good enough to incorporate in his offensive arsenal and good enough to demand attention from the defense. But that’s it."
"I met Danny Green. Tall, trying to hide the fact that he was an NBA player. I respected his feelings and didn’t mess w him bc he obv was kinda trying to stay hidden. Done this with a few stars tbh. Wesley Snipes stepped on my shoe one night walking down the street. Only reason I didn’t hit him is bc of who he was. Neither one of us was happy lol."
"Spurs really bred two of the dirtiest players in the NBA, Bruce Bowen and Danny Green"
"Simmons would have been traded for kawhi that off-season if lebron joined Philly. Kawhi/embiid/lebron/Danny green/covington is good enough to beat gsw, both offensively and defensively. It's better than the 2019 raptors which bewt a kd less gsw"
The only other role player I’ve seen explode like that in a series was Danny Green on Spurs in Finals
"Danny green has one, don’t know if he still does it though"
He's was the GOAT guard shot blocker until Danny Green showed up. Even then Danny Green is quite a bit taller.
"Out of Kyle Fred Norm og siakam ibaka gasol kawhi Danny green, Norm was the worst defender. He gets in his stance and has effort, but he doesn't do anything special and he committed a lot of fouls when dudes blew passed him. Portland isn't going anywhere playing Norm at the 3 where he's playing undersized.  Gary was sold as a high effort on ball defender. Still needs to figure out some stuff for the raptors team defense."
"Danny Green made an all defensive team.  Shawn Marion never making all defense was a huge snub for his career, but it kinda proves my point...  Elite means among the best. PP wasn't a better defender than Marion and Marion never made a team, so how is PP elite?  PP was not a bad defender but saying he was *elite* is the type of exaggeration I'm talking about.  This shit only started in his retirement...no one was saying this when he was playing."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic has a pretty handy 1-on-1 game. Bojan less so, but he's still not a unidimensional player on offense like Danny Green or Joe Harris."
"RJ is right. Klay has way more 1 on 1 game more than that of Joe Harris, Bogdanovic, Danny Green type for sure.. that’s why I always hate the comparison of Klay being a 3nD player..He was a legit all star with star attributes.  That being said tho, Warriors case for being the best brand comes from their star players identity that came with the pre existed foundation of ball movement, screen, cuts, motion offense smart making move off the ball… KD can fit in anywhere with any system. We also got to see the Warriors beautiful brand of basketball since 2014-15 and had 3 seasons with KD in that system.   We barely got to see a full strength Nets altogether. Nets do have some elements of an off ball plays, there are plenty of plays where Kyrie and KD screen for each other’s to either create mismatch on switch or to beeline for the lay up off miscommunication.. I think given time Nets will come to their identity of all around well offensive juggernaut that can kill anyone in Iso, PnR, ball movement… hell even Harden was cutting without the ball in the series against Boston.. there is also so much more shootings on this team than GSW. KD, Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Patty Mills… that’s just absurd spacing all around  even if Joe Harris can be a brick layers in Playoffs they can afford it"
"What part of ""at his peak"" don't you understand? And plenty of elite defensive players didn't make all nba teams. Matrix? Danny Green? Sheed?   Peak season I'm talking about he lost out to Artest, Garnett, Ak47 and Bruce Bowen. All 4 are extremely well regarded defenders, all-time caliber even."
"He's great on defense! But he isn't peak Klay. He can't guard the likes of Harden, Kyrie, KD (ehh even for Klay) in a playoff series to the same effect. No knock to Wiggins, Klay was like Danny Green 2.0"
Danny Green will go down as the most under-appreciated  role player of his era
That Spurs Heat finals was awesome. Kawhi breaking out as an absolute 2 way god and Danny Green going nuclear from the 3.  Bron and the big 3 and all of their shooters were relentless.
It is Easy Being Green: The Danny Green story
"Yeah I guess the big question, if they had Ingram over Simmons, would they have won it all? No I don’t think so, maybe they do better, you don’t bring in both Danny green and Seth curry if you have shooting from Ingram instead of Simmons"
&gt;evil Danny Green  Bruh
"Turned a rockets team treading water into a legit contender without ever tanking once. Stacked them with great role players. Traded for cp3.  And on one season on the sixers he drafted maxey, got them off Horfords albatross while getting Danny green in return  and his moves got them to the 1 seed in the east."
"Spidder man, Bane, Khal Drogo, and evil Danny Green. What's not to like"

Danny Green - Transition Defense     Andre Miller - Best 1 handed Dribbler (rarely used his left hand)
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?  Top (potential) free agents were:         Kawhi (doesn't count; wasn't leaving)   CP3 (old)   John Collins   Kyle Lowry (old)   Mike Conley   Demar DeRozan   Devonte Graham       Other names:   Duncan Robinson   Lonzo Ball   Danny Green"
"Let me tell you, as a Wolves fan I would KILL for a consistent string of 1st round playoff exits.... Big market teams don't really understand what it is like to not have FAs want to come to you. Ever. Like never ever ever. The Lakers best ever FA signing is a toss up between Lebron and Shaq. The Wolves best ever FA singing is a toss up between Kevin Martin and Taj Gibson. Then comes the tanking, so we small market teams need to tank to get top prospects, but once they sign their 2nd contract it still becomes hard to build a team of competent role players around them, because you are overpaying for FAs to come live there. There is no Danny Green tier players that will come here. The best case scenario for a small market team is to find diamonds in the rough that stay loyal to their franchise. GSW isn't a small market team, but before they had not too much FA sway. But Curry is better than anyone could have guessed, and Draymond is an absolute gem of a late pick, pair that with a coach that has an innovative system that fits their players strength and now you have a contender, once you are in contender rankings you get the chance to sign KD."
"&gt;	Getting triple teamed every clutch moment because everybody on the planet knows you’re the GOAT then making the right pass  Lol, a [knock on Lebron his entire career has been that he “makes the right pass” at end game situations instead of taking the shot himself](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/12766/lebron-takes-a-pass-at-crunch-time).   Lebron gets double and tripled teamed in the clutch too, and he makes the right pass more often than not. Case in point: [the bubble Finals](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=boiBU6Wt31s) where the *entire* Heat defense collapses on Lebron and he kicks it out to Danny Green."
"6 quarters. Danny Green knocked him out of Game 2, too.  But the point is that ""depth"" is a terrible explanation for why the Raptors beat the Warriors.  If Kawhi had gone down in the second round like Durant did, the Raptors never would have made the finals. That has nothing to do with having better depth."
My pops always said Danny Green looked like Lionel Richie
"We got Danny Green in the Horford trade too, been a solid player both ends"
"I guess it depends on who the 3rd team is in that hypothetical. Everybody seems to forget that trading Ben will result in them having a wing-sized hole in their roster that they don't have the personnel to replace him with. Are they really going to run Danny Green or Korkmaz at the 3?  If they're able to swing a Dame trade, I sincerely think that the 76ers would consider throwing a pick back at Portland to take on Robert Covington (he'd be traded anyways if Portland is blowing up the damn team).  McDaniels could fit that whole, but I doubt that Philly would want to trust a second-year guy that was barely a first round draft pick with starters minutes on push to contention."
"Bro this. Wasn’t like Danny Green was playing spectacularly out there. Even in game 2 the Sixers pulled away mostly because shake Milton decided to go supernova. I get that he’s a very useful player for the system, but he had been playing fairly mediocre to that point in the series."
"Shaky start? Good lord man.      1. We were not getting Harden, ever.      2. We traded Horford and Richardson and got back Curry for a 1st rounder 5 years out (Edit: and Danny Green).      It’s absolutely crazy how anti-Morey this sub is when he’s really done pretty good."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ou46ae/how_badly_did_daryl_morey_mess_up_by_refusing_to/  Why are you so insistent on shitting on Daryl? Lol  George Hill was probably an overpay, but it shouldn’t be in the same conversation as the Harden trade.  To be fair to Daryl, he has made some good moves in his short time in Philly as well such as acquiring Seth Curry and Danny Green."
Danny Green being higher than Tim Duncan is mildly annoying
Kids these days acting like Danny Green wasn’t the premier 3 &amp; D dude like not even 6 years ago
"&gt;This. Danny Green and Korkmaz are easily our biggest threats. Danny was injured and Korkmaz is a bench guy.  Dude where does he say ""two of their biggest threats are out""? He called them THE biggest threats... he didn't even mention them being out until after, and even then Korkmaz still played...  Read some more dude, you're inferring more than you can handle holy shit"
More or less the MLS is where the good players go to make one last payday. It’s like Danny Green passing up the chance to contend again in exchange for more money in Philly because he’s satisfied with his career.
This. Danny Green and Korkmaz are easily our biggest threats. Danny was injured and Korkmaz is a bench guy.
Danny Green - Fastbreak Defense
Danny green- stopping a fast break
"I see your point but the issue for the Sixers at that point was coaching and roster. The Sixers simply have terrible guards, once Danny Green went down with injury they had 0 two-way guards. Doc Rivers coached terribly, making the issue way worse than it should have been."
Imagine playing Shawn kemp and drexler in the finals LMAO  What fake GOAT only makes 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history  Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than jordan does vs literal PE teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec
I never said he wasn’t I said we couldn’t bench him because Danny Green was hurt.
"You’re talking about game 7, OP is talking about game 5. We couldn’t bench Seth because Danny Green was injured."
Danny Green - full speed to full stop pull-up 3 pointer on a fast break.
Your defense is only as good as your weakest link. That Danny green loss was devastating for the sixers. Teams that rely on stops to generate the offense line bucks and Philadelphia suffer hard when a starter is a defensive liability
"Sixers still choked this series but they were notably worse without Danny green, one of their best defenders and a starter.  Not making excuses for them because both teams had injuries, but it’s worth acknowledging that the landscape of the series shifted after he got hurt and never came back."
That’s cap  Danny green isn’t making up for Simmons woes
You can’t say all that and not acknowledge the hawks were without their best wing  De’andre Hunter &gt;&gt; Danny Green
Losing Danny Green wasn’t mentioned enough. With him they win the series
Imagine making 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history   There wouldn’t be a Jordan era if even Durant played in the 90s  Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals and a million times better performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did by pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec
Danny green just sliding in the list 😂
Danny Green has earned his keep
 Danny Green:  Busting up a fast break by himself.
Danny Green is the luckiest mf ever lmao
Danny Green - breaking up an opposing fast break when outnumbered
Danny Green - fast-break transition defense.   I've lost count of the number of times that I've seen him poke the ball away from the ball-handler of a two-on-one or three-on-one fast-break.
Legendary! Both Spurs vs. Heat series were some of my favourites this entire decade. I still wonder what the absolute hell Danny Green was smoking during the 2013 finals.
FVV was coming off the bench for 25-27MPG and played even less in the playoffs. We had Danny Green starting for most matchups that would give us issues defensively and also had Norm off the bench for 20MPG. This is without mentioning that both Lowry and FVV are dogs defensively.   Sexton is closer to Monta Ellis than he is to Devin Booker. If he was worth a max then the Cavs wouldn't be looking to trade him in the first place. He'd have to show something really promising in the upcoming season to be compared to Booker.
danny green transition defense
"&gt;Also the lakers hold nothing compared to the nets, so don’t even trying to compare the two.  You're right, there is no comparison between the 60-win pace, 1st seeded Lakers and KD+roleplayers. Lakers would have that shit over in 5 games.   &gt;Second of all you didn’t even rebut my statement about the bucks stopping the lakers, just said some passive aggressive hoe shit.  All you did was call something subjective a fact with zero supporting evidence. Don't expect me to be posting a dissertation-length rebuttal off that bullshit lmfao. I swear it's always the people doing the least that expect the most.   &gt;The lakers faced the 8th blazers first round  Wait, the first seed played the 8th seed in the first round?!?! I can tell that you're salty as hell cause you deadass thought this nonsense made sense lol.   &gt;harden by himself in the second  I know you weren't watching bball back then, but WB was on that team. That Rockets team was more formidable than the hobbled Trae Young + roleplayers the Bucks had to beat to get to the finals. Shit, didn't even have to play against Trae last two lol.   &gt;taken to 6 games against a Miami heat team that had dragic out, bam missing multiple games due to a messed up shoulder and Jimmy twisting his ankle  Same Heat that embarassed y'all, btw. But lemme guess, ""that doesn't count!"" Sadly for y'all, those of us who watched aren't gonna forget. Also, you wanna talk Injuries? Let's talk about Harden and Kyrie? Or maybe Trae young? Or maybe the guys y'all faced in the finals' opponents.   &gt;even with the lakers shooting above their heads career wise  Lakers shot 35.1% from three that finals. This was with KCP and Danny green (career 44% 3pt shooter in the finals up til then)  shooting 30.2 28.9, respectively. It's real funny how their 3pt% was somehow still lower than the Bucks during the finals yet somehow it's the Lakers who got lucky with hot shooting.   &gt;The fact that both teams that made the finals ended up getting bounced in the first round this year, perfectly illustrates how fraudulent that bubble run was.  It shouldn't have to be explained that you can't extrapolate two different seasons with different roster constructions and circumstances lol. I guess 2011 Mavs and 2014 Spurs didn't deserve their ring cause they got bounced in the first round the following seasons."
Yeah he’s just not that great. If it happened to someone like Danny Green he’d still be on a roster for sure
Tobias was giving you 20+ on near 50/40/90 shooting and Ben was the DPOY runner up  They also had great shooters in Danny Green and Seth Curry as well as a good bench unit
"Sure, go ahead and attack my flair. It's not like I said the Nuggets should've won the series or all the Lakers players were getting away with a million fouls. It was specifically Rondo and Dwight doing ""saavy veteran"" things that are fouls and normally get called as such, but didn't, because of their names and the fact that they play for the Lakers. You don't see me saying Caruso or Danny Green or AD was getting away with shit.   Jokic would've put up better stats had he not been in foul trouble for most of that series, that's a fact, he's just an unstoppable offensive player."
* ben simmons * seth curry * tobias harris * danny green * andre drummond  They would beat the Sacramento Kings when they'd play them in Philly.
"Lol , i dont think you saw how our role players played at all. The only one bricking was danny green and he was still good defensively"
He made 1 trade trying to get a pg for Danny green. We all can shit on it now retrospectively looking at it but it seemed like a great move at the time. Lebron could not sustain the bubble year roster again as the primary ball handler. Also Dennis looked really good til getting covid and not showing up in the playoffs
2016 Danny green? Yes. They were the title favorites without kd.
"Probably because: 1) Analysts liked the Clippers back then with Lou Will, Kawhi, PG13, Pat Bev, Montrezl, etc. compared to the Lakers. While the Lakers were the betting favorites, the Clippers were sort of the favorites among analysts and media. 2) There were questions on the Lakers regarding age, fit, lack of shooting, etc. They were among the oldest teams in the league (now they're even older) and their best shooters were KCP, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, and Troy Daniels (before he was waived in the middle of the season). Not to mention potential fit issues with Dwight Howard in the mix. Plus, ""AD at the 5"" debates started when they insisted on starting McGee at the 5 at the start of the season. 3) How much did Lebron have left after a rough 2018-19 season when he had a non-contact injury when he pulled his groin and he performed rather mediocre for his standards after he came back. 4) Frank Vogel: How well can he coach guys like Lebron, AD, Dwight, etc.? Sure, he's well known for his defensive schemes. But was that enough to get them over the top.  Fortunately for them, things worked out in the end. Sure, the Bubble sort of added context on how the championship will be remembered, but every playoff team had to deal with it."
I wanna say don’t sign Al Horford so bad but then we don’t get Danny Green and I like Danny Green so
u mean the danny green that chokes every playoffs? stop being delusional to try to discredit KD
Should've been 5 games if Danny Green hits the dang shot at the end.
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
"Amnesty Perkins and meet Harden's demands during 2012 offseason. No Harden for Houston = no playoffs for Houston = unlikely injury for Westbrook (no Beverley). No one would have beaten that core after 2012, especially if Brooks were to be replaced with a more competent coach, and Miami wouldn't have been able to take advantage of Perkins during the likely 2013 finals rematch.  A close second would be encouraging FO to resist the application of the Derrick Rose rule to KD in 2011 which messed up OKC's salary situation and made OKC too stingy /cheap in dealing with upcoming free agents like Harden. No one can fault KD for trying to earn more, but everyone forgot that the application of that Derrick Rose rule meant OKC had less to offer to Harden.  The third would be drafting Curry instead of Harden. With Curry's injury problems during the early part of his career, OKC could have afforded keeping KD, WB, Ibaka and Curry and the GSW dynasty would not have occurred.  Fourth would be trading up further than the 11th pick during the 2010 draft to get either Hayward or PG13 instead of Aldrich (or at least drafting Sanders or Whiteside).  Fifth would be firing whoever that was making draft choices was infatuated with long/athletic non-shooters during the 2010s - OKC could have built a village with all the bricks from their 2010s draft picks.  And lastly, if none of the above were to have happened, I would have traded KD after his 2013-2014 season for Kawhi + Danny Green + picks (sure it would have looked stupid back then but knowing KD will leave without even yielding OKC some draft picks like what the Cavs did with Lebron when he first left would have made this better in retrospect). Westbrook + Green + Kawhi + Ibaka + Adams (or small-ball Westbrook + Green + Kawhi + Roberson + Ibaka) would have crushed the 73-9 GSW and Lebron in 2016."
"I remember being so stressed watching this.  It wasn’t enough that Danny Green and friends decided to never miss from behind the arc, but Tony Parker was out there doing trick shots in the clutch."
"Yeah y’all were fucking stacked lmao. Kawhi, Lowry, Pascal, FVV, Ibaka, Danny Green, and Gasol. Sheeeesh that’s a deep team, definitely not a carry job"
"Danny Green isn't a small forward, but nice try."
We put Danny Green and AD on Westbrook because they were the only two dudes that Russ couldn’t bump off when attacking the rim. So that neutralized him. He easily took advantage of Kuz/KCP/Caruso. We had the right scheme and the right personnel for so many different matchups.
"How do you know that? You think Chris Paul wouldn’t have looked for the best team to join just cause the Warriors were still great but not as good?   And the Cavs beat them the year before, proceeded to get better and went 12-1 in the playoffs. Meanwhile the Warriors in this situation would’ve had a worst record and replaced KD with Danny Green."
"Except the warriors barely lost the year before? It was clearly not some overwhelming victory for the cavs. You guys go back and forth with the east was trash and that cavs team was almost as good as the 2017 warriors lol. Yes with danny green instead of KD they wouldnt have only lost 1 game, but they still would have been favorites."
Yes they would still be favorites with danny green. You realized they won 73 games and already had a chip right.
"They went 73-9 and Steph had to choke for them to lose in the finals   With the Rocky relationship in cleveland they were 1000% title favorites with Danny Green, Gerald Green, or Jeff Green at SF"
So Danny Green instead of KD makes them title favorites?  You don’t believe that. It’s not any decent small forward
"Sixers get: Anthony Edwards, Kat, DLo, 1st round pick, Michael Porter JR.         Nuggets get: Danny Green.         Twolves get: Ben Simmons.            All teams say yes."
"If you went to prime Lebron and told him all he had to do is chase a shooter, he’d do it and he’d be phenomenal at it. And he’d be better at it than Danny Green. He’s just bigger stronger faster and more athletic"
"Throw a couple contenders for the recent finals  2020- the imagery of Jimmy Butler leaning over the rail after that ridiculous triple double and Danny green’s brick are probably the most memorable moments from that series   2019- this was a great series, but notable moments I can’t come up with   2018/2017- KD’s daggers in both game 3, also we got JR forgetting the score in 2018  2016- self explanatory   2015- there was a 3 where curry turned a cavs defender around that I remember being pretty notable  2014- a vicious Ginobili dunk over Chris Bosh in game 5 was my lasting memory of this series  2013- Parker’s falling down clincher in game 1, Ray Allen’s 3 in game 6, and Bosh’s block over Danny green at the end of game 6 stick out"
Danny Green is fine but Tristan Thompson against Kareem?  Maybe give Bron Kawhi or Klay as a 3 and D guy and then a HOF Center
"IDK 5 LeBrons is quite redudant and the best way to beat all the LeBron's would be through size at the big positions. I feel like a Danny Green type actually offers more to a team of LeBrons than random SG LeBron. Because at the end of the day, there are still roles  and Danny Green does the whole ""shoot 3s off the catch and chase dudes around screens"" a lot better than any version of LeBron. Same could be said for LeBron and an average center."
KD was guarded by Danny Green. Russ was guarded by Kawhi.   The way you’re describing it is as if KD outplayed Kawhi 1v1.
"Blaming Danny for ""destroying"" his knee is insane.  It was a normal, albeit fairly risky basketball play by *both of them.*  Attempting a dunk going full speed while being pursued by someone you know will attempt the block is risky, as is attempting the block.  It was a totally fine basketball play that had a really unfortunate sequence of events lead to a horrible injury.  That bit of contact knocked him off at just the right angle for him to land at just the angle to tear his ACL.  It sucked but blaming someone for it like you are doing is absurd.  ""If Green didn't go up Klay would have an ACL""....well no shit? How is that a relevant point, he was just supposed to not play defense? Basketball is a contact sport -- as long as the play isn't dirty, fouls are a normal part of the game. If Klay didn't go up he'd have an ACL, if he had landed slightly different he'd have an ACL.  It sucks that it happened but blaming Danny is kinda ridiculous, even if you are claiming you aren't saying its dirty."
Watched both it’s not even close   Lebron has a million times better finals performances vs million times better competition   More 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Jordan played in the weakest era in nba history   Also he wouldn’t even sniff the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 cavs teams lebron took to the finals   Talking about in the modern era not the expansion era where Jordan made the playoffs going 30-52  There wouldn’t even be a Jordan era if Durant played in the 90s
"That's just an insane hypothetical. You could say the same thing for literally any team and they'd win 5. If the 2020 Lakers had kept their roster together, then Rondo, Dwight, JR, and Danny Green time traveled back to their primes, and had no injuries, and no super teams were made, They'd win 5 as well.  The Warriors would have to be in the finals for what? 7 years straight? No way they'd be able to."
"Lol what, he was not beating Giannis on the switch, the Raptors weren’t switching and we weren’t trying to force them to. He was doubling off his man, just like Lowry and to a lesser extent Danny Green did."
Danny Green next year
"I agree that Duncan would have won MVP, but as I recall the media that time was making a narrative that danny green was a candidate. Similar to how Iggy won FMVP but Curry was clearly the better player that series"
Danny green every year
or Danny green last year
*Danny Green taking a selfie in front of a depressed Ben Simmons*  You know I had to do it one time lol
danny green 2020? harrison barnes 2016? every single role player that plays w lebron after he losses in a finals?
"Yeah idk what that guy is on, that was a laughable comment. But trading Maxey, Danny Green and Thybulle for Lowry would absolutely make us worse considering the hawks wings absolutely cooked us."
"You're thinking of the Bowling Green Massacre, where Danny Green...fuck, I can't figure it out either"
"Ben Simmons fucking up the Sixers shit in the playoffs be like ""You know I had to do it one time [lol #Holocaust""](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/09/1412835063858_wps_2_image001_png_danny_green.jpg)  The lol followed up by hashtag Holocaust was beyond egregious. Danny Green is a wild boy 😂😂😂"
*evil Danny Green
"Lol it happened like 4 months ago, of course some Nets fans still feel some type of way about Giannis. He accidentally injured Kyrie and fucked up our season, other fanbases have hated players for less, like Mavs and Dwade, Bucks and Dunleavy.  Also, even though it was completely accidental, it was 100% Giannis's fault on what seemed to be an injury that could've easily been avoided. Oh well, but he's to Nets fan what Danny Green is to the Warriors fanbase, Kelly Olynk to the Cavs, Zaza to the Spurs, Bruce Bowen to the Lakers (it's Solomon Hill for the Lakers currently)."
"I mean sure he has a right to be pissed. Anyone would be pissed. But in this case it’s true. And it’s not something he hasn’t heard from analysts, commentators, and fans. Being a Sixers fan and just seeing and reading about how babied he has been since joining the NBA is a joke. You can’t be told you’re doing just fine when you show zero improvement over 3 real seasons. Obviously we have no insight to what conversations happen inside and outside the locker room and how frequently they happen, but taking accountability for the losses they had in round 2 had to have been brought up to him in some way. Everyone saw it, it all came down to the same common denominator. Sure maybe Tobi hits a couple more shots, sure maybe we keep starters in longer, and sure maybe if Danny Green plays things improve, but when your 2nd best all star caliber player refuses to attempt a single FG, that’s the problem. If you can’t hear that you cost your team a playoff series and then work to improve your game, maybe this isn’t the league for you."
Danny Green the real mvp
There’s a Danny Green joke in here somewhere but I’m not creative enough to think of one
"Dude he's on a team with Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias (who doesn't shoot volume but still good percentage), Korkmaz, shake and Embiid plays outside of the paint a lot. How much shooting is enough shooting for Ben? Does he need Warriors level shooting to be effective?"
I really want to see that. I fucking hate Danny Green and I'd take Matisse and Furk over him any day.
He's also the 4th highest paid on the team with an annual salary that is double the MLE and will be at just a hair under $20 million in the last year of his deal.  That's actually quite expensive for a role player whose only job is to hit threes when they present themselves. I don't even think prime Danny Green made that percentage of the cap.
"Also, he's not a shooter. You just replaced Simmons with Draymond, and by the way, you just lost Danny Green. Good luck!"
found danny green
"If only they traded for Kyle Lowry, Sixers just need a main playmaker, Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons and Embiid will make it work easily."
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"It must have been a real shock to the team when they realised their 14 point a game, pass first point guard wasn't going to iso score their way to victory. A real rattling moment. Embiid must have been thinking, if I played every game this season, I'd be the MVP, but who am I going to get the ball to here so Galliani doesn't poke steal me and get and dunk at the other end? Where do I stand here, so I can not be effective help on Young, and still get lobbed for a Capella dunk?  This is a poorly built team, losing Danny Green really exposed the teams weaknesses. Rivers completely whiffed, Thybulle and Simmons had no business being on the floor at the same time ever, let alone in the fourth quarter of a game 7. This is a cherry on top moment for building a team from the draft based on best player available, rather than fit. And again, the 6ers enter the trade market with a player they are trying to move for 'value' rather than what normal teams do, which is trading (and drafting) for team needs.  Meanwhile, the three time championship winner three and D guy that started 70+ games nopes the fuck out, and you think the problem was the team is too diplomatic with Ben Simmons. :)"
"KAT for Danny green, shake Milton, and a first. Maybe a second as well"
"We'll see. We have yet to get to the conclusion of all this nonsense.   In the meantime, he's already built up a lot of slack because of how he was able to get rid of Horford relatively painlessly (and get Danny Green in return) and trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry.   As bad as our situation is now, it would be 100x worse if our old front office was still running things."
"Harris is solid for sure (underrated imo) but do you only need one startong forward? One could play 3 and another plays the 4, Embiid at 5 and you either hand the starting PG to Shake or Maxey or bring someone in. Worst case Danny Green slides to the bench, or you ship him for another PG"
"Nah, lakers are just lucky they didn't run into us when we were at our peak, the rockets put up a better fight against us then the Lakers ever would have.   The Lakers are extremely lucky that Danny green injured Klay, otherwise they wouldn't even have their lone Mickey mouse ring right now and would probably struggle to win 1 game against us in the playoffs"
"Losing Ben would be rough, but uh...we still have Danny Green, Matisse and Embiid. I think we'd be okay-ish. Even Tobias improved his defense game to be at least average."
"Ben Simmons was 2nd in DPOY voting, finished 1st team all defensive and has made multiple all star games. Tobias Harris was considered a snub for the all star game this past year. Matisse Thybulle was 2nd team all defensive last season. Danny Green and Seth Curry are above average role players/starters. To say that Embiid was surrounded by ""a gang of useless scrubs"" is absurd."
game 1: coach choke with danny green guarding trae.  game 4 and 5 both had huge leads and blew it.   sixers were the far superior team all year and even in the series.
"Lakers Heat game 5, Jimmy and Lebron basically fighting to the death the last quarter and 1/2 was just so much fun to watch and so intense with it being a close out game. Plus an amazing ending with the Danny miss along with Markieff being goofy. Cherry on top is the social media aspect with all the Danny green slander which was just hilarious to see (other than the death wish, that person can go suck it)"
Would heild even help them at all? He aint really a playmaker and Danny green feels like the dude you'd rather have filling that type of role. They really need a playmaker who can also create his own shot. Basically anyone that embiid can actually run a god damn pick n roll with imo.
"I really think Pat Bev in general is underrated, but there’s just no way he would start over Maxey.  Even if we assume they stay the same production wise, which they wont, Rese is just gonna be better this year, and age is gonna catch up to Pat Bev, their production is roughly the same, with Tyrese being a better playmaker and scorer, and Pat Bev being a significantly better defender, it just doesn’t make sense to start Pat Bev for the Sixers.  Not only is Maxey a better fit for the starters where his floor spacing and playmaking open up things for Embiid, Pat Bev is a better fit for the bench who don’t have defensive contributors like Joel and to a lesser extent Danny Green.  Like I can appreciate your sales pitch, but it’s just not true from any perspective that isn’t the Sixers should let the Wolves rob them."
"&gt; We’re a better team this year than we were then.   Agree to disagree then because i doubt it. Defense is worse now and pretty much everyone on the 2020 squad could shoot except Javale and Dwight. For example Lebron was complaining about Rondo (“no spacing”!) until suddenly Rondo turned into Curry, so how would that be any different with Westbrook. Danny Green was icy hot but I think Westbrook will more likely just be icy. If he doesn’t shoot like Rondo/Caruso did those playoffs I don’t see how their offense is better.   Maybe if he leads the second unit while Lebron is on the bench but in crunch time I don’t really see how it would work out. The ball would probably be in Lebron’s hands (since he is a much better decision maker than Westbrook) which makes Westbrook become a spot up shooter. And he is terrible at that."
I personally never cheered so not my problem. Do you remember when you sent Danny Green death threats because he missed a shot?
"Simmons, 2 firsts, Danny Green and a Philly Cheesesteak"
"yeah but in that scenario it would be a multi team trade. however portland just used their last FRP for Nance, why would they change their opinion now? Morey is not going to put together a deal they cannot refuse here. sure Joel, Tobias and Dame would be a contender core but to make the trade work, they would also have to end up with lots of Danny Green type vets at the end of their careers so every young player can end up with the Blazers and all the players in their prime land with teams that are up and coming. I just don’t see it but of it happens it would have to involve at least 5 teams"
Seth and Danny Green are non-starters in that conversation.   If the Blazers trade Dame they are blowing everything up and want young players on rookie scale and lottery picks.
"Guys like Maxey, Seth, Danny Green, and Thybulle all have some value. Either send them to Portland who can trade them later or send them to other teams to build up more draft capital"
Nahhh he can blame embiid health this year. Or uhh maybe Danny green for doing to many podcasts
"Which makes it all the more puzzling how a head coach and well regarded staff put Danny Green on Trae Young in game 1, couldn't punish a backcourt of Trae and Lou Will defensively, and decided to run out all bench lineups that never worked all year. How are you so good at your job but still chose a lineup of Dwight, Matisse, and George Hill in a game 7?"
"how? What position would he play? Draymond is a PF, Tobias is a PF. You can't move him down to SF because 1. the 4 is his natural position, and 2. Danny Green plays SF."
"i fucking love reddick and for the most part how his career panned out really fucking annoys me! Particularly the back end, teams have had all this time for danny green but couldnt take a shot on reddick?  this guy was made to be 'that' shooter on a championship team, as much as CP3 was made to be a championship player.  if you replayed reddicks carrer 10 times, in half of them i reckon he has 1 ray allen shot and half a dozen playoff moments on multiple championship teams"
*IcyHot Danny Green noises*
no you’ll just harass him like you did with danny green
Mavs got robbed in that game. Dwight was holding Seth (iirc) and Danny Green hit the three to tie the game at the buzzer
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"JV and Delon Wright got traded in 2019 and still haven’t been back. Danny green hasn’t gotten his ring yet. Kyle, Norm and Serge are coming back as visitors"
Danny Green gonna finally get his ring
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
shout out to danny green for getting his shot blocked by murray on the baseline.  murray then tried to save it from going out of bounds which gave la the time to run a play  icy hot playing 4d chess as always
He was 6th in average minutes played that season for the Lakers.  Essentially tied with Danny Green.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2020.html
"Watch: Ray Allen. He has one of the purest shooting forms, and had an incredibly quick release which made his shot hard to guard.   Honorable mentions: Klay, Danny Green, Reggie, pretty much any efficient 3&amp;D guy that plays off ball. Great for teaching off-ball movement and smart team defense.   Avoid: Drummond. He's an inefficient, ball dominant big with no real skills outside of post scoring, which he isn't great at. He's selfish *and* bad.   Honorable mentions: Lillard (you'll never do what he can so please don't try, you'll make everyone hate you), Steph (same reasoning), AI (same reasoning), any ball-dominant player that regularly makes contested shots."
Whiteside/Draymond/Covington/Danny Green/Melton?  Gotta go all out defense because this team might not touch 90ppg
"Desmond Bane was shot 47% from the field last season, and 43% from 3. Danny Green was 41% from the field and 40% from 3. I’d keep Bane where he is.  Maybe substitute Maxey for Thybulle or Green though"
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: Danny Green  SF: Robert Covington  PF: Draymond Green  C: Steven Adams
"I would trade out Maxey with Thybulle, and maybe Bane with Danny Green."
PG: Tyrese Maxey  SG: Landry Shamet  SF: Danny Green  PF: Draymond Green  C: Mitchell Robinson
"""23. And 18 the game after. Yeah, 23 and 18. Inefficient, but like... Okay...? He went on to drop 32/4/13 in Game 6.""  32/4/13 on 13/26 shooting, not bad at all, but you're forgetting 5/12 at the line, and 8 turnovers   ""This is exactly what Lebron has been doing the past 10 years, yet nobody complains.""  lmfao are you on crack, literally every time lebron has passed up a shot down the stretch when doubled, half the people go insane, just in the 2020 finals when it was like three on him and he passed it to danny green for an open three people went insane  your whole argument is ah well i mean lebron does it too! and most of it doesn't even make sense   ""In Game 1 of the 2014 Finals, Lebron had 25/6/3 with 4 turnovers. That's more turnovers than assists in a finals game.""  he had like a 65% ts that game and only played 33 mins before cramps   ""in Game 3, Lebron had 22/7/5 with 7 turnovers.""  no he didn't"
"He still did played a major part on their defense which led for the game to last 7 games, but he was indeed shooting less but for someone who’s age was 36 with .554% ts% was still pretty impressive, but then again if it were not for Kawhi Leonard Danny Green playing significantly better during the finals it could’ve been lasted only 5 or 6 games. The Miami heat was truly strong."
Imagine having less 40 point games than lebron in the finals while being guarded  by literal pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec than he had vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green.   Paul pierce would have had 6 rings if he played in the 90s  K enough about the subway sandwich maker era
Jordan has less 40 point games in in the finals while being guarded by pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec than lebron does vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green
Danny green is one of my all time favorite players but he never averaged 17/7/7 during the Spurs title runs like Kenny did
It was Danny Green
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
"This is the reverse of your post, but right after Danny Green bricked the game-winner in game 5, Morris literally just held the ball instead of passing to one of two open 3-pt shooters, then threw it out of bounds."
Danny green is a meh comp tho. Plenty of role players have player on championship teams. To be compared to big shot bob you have to hit big shots. This is why iggy is a much better comparison imo
Danny Green has won for 3 different teams tho so it's a better comparison. A comparison doesn't make them equal.
"Hell nah. Big shot bob was way more consistent and hit tons of clutch shots. His nickname was “big shot bob.”   Danny green is a great role player and teammate, but  always goes cold in the playoffs and absolutely bricked his chance at a classic shot in the 2020 finals.   Hes had a great career but he doesn’t have close to the resume. Iggy would be a closer comparison to bob."
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
"It’s just a really easy comparison - he isn’t near draymonds IQ level or confidence level. He’s the closest thing philly has. Embiid guards the paint so that is similar to dray but I’m referring more to his entire game. Ben is way more draymondy than Danny Green, toby, Seth curry or Embiid is."
"He was the 4th/5th best player on two title teams. So, I would compare him to like Derek Fisher or Ron Harper. Maybe PJ Tucker or Danny Green in you want super recent examples."
"Sengun, Porter, Wall, and Gordon for Ben and Danny Green  Dunno if Houston would do it but they’d be a playoff/playin team with Wood, Green, and Simmons  Edit: probably would have to include picks from Houston’s side but Porter and Sengun would equal 2 firsts in my opinion  Edit #2: trade won’t work. They’d have to throw in Tobias and idk if either team would want that. Maybe if it became a three team trade and Phili got something else back for Tobias"
no I'm talking about danny green unnecessarily comtesting Klay Thompson resulting in an acl tear. Klay was lava hot when he got hurt and no doubt in my mind theres a game 7 with Klay.
the only reason we really lost gm 6 was danny green
Danny Green is the Robert Horry for this generation...and Pat McCaw is the Steve Kerr.
"i mean that toronto team was stacked though   Kawhi, Lowry, Siakam, FVV, Gasol, Danny Green, Ibaka. I would say on paper I'd take the Rpators over 76ers...that 76ers team has no chemsitry, Simmons with no offense outside of the paint, Tobias doesn't really mesh well as a 4th option, etc."
"Luka and a team of superstars. I think Luka is amazing, but I think he's so ball dominant that on a team with like Lebron, KD, Curry, and Embiid, Luka's abilities are wasted. Even if you had the other players play more offball, that lineup isn't better than the same 4 guys with like a Danny Green as the 5th imo. His talents are just wasted if he's playing with a better playmaker in Lebron."
"You can develop your floor though, even if you're not great. Danny Green has lost some of the athleticism he had but he's still a good-ish defender most of the time.  Part of the equation is what can you focus on improving.  Like is it worth the effort for Marcus Smart to become a great ball handler and spend less time on other traits?"
Joel Embiid stilll had the torn meniscus and Danny Green was pretty important to that team. Yeah the Hawks won on the road a bunch but 2-3 of those wins seemed like the sixers fell asleep after being up so much and taking their foot off the gas.
"They didn’t have their 3rd, arguably 2nd best player DeAndre Hunter after the Knicks series  The Sixers were almost completely healthy other than a replaceable Danny Green, and the Hawks beat them on the road 3(!) times"
"Honestly probably team 2 Harden almost won with   Cp3 Harden Ariza Pj Clint  Bench:EG and Luc Mbah amoute    Now you upgrade cp3 to Kawhi, add a prime Danny green instead of luc and patty mills over EG   Would be very close but I think team 2 in 6 if MDA is the coach and they continued to run the switching defense system to slow down Steph and klay."
"Derrick is an excellent defender, high IQ and great instincts similar to a Kyle Lowry with the way he draws charges or a Danny green the way he tries to meet guys at the rim, but he’s athletic and 6’5 or so.  Offensively he is solid at everything but great at nothing. He’s a solid passer and can run point but he’s best when he’s being used as a score first player. He’s a solid shooter from mid range and 3 but a bit inconsistent and overall not great. He’s a very tenacious rim finisher around the rim and great at getting through contact but he’s a bit of a rhythm player in that way."
"i know Mat Latos (former MLB pitcher) was into exotic snakes, cuz he's from Florida lol. Didn't know that one about Danny Green--cool to know"
"When I first saw the headline I was like ""oh cool Terrence Ross is into reptiles! I know Danny Green loves snakes, that's a cool hobby"" and then the headline kept getting worse."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/08/san-antonio-spurs-danny-green-holocaust-selfie
"Missing a shot was the most unflattering thing you could think of for Danny ""Had to do it one time! #holocaust "" Green?"
Danny Green - holocaust picture
LeBron-defending China Danny Green- bricking finals winning shot Luka-shoots .600 from the line in the playoffs
* LeBron James  * Danny Green  * Luka Doncic
"What about the volume? 1.5 threes made per game. For comparison Danny Green is 25th in the league for 3pm per game with 2.5, you can't be a great 3p shooter if you're shooting such a low volume"
"Danny Green - one steal, one block.  Matisse Thybulle - two steals, two blocks."
Same Puerto Rican that swept kobe?   Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did vs subway sandwich makers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Get over it. Lebron passed Jordan in 2016  He would be dorezen outside the expansion era
Please stop referring to 1 game lol. Klay is not danny green. Ill check the stats later tho.
Would UTAH benefit from a straight Rudy Gobert/Danny Green swap? They get an elite defender and decent shooter in Danny Green
"Why would the year be wasted? I think the assumption is the FO would hold him out from now until the trade deadline, and pull the trigger as soon as a an offer good enough comes along.  The team as currently constructed isn't suddenly just going to miss the playoffs lmao. They have the reigning MVP runner up who's getting better every year, a good regular season player in Tobias, and good role players in Danny Green, Matisse, Maxey, Shake, Niang, Curry, etc. That's still a playoff team without Ben Simmons.  Only way things tank is if Embiid gets hurt, which then you're fucked whether you made a Ben trade or not."
This is beautiful coming from a Lakers fan. The most notoriously toxic fanbase in the league.  Yall sent Danny Green fucking death threats for missing an open three in the finals.  So following your moronic logic all Californians are violent psychopaths
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30091882/los-angles-lakers-danny-green-fiancee-received-death-threats-missed-shot-game-5-nba-finals
"If Philly can get both CJ and Brogdon in a 3 or 4 team trade for Simmons and Maxey (and probably a pick) then i think they're contenders.  Brogdon, CJ, Danny Green, Harris and Embiid is a contender. Just not the favourites obviously."
"&gt;to the point this sub would probably be demanding his head like /r/NFL and Cole Beasley.  Don't wanna sound pedantic but idk man. Being actively anti-vax as a public figure and possibly impacting your own team/teammates isn't in any way comparable to making a single tone deaf comment  People joke all the time in danny green threads about his holocaust blunder, and thats way worse than this kyrie comment. It really isn't that serious"
I would rather have him over Danny Green although this sub probably will prefer Green.
He’s probably the type of guy you’d love if he was on your team…   I found myself rooting for evil Danny green in the last playoffs. Something about his specific brand of fk you attitude is fun to watch.
Evil Danny Green has no off switch
When Embiid is 100% you'll be good  You should have won against us if not for Danny Green turning into Anthony Bennett in the last 2 minutes and airballing THREE times in a row  Can't say the same for when we played Boston
Trading D’Angelo for Brook Lopez and then not re-signing Brook Lopez    Trading Danny Green for Schroeder     Zubac for Muscala
"He was a significant upgrade but it was more about fit. JV is great at scoring himself, but wasn’t much of a facilitator and was getting exposed defensively. Danny green, kawhi, and siakam were also score first players, and if anyone’s getting an iso play it’s kawhi. Marc gasol changed the last defensive weakness on the roster into a strength, and provided secondary playmaking alongside Lowry so that kawhi snd siakam could be more aggressive"
"Reggie is basically the wal-mart version of Danny green.   He is a three and D guy, but he is only a three and D guy - every time he dribbles it is a bad idea.   So many nephews on here think Danny green sucks because they see one or two games where he shoots poorly and assume he can’t do anything - Reggie is kind of the same way but he’s just a bit worse at everything. Hoping he turns it around for y’all!"
get rid of danny green then he's never missed the playoffs except his rookie season when he got waived by the cavs  he's too much of a winner
Lowry/Holiday/Lebron/Middleton/BubbleAD  FVV/Danny Green/Pascal/Lopez  Should beat the Warriors on depth alone.
"Serge, Danny Green, Caruso, Rondo, Kieff, Connaughton, Forbes, Teague, Tucker, Portis  Need to make sure I'm in full tank mode for Doncic in 2018"
"I’m pretty sure every decent team in the east qualifies except for the Hornets and Hawks.   - Nets have Kyrie and Joe Harris - Bulls have Ball and Caruso - Heat have UD - Wizards have Harrell, Kuzma, and KCP - Bucks have George Hill and Rodney Hood - Knicks have Derrick Rose - Sixers have Drummond and Danny green - Cavs have Love - Celtics have Schroeder   So yeah I agree I think the streak most likely stays alive this year one way or another."
danny green my favorite non-knick player in the whole league
"Danny Green comes to mind. Three rings with three different teams, doesn’t get talked about enough."
"danny green, he's a winner"
"To be fair, Pop has coached several different offenses/defenses as his stars aged. The 2003 “Give it to Duncan” Spurs were a very different team than the 2013-14 “Danny Green or Boris Diaw might win FMVP” Spurs.  So far, Kerr’s only had success with a ball-movement offense designed around 4-5 playmakers and a switch-heavy defense designed around versatile wings/bigs. I want to see how he adapts when Curry and Draymond lose a step."
"Even with KD I think the Raptors would have still won. Steph and KD are pretty unstoppable but that Raptors team had elite defense. They had Kawhi, Lowry, Danny Green, Gasol, Pascal and Nick Nurse."
"Lionel Richie is Danny green, come on now"
"Duarte has impressed so far. Early in the season when Caris was out, he came in and gave consistent offense and really solid defense. Honestly, I wish we'd start him still. He's played much better than Caris in my opinion.   He looks like his floor is pretty much Danny Green, and I think a lot of folks thought that would be his ceiling. Also, I don't care that he's 24."
"Oh totally, it’s why NBA GMs/executives do what they do and we just talk about it.  It’s one thing to point out a hole in a team / thought / ideology / mechanism / whatever. It’s a whole other beast to recognize that flaw, then have the ability to remedy that weak point without creating more gaps or issues for the whole.  I can sit here and say the Suns need a player like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green as a PF (or even Bembry). Or say they need a Bogdanovic, Seth Curry, Danny Green as a SG. Or a Harrison Barnes, OG Anounoby, Norman Powell at SF. But how can they do that without giving up the things that make them good / or creating more holes?  That I don’t know."
"Instead of focusing on recovering from injury and reloading a bit, they panicked.  Imagine if they hadn't traded away Danny Green and if they had kept guys like Caruso, Morris, Kuzma and others.  They had all the right roleplayers and some strong effort guys and defensive players that they let go in favor of over the hill vets."
And LeBron to Danny Green although he bricked it.
"I mean there is much Dwight can do when your perimeter defenders just let guards blow by them.....All Dwight can do is foul..... Atleast KCP ,Caruso and Danny Green could funnel the guards into their Bigs....now Russ doesn't defend much... Jordan shouldn't be on any basketball team he cannot even catch the ball...... Vogel should go the Rockets small ball line-up.... Russ-Lebron-AD-Monk-Ellington Russ can just drive to the rim every time....or kick out to Monk or Ellington"
Can Danny Green even contain any dribble drive from any guard anymore?
Can Danny Green even contain any dribble drive on any guard anymore?
"&gt;we know how good that team without kawhi is  No you didn't. Danny Green, Marc Gasol, MIP winner Siakam, and the subtraction of DeRozan meant you never saw that team before. It was very different."
Only Danny Green and Niang have more field goals than free throws at the half.
Danny Green moves as slow as Niang
"Couldn’t that just be Davis stepping up in the playoffs though and playing clutch? Guys did say the depth perception was better with no crowd behind the hoop though. It could be a little bit of both. Danny Green shot worse though lol, below his career average in both 3pt % and free throw percentage."
Maxey Curry Thybulle Tobi Embiid starting. Doc keeping Danny Green coming off the bench.
Danny Green hasn’t been a good defender since he was traded off the Spurs.
"That's the thing that adds to the unlikeability - it's not any one person's fault. It's legit everyone left's fault. All our good guys (except maybe Drummond and Shroeder) have left or been traded away. Dwight's still fine.  But we cheaped out on Caruso (Jeanie)  Traded away our good, hard-working, role players like KCP, Kuz. And if Trez and Shroeder weren't good fits for us, they're above average starters on other playoff teams right now - we lost them for NOTHING. Danny Green was traded away for Shroeder and he's a valuable player for the Sixers.   This front office hasn't really made any plus-value moves in two seasons, and we've gotten away with it for so long because we have Lebron and AD and because we're the Lakers, it's infuriating seeing all the small moves that bleeds our assets and our team dry, to the point that we see it now. Imagine if it was a team like the Pacers or Raptors who lost as many good players as we have over the past 3 years and get nothing in return. They would be legit worse than the Rockets right now."
"Tim Duncan might be the single most underrated defender in NBA history. That right there is pretty much the story.   Now, losing Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard and replacing them with DeMar DeRozan can kill just about any defense as well.  But the biggest thing is that Duncan was Duncan."
"No no no, you got it all wrong. The goal was to iso Danny Green in the post but they had to go to plan B"
If they had 1-2 rotational pieces like Danny Green or Crowder it would help a lot.  I still feel like the Jazz perimeter defenders aren't as bad as people make them out to be.
PROTECC KLAY AT ALL COSTS  **fuck danny green
Lol I promise you that watching Clint Capela post-ups or seeing Danny Green spotting up from 20 feet is not more entertaining than the product today.
"Okay but that’s one player… do you have any stats for all of the other teams and players? One player doesn’t mean anything statistically…   Even if shooting was easier in the bubble, wouldn’t everyone have that advantage, thus negating the advantage in general. Also what happened to the clippers losing to the Nuggets? Kawhi and Paul George were bricking everything in the 4th quarter of game 7. They were shooting abysmally in the second half of games and during crunch time to lose that series. Why didn’t they get this “bubble advantage” to help them close out the series? What about Danny Green missing that game winner on that pass from Lebron? Wide open and in the bubble lol…   It’s just bad reasoning imo"
"Lol OK sure. Try Ben simmons (!) tobias Harris, Danny Green all missing major time. Seth curry has missed games as well. We essentially played without any of last seasons starters a few nights ago (and actually won). Also missed thybulle and Joe for 2 weeks. I guess operating with only 7/8 players for half the games this season is a better situation? You must only have abojt 3 players left then"
"It’s not rocket science, surround LeBron and AD with 2 way players, younger, with athleticism. Someone like KCP and Caruso. Danny green is still playing pretty well."
PG: Rajon Rondo (2012) / Derek Fisher (2001)  SG: Danny Green (2013) / Kyle Korver (2014)  SF: Shane Battier (2007) / OG Anunoby (2021)  PF: LeBron James (2017) / Draymond Green (2016)  C: Ben Wallace (2004) / Dikembe Mutombo (2000)
"Not really,  Draymond at the 5 works exceptionally well on both ends. Warriors w Dray at the 5 have a 97.7 DRTG this year and +16 net rating, and peak Danny Green is a monster defensive guard, peak LeBron was a dpoy level wing who dwarves Wiggins in impact, Jingles and Horry are both good defenders who have been part of high level defenses in the past and are comparable defensively to 2022 Steph/OPJ/Iggy etc"
"I believe so. Kawhi ended up with a degenerative knee ailment. Not to mention we did the same to Danny green and pau gasol. Around that time, our med staff was pretty bad and neither side did good for each other and it led to the break up.  We’re just very spoiled and have a “we can do no wrong” mindset"
I’m over Danny Green. He has a good reputation because his multiple rings but he should not be starting at this point.
Danny Green?
"Rondo, Danny Green, Bruce Bowen, LeBron, Wallace.  Decent shooting, great playmaking, and with stifling defense"
"&gt;  LeBron will make the best play, whatever it happens to be.  Kd or Kawhi taking that shot is the best play though. As opposed to a wide open Danny Green."
"Maxey was an incredible pick, he traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry, dumped Horford for cheap, signed Niang and Drummond for cheap who have been huge for us. Re-signed Furk and Danny Green for cheap. Signed Embiid to a Max extension. Literally every move he has made so far has been excellent. Only question mark is Simmons"
"PG: Calderon  SG: Danny Green  SF: Crowder  PF: LeBron  C: Draymond  Could obviously add another DPOY center over Crowder, but I think this team is better. Green/Crowder/Lebron/Draymond is already enough defense and LeBron needs shooters."
"&gt;Spurs level of stupid when they tried to be petty and traded Kawhi to Toronto for scraps.   What other option did the Spurs have? Kawhi didn't come back to the Spurs when they were making a playoff run, and also made it clear that if he didn't end up in LA he'd leave after a year. Which he did. And they still got Toronto's best player and a first (while giving up Danny Green).  They wouldn't have gotten anything better from LA or the clippers."
"**Rondo-Anthony Parker-Lebron-Battier-Draymond** would have won a title.   I feel like you basically have to pick **Rondo** because he made 4 straight all-star games and there just isn't a perimeter player out there who averaged under 10 a game a game and was a top 30 guy in the league for half a decade. Then obviously you need shooting around them.   A lot of these teams don't have a 2nd player who can create at all, and this one has 3 since Bobby Jackson wasn't half bad in his prime, and he shot the 3 well and played hard on D, so he was my original choice. Ironically, Delonte West was my 3rd choice at the 2 guard spot after Danny Green. But then I remembered **Anthony Parker** existed and he put up 12 a game on 44% 3pt shooting his first 2 years in the NBA, and that was aged 31. So if you get a 28 year old euro league MVP in Anthony Parker I think that's the same 14-15 point guy Bobby Jackson was, and Parker was a very good defender. But I was really tempted to pick Bobby Jackson because it would be hell for Lebron on offense needing to get 35 a game on this team, and in the playoffs you need a credible 2nd scorer. But him being 6'1 was just too tough for me to get past. That's a tiny backcourt. If Rondo and Lebron didn't work I'd panic and make Lebron the PG and bring on Bobby Jackson for Rondo to get another shooter out there. Also, older Lebron in the post, I think you want Jackson shooting at PG to spread the floor and you can play 5 out since you can pick Draymond from when he had a 3pt shot. Younger Lebron, driving and playing up tempo, you probably go with the superior player in Rondo.  **Battier** vs Horry is a tough one but Battier was the better shooter and probably the better defender too.   **Draymond** is my choice as center for the modern era, but if I was competing against other all-time teams who might have a proper 7 foot scorer I'd be tempted to go with Mutombo, Chandler or Noah. Also Tyson Chandler is tempting since he was a lob threat and might fit better with Rondo and Lebron than Draymond. I went with Draymond because he's the best defensive player I've ever seen, but with Battier at the 4 I'm really not sure he's a better fit than Mutombo or Chandler since you get a real rim protector at the 5."
"Rondo Danny green Lebron Draymond  Kelly olynk   Im gonna cheat since Kelly olynk averages like 10.2 over his career but I wouldnt want to play with 2 non shooters  Prime rondo can bring some secondary scoring and playmaking and draymond, danny green and lebron would have people in HELL on the wing   Rim protection may be an issue but get Ben Wallace of the bench and this teams wins it all if they are all in their primes"
"caruso/danny green/lebron/draymond/ben wallace  absolutely suffocating defense, still very good offense if we get peak draymond shooting 3s"
"Assuming we're building a team to take part in the 2021-22 season (all peak years are IMO ofc):  **PG: LeBron James** (career 27.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 09, 12, 13, 16  **SG: Danny Green** (career 8.9ppg) --- Peak versions: 13, 14, 16  **SF: Joe Ingles** (career 8.7ppg) --- Peak versions: 17, 18, 21  **PF: Robert Horry**  (career 7.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 94, 95, 01, 05, 07   **C: Draymond Green** (career 8.8ppg) --- Peak versions: 15, 16, 17  rationale: lebron + shooting is a tried and tested formula so here are 3 shooters plus peak draymond  who could occasionally knock down open 3s too (34.4% from 3 in 61 playoff games from 2015-17). All of them are at least solid defenders with some elite ones. Draymond and Jingles are both excellent ballhandlers/passers who can relieve some of the offensive burden on lebron. Might have to ask Horry to become the roll man in some sets ig, im not super familiar w his game haha"
Dude everyone forgets that after Blazers won game 1 everyone thought lakers were losing the series  Same with the rockets series but now when you talk about it that was a superteam  The team starting Danny Green KCP Caruso in the finals
"i’ll go   mike james (averaged efficient 20/6 in 2006)  danny green  bruce bowen  lebron  mutombo  james is about as competent of a second option as you can get, maybe aaron brooks, green and bowen give you elite 3 and d options, and mutombo gives you an elite rim protector to truly solidify this defense and isn’t completely useless on offense (&gt;50% from the field, nearly 70% from the line for his career)"
"Yeah you can scrap together a contender if 10 ppg or less with Prime Lebron. You got the lineups already included on the thread but other players can be prime Trevor Ariza, Danny Green, Harkless, Larry Nance Jr., PJ Tucker, Marcus Smart is towing the line, Reggie Bullock and the like and scrounge up a decent core of prime 3 and d core around prime Lebron to contend. You can also look at old players that declined and had a couple bad season that dragged their career below 10ppg but they are actually better then that."
"Eyesight isn't all that important for an NBA player. Steph and Danny Green both got Lasik surgery in the middle of their careers, but their shooting percentages were damn good even before the surgery. It's not like baseball where you have to judge micro-movements of a small ball moving 100 mph. A basketball is pretty big, and the hoop doesn't move.  And Draymond actually has good athleticism for his role -- huge wingspan, great core strength, and quick feet. NBA scouts at the time had a too-narrow view of what an NBA athlete looked like."
"I really think the Sixers should strongly consider a deal centered around Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield for Danny Green and Simmons. Both great shooters and Barnes seems to be solid defensively (correct me if I'm wrong). Imagine a being able to roll out a lineup of Seth Curry, Hield, Niang, and Barnes with Embiid at center. Absolutely insane spacing.  In fact, the Kings should be the ones to reject this trade with how low Simmon's trade value is getting. But if the offer is on the table, Sixers have to take it imo. I think with the emergence of Maxey they would be fine not getting Fox."
That's just overkill. Danny Green is evil as is. How much more do you need?
Much rather watch THT and Melo chuck bricks over Danny Green Kuzma &amp; KCP
"You say ""G League team"" but the Sixers were legitimately playing well in the first half. They were shooting over 60%. Most teams playing like that in that position would be up by 5-10, not 19. But Seth couldn't miss and Maxey was making circus shots plus drawing the foul left and right. Even guys like Danny Green and Isaiah Joe were absolute snipers that first half. You have to give them a lot of credit."
FUCK DANNY GREEN
"So who after that? Danny green, Ricky Rubio, or someone else? Ironically Ricky may be the 6th best player of the draft - he just happened to get picked before curry. Lol"
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. DeMar DeRozan 4. Blake Griffin 5. Jrue Holiday 6. Danny Green 7. Jeff Teague 8. Ricky Rubio 9. Patty mills
Danny Green probably the first pick. Steph and Harden undrafted.
Danny green being a random +10 in a blowout loss for his team is the most danny green thing ever.
evil Danny Green has to keep up appearances
Riverdance?  Danny green moonslide riverdance to ass combo
So did Danny Green
Yeah maybe trade him for somebody like Danny Green or Kentavious Caldwell-Pope might help their championship odds.
"How the fuck Danny Green shooting like Steph in that first half, couldn’t believe my eyes."
What did Danny green do?
"""evil danny green"" comments"
Danny Green was a fraction of a second away from making this game have 3/3 buzzer beaters. Would be cool if the trend kept up in the 4th
Bruh please get Danny Green out of this team.
"Any time Danny Green dribbles, bad things happen"
danny green is more washed than my 4yr old bath towel
Danny Green is a flopper mofo
Danny Green you are too old to slam yourself into teh ground like that
zzz fuck evil danny green  dude seems like the biggest asshole in the league
"Idk i think you are filtering out information you already know, i ve heard ""Maxey"" ""seth"" ""Danny Green"" and ""thybulle"" a lot, they even talked about the bench's performance without the starters and how they were the 1st seed last year."
Draymond and Danny Green pretty good
this half was a full Danny Green experience. Making crazy shots. Making a random steal. Also just straight throwing the ball out of bounds and just staring at Poole as he gets the inbound LOL.
"Not today Evil Danny Green, not today."
Jesus Danny Green just got dropped.
I hate Danny Green.  Don't wish well to him at all.  Dirty player.
Danny Green &gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Wiggins
"Danny green with 2 2pt field goals already, idk what im watching"
And Gary wasn’t because he’s more disciplined Gary &gt;&gt;&gt; Evil Danny Green
Wait what just happened with that Danny Green 3?
That looked more like Danny Green just lost balance
Jordan Poole getting a foul call because Danny Green fell over is... a thing
"Yes he was, same with rondo.  Danny Green completely forgot how to shoot the ball lmao"
Most star players can shoot FTs well so why not them?  IIRC the Sixers have Embiid shoot them and the Nuggets Jokic.  Back when we had Danny Green he got to shoot technical FTs too.
Pop is a great coach but dude likes to wait an eternity to switch things up. Took him a year to give Tiago Splitter regular minutes when it was obvious he could contribute. He still gives Forbes minutes even though it's 5 on 4 when he's out there and makes Danny Green look like the non streakiest shooter on the planet.
"CP3 trade was bad? You do know how close that team was taking down the historically great Warriors.   And let’s see, he discovered Patrick Beverly, Chandler Parson, Clint Capella, Tyrese Maxey. Traded for Seth Curry, got rid of Al Horford contract while picking up Danny Green. Harden trade was definitely not his only good transaction.   Oh, btw. Simmons was the one who requested the trade. Team fined him when he claimed that he had mental issue m, but refused to cooperate and provide any update.  If you tell you boss you need a mental break. Your boss will probably let you take few days off. But after taking a break for couple weeks, don’t you think your boss has the right to ask you provide any update or a give them a doctor note?"
"Ok so let’s just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that’s hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You’d have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there’s no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you’d be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I’d be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I’d still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
"On a team that has more 3 point shooters in the starting lineup sure. But on the Sixers, swapping Seth for CJ means you are relying on CJ and Danny Green as your main outside threats, both of whom are streaky at best from beyond the arc."
"No genius - Danny green, thybulle, Joel are all out and Tobias was out for 2 weeks."
"This is how I felt with the raps 2019 team, it's pretty sick. We could switch Kawhi, Danny Green, OG, Ibaka, Lowry, Siakam onto pretty much anyone without compromising the defence"
"its more that they went to the finals and then got pumped in the first round, they failed to play as well the next season.  i mean the raps lost kawhi leonard and danny green and went 7 games in the second round the next season - heat should at least have gone somewhere."
"Damn, no love for Danny Green in this thread even though he's won 3 titles on 3 different teams"
On the bulls he’s the point guard who spots up a lot of the time.  On the pelicans his role was to be Danny green. Watching the pels last year was hard. They had Bledsoe running pg over Lonzo
"Dillon ""evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
Danny Green has entered the chat
They were just paying respects to Danny Green.
Danny Green seems to get his sound bites out and  has a pod cast he generally speaks well and has his own opinions- maybe him but he can be boring too so that’s perfect for a national market
"Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for Demar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, a first, and cash considerations has to be one of them."
"There's a trade that's talked about but not enough, IMHO. That's Demar Derozan, Jakob Poetl, and a 2019 FRP for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.   At the time of the trade, DDR was (rightfully) viewed as a negative value contract. He bounced back a bit on the Spurs but he also locked them into the treadmill of mediocrity. Poetl was intriguing and has evolved into a defensive anchor for the Spurs but isn't exactly a world beater out there. Danny Green is still one of the league's better 3&amp;D players, and Kawhi was (and is) an MVP-caliber player in his prime. Yes, he had one year left on his contract and was widely rumored to be interested in going to LA, which of course was 100% true. He was also done with San Antonio, and that forced their hand. However, they almost certainly had better offers on the table.   Overall, it was an absolute steal for the Raptors. Naïve observers saw that the Raptors got an All-Star back for Kawhi and were happy, but the correct move (in terms of winning a championship in the future) was to trade for more assets rather than chasing the 8 seed with an aging Demar Derozan. That trade happened in 2018, and the Spurs have finally accepted the invetiablity of rebuilding. Instead of having 3 years to tank, get more assets, and build a new core, they spent that time missing the playoffs or getting gentleman's swept by the Steph-less Warriors. Yes, Popovich probably didn't want to tank. At the time, there were rumors that DDR was basically a going-away present to Pop so he could retire without the bad taste of a ruined season. However, he's still the coach now, so that basically amounted to nothing. That draft pick ended up being Keldon Johnson, so time will tell how much that pick was worth. At 29th tho, the value of the pick before it happened didn't exactly make up for losing Kawhi.  From Toronto's perspective, just getting off DDR's terrible contract was a massive win. He was terrible in all of their previous playoff runs. Not only did they get off Derozan, they got Kawhi MF Leonard and Danny Green for Jakob Poetl and a 2019 FRP. It turned out to be a Kawhi rental, but that didn't matter because they won the championship. What's more, Kawhi leaving was still preferable to being stuck with Derozan's contract. Even if they hadn't won the championship, it would still have been a great move with very little opportunity cost."
"CJ McCollum, Chris Bosh, D Wade, Giannis, Danny Green, Fred VanVleet, Draymond, Klay, Steph all have future/expanded roles in TV if they want it. All funny, accomplished, insightful and likeable players"
"Draymond, Candace, JJ, and either Malika Andrews for the Ernie-role or Danny Green"
Danny Green is great too
"Lonzo's really good, he's basically a Danny Green that can handle and pass."
Danny Green and Klay
"I agree. KCP and Danny green *consistently* did what they were supposed to. Made the right rotations, stayed down on shots, and funneled their players to the right people. That’s all we need from the likes of Monk, Russ, Nunn and THT. Vogel is a great defensive coach, he just needs his guys to be disciplined."
they had below average shooting but they still had shooters. Danny Green mightve beencold but people still defended him at the 3pt line and he provided spacing. this team doesnt have spacing because nobody gives a sht if westbrook or ad or howard shoots a 3.
Prime Danny Green on the Spurs was beautiful to watch in transition D too. Tons of strips and blocks on 1v1 / 2v1 / 3v1 fast breaks
Everyone thinks of Danny Green but Westbrook is always givin me those IcyHot vibes lol
"It's BS when people act like Kawhi won that 2014 title with the Spurs all by himself, as if he carried the team like Jordan or LeBron. That might have been the end of the road for the Spurs, but they just went to the Finals the year before and were obviously still a potent team with their original Big 3 Duncan, Ginobli, Parker and Poppovich still at the top of his coaching game. And Danny Green shooting 3s like his life depended on it helped. LeBron was pretty much the only Heat player who even showed up in that series and people are acting like Kawhi shut him down."
Danny Green and Trae Young
"Turns out losing Danny Green, KCP, and Caruso would hurt the defense."
Naw I think we could have scraped by with a dub if *Prime Michael Jordan* was starting instead of Danny Green or Tyrese Maxey. Just my opinion though.
"Damn, Danny Green fell all the way off. Airball?"
"Danny Green definitely airballs an extreme amount for a ""shooter"""
"Danny Green just airballed one 3 and bricked another, he's back in true form."
"If not for Danny Green, I could unclench"
Danny Green shooting a career high percentage from 3 tonight
Any time he or Danny Green do something good they get in their feelings lol
"""Bird, Magic, Jordan, Pippen, Draymond Green, Danny Green, AC Green, Giannis, Thanasis, Kostas, Simmons, Embiid, Fultz"""
"Welcome to sports man. It happens, I guarantee both players would make that same play again. Especially in a fucking finals game god damn did u just want Danny green to do nothing ???"
Klay wasn't injury prone either. Then Danny Green happened in a very similar situation and dude still hasn't returned.
Also Danny Green just tattooed the CN tower on his forearm... but DeMar...  Why do all of them have to be so damn likable? This would be a lot easier if one of them was an asshole.
"I do agree with what he’s saying but what kills me is how the Sixers are absolved from any blame. Not only did they enable his behavior from the fucking start when they didn’t need to, they threw his ass under the bus after the whole team didn’t show up. No one wants to talk about Danny Green disappearing every other game or Tobias shooting horribly. Let’s not even start with Doc not making any adjustments ever. Granted Simmons deserves about 65% of the blame as to why the Sixers are not title contenders yet.   The Sixers actively tanked this mans value by leaking shit and turning the media against him. Then the media had a field day reporting half false shit all off-season. Then when the Sixers couldn’t get what they wanted they expected dude to come back after all that and play even harder just to get traded later? I mean it just makes no sense to me why we’re not giving the Sixers just as much blame for fucking up this whole situation."
"No, but I would’ve traded Danny Green and that pick to Dallas for Seth instead of to OKC for Seth. Amazing how Morey got Seth Curry."
"That was an inverted pick and pop, which actually wasn't that bad of a play, but doc honestly should not be using danny green or thybulle as the initiator AT ALL. Most of the time, the best case is that you just waste a few seconds of shot clock."
"What's weird on that play is to have Maxey in the corner, and Danny Green as the initiator. I guess they wanted to involve Giddey on the play, but Maxey is guarded by Shai who is not any better on D"
I dunno why I thought Danny Green
"ran into this even-dirtier dirty embiid foul from 2018 on Tyler Zeller (now out of the league):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Fm-rKXMJk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Fm-rKXMJk)   these fouls should come with a warning - if you take someone out from behind while they're in the air, i.e. if you foul them \_at all\_, it's an automatic Flagrant-2 (ejection), and you are suspended for 4x the amount of games that your victim misses due to the injured sustained.  so, for example, Danny Green would have been suspended for 8 years."
"They cheered for over 2 minutes when Michael Irvin got injured, the injury that prevented him from playing another snap again.   I don’t get your “and don’t use the normal bullet points” lol. Those normal bullet points are bullet points for a reason.  Let’s not forget they also booed the eagles in their home opener after winning the Super Bowl, the Lombardi was literally lifted pregame haha.   Also, back to basketball, several ex-sixers have commented on how Philly fans need to change. Didn’t Danny Green just do that?"
Danny Green 2022 Slam Dunk and 3PT Champion
I genuinely thought you meant he did this project with Danny Green.
Gd that was a LOT worse than patbev stealing the chip away from westie   The foul from embiid on giddy is how dirty Danny green ended klay and the warriors
&gt;IcyHot  I don't see Danny Green anywhere?
That Danny Green defense.
Law of averages took down Danny Green a lot
I think that’s purposefully misrepresenting what he said though. One of Klay’s *abilities* is that he will be able to literally fit onto any team and elevate them to the next tier of contention. Danny Green can be a positive for any team but Klay is literally one of the top 3 shooters of all time(and he’s not #3) and can score on all three levels while providing defense that is just as good if not better than Danny Green.
"Danny Green can fit into any team in any generation. Your comment says more about Klay’s skill set than ability.  Edit: just to avoid a straw man response, I’m not saying Danny Green == Klay. Klay is waaaaaay better. I’m making a point about how ease of fit, while a good attribute, does not necessarily make someone the best player."
I agree CJ fits really well with Embiid but I think they might need more changes at SG and SF with CJ. CJ and Seth Curry don't fit at all and Danny Green is washed.
I thought you guys meant Danny Green 💀
I Wish Shaq and Danny Green all the best in their partnership
IMO Danny Green is a better defender
Klay is a better player than Danny Green in every single facet.
"Comparing Klay to Danny Green is so insulting lol. After Steph, you could argue Klay is the 2nd best shooter ever. If anything there is a stronger argument that he could’ve put up way larger scoring numbers as the primary option somewhere else."
I'm not sold on this.   Who's to say Klay doesn't have a career like Danny Green if things play out differently?   Likewise Dray anchored a top 5 defense pretty much by himself last season. He's a massive difference maker on any team IMO.
"Russ will brick the rim every time. But to be honest I would love to have Danny Green. Yeah he can be hot or cold from 3, but great defender and smart player."
We already have “ Airball”Danny Green -  need somebody who can hit rim
So then why does everyone bitch about Danny green? He shoots that's and yet gets made fun of
Do you see embiid and Danny green making one of these for Simmons?
Danny Green is basically Klay except that he isn't
The Danny Green that just airballed three 3 pointers in a row in crunch time against the Nets? That Danny Green? THREE IN A ROW DANNY WHAT THE FUCK.
Danny Green? The guy who repeatedly has signed with teams that have championship aspirations? After he played on perennial championship contender Spurs teams? That Danny Green?
There’s a Twitter thread debating that Danny Green is basically Klay with less fortunate circumstances
Danny Green was not in the game for 30 minutes prior
"You don't have to be curious just look 2 years ago. ""Most United team I've ever been in"" -danny green"
"The only thing that worries me is our point of attack defense. The offense will get there. The team defense will get there. However, This year we don’t have the likes of KCP, Caruso, and Danny Green. Players that can apply pressure on the perimeter and funnel guys to AD. Other than Bazemore and Bradley, we don’t really have anyone like that. That’s going to make it really hard to slow down teams in the playoffs with good perimeter players when they get on a roll."
three airballs in a row from Danny Green.
"I have not. But on the game thread last night people were arguing that neither call would have gotten overturned, and that Danny Green was at fault for the loss."
"Everyone on this whole subreddit was trashing on Danny Green. I don't get how people forget that. At the time, trading Danny Green for Schroeder, who was also in the race for 6moty award, was seen as a positive. Many people thought grabbing Harrell and Schroder were an off-season improvement. Obviously that ended up dead wrong."
I totally saw Danny green score 38 in 1 quarter
They barely lost in 7 games.  It wasn't solely because of Ben. There was all bench line where the hawks went on like 20 pt runs. Danny Green was 1-9 from 3 in the first 3 games then missed the last 4 games. Harris didn't play well either. He went 2-11 in game 5. Embiid turned the ball over a ton game 7. There was several factors for why they lost. They could have beat the hawks and probably still should have even with Ben playing like that. They could win this year with that roster with Ben Simmons. Blaming it all on simmins is just stupid.
"I’m not doubting what Lebron can do with a roster after 2020. I seriously had them pegged as getting knocked out every round after R1 because they had no real talent outside of bron/ad. With little to no consistent shooting other than KCP.   -Rondo and Dwight were not considered championship run material at the time and were used as a point of emphasis for their lack of bench depth.  -Caruso was a meme.  -kuzma as well with those threads saying he is one of the worst players in the league or showing his lack of BBIQ,   -Javale McGee   -Danny green was considered a shell of his former self with multiple playoff postgame threads calling for his head and being scapegoated especially after missing that finals open 3 pointer.   -Markieff was an unknown quantity for the playoffs vs the clippers getting the better Morris."
"The lakers will struggle to make playoffs.  This team does not fit, we have two good players and the rest are negative impact players.   Rob Pelinka the only GM who signs players in hope our superstars make them better instead of signing players that make our superstars better (letting Caruso and Danny green go back to back years???)"
"It’s pretty baffling. Out of all the current stars, Westbrook has to be the worst fit with AD and lebron. He would make so much more sense on the Clippers or Celtics or somewhere  KCP + Hield + Caruso would be so good. I also don’t know why they got rid of Danny green who was perfect for them despite his icy hot ways."
"“You do realize Duncan only had 2 season above 52% FG in his entire career. Kareem's bottom 3 seasons would make Duncan's top 3.”  Duncan played in the toughest defensive era ever. Moving on.   “ You also ignore level of coaching help, and the impact of Duncan having one stable coaching system with arguably the GOAT for his entire career.”  What has Popovich done without Tim Duncan? Exactly.  “There's no way you adjusted for pace. You do realize that the only reason for this is because the late 90s and 2000s were the lowest scoring era in NBA history, right? I'm willing to bet that a disproportionate number of teams on your list are from 1994-2007”  You adjust it for pace then come back to me. I asure you Duncan will still be towards the top of the lowest scoring supporting casts.   “The ABA-merger happened right before the 1976-77 season. Guess who won the 1977 MVP? Kareem. Kareem has 2 MVPs post-merger alone (compared with Duncan's 2 MVPs for his entire career).”  The players voted on who the MVP was up until 1980, hence why Kareem never won another MVP after that year. Next.   “The level of bias here is ridiculous. I could just as easily say Duncan lost to Karl Malone, Shaq x3, Dirk x2, Gasol, Stoudemire, Zach Randolph, Bosh, ... essentially every great PF/C of his era.”  You could do that but the problem is Duncan has beaten all of those guys on his way to championships. During his prime Duncan was winning championships every other year, while playing in the toughest conference ever. Kareem in the 70’s only one 1 championship, so his shortcomings are even more bad when you factor in that he didn’t achieve any playoff success without Oscar or Magic.   “You bring up Kareem missing the playoffs on garbage teams but gloss over things like Duncan losing to the 8th-seeded Grizzlies in the 1st round as the top seed, while being outplayed by Zach Randolph.”  Kareem missed the playoffs IN HIS PRIME, in back to back years. And yes the Spurs lost to the Grizzlies in 2011 but Ginobili missed a game, and Tiago Spliter and Danny Green both missed 2 games.   Duncan was the best player on 4 of his 5 championships.  “3 out of 5”  Laughable.   “Kareem averaged 26/9/5 along with 1 steal and 1.5 blocks and shot an absurd 60% FG, and even Bird was quoted as saying “That did it. People forget that Kareem could pass out of the post as well as score. He was the difference-maker in the series.”  Most of those points were attributed to Magic’s passing. As Magic had the greatest playmaking series in NBA history in the 1985 Finals, averaging a record 15.2 APG and a finals record 14 APG. Keep in mind that 5 of Kareem’s 6 highest FG% seasons came while playing next to Magic.   “Kareem was outplayed by prime Magic. Duncan was getting outplayed by Tony Parker and a baby Kawhi”  Kareem was outplayed by Magic and Worthy for his last 3 Finals Appearances. Duncan was only outpayed in the Finals by his teammates once and that was by Kawhi in 2014"
Oh the feels when the Danny green air balls
FR dude is so overrated and just a glorified Danny Green
Most overrated player in the league imo glorified Danny Green
"Danny Green won like 3 of those games by himself, we all forgetting that?  Danny Green was going to get FMVP and then TD had 1-2 good games and all that evaporated."
"Please explain to me in fine detail, How is Docs fault Danny Green airballed 3 shots in a row?"
His job is to hit threes because that is all he can do. If he could dribble or pass he’d actually be good.   The fact that you compared him to JJ is laughable when JJ was in Philly he was making 200+ 2 point fgs and 200 free throws a year.   Danny Green made 49 2s and 31 free throws last year. I guess we are done with this discussion because MY lack of basketball knowledge though haha.
Anytime I see Danny Green do something dumb I think of [this clip](https://youtu.be/bFFvShURQ5k).
"He’s not supposed to be star and I never pretended he was. You’ve done weird angles to change this discussion over and over and it’s frustrating to deal with. Danny’s job is to hit threes, so I don’t care that he doesn’t add something else. I never bitched about JJ for the same reason. I have no idea what you believe besides “Danny Green no good haha”. And you’re wrong   I don’t believe your honest with what you’ve watched, and if you are I think you fairly bad opinions about basketball. That’s probably where we should end this"
Didn't call a challenge for two plays within the lady three. Subbed out curry for defense when he was the only one making shots. Speaking of which .. Kept Danny green in after three air ball 3s. Took embiid out with 90 seconds in the third... Didn't bring hjm back until 4-5 minutes remaining.   What the fuck....
"Funny stat I noticed from game 1, between Danny Green and Isaiah Joe they played a combined 30 minutes and finished 0/0/0/0/0 with 4 PF, but somehow a +4."
"Danny Green almost got there opening night, went 18 and a half."
Danny green has claimed it and pau gasol was publicly known. He played one game and the following day was in a boot following a misdiagnosed broken foot.  I understand that Tim’s was handled well but we also don’t know if that exact medical team has stayed the same since then.
Also Iversons first shot of his career was blocked then he airballed twice.   Oh yeah and he finished with 30 points which is something Danny Green has done one time in his entire career.   He isn’t good. Not because he has bad games shooting. It’s that he brings nothing to the offense outside of his inconsistent 3 point shooting.
More like Doc will blame him and then people will follow Doc and say that Danny Green is responsible for every bad thing that’s happened to them
Danny Green did this but with 18 mins in game 1 of this season. 0/0/0 and 0/1 shooting. Impressive.
Also to note is that a very cold Danny Green and Embiid came back into the game around then having not played for the last 30 minutes of real time.
I could've sworn Danny Green did this last night
"Russ is not a winning player nor are any of the other players lakers signed.  Danny green and Caruso are winning players and we shipped them out for nothing.  Rob Pelinka should be fired for the garbage roster he has, literally name one starting caliber role player on this team now?"
danny green
That’s the Danny Green we all know and love!
Danny Green wishing they waited a year.. How's Schröder doing?
Danny “Paul George” Green
Yeah why didn't doc just tell Danny Green not to shoot airballs
"Defensively it's not even close. AD has had the benefit of elite PoA defense nearly his entire career i.e. Jrue in NO, a combination of Caruso/KCP/Danny Green in LA.  Without that it's clear he isn't on that perennial DPOY candidate lelvel."
"The first time I watched Danny Green was the 2013 Finals where he averaged 55% 3 point shooting on 7 attempts per game. People might not remember that cause the Heat won, but he was definitely on some Klay Thompson shit in that series"
The Danny green and Morris video from the bubble was hilarious lmao
"Danny Green certainly made a stupid as fuck decision on the play, but it wasn’t intentional."
You’re gonna get downvoted because it wasn’t “on purpose” but It was def a reckless foul by danny green that unfortunately caused an injury.
"In this high paced, offensively potent era, 17.7 on 57TS% isn’t shit.  Prime Danny Green would do better than that in today’s NBA."
Nearly did with that horrible Danny Green turnover.
I’d rather have Dipo than Danny Green if I were the Sixers
Having just Deandre isn't ideal but he's a serviceable center that can rebound and defend the paint. He isn't the worst guy to have on Embiid who will get doubled on the block anyways. They're just gonna abuse whoever they have Seth Curry on. They can put Simmons on one of their big 3 but who's gonna guard the other 2? Danny Green? Then who else? Do they start Mattise?
"That's a false equivalency. Danny Green is undeniably one of the more effective role players/glue guys in the league, but that's not what I'm saying.   When you have guys like Harden, PG, and maybe Beal if he becomes available, they're all proven scorers who have also been to the playoffs. They've proven that their numbers lead to tangible wins in meaningful games.   LaVine is tremendous. I actually think higher of him than most people probably do. He's a good shooter and his strength at getting to the rim after his injury is straight up impressive.   But he doesn't have the same resume to be able to demand a player like Simmons who is objectively better and has proven more already."
"&gt;They rerouted for Jarrett Allen who was an upcoming RFA for a 1st round pick right after they just signed Christian Wood to be their future starting C, so while I agree it was bad value, Allen wasn't going to be starting there anyway  it doesn't matter whether Wood is there or whether Allen would be starting -  it's still terrible value. even in a sign-and-trade scenario next summer you should net more than a '22 Bucks pick for Allen.   Prince isn't good but he'll be an expiring mid-tier contract next summer, his contract alone is valuable for salary matching purposes. a competing team could be very interested in him this summer in a salary dump situation, similar to the Horford/Danny Green deal, or for the purpose of consolidating smaller contracts into 1 medium contract - because he would make it easier to trade for a high salary guy at the next trade deadline.  if that trade happened in a vacuum people would be losing their minds."
"&gt;I don’t see them getting any meaningful assets for dipo  I mean if I were the Sixers looking to a compete for the chip I'd rather have Dipo than Danny Green. Danny Green + a FRP gets the deal done imo.  It's confirmed he didn't want to stay in Indiana but there's nothing out there saying he only wants to sign in Miami.  If I'm Denver I'm also offering up Gary Harris + a first.  Shit, if I'm Boston I'm also offering up the TPE money from the Hayward trade + a first."
Yea but when he plays the Sixers he'll be able to stop Seth Curry and Danny Green from dominating in the post where they make their living /s
"What do you mean we were different? We had Rondo, KCP, Dwight, Caruso all playing integral parts in the championship run. Just because Kuzma underperformed and Danny Green lost his shooting touch doesn't mean the entire supporting cast was bad."
Danny green can guard either Kyrie and harden too
JR Smith and Danny Green
Danny green
Without embiid or simmons. Or anybody really. Their best player was danny green lmao    They've beaten zero good teams.  Like the kings team we just beat would be better than any of their wins
This fool really lives in his own flat world. He really thinks everything revolves around him. Trade him for Danny green or something.
"Danny Green, Bryn Forbes, Gary Neal. Ginobili too but not the streakiest."
"Danny ""I've got three rings Ninja"" Green"
"KD Help: Kyrie, Harden, Harris Embiid help: Ben Simmons (who is looking not good), Maxey (who has played ten games), and Danny Green (is Danny Green)"
"Sterling Brown, Danny Green, nice band from 00's and a bakery? that's a sick bench"
Dipo for Danny Green plus a 1st who says no
"Lmao what? You think a team of Lebron, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Dion Waiters, Danny Green, Kuzma, Caruso isnt a great team? Thats legit a super team lmao what the fuck do you want on your team 8 superstars?"
Okay? I could say the same about Danny Green
"I mean yeah. Of course they aren’t close to a title team, but that doesn’t mean they played like bums, even Danny Green. They were an extremely competent defensive unit, albeit sometimes top heavy on offense."
"I mean no shit if you remove one of our superstars you  don’t get as far. Danny Green, KCP, Morris, Howard, Caruso, and Rondo all had crucial parts in our run last year. Obviously I think the Nets still can make the finals but they still need to make adjustments to their roster to compete. I don’t think they beat us in their current form, at all."
"If you removed one of AD or Lebron from the team in the postseason, do you think you guys would've won a championship?   I think depth (especially whatever you guys had... Kuzma, Danny Green, KCP...really?) in the playoffs is overrated. Top talent/stars are what raise a teams ceiling."
3 time champ danny green doesn’t deserve this slander from both you guys
"League average shooters but they take much higher volumes of shots than normal. And league average doesn't account for all the players that don't shoot 3pters.  Alsonignoring the original question which was how many legitimate 40% 3pt shooters there are in the league. My guess would be 15. 5 of which are stars (Middleton, Curry, Klay, PG13, then for one of the all-star pgs they seem to hover around 38-40% each year, and Kat), then you have guys like redick, Bjelica and Seth Currywho are great shooters but their defensive deficiencies may not be worth it on a team without great individual defenders. Then there are guys Buddy Hield not as bad defensively but not fantastic and are being payed like stars. So both Bogdanovics and ingles. Then you have players that some years do but some years don't like Danny Green.  My point is those guys you were talking about don't exist."
"Kuzma, Danny Green and Rondo confirmed all stars last year I don’t know what you are talking about"
"Damn but Imagine if Danny Green took all the cyber bullying to heart and committed suicide. RIP Hana.   Also all the comedians commentating on terrace house is basically the equivalent of all the nba talking heads like SAS, Skip, and the inside the nba crew commentating about nba drama lmao"
"Yeah and the Lakers’ depth last year was Kuzma, McGee, Dwight, KCP, Danny Green, and Caruso. Obviously better than the Nets depth but that’s still mediocre by design."
"But it’s true. The only guy that showed up in game 5 was bron, the rest had already thought it was in the bag. Even then it took Danny Green missing a wide open 3 at the buzzer for the heat to scrape out the win."
"Caris ""2021 offseason Danny Green"" LeVert"
"Yeah Lowry for Danny Green Mike Scott whatever other matching salary and two protected future firsts. It's not a small price those two picks flexibility would be gone really, but I think I would still ultimately do it."
"the Spurs have always been an incredible defensive team. You're talking about a team starting Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan (albeit aging) as bad defensively?"
All that space for Danny Green and Ben Simmons though lool
"Idk dude, I feel much better about the sixers with Seth curry and Danny green, as well as the bench shaping up. Their championship window is also still open for a long time as long as embiid doesn’t get frustrated and want Simmons traded. Harden would make this season championship or bust, and I think their defense would keep them from the chip"
Danny Green or Tony Bradley best i can do
You mean sixers franchise record holder for most 3s made in a game (9) Danny Green?
Lmao imagine stalling over harden because of maxey. Dude had 1 good game where he got to shoot 33 times. Danny green gonna average 29 for sixers too lol?
"a few ways, Danny Green expiring and take back someone elses long term shitty deal plus a pick?     Shake, Furkan, Thybulle(assuming he's not in deal)...idk"
danny green gonna 3peat. has it ever been done on three different teams?
"The Raptors could throw multiple bodies at Embiid because his options were very limited, you'd have Simmons always lurking on the paint  and some other non-shooter  You can't do that if Embiid's options for kicking it out are Harden, Curry, Danny Green and Harris"
Dude is Icy Hot for a reason. He got plenty of open looks last year he’s just streaky as shit. All you can do is hope you get the good version of him in spurts. I would not put any faith in Danny Green lol
Danny Green in the playoffs is ass don’t fall for it
"Why does everyone hate 3 time nba champ, starting shooting guard, Danny Green?"
Danny Green too when he decides to shoot well
"I think if PJ Tucker is involved in this I would side with you on this. If he isnt.........man that's hard.   The perimeter/wing defense becomes an issue with this trade(of course you still do it but doesnt mean this isnt true). Lakers had to put AD on Jimmy Butler last year because Danny Green couldnt do it. Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Tobias Harris, James Harden, Danny Green, those are your realistic perimeter defensive options  It's close. If the cost of PJ Tucker is it requires me to give up Maxey instead of Thybulle I would do that though."
"If we get Harden, I think we'll want to keep Danny Green if we can help it"
we'll probably be looking to get Danny Green + stuff at the deadline
Philly with Seth curry Harris embiid harden and Danny green is the best team in the east
"If Im Philly, Im tryna pick up PJ Tucker as well for Green. I need 5 guys I can trust no matter what and at this stage, Danny isnt one of them."
"Ehh, might be giving up too much for Philly. There’s another disgruntled superstar in Houston tho... how about Wentz &amp; up &amp; coming star Danny Green for Harden &amp; Watson?"
"Danny Green, Harden, and Tobi are all decent defenders. Losing Ben would be a big blow to wing defense but with Embiid anchoring the defense I think we’d still be above average at worst."
Danny Green shot 21 threes last night??
"Insert standard homer take here  But really, I think the Sixers would be more well rounded and would probably be able to retain a lot more of their depth in the trade than Brooklyn.  Seth Curry - Harden - Danny Green - Tobias - Embiid  That's not an entirely flawless lineup but damn if it doesn't have many flaws. I think the Nets would seriously lack the front court dominance that the Sixers would have"
"What did Dwight win before joining Lebron. Danny Green has won too, but with loaded Spurs, Raptors and Lakers teams."
and Point Guard Danny Green!
Danny green has been to the ecf
"&gt;Why? Why specifically past the first round?  Past the first round is when you start playing the real contenders not teams like Orlando.   &gt;Green &gt; Tucker as a starter if we trade for Harden  Not really, just wait till Danny Green's shooting starts regressing a little before saying that. They had to put Anthony Davis on Jimmy Butler in the Finals last year because Danny couldnt guard him at all."
"&gt; At the end of the day, a team can’t win a championship with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer and Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz as the secondary ball handlers.  Why not?   Our team this year actually built around Simmons strengths and Embiid's influence on the defense.   If Seth Curry and Danny Green get hot at the right time we are one of the best teams in the league.  Great defense and 3 pt shot making/creating with a dominant interior presence.  Meme all you want but Simmons is arguably the best player at getting his teammates good looks from 3.  The problem has always been we werent able to spread the floor enough for him to do it especially in the playoffs because him and Embiid arent a great fit.     Outside of shooting a tad bit better, Simmons is similar to Giannis.  The difference being one team has a top 3 center and the other doesnt so they were able to build a more functional team around what Giannis does."
I think he matters because they will need a bigger wing to throw on Kevin Durant Jayson Tatum Jimmy Butler and hell if they make it that far LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard. Danny green can’t do it anymore that’s the PJ duty  You want lineup flexibility. Tobias/Harden/Embiid....you don’t really need more offense around that. Want to compliment it with more wing defense if the possibility exists. I actually think the lineup I like most is Embiid/Tobias/PJ/Seth/Harden. PJ guards 4 positions doesn’t matter what you list Tobias as if you want him to guard 4s you can easily make that happen    Also Dwight looks good now but it’s no lock he’s gonna be reliable enough to hold up as a backup C after the first round. They lost a series to Toronto literally because they died without Embiid on the court PJ is a real backup 5 for 10-12 min a game you don’t have to worry about
"He probably is the [greatest lob receiver](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/1/5/21049574/lakers-anthony-davis-catching-lobs-lebron-james-danny-green-pass-frank-vogel-video-gum-pelicans) of all time, it’s incredibly rare to have his size, athleticism, and feel for finished lobs at the rim. Also, I didn’t say anything about scoring, I said he’s a way better complimentary star to someone like Lebron or Harden because more of his value comes with the ball out his hands compared to Jokic, who needs the ball in his hands to take full advantage of his passing ability."
"Yeah I agree, all question marks. More so in response to the people above, he already is a 16ppg guy, it's not like he's regularly taking 2 shots a game. I'd add that shorthanded Miami was playing a very straightforward live and die by 3 pointers game. Pack the paint and hope the sixers miss, while they hit themselves. Hence why Danny green put up 25 shots and Simmons had 12 assists."
Yeah I'm sure we're trading him for Danny 3 rings Green instead...
"last 11-13 yrs?  wade, bosh, love, irving, shaq, ilgauskas, mo williams, hughes, szcerbiak, gooden, drose, isaiah thomas, boozer, mike miller, korver, mcgee, dwight, birdman, bibby, rashard lewis, battier, marion, rondo, AD, ingram, kuzma, ball, chandler, ray allen, haslem, jr smith, danny green, donyell marshall, david wesley, ben wallace, frye, shannon brown, james jones, hood, michael beasley, clarkson, jeff green, jefferson, snow, etc"
"Salaries need to match. Harden and Tucker combine to nearly 50M of salary and Ben Simmons is only 30. Where do you get the other 20? Danny Green has to be included.  Harden + Tucker for Simmons, Green, either Thybulle/Maxey and 3 FRPs."
"Bruh Embiid and Simmons playing in a back to back (and 3 in 4 days) after both being injured, and our two ball handlers fouled out leaving Embiid to run point guard in OT.  Not saying Sixers didn't have more talent but clearly Ben wasn't 100% and Sixers trotted out Isaiah Joe for 37 mins, Danny Green played 50 mins, Mike Scott wasn't on the team last week and played 46 mins, hell we had Dakota Mathias out there."
"I get the sentiment, but if the decision to deal Ben Simmons for a better fit revolves around *Danny Green* maybe liking the way Ben passes to him.....we'd have a much, much larger issue to deal with.  There are a few reasons to keep Ben, but that one should be FAR down the list. Especially since Green seems to be the only one really missing a beat without him on the floor."
"&gt; The Sixers do.   Who are the multiple good young players, in addition to Simmons, and what does that leave in Philly?  Harden, Embiid, and what?  Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Mike Scott?  And three (plus) team trades aren't magic.  That just means you're giving up even more, but different, assets."
"Danny Green, the guy who went with him, convenient that."

"Except the Sixers were missing their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th scoring options behind Joel. The Sixers lost starters AND 2nd rotation guys, so it’s literally Embiid, an injured Simmons, Danny Green, and a bunch of dudes that under normal circumstances would come in for “garbage time” playing right now, so Embiid and Green did exactly what they needed to do to carry the team to a win."
We just pretending Danny Green didn't back up kawhis accusations now saying they happened to him?
Spoelstra probably has PTSD of the 2013 version of Danny Green
"I still don't think you guys have enough shooters around Embiid. Danny Green had a career high 9 3 pointers made (w/ 21 attempts), but I'm not sure he's going to keep that up. Seth Curry is probably going to be your most consistent 3 point shooter, likely followed by Shake.   I think Embiid is the really the future of the Sixers, not Simmons."
"&gt;Should they sit on their hands for the year and run back this same roster we've seen several times but with Seth Curry and Danny Green instead?  Yes  Seth curry and danny green were huge additions, not because of how good they are but because of how much better they fit  Last year Embiids PPG went down by 4.5 mostly just because of how badly constructed our roster was. We already look way better again this year.  I dont think theres a trade on the table for us anymore. The 6ers and Simmons are playing too well to give up a ton for Harden. I wouldnt even do Simmons for Harden straight up and the rockets obviously wouldnt do that either"
"I feel like there is natural talent tho. There are definitely guys Ive played with over the years with better ball handling abilities than Danny Green. Danny Green is a professional and Im sure has had more reps, practice and has gone through more and better skills training than most but obviously doesnt have the natural ball handling ability others even some amatuers have"
"I have not been a huge fan of Danny Green but he played 50 minutes tonight, he's a team player, I'm a fan now happy to have him"
I was whispering don't pass to Danny Green during this possession
Where was this Danny Green when we needed him last season? LOL
"No, Danny Green has a pretty extensive history of shitting his pants in the playoffs, most notably the last two years where he was an absolute passenger. And the last time Dwight did anything noteworthy in the playoffs was when he was second fiddle to Harden, last time he actually looked like a top star was what, Harden’s rookie year?"
Excluding Danny green and maybe Howard
"Idk man. It's just not. Why mention per 36? We're literally talking about one game. 5 points and 2 steals. In 32 minutes. Right up there with defensive stalwarts gabe Vincent, Kelly olynyk and Danny green"
"Ben fouled out then Maxey fouled out a couple minutes later. Zumoff said on the telecast ""who handles the ball now, Danny Green?"" I almost had a heart attack hearing that sentence. Instead Embiid basically ran the point for us thank god lmao"
"Should they sit on their hands for the year and run back this same roster we've seen several times but with Seth Curry and Danny Green instead?  What happens if they sit on their hands, Harden gets traded to idk Miami or something and then the sixers lose in the playoffs with this group anyway? Idk how many times Embiid is going to fail with this group before he asks out himself."
"What that saying, every dribble Danny Green takes exponentially increases the chance of him doing something stupid?"
"If you're open you gotta take that shot, considering 3-pt shooting is literally one of 2 skills that Danny Green does at an NBA-level he absolutely has to take that shot.   If he's passing up open shots then the defense has already won, he's psyched himself out of his game"
"Not sure how good Danny Green will be in Houston though, but I'm sure they can make it work!"
Who got a ring on the bench not doing much?   RJ? Danny Green?  Or maybe doing alot but not a star? Draymond?
Harden. Embiid. P&amp;R. Tobias on the wing. Seth &amp; Danny Green spacing out top.   Even I'd be hype for the Sixers
"Yeah for sure . From the Danny green podcast, JJ’s podcast and others. More or less and idea of what’s he’s about"
Shades of game one of the 2020 regular season Danny green
You know shit is mega fucked up when Danny Green scores 29 in a game
Maxey and Danny Green should suffice
"Kyle Lowry, Matt Thomas, McCaw for Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Tyrese Maxey"
Duncan Robinson texted Danny Green to tell him y’all were clowning on him.
76ers Legend Danny Green.
"9-21 is 42% from three. That's pretty good for a role player who is put into a position where he has to assume higher volume with other players out. if danny green is his usual danny green self, do the 76ers win this game even with embiid playing at career best levels? no right? because *teams* win in the nba.  I think we need to calm down with the word ""scrub"". limited? I can agree with that."
All Ik forsure is that 2019-2020 Lakers would have the best defense of all time   - PG- Prime Rondo - SG- Prime Danny Green - SF- Prime Bron - PF- AD - C- Prime Dwight   Sixth man- Prime Avery Bradley
"He's hot and cold, i've seen a couple of Sixers games, he's either Klay Thompson or.....well, Danny Green."
"Thing #1: don't hold the ball for 13 seconds after an offensive rebound, only to pass it to Danny Green in the corner for a contested heave."
Despite the loss it was a fun game to watch. Also is Danny Green back in his “hot” phase of his icy hot nickname this season so far??
Danny green scored more 3 pointers this game than last year with us in total
Danny Green was a lot closer than this dude though.
"You’re overlooking the 2020-1 Sixers: 3x DPOY Dwight, 3x NBA Champion Danny Green, with 2x MVP (2021,2023) 3x DPOY (2021, 2023-2024) Embiid, DPOY (2022) Ben Simmons, 2025/2027 MVP and scoring leader Shake Milton, 2026/2028 MVP and 2032 MIP Tyrese Maxey, all time 3pt leader at retirement (2033) Seth Curry, and 6x Emmy-nominated James Michael Scott, OBE."
That second to last possession where Danny Green just kinda yeeted it had me screaming at my TV. Thank god for Tobi because I was about to go into a deep state of depression after that blown lead.
"Probably needed to make salaries match, same reason why Danny Green was traded to Toronto in the Kawaii deal"
"Skimmed it but mostly it seems like he's saying LeBron dominates against the Sixera about as much as he dominates against every team. Weird way to title the article, especially for a Philadelphia paper.  Also a gem from the end of the article mailbag section: ""I came up with this trade proposal, what do you think? Warriors get Ben, Terrance Ferguson (expiring contract), Danny Green (expiring contract), Mike Scott (expiring contract) and a first round pick. The Sixers get Stephen Curry, Draymond Green.""  Oh honey."
"Huh that’s my first comment? And Danny green was so bad I watched nearly every reg season game, and every playoff game. He killed the team thankfully Bron, AD, KCP, Dwight, Kief, AC, Rondo, and even Kuz brought it every night"
Danny Green has the most made threes in NBA Finals history. Don’t disrespect the man he has made plenty of shots in his career.
Danny Green and clutch shots.  Name a worse duo.
"&gt;Danny green cannot guard Schroder at all tho  To be honest, only a couple guys in the league can, if that.  When Schroder's cold, like his 0 for 5 first half, that's fine, but when he's not cold -- like in the second -- he's a problem for anyone to handle."
I'm rooting for Danny Green to win a three peat on 3 different teams.
Gl to Danny Green. Love my tar heel alums
I have no clue. Like he says regularly so it's not some person he has beef with. But like what did Jae do? Even if you go back to the Finals? He didn't have a Danny Green missing shot for the game play or anything just really weird and sad.
"I was screaming that they didn't go to him on prior possessions. He's being guarded by Caruso, but nah Danny Green pullup contested 3, good choice."
"I think it was because when he caught it, he instantly went to attack. Danny green was on the wing for the entry pass to Embiid if he swung it to him."
We have Danny Green tho and He will not be denied his third straight chip
It's not Doc's fault Danny Green just casually watched AD come off a screen and stood there for a good second or two.
throwing it to Danny green in the corner and then just standing there while he tries to create was um interesting
I'm just happy it wasn't Danny Green game winner. I don't hate him unlike a lot of other fans but that would have been too much for even me
well that was an awesome game. Went about how I thought it would with it being real ugly at points for either team. These teams matchup weirdly well with each other very well defensively with a combination of the lakers having the size to guard embiid and the sixers having simmons and embiid to guard Lebron and AD respectively.   Danny green cannot guard Schroder at all tho
Danny Green has been hitting 3s all year from Simmons passes. Maybe he’s just got better chemistry and spacing here
Danny Green revenge is complete haha
"The two kings of Long Island Basketball, Tobias Harris and Danny Green baby"
"Some of the final few possessions by the 6ers were so rough. From Simmons driving into the paint to lay it off to Curry to iso with Embiid hanging out outside the perimeter, to that offensive board that ended with a Danny Green brick… the two all stars on the 6ers have to step up at the end. They should be taking these final shots. Harris bailed the fuck out of them tho, he's been looking great."
danny green LA sleeper agent
TERRIBLE defense by Danny Green
what on gods green earth was danny green doing there
Why do GMs keep giving Danny Green a contract
was danny green awake?
DANNY GREEN THREE
Danny green for the win.. you heard it here first
Philly deserves to lose just for giving the ball to Danny Green to create his own shot in crunch time
"So simmons could've either passed to tobias, whose being guarded by CARUSO, or shove it to a covered danny green in the corner. Great decision dude"
Danny Green still playing for us😎
I suddenly have the urge to throw batteries at Danny Green
NO SPOILERS I'M BEHIND BUT FUCK DANNY GREEN
LOL Danny Green
The Danny Green experience. Lol
"Danny ""Danny Green"" Green back again"
Thanks Danny Green
LMAO DANNY GREEN
why tf did Danny Green try to take that
*Dennis Schröder scores once again on Danny Green*   Doc Rivers: “6th times the charm”
Danny green has been to slow for Dennis all game. Change it up doc
Dude get danny green off shroeder he's been getting burned all game wtf
"why does Danny Green think schroder can shoot??? make him go left and shoot, its not that complicated"
Danny Green having one of his 5 good games per year tonight.
Danny green can barely jump and he makes that lol.
Danny Green just met AD at the rim and won lmao
LeGet D'ed up by Danny Green
Get Danny Green off Schroeder. He's too fast
Danny Green must have circled this night for his out-of-hiberation game where he shoots over 50% for a game then goes 30% the next 3.
I’m not trying to say he was good or not frustrating but they still won. If Danny green is bad in the playoffs but they still win I will be OK
"See a lot of comments on Danny Greens shooting. It’s lowkey been like this all season specifically when he’s on the floor with Simmons.   Those two seems to have some really spectacular chemistry. Without Simmons on the floor green struggles and without Green, Simmons assist rates drop.   Might just be a good fit"
The way some Lakers fans talk about Danny Green you would think he personally cost them a loss in 4 straight finals games and was so bad they had to forfeit 3 previous championships or something.
Lakers shooting 9% from 3 and Danny Green is shooting 200% from 3. Philly better win coz it ain't gonna be there in a series.
danny green did'nt want to hit 3's last season wtf
Danny green revenge game
what was Schroder even doing so far off of Danny green
Danny Green playing like KCP
Danny Green with more 3's made tonight than all of the Finals combined
&gt;considering Danny green OBVIOUSLY is playing out of his mind too  FTFY
lebron carrying the team hoping the 3pt shooting shows up. haven't got a clue how its this close considering Danny green is playing out of his mind too
"Danny Green: ""Thanks for the ring, but this is for trading me"""
"Reminder that dwight howard got his championship ring today, while danny green opted to recieve his when he can be celebrated by Lakers fans. [Laker fans reading this rn.](https://imgur.com/a9MZjc9)"
I was really expecting Danny Green to get blocked from behind by LeBron. Disappointing
"He’s so fucking streaky, I swear every time I’ve watched Danny Green recently he’s been terrible but that playoff run with the Spurs tho."
Very badly need a gif of danny green blocking the shit out of schroder
Danny Green 1/5 the other night with 3 air balls against Detroit and now 3/4 from 3 before the half tonight  Living up to the Icy Hot nickname
"ah yes, danny green 3/3 from 3. Just as we all expected."
Danny Green 3/3 from 3    Is that sustainable?
That was the best handles I’ve ever seen from Danny Green
Lmao a Danny Green Iso on Anthony Davis is not a good idea
Is Danny Green about to be a back to back to back champion?
"Wow, Danny Green got a freebie from Toronto, and Los Angeles, only to start playing well in Philadelphia."
So danny green is hot this game
Danny Green heard you lol
Danny green revenge game
danny green hitting 3s makes me irrationally angry
Danny Green revenge game
Post Embiid’s block into Danny Green 3.
Bro Danny Green is such a clown. Completely worthless all regular season AND playoffs (his defense wasn’t anywhere near what Laker fans pretend it was) and now he wants to hit shots smh
Danny Green taking things personally
Lakers fans punching the air every time Danny Green hits another 3.
Revenge game Danny Green
Danny Green revenge game 😈
Ok so now Danny Green decides to put the ball in the net. Nice
I had a feeling Danny Green would start hitting 3s against us
danny green death threat revenge game
the same danny green who wouldn’t hit wide open catch and shoot threes in the playoffs making a three off the dribble in transtition...damn
Danny Green came to make shots today!
Danny Green was feeling himself a little bit too much on that one but thankfully it went in lol
If Danny green hits as many 3’s in the playoffs as he has tonight the Lakers win the championship in 4
Danny Green revenge game
Danny Green baby!!
I guess Danny Green misses Lakers coz his shoes are Lakers' colors
"Not cut out to be a star. Alternatively, talents such as Danny Green and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope should not be ignored!"
KP has the potential to be better than Luka. Rick doesn't know how to use him and uses him like Danny Green.
"I don’t see an easy way to match salaries for the Sixers. He’s making 30+ mil? We would have to give up Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and someone else to make it even close to working financially."
"Sixers are way better constructed this year than it was last year, and this is part of what has enabled Embiid to be playing out of his mind, and Harris to actually be playing really well. Replacing Horford and Richardson with Seth Curry and Danny Green is just a much, much better fit for Harris, Embiid, and Simmons to be playing their respective games."
"That’s a good point. It’d be interesting to look through the stats after this season though. I’m curious if COVID and the lack of training camp is gonna cause more wild swings than normal.   There’s also different kinds of good shooters. The first is guys that are super hot and cold like Danny Green, Robert Covington, or Jamal Murray (or me on a much worse scale, lol). The second type of guys who are just always consistently good, but don’t necessarily reach the same peaks as the guys from the first category, like JJ Reddick. I’m not sure which is more valuable."
"The spurs had three HOFers, the GOAT coach, a young DPOY kawhi and the best role player in the league in Danny Green. Not close."
Last season I took the Celtics over Sixers easy. But last season with Simmons injured they didn't have defenders to throw on Tatum and Brown. Now they'll have Simmons back plus Danny Green. Last season they were 3-1 in the regular season I believe
Thanks Danny Green.
"Role players on non contending teams get underrated.  For example a guy like Richaun Holmes is better than a lot of starting centers in the NBA.  Kyle Anderson is a great defender, a good passer/pnr operator and this year he's even shooting well on decent volume, he'd be a starter on a lot of contenders, but he's on the Grizzlies so nobody cares.  Valanciunas is better than he was on Toronto, but he's not on a contender anymore so nobody cares.  Justin Holiday is an elite 3&amp;D guy, legit one of the best in the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other end role players on elite teams either get overrated/overhyped (Beverley, Caruso, Horton Tucker, DiVincenzo...) Or some often get overscrutinized  (KCP, Danny Green,...)"
Danny Green robbed us of Klay
Man if Danny green hit that shot that would have been such a nice way to end the season
"To be fair, I'm not sure if Booker scored a single basket on Ben in the first half when he was the primary defender. Every take he had in the first half was when Danny Green was guarding him. He seemed like he was shying away from taking shots with Ben on him, other than those he got off the PnR.  For some strange reason Doc put Green on Booker a decent amount to start the second half and Book started cooking, and in the 4th not even Ben could stop him (dropped two threes in his eye near the end). I thought Ben played great defense today, Booker is just a great scorer and eventually got his.  Won't stop all these people in here who didn't watch the game saying ""best perimeter defender lolz"""
He's getting way more than 10M a year. He's shot above 40% from 3 for two years and plays excellent defense. Danny Green is getting 15 mil a year to put it into perspective.
"Yep, those first 4 guys should all cost like a 2nd rounder, so I think they’re safe to get some combo of those needs acquired easily.  I’m a big Lowry fan, I think he’s the kind of high end, all-around guard that could legitimately put the Sixers into serious championship contending territory. He is old, but he’s such a smart player, and his game isn’t overly athleticism based, I think he’s gonna age okay over the next few years. He also had a late career start so his overall mileage isn’t as insane as some guys. He can play on or off ball, so he fits great with Simmons. We won’t lose anything on defense either, since he’s strong on that end. I also feel good about Philly’s ability to bring him back next year. He loves Philly, and the trade would give them bird rights.  The cost to me starts with Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Poirer or Ferguson to match salary, and then the incentive would be a young guy (preferably Matisse, possibly Maxey) and likely a first. I’d do it without question for Matisse and a 1st, and I’d hesitate on Maxey but I lean towards yes."
Yeah I don’t know what Ayton was thinking. Tobias was still a few feet away from him. The closest guy is Danny Green. Just dunk that shit lol.
Still remember Dunk'd On podcast ranked him below Danny Green and KCP.
"Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Vincent Poirer matches salary. Incentive would be a young guy (preferably Matisse, likely Maxey) and a 1st"
Green of Danny this year
Definitely would rather have Danny Green. And Dennis Smith Jr. is for sure a better prospect.
"Someone who can actually create half court offense, Tobias Harris as the half court initiator does not work and Simmons is in Dunker spot mode at the end of games.  I also think they need more wing defense to deal with secondary players like Jaylen Brown or Kyrie Irving. Danny Green ain’t it at this point in his career"
Danny Green is far too old and slow to be guarding Book
"I sort of understand the sentiment behind not just planting Simmons on the best guard/wing on defense and letting it be, but man, at least give Ben the benefit of the doubt until he picks up a foul. Quarter wouldn't have been as close if Ben were defending Booker instead of past-his-prime Danny Green."
Danny Green offers no resistance on the perimeter at all
"For how good a defender he is, Danny Green gives up so many open 3s because he always jumps past the shooter on every closeout"
"Do you believe that was the only change we made?   - We got Marc Gasol  - Siakam became an all star / borderline all star caliber player   - Serge improved significantly  - We got a championship 3&amp;D starter in Danny Green  - Fred VanVleet was a lot better in the last 2 series  - We got a new head coach that understood positional matchups   In 2018 our offensive rating against Cleveland was fine. The issue was defensively, we had JV guarding Love, Serge Ibaka on JR Smith and DeMar (a guy who infamously couldn't get around a screen to save his life) guarding Kyle Korver. There's a reason those 3 shot 40%+ in that series and did shit all offensively  In the other series .  If Exchanging Kawhi for DeRozan was truly the only change we made, we lose to Philly 100%"
"Dream trade is Kyle Lowry to the Sixers for Danny Green, Salary (Poirer/Scott), Thybulle, and a 1st.  I don’t think that’s enough for Toronto though likely, I think they’d push for Maxey instead of Thybulle and I’m very hesitant to give him up."
no they had danny green and bron was young and fresh
"For realistic trades right now, the only possible move I see the Raptors making is sending Lowry to a real contender.  Personally, I thought of a 4-team trade with PHI, GSW and NOP that would send Lowry to the Sixers, Danny Green to the Warriors, Kelly Oubre Jr to the Pelicans and Lonzo/Maxey to the Raptors. There'd be picks sent around to balance out the trade for each team as well, but I'm not sure how each fanbase feels about that."
"Would have to be like Danny Green to match salaries, and you can't play Rubio or Ben with Dwight. So now you need a new backup 5 too."
Sixers were obvious choice even return would be small but now with Danny Green and Seth they're set. Don't have idea who else need him
I like MJ but to hold him so much higher than any other player I can’t get behind.  The Danny green example is horrible dude was essentially a journeyman brick layer last year.  I rooted all year for him and he never hit a streak while I watched.
IMO I still think Lonzo should be converted into a wing like a younger Danny Green with fullcourt passing skills
Chubby Danny Green tries to flex on Lebron - AGAIN
"MJ is a great passer. He just didn’t have to pass because him scoring wins more games. LeBron didn’t have the option. He puts up 25 PPG, pale in comparison to MJ’s 32 PPG, and relies on his teammates to win games, hence him passing. He didn’t have the moves MJ has to carry his teams.  Kids don’t go in awe watching people passing. Somebody at YMCA can do a chest pass just like LeBron can. But nobody could fly as aesthetically as MJ flew. That’s what’s awe-inspiring. Give them a clip of MJ switching hands in mid-air and they’d want to hold a basketball. Give them a clip of LeBron passing a ball to Danny Green for the brick and they would rather do their homework."
Yo is number 15 correct? Danny Green really? And I’m a Lakers fan
Schroder is a fools gold player lmao I'll take Danny Green bricks over that dude any day. At least Danny isn't high usage and contributes more on D
Hell no... Lillard is not even the conversation of shooting when it comes to Curry... Curry's worst seasons are equal to what dame good seasons... After they started shot tracking... Curry's only contested 3s percentage is better than lillards open shots percentage or his overall percentage... U act like Klay and Draymond were stars like LeBron or Kd coming though the gate... Klay and Draymond were made by Curry... Curry generated their open looks... Put dame back in warriors... Klay would be just a 3 and d guy like Danny green... And Draymond would be atmost a hustle player like faried... Also do u think everybody is a good shooter coming of the screen... Do u why people overcommitt on steph... His release is super quick and he does it in less space and better efficiency... Lillard wouldn't be even able convert half those looks... Also put Lillard on those teams of warriors ain't no way they even making it to the finals... Also lol... How skewed is your argument... Like put Drexler instead of Jordan in those bull's teams... Sure they would win 6 or atleast 4 rings right... Cuz Drexler played like Michael but with just worst efficiency because he had bad supporting casts right... So Drexler is 2nd best or even equal to Jordan.... Lol... Curry's shooting is what made him and warriors... Stop trying to put some shit down...
"Danny green, Fred VanVleet and Normal Powell?"
Brooks look like budget Danny Green
"Depends how specific we’re talking. If we’re talking strictly playoffs, Danny Green barely contributed at all. He was putrid in the playoffs. If you want to include the regular season then that’s another story.  Fred Van Vleet was a bigger contributor than Kuzma imo, not only because he played better, but because the Raptors *needed* FVV more than the Lakers needed Kuzma."
VanVleet and Danny Green are both much better known for the defense they played.
"This applies to so many players of so many championship teams though, so why denigrate kuzma? I’d say Rick Fox was a large contributor to the Shaq/Kobe Lakers, just as Danny Green or VanVleet was for the raptors..."
"The Danny Green special, get paid = shoot bricks"
"Before everyone gives Curry all the credit the 2012-2014 Spurs hit these shots too. Danny Green, Patty Mills, and Manu would take and hit these shots and they went to two finals and won one doing it."
"Even if Danny Green learns to make a floater, the defense has won. No player ever makes that shot enough to be more efficient than a 3."
Because there’s only so many things you can work on. As a role player today your priorities should be not being a weakness on perimeter defense and being able to shoot threes. Danny Green is far more valuable in today’s NBA than Lou Williams even though Lou can make plays off the dribble
We had Danny Green run point one game.  Been a weird season.
wow and they ended up taking horford for a pick and danny green😒
i think chuck is arguing for literally what danny green was showing in the bubble.
"Steph is a lot like Giannis in that it’s a team effort to guard him, since Steph plays a lot of off ball and with Giannis you have to build a wall. With that being said, I think the 2016 Cavs and the 2019 raptors defended him the best imo. If you had to pick a single best defender, I might have to say Danny Green..."
"That wouldn’t happen nowadays though. The closest in this day and age is Danny Green or (jokingly) McCaw but I don’t see Danny winning 4 more. A player who happened to win 12 rings being on the right place at the right time, in today’s day and age, would be a max level player, because clearly they’re offering some sort of intangibles if they’re able to do it for what is (presumptively) a majority of their career. So a LeGM player? We’re not gonna see anyone close to LeBron for a while, because that player isn’t in the league yet.   How do you not think 100 will happen in the NBA? Kobe scored 81 in an era where mostly 2’s were taken. Way less 3’s. Devin Booker scored 70 a few years ago when he wasn’t as good as he is now, Harden scored 60+ through 3 quarters, hell so did Kobe before he got 81. 100 is far more likely than someone winning 12 rings. Assuming even a very generous 20 year career, that means they have a higher Finals win rate than the current winningest player? And they’re not even in the league yet?   Bill Russell’s rings aren’t worth as much as the ones nowadays because he played against inferior talent and literally less teams. Back then with like less than 10 teams, everyone had a ring. No one is winning 12 championships as a player in the modern NBA."
Okay well why doesn’t Seth curry improve on D or kuzma improve his passing? They’re just bad at those things. Of course guys work on their game. Do you not think Danny green has done hours and hours of dribbling drills? He’s just not good at dribbling. Why doesn’t Seth curry play defense like Danny green? He would be a better player!!!!!
"I think its less this and more that they're not nearly as good at creating as the teams actual PG/Playmaker, who the coach assuredly wants initiating the offense  So really.. aint nobody wanna see Danny Green dribbling, instead of standing there, providing space for JoJo to put in work"
"No one is asking someone like Danny Green to ISO and create his own shot. But being able to beat a strong closeout and make a mid or floater opens the game up drastically for everyone. Most shooters aren't running around screens and pin downs, there just standing in a corner or wing waiting for the ball to come to them. But when the ball comes to them they get closed out hard and just have to swing it. If a guy like Kleber or Bertans was able to drive at that hard closeout and get to the rim it would completely change the way that player is defended and open up their whole game"
"I'm interested to see who he primarily guards. I'm guessing Seth on Harris which leaves Ben, Tobias, and Danny Green for Kyrie, Harden, and KD."
Very weird. Harris and Embiid packed the paint while Danny Green and Seth Curry weren't even moving. I assume they were meant to be ready for a dribble hand off to shoot a three but it was really awkward and left Simmons with no options.
Danny green wide open miss calling it
Seth or Danny Green?
Danny Green game winner incoming
This evening police issued an APB on Derrick Jones Jr. for the attempted murder of Danny Green
"You act like it's basic as fuck but players like danny green, kyle korver, and more show that being able to drive in the NBA is actually hard, even when there's no one in front of you."
Danny Green sprint like the devil chasing him
I was like these are not the state of Seth curry and Danny green so far
everytime i watch the sixers  why the fuck do they shoot like 25 and 20% from three.  Danny green lays bricks everytime
 Danny Green asking for Gary Harris to be attributed that miss in his stats
I see Danny green still getting blown by 🌚
"Isn’t that why Seth Curry is a better offensive player than Danny green though, because he can take someone on and do more than stand there and shoot."
Danny green runs like he got plantar fasciitis in both his feet
Gary Trent Jr is what everyone keeps paying Danny Green to be
"we'll see if Simmons even guards him, at least to start. Doc has been put Danny green on Jaylen, beal, harden, etc."
"It’d be great if Danny Green could create off the dribble obviously, but at that point we’re just asking players to be perfect and make unprecedented improvements. Some guys will never be able to dribble effectively against NBA defenses. Better that they know their limitations than force it."
Because being one dimensional limits you severely especially if you aren’t a good/great defender too. We’re not saying Danny Green needs to be able to iso somebody but if he could or anybody who’s primarily a shooter could make some floaters too it would help everybody.
Lol why does Danny green type players need counter when they need to hit the 3s by standing in the spots
"Part of the reason coach wants them to stand there is because they can't dribble, though. No one wants to see Danny Green trying to bounce a ball."
"Danny Green erasure, he started the infamous Seven Sixers game sir."
"Sixers had 7 players available when they played the Nuggets, Danny Green the only starter"
"Neither will ever happen, but I think some Danny Green/Robert Horry type tagging along for some dynasties is more likely than all of the confounding factors that had to happen for the 100 point game to happen again"
I was surprised too. Gave up a 2025 pick and got and expiring Danny Green back.
"&gt; with zero return  yeah raps got literally nothing out of keeping kawhi and danny green just for that one last playoff run, shouldve traded them both smh"
Danny Green?
"I didn’t.  Rodman, Rashad Lewis, Danny Green, Ainge, Milsap, Ariza, DJ, Mo Cheeks, Kukoc, Hornacek are names who could be put up there.  Not Norman Powell lol."
"eh we cant let all of kawhi, danny green, serge, marc and lowry walk for nothing. we need to get something back even if its not much"
He's also the type of defender that gets recklessly overrated by fans. Tenacious and strong on-ball but pretty one-dimensional. He's too big to be elite at getting through screens and not tall enough to have a lot of value as a help defender.   I don't think Dort will ever be as good as prime Danny Green for example and honestly I think Green was better on defense alone than Dort is right now.
"I keep thinking he's just young Danny Green when I watch him, so meeting he's just inherited the icy hot nature too."
the problem is that filler is Danny Green and another contract which kinda hurts the team. danny has been real good for us. would love lowry though obviously
People were saying it during the finals last year after Lebron passed the ball to Danny Green and then he missed the shot
Pretty sure people were saying it when he passed to a wide open Danny Green for the potential game-winner in the Finals too.
"Honestly it’s not as egregious as a deal as people make it out to be. Dort has zero pre-draft acumen and legitimately has less than 60 NBA games of experience and tape to go off of. So far he’s shown himself to be an elite and versatile man-to-man defender but the rest of his game leaves much to be desired. He’s got a non-existent ISO game and has trouble finishing around the rim against resistance.  People want to speculate on his value as a 3&amp;D type player when he’s extremely inconsistent as a perimeter threat. For example, first 4 games in December he lights it up and shoots 48% from 3 and scores 16PPG. Comes back down to earth in January shooting a respectable 35% from 3PT while averaging 12PPG in 14 games. Now 5 games into February he’s shooting 9% from 3PT and averaging 8PPG on 31% from the field.  What value does Dort have to an NBA team if he can’t consistently knock down 3’s? 3PT shooters still get paid. Lock down defenders that can’t shoot or score don’t even have roster spots most of the time.  I can’t blame Dort or his agent for taking a guaranteed deal for a permanent rotational spot on a developing team instead of betting possibly being on a two way G-League contract. Better to take the cash and pay the mortgage and take care of your family. Sometimes if you struggle and get sent down you never come back up to the NBA.  If he consistently shoots +35% from 3PT over the next two seasons? He will probably be in line for Danny Green type money @ around $15mil/yr when he’s 24/25 years old."
"Players typically don't get their rings until they return to the arena the following season. So whenever the Rockets come to Staples Center, he'll get his ring. That's why Danny Green still has yet to get his Toronto championship ring: the Lakers never went to Toronto last year, and of course, this year the Raptors aren't in Toronto."
Nobody else has said his name so I'll throw Danny Green out there
Wes Danny Green Matthews
"Danny Green earned his ring, and chose not to accept it until he visits Toronto (which he hasn't had a chance to due to the pandemic)"
And Danny green
danny green still aint get his 2019 ring.
The only SF in that list is Danny Green because Seth starts at SG. Also Harden too with Joe Harris starting at SG.
"Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, and a 1st, ring it up baby"
Danny Green guarded Harden for most of that series.
"i don't think Otto Porter makes sense at all. he can't play with both Simmons and Tobias, that's three power forwards i can't go through this again after last year. you would have to send out Danny Green just to match salary and i'd rather have him honestly.    i actually like Lonzo as an option, not the off the dribble creator we need but still high IQ guy and good passer, two things Sixers are lacking in. have no idea what his trade value is though and if/when you pay him the team would get very expensive and i'm not sure if he's worth it."
"That '14 Spurs team doesn't get the credit it deserves as truly revolutionary. Despite Pop's unfavorable view on the 3 point shooting revolution, that was the team that showed how it could be used to great effect to win a championship, and a lot of the Warriors 2015 success was built on a similar engine (with two even better shooters, Steph and Klay). The ball movements, the defensive switches and intensity (having peak Danny Green and an entering-prime Kawhi helped), and quick decisions with high-efficiency shooting were amazing. The '14 Spurs dismantled the Miami Heat with a surgical precision that hasn't been duplicated against a LeBron team (even the KD-led Warriors didn't have the same degree of dominance against the Cavs on a game-to-game basis)."
"&gt; What 3 records? The spurs were up 3-2 that game, it was game 6.    &gt;   1) Danny set a finals record for most 3s in the series.       2) Game 1 -- the one they won by a shot -- they set a finals record for lowest turnovers (4!!!) And if you remember the Heat team, that was  a *huge* deal. Their fast breaks were unstoppable, especially after a turn over. For perspective, the rest of the series looked like this: (4), 16, 16, 18, 18, 13, 14  --- that's 9 less than their next best game.      3) Game 3 - Finals record for most 3s in a game (16) with Green, Neal, Kawhi &amp; Parker being a combined 16 for 23. For perspective, as a team The Spurs averaged 21.5 *attempts* per game (making 8.1).  For the other games in the series they had: 7, 10, (16), 8, 9, 5, 6     I remember thinking, how are they playing this well. The Spurs aren't not that good.      &gt; Also why do you think the heat were so much better when they lost 14 and won a nail biter in 2013?     I know that they often talked about how trying to go for the 33 win-streak record (where they ended ~27) really really wore them down. It's why I though the Warriors going for 73 was a bad idea in 2016.  But the Spurs played so much better than they ever had, and even then they needed to set 3 different finals records to eek out 3 wins.  But the 2014 spurs were way better for 2 reasons: they were much more motivated and Kawhi was significantly better.  Conversely, 2013 was the last healthy year Wade ever played. His prime ended with that series. The next year he was a shell of himself (knee).  And it's not secret he was huge for the Heat.    In 2013, the best players (in order) were: Lebron, Wade/Duncan, Bosh, Kawhi, Manu, Parker.      In 2014 it was: Lebron, Kawhi, Duncan, Bosh, Manu, Wade/Parker"
"Because Doc Rivers knew that in a playoff series, he was gonna have to put Simmons on KD so he was seeing how Danny Green would be on Harden and he got clobbered"
I still want to see the 76ers play the fully healthy Nets. They have to put Ben on KD while Harden was feasting on Danny Green and keeping the Nets competitive for that half. I also didn't even mention Kyrie and how he didnt play that game either
"It’s ducking hilarious, especially games when Danny is on, or when Thybulle is in. Work really fucking hard to get a switch off Thybulle, just to turn into Ben. Reset offence, work really hard to get a switch, switch onto Green. Work really hard to create some space, drive, look up, embiids there. Try to pass out ‘oh no there goes Matisse with his stealing hands’"
"I guess my question is, do they have enough?  Let's assume you throw Ben on Harden.  Who do you throw on Kyrie?  Who do you throw on KD?  Philly has great defense but I don't think they have enough huge plus defenders to offset Harden, Kyrie, *and* Durant on the same team.  Teams can't just have plus defenders, like Danny Green just isn't good enough on defense to hang with Harden, Kyrie, *or* Durant despite being a plus defender."
"His defense is a different level, he took Harden completely out of the nets game not long ago while Danny Green was getting cooked"
Danny Green is actually going to win a third ring in a row with three different teams
I was honestly shocked at how much they were hiding him on Danny Green in the corner.
Point Danny green? LMAOO I wish I had caught that
The games where both Ben and Shake were out were an experience. Idk if you saw the point Danny Green game
He's being hidden on Danny Green and can't even give effort on one play when they get a switch.
Danny fucking green
"I think we have a chance. It's going to likely depend on Harris, Curry, Green. Are we going to get 6/8 from three Danny Green? Or are we going to get the 0/9 verison? If we get the 45% version of curry and the hot version of Icy Hot, we'll be really tough to beat. Ben, Jojo, Thubylle will be solid on defense no matter what."
"The stats posted were for the entire game, not when defended by Simmons. Quick example being Dame, he was 4/8 with 21 points on 9/9 from the line at half while being mostly guarded by Danny Green. He went 2/13 with 9 points and 5/6 from the line in the second half when he was being guarded by Simmons."
"Well Danny Green doesn't solve the ""scoring off the bench"" problem either. Just ask Sixers and Lakers fans. If you need a scoring sparkplug off the bench a man with the nickname ""Icey hot"" is probably not gonna be the answer."
"This is gonna be such a fun game. Luka vs Ben. Embiid vs 2-3 Mavericks, Seth vs Jrich in battle for who won the trade, Danny green vs Danny Green, Boban and Tobias reunion"
"Yeah. FWIW, from checking a couple of trade machines, it would cost Danny Green and Mike Scott + some more salary to match as well as draft compensation. For the Sixers, Lowry makes a tremendous amount of sense, but the question is whether or not they can find a way to provide the value that Toronto is looking for without giving up too much of their short-term future which they will need to have in order to contend."
"I don't even wanna trade Maxey for Lowry and Lowry is one of my favorite players. Lowry's 34 gonna be a 35 year old FA. I've been talking to raptors fans on here, they all have this expectation they're gonna get Maxey, Thybulle, and a 1st. Like no, I wouldn't even make those dudes available. You can't just liquidate all your futures when you have no cap space in the beginning of embiid and simmons primes. Who's gonna be on the sixers in two years if we trade for lowry?   Reality is because of the size of his expiring contract, his age, and his value to raptors it's a tall order to get a reasonable return. Like the sixers can't even just flip picks or prospect/prospects for him, danny green would have to be included. While not like an amazing player Danny green is like a pivotal rotation piece for us so we'd have a shorter bench as well. Love Lowry just don't see him coming here unless he forces it for an extreme discount."
"Clippers don't have any assets. Miami have a few assets but don't think they would trigger on him and Sixers will beat their offer. Lowry is from Philly and he would re-sign with them. Sixers can trade Danny Green, Maxey, Scott (if they want to) and 1st FRP for Lowry"
"Because the Raptors are going to work to send Lowry somewhere he wants to be. They aren't opening up a bidding war to maximize their return so this idea that they're going to get some king's ransom for Lowry is silly. Maxey, Danny Green + filler and a 1st seems like a reasonable return."
Also favorite to win FMVP for three games in 2013 Danny Green.
I would like Danny Green to be back in Toronto so we can work something out
"Maxey is waayyy more valuable than Nunn. Nunn will be 26 next season, he's likely in his final form as a bench spark plug. Maxey may have shown less, but he's over five years younger, that makes him more valuable. I think Precious/Maxey are basically on the same level, but Philly also have Thybulle, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz, and Shake Milton (who, notably, has been putting up numbers similar to Nunn while being two years younger.) Then there's picks: Miami has given up most of their picks in trades, Philly has most of theirs and a number of potentially valuable seconds (Knicks this year, most favorable of us/Hawks/Nets in 2023, Heat 2024.) Finally, as far as filler, Heat are giving up Iggy/Olynyk, whereas the 76ers are giving up Danny Green, Mike Scott, and one of Terrance Ferguson/Tony Bradley. Those last two are a wash, solely useful for being expiring, but IMO Danny Green is a better player than either Iggy or Olynyk, and can help the Raps retool while remaining competitive."
"Kawhi, Kyrie, Tatum, Danny Green, and Horford is a championship-level team in 2019 (assuming they deal Brown and Hayward for Kawhi and Green).  This year, though, no.  Not as much depth as that 2019 team with Rozier and Morris had."
"I am not sure why anyone thought otherwise. We went from jrich/horford/trash version of tobias/shake as our supporting cast for Embiid/Simmons, to all star tobi, seth, danny green, shake milton, dwight as a backup.      Meanwhile the celtics lost Hayward and the best player they got back is Tristan Thompson, Kemba is only getting worse and his playstyle doesn't complement the Jays. I had the sixers above Boston in my pre-season predictions, but I didn't predict the Celtics would be this bad... I'm not complaining though."
Who the fuck is Boston gonna play at center then? Also Boston needs playmaking not more defensive wings do they not?   Danny Green feels kinda redundant when you have the Jays.
"$30M is so high tho. youd have to start with danny green, maxey, and scott right?"
And what C do you think is available for Danny Green?
"Fair point, but then you only have Thybulle or Simmons as wing defenders and you lose the shooting that Green provided. Replacing Maxxey or shakes three point shooting with Lowry’s isnt as drastic as a drop as the Danny Green drop would be"
"Why would the Raptors accept this, Danny Green is a net negative at this point in his career and Maxey balled out exactly once this season because Doc let him play for 40 minutes.   May as well tank if they give up Lowry to an ECF contender."
If we get him then just give you might aswell just give us Danny Green and Siakam to round out the roster.
"Why has nobody mentioned shake Milton ? If he goes to philly that's who I would be looking for him and thybulle . Be hard to make the salaries work have to be Danny Green , mike Scott and Terrance Ferguson to even get close. Olynyk and Meyers Leonard have to go for Miami to get close too . I could see the Clippers in a three way trade Beverly Lou will and zubac ."
"No lie idk if they should get rid of Danny Green, Thybulle, Curry, etc even if they were getting Lowry. They desperately needed wing help last year and even though Danny isn’t a great shooter any more he’s still a good role player. I don’t know if they should mess that up. If they can manage to get another suitable wing and still get Lowry they should do it but otherwise you’re fixing one hole while making another hole."
"I have a hard time figuring out where the Sixers would come up with not only the money but a decent trade without moving Tisse or Maxey, which they apparently didn't want to do for Harden, so why would they do it for Lowry?  Would probably have to ~~shit~~ ship Danny Green too to afford it.  Edit - Must have been a Freudian slip"
Raptors receive Danny Green.  In compensation Sixers will receiver Danny's ring.
Oh yea Maxey and a first minimum. Plus you guys get Danny Green back!
"Danny Green and Mike Scott to make salaries match. Scott is basically filler, but Green has some value"
Chris Paul if he doesn’t get into coaching  Jimmy Butler has a great personality   Danny Green is well spoken and has played with legends  JJ redick has a great podcast and is a funny dude
Current BACK to BACK champion Danny Green
i mean if the other option is danny green tferg and scott theyre not really losing anything at all
 You forgetting about **3 time** NBA champion Danny Green coming to Tampa .  FIFY
Lol. Poor Danny Green is getting passed around like a blunt in a group smoke session. Gone a full circle. Lol
"Yea, well Danny Green can also play PG too. I watched him. It was a complete disaster and only happened because the Sixers had 7 guys, but he did it!"
You forgetting about NBA champion Danny Green coming to Tampa
Somebody get Danny green on the phone.  The one from the last two finals I mean
"I made a few other views from that list, looking at the top and bottom 5 from their list of 25 players:  +/- Per Game   ||NAME|GP|+/-|MPG|PTS|AST|Per Game| --:|:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|:--| |1|Stephen Curry|731| 4,759.0|34.3|17,378|4,821| 6.51| |2|Tim Duncan|1392| 8,910.0|34|26,496|4,225| 6.40| |3|Kawhi Leonard|550| 3,480.0|31.2|10,498|1,529| 6.33| |4|Klay Thompson|615| 3,676.0|33.1|11,995|1,416| 5.98| |5|Draymond Green|604| 3,462.0|28.2|5,325|3,089| 5.73| ||||||||| |21|Jason Kidd|1231| 3,868.0|36.1|15,259|10,701| 3.14| |22|Kobe Bryant|1346| 4,153.0|36.1|33,643|6,306| 3.09| |23|Ray Allen|1300| 3,491.0|35.6|24,505|4,361| 2.69| |24|Dwight Howard|1145| 2,991.0|33|18,815|1,602| 2.61| |25|Paul Pierce|1343| 3,345.0|34.2|26,397|4,708| 2.49|  How many points did a player score to generate +1?  ||NAME|GP|+/-|MPG|PTS|AST|Points Per| --:|:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|:--| |1|Kobe Bryant|1346| 4,153.0|36.1|33,643|6,306| 8.10| |2|Paul Pierce|1343| 3,345.0|34.2|26,397|4,708| 7.89| |3|Ray Allen|1300| 3,491.0|35.6|24,505|4,361| 7.02| |4|Russell Westbrook|900| 3,133.0|34.6|20,850|7,511| 6.65| |5|Dwight Howard|1145| 2,991.0|33|18,815|1,602| 6.29| |21|Tim Duncan|1392| 8,910.0|34|26,496|4,225| 2.97| |22|Derek Fisher|1287| 4,164.0|25.4|10,713|3,804| 2.57| |23|Manu Ginobili|1057| 5,468.0|25.4|14,043|4,001| 2.57| |24|Danny Green|720| 3,168.0|25.5|6,407|1,146| 2.02| |25|Draymond Green|604| 3,462.0|28.2|5,325|3,089| 1.54|   How many points + assists (assuming they all count for 2 points) did a player have to generate +1?  ||NAME|GP|+/-|MPG|PTS|AST|PRF Per| --:|:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|:--| |1|Russell Westbrook|900| 3,133.0|34.6|20,850|7,511| 11.45| |2|Kobe Bryant|1346| 4,153.0|36.1|33,643|6,306| 11.14| |3|Paul Pierce|1343| 3,345.0|34.2|26,397|4,708| 10.71| |4|Ray Allen|1300| 3,491.0|35.6|24,505|4,361| 9.52| |5|Jason Kidd|1231| 3,868.0|36.1|15,259|10,701| 9.48| |21|Manu Ginobili|1057| 5,468.0|25.4|14,043|4,001| 4.03| |22|Tim Duncan|1392| 8,910.0|34|26,496|4,225| 3.92| |23|Kawhi Leonard|550| 3,480.0|31.2|10,498|1,529| 3.90| |24|Draymond Green|604| 3,462.0|28.2|5,325|3,089| 3.32| |25|Danny Green|720| 3,168.0|25.5|6,407|1,146| 2.75|  Interesting that despite his career success, Kobe was so high on the scoring lists and so low on the per game list. Those lean post-Shaq years weren't great, but it actually looks like his last 3 seasons sunk him the most. Same story for Pierce, although for him it actually looks more like his early Celtics years sunk him."
Danny Green has been pretty bad defensively
I’d do it if I’m Philly. Losing Danny green would low key be a hard hit tho for this year. 3 and d is hard to replace
Eh they can get Maxey and a protected first from Morey. And Danny Green would have to be there for salary anyway
The laughing after the bank made me smile. I think Danny Green was giving him shit lol
"I'm all for firing Danny Ainge, but I think it's absurd that somehow Tatum and Brown are blameless according to green teamers. Their effort levels have been horrific over the past month, which is not acceptable considering they are supposed to be our franchise players.  Inb4 ""but roster bad"", as if other superstars don't deal with bad rosters. LeBron was single-handedly bringing a bunch of bad Cavs teams to the Playoffs and Finals. Kobe Bryant averaged 35 points a game to drag Kwame Brown, Smush Parker, and Chris Mihm to the Playoffs in the Western Conference. Hell, Julius Randle is dragging the Knicks to the same record as the Celtics, but somehow two All-Star players can't be bothered to play because the roster is bad? Get out of here.  There was nothing related to Xs and Os because last night was a disgraceful performance, and accountability has to start from the two All-Star players. I'm tired of hearing those two talk after every game about how they didn't play hard enough, do something about it instead of patting yourselves on the back."
"But it is much worse   Right now Rondo/Danny Green &gt;&gt;&gt; Schroeder/Wes Matthews   And Dwight/Javale &gt;&gt;&gt; Gasol  So their guard play took a hit, they no longer have a mobile center to come off the bench to spell AD, and as the cherry on top AD is injured  People have short memories. Lakers struggled during the season last year and had some games in the playoffs where their role players couldn’t hit the side of the barn.   Somehow the shooting got worse and the loss of Dwight/Javale is hurting them a lot more than anyone including myself thought it would   With how tough the West is this season, seeding is particularly important and it’s not looking good esp since it will be at least a month minimum before we see AD looking like himself again"
Dude get some rhythm before the game. Should I let Danny Green dribble in the 4th to get some rhythm?
Prime danny green was one of the 5 best defenders at his position in the NBA.
So basically prime Danny Green?
Your comment looks dumb af now danny green starting for the sixers in first place and those two other guys you mention are barely getting any playing time
trust me if Danny Green still here he will be about same as Matthews
wes matthews is the new danny green
I would rather have Danny Green back bricking 3’s than Wesley Matthews
#WES MATTHEWS SOMEHOW MORE WORSE THAN DANNY GREEN
"So Wesley is not getting any serious minutes in the playoffs. He gets easily blown by these days and he can't knock down even open 3 pointers. Which is concerning because he was supposed to be our Danny Green, who contributed to the title. So there is already an opening there. I have to assume we'll have to make a move for a good 3-and-D wing before the deadline to address this."
"Danny green, Mattise, Maxey, Scott and a Pick"
Dennis over Danny green was a huge upgrade.
Wesley Matthews is Danny Green 2.0
"Let him get 50, there always a JR or Danny Green to mess shit up"
Wes has a worse running gait than Danny Green which I didn't think was possible
"A team with two All-Stars manages to embarrass itself night after night.  But green teamers will plug their ears and shout ""Brad is a top 5 coach!"" ""We don't need Harden, we have Brown!"" ""Danny is a top 5 GM!"" until their faces are red.  It's time to face reality. Kyrie, Rozier, Hayward, and Horford all left because they all knew there was something rotten about this franchise at its core: Tatum, Brown, Smart, Brad Stevens, and Danny Ainge."
"It's a win trade considering the situation. Pop wasn't gonna give the Lakers another Superstar, and again, their offer for Kawhi at the time wasn't close to his value, specially after looking what they sent for AD. The best value of the trade was BI. Lonzo doesn't do much for us. We have enough guards. Josh Hart really isn't as valuable either.  &gt; Ingram at 21  Would have been nice, but Derozan has done his job as the first offensive option. The sole reason we struggled so much last year was having two of the worst defenders in the entire league taking so many minutes alongside Derozan, and we had lost DJ for a season. Plus, Ingram isn't a stud on defense as well. Derozan's job is offense and to facilitate, and he does that well. His defense struggle can be hidden by playing him as a Forward while he's alongside good defensive players. He has bought into the team, and it's also an awesome presence for our young unit. Derozan has saved us many games. He's far from perfect, but he isn't the main issue with our team.   &gt;Lonzo/1st round pick   Why have Lonzo when we have Derrick White and Dejounte? We got a first round pick from Toronto that turned into Big Body, and Jak fills that very much needed defensive anchor as Lamarcus has regressed a lot.  &gt; While giving away D Green  Danny was sent to match salary, and the dude was coming off a bad year. So you can very well say it was Danny for Jakob and Keldon, and both have turned out incredibly well. May not have been that good because we gave up our perimeter defense, but seeing how the team is with Keldon and Jakob, I'd say it was worth it in hindsight.  &gt;  Just doesn’t make any sense at the time and now  It made sense at the time. Kawhi tanked his value, and with the mystery surrounding his injury, no team was gonna give anything for a year rental. Lakers offered, but for a player like Kawhi, and them being conference rivals, it wasn't worth it. No matter what the team would have done, we would have been clowned, either for not falling for the ""godsend"" offer, or because we gifted the Lakers a free superteam In both situations, we were getting fleeced. People talk about how we could have gotten an AD-like haul or a PG-like, but that type of deal was never offered in the first place for us. Toronto was the team with the best offer, since Pop really wasn't gonna spend his last years in a rebuild, so we took that one. Toronto made the gamble with Kawhi and it paid off. We did made the playoffs with Derozan on his first year, and pushed the second seed Nuggets to 7, but last year we went to shit thanks to Marco and Bryn Forbes playing so goddam much. This season we are in a much better position for now. We were expected to be under 30 games for the season."
Danny Green had “Green Ranger Grapes” last year lol.  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nba-star-danny-green-partners-with-blanc-vineyards-to-encourage-kids-to-live-healthy-lifestyles-300940102.html
"Danny Green is not in any way the reason the Spurs, Raptors, or the Lakers won championships. He's a replaceable role player."
Ok so can we talk about Danny Green?
"Like Danny Green and Tyrese Maxey?  I'm not saying he'd be a godsend and the fact his dad is the coach factors in, but we could use another ball handler next to Shake and Curry in certain lineups."
"1) Does this account for the COVID games where we basically suited up 7 active players and lost two games by a combined 30 points? Not to mention Seth Curry has been struggling post COVID. He was shooting 50/50/90 prior to getting sick. Obviously the chances of sustaining that are low but the breathing issues have made him very hot/cold.   2) We will see, the Raptors team defense slowed him down. But can other teams replicate their strategy? Very few players/teams are capable of guarding him. It's really on Embiid's conditioning and focus.  3) I'm curious what the difference is when Embiid plays verse when he sits. I am worried about this over the season. We can not rely on Danny Green/Furkan Korkmaz to spread the floor as they are very streaky. Along with the aforementioned Seth Curry issues.   4) Doesn't matter, we're in the Eastern Conference. It's meaningless to say we would be fifth in the west cause we're not.   My main concerns about the Sixers (outside of Joel's health) are the streaky shooting and travel woes. Tobias needs to show up in the playoffs. We're hoping Daryl can add a secondary ball handler/playmaker."
Danny Green says be quite.
"&gt;“The only way you become untradeable, pretty much, is if you win a championship”  Tell that to Danny Green"
"But other guys don't have that, like KCP, Danny Green, Horton-Tucker..."
"Even if Kawhi was going to leave the year after in FA, then getting a haul of picks and a young player(s) would have been the better choice. Think about this. You got Demar (Older, poor spacing, team ratings are worse with him in), Jakob and a late first rounder and you  actually threw in a good player as well in Danny Green. You could have negotiated atleast another first rounder, a young player who would now be an all star, etc. I mean Kawhi a top 5 player in the league and Porzingis, Jrue Holiday, Harden, AD, Tobias, etc all got more assets lol"
"If that is the case, then getting a haul of picks and a young player would have been the better choice. Think about this.

"There's nothing especially wrong with that trade- 76ers would probably do Danny Green + Mike Scott + filler, because Curry has been so valuable to them and Simmons' size/versatility means you can run a Lowry/Simmons/Curry three guard lineup and be fine on defense. But I honestly think all the teams are happy with what they have: Lowry is playing well, Lonzo is playing well, the 76ers are playing well. Your trade makes sense on paper (Pels go young + cheap, Raptors go younger, 76ers go win-now), but I just don't see teams being that willing to shake things up."
LMAO wasn't no more reckless than what Danny Green did to Klay Thompson
Conversation where Danny Green blew Klay Thompson's ACL with the same play
What does that have to do with Danny Green blowing Klay Thompson's ACL
"Lol LeBron. Guy is +50000 on DK to win this award. Tied with other defensive stalwarts like Donate DiVicenzo, Danny Green and Kristaps Porzingus."
Danny Green
"Please take the goggles off and just go watch both of those plays. Simmons hits powell on the wrist and pulls his wrist through the arm of powell thereby grabbing him and causing him to lose balance in the air.   On Danny Green, they meet at the rim when klay is going from the side angle to two hand dunk. Danny Green connects with minor ball and lots of hand. Foul. But he does not drag his arms through the contact thereby grabbing Klay. Klat then lands awkwardly hylerextending his knee and tearing his ACL.   Like what are we doing here. 90 percent of all comments in this thread are saying flagrant, not intentional, reckless. At some point read the room and just admit you're wrong."
"Ah yes gotta love the ""Are you new here?"" argument. My favorite next to ""You never play basketball.""  If that's a flagrant the likes of Myles Turner and Giannis will be tossed out three times per game.  Were you calling for flagrants when Danny Green did this to Klay Thompson?"
Blaming Danny green for that is fucked up that was not a dirty play at all.  Shit on raptors fans all you want but Danny doesn’t deserve that
Were you there advocating for a Danny Green flagrant when he blew Klay Thompson's ACL? I'm sure you were.
"Danny green tbh, i remember him saying somewhere how he likes to not bring it down when he catches before shooting"
&gt;not to mention danny green caused klay to tear his ACL  I mean I kind of got what you were saying up until this point. Lmao. Cmon bruh.
&gt; not to mention danny green caused klay to tear his ACL  This is 10x the foul that Danny Green committed on Klay Thompson. Danny Green legit got ball and Klay just had an unlucky landing. If you're blaming him for the ACL tear you're absolutely delusional
you dont think MPJ starts over DANNY GREEN??
raps fans forgetting danny green blowing out Klays ACL
lol 80% of their fans were cheering when KD got injured and ryen russillo talked about how raps fans sending him death threats and threatening his family and shit.  not to mention danny green caused klay to tear his ACL
I mean you're acting like it's crazy but players get fucked up by botched chase-downs. It's how Danny Green took out Klay and how Terence Davis fucked up Jeremy Lamb. Not saying they should be banned but they can very easily end up in injury.
Danny Green was guarding FVV all night. Look at Fred's score vs. last game. And the second Fred got Green switched off him in the 4th he hit his first 3.
the only depth i know is the early grave that danny green late-game decision making will send me to
Give them a maxey Danny green filler and 1st fot Lowry if you want to trade him
"Danny Green for Kyle Lowry trade should happen ASAP, Danny was making big plays for the Raps down the stretch while Kyle did nothing tonight  On a serious note, can’t believe we won this game and took the season series against Toronto, I swear games agains them are never enjoyable tho for me even if we win"
This man Danny Green forgot what team he was playing for at the end
Sleeper Agent Danny Green almost got us back in it
"I mean, who knows maybe Danny Green doesn't shoot 1/10 again.  The bench has been playing well."
Ya but he’d be cheaper than Lowry and we could keep Danny green
I think this is the best comparison. Maybe not quite the defender as Danny Green though.
A Danny green on roids
Danny Green
1)Alex Caruso 2)tacko fall 3)kostas antetokounpo 4)Danny green
Just imagine the sixers if Danny green actually made threes sometimes
"They wouldn’t   The current Warriors have no front court at all.   You just need to stop their guards and the 2019 Raptors had a lot of great guard defenders: VanVleet, Norm Powell, Lowry, Kawhi, Danny Green  This hypothetical Warriors isn’t making it to the finals either"
do i hate the refs or danny green more
"So Danny green decided to reenact the 2013 finals against us, but against the knicks he’s 1-10 😐 icy hot back at it 😔😔😔"
"danny green is straight buttcheeks, idk any other player in the league where i randomly tune in a game and they are like 1-8 most of the time"
Danny Green what the fuck
I can't watch Danny Green tonight please god give him some rest
"Danny Green, for obvious reasons."
Hey we got Dennis for Danny Green and a pick!
"As a fan who has watched every game this is honestly amazing because our defensive looks straight ass at times. We replaced really good defensive players like Danny Green, Avery Bradley and two mediocre bigs in Dwight/JaVale with worse or equal defenders. Dennis, Mathews, Gasol and Montrezl have not looked like an improvement to me as a fan. Maybe blowing 4th quarter leads when we didn't all last year adds to this feeling. Not sure, but appreciate the stat."
"We are also a worse team. Replaced Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick for Danny Green and Seth Curry. Not as bad as losing Kawhi though, obviously"
"If you watch a lot of Mavs games you'd know this isn't true, casual fans just think he doesn't because most of the time the guys he passes to clank wide open shots he just created.  There's plenty of examples of Luka's clutch passing. Two examples that immediately spring to mind is he fed Brunson for a wide open dagger three earlier this season vs the Spurs: https://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=30762555  He also hit Dorian Finney-Smith for a go ahead three pointer versus the Lakers last year before Danny Green hit his three to force OT. Can't seem to find a video of that one.  Anyways, those are just two that immediately come to mind. The narrative that he doesn't pass in the clutch is false, he's always trying to make the right play just usually the best play to make is to call his own number."
"The Spurs have already had Stephen Jackson, Danny “you I know I had to do it one time” Green and Lonnie “Hitler is still alive” Walker"
"On the same contract, def Danny Green. For the price, though, Wes is better. Comparable defense with offense that's streaky (Danby's is better no doubt) but that you can win without"
"I could say it better, he’s the star version of danny green"
"I'm always on Danny Green train because I know when he's  cold on the shot, he never cold on his defense.  In fact, that was the big question in early season  ""Will Wes be able to replicate Danny's defensive ability though?"""
"Quick before the deadline,  trade Spida for Danny Green."
"he's like the most reliable open three in the NBA. if Danny Green shot like Joe Harris, his entire career would be different and people think of him as a good shooter. lol Joe Harris is a positionally sound defender, doesn't make dumb mistakes, and he finishes really well. if you uploaded Joe Harris's brain into Lonnie Walker's body, he'd be a full blown star, easily. lol I think Joe is as good a player as his talent level allows him to be.   I think guys often get called overrated if they aren't pushing their ceilings. that's why Tatum catches a lot of shit. theoretically his ceiling as a two way shot creator is about as high as it gets, so if he's ""only"" scoring on above average efficiency, people think he's overrated."
"Danny Green, though on Wesley Matthews money."
Danny Green shoots 6 threes a game at 38 percent. That's not bad at all.
"Yes Danny Green is much better than Matthews, but if we're including contracts than no since Schroder has been the Lakers third best player"
"The difference is Danny Green is a role player, while PG is making max money (and cost us 6 first rounders, I know it included Kawhi but still) and is taking up all our cap space.  If you're making max money, you just can't be this inconsistent especially when Kawhi only has another year or two of his prime left."
"Agreed, but that's how it goes. If Danny Green could shoot as reliably as Joe Harris, he wouldn't be Icy/Hot, and he'd be a much more valuable player. If PG was a game to game reliable scorer, hed move into the superstar tier, depending on what your definition is.  as it stands I think he's like the top guy in the highest level ""star"" tier."
Makes me miss Danny Green but at least we're not 15 mil deep with him.
"I think the same direction as before. Be a solid perennial playoff team. Maintain the culture, wait for the next disgruntled superstar and make a move. I like our core a lot. They're all roughly the same age, and on the same timeline contract wise. They also play the three main positions you need in order to build a contender, guard, wing, forward.   Flynn was our only frp in the past three years. We really need to reload. Our bench from the title run has become our starting lineup (minus siakam and lowry... And siakam didnt start till midway through the season), without reloading our bench with young guys. We've lost kawhi, Danny green, ibaka and gasol to free agency. Reload.  Trade Lowry for picks and assets.   Sniff the market for norm Powell trades. I'm not sure what his value is. I really want to keep him on, but I have no idea what his free agency ask is going to be. I'm sure the front office knows.   Might even look at trading Boucher, depending on what we could get for him. He only makes 7m so I'd imagine most contenders would pay a decent amount for him. That said, we developed him, he's Canadian, and I feel like we'd be doing him dirty by trading him."
"first guy i really saw do that was shane battier at duke and then carried into the nba.  it's great for when guys think there will be contact but then almost fall over when they don't hit the defender.  danny green was also really good at it for years, which is why he was probably the best i ever saw at breaking up a fastbreak before draymond (watch the 2013 finals, he's crazy good at it).  i would teach it to every defender.  same thing with draymond on 3-on-1 breaks.  he keeps giving ground without committing.  it forces the guy with the ball to eventually have to take a tough layup or make an awkward pass because you never commit to one action."
Can someone tell me how did the Lakers  get Schroeder for onky Danny Green and a late 1st round pick? It blows my mind.
Does he mean Danny Green knows what it takes? Cause none of these others dudes have been to the dance.
"I think his claims are mostly valid, but I loved the part where he included Danny Green dribbling when trying to show Steph’s defensive pressure as if it proves something"
If the Sixers win the title this year Danny Green should rightfully take the crown for Greatest of All Time
Danny Green still stops fastbreaks but mostly on offense and mostly because he missed a 3 pointer
"You do realize that Danny Green is the sole reason you’re even a contender? Without Green, the Raptors and Lakers can’t win a chip. He’s the secret power to a championship."
"Its all Roco's fault, better send him back to the sixers for Danny Green"
"Or a longer-term contract for a guy who isn't living up to it.  Obviously, there hasn't been a lot of time to grow disgruntled with the moves made in November, but things like OKC's acquisition of Al Horford plus assets for Danny Green and filler.  Now, obviously *some part of that* was compensation for Green, and some part was compensation for taking Horford.  I don't think we'd get a high 2nd and a future first in a LMA-for-bad-money swap. But perhaps one or the other might be in the cards."
lol that’s funny to hear coming from a Toronto fan. The fact is. Toronto never had a chance with it without them. Multiple miracles blessed y’all all at the same time. 1) Lebron out the East and out the playoffs 2) Pop mad at Leonard sent him as far away as possible and sent Danny Green with him 3.) Luckiest bounces of all time. 4.) The second best player in the world has a previously career ending injury. 5.) Y’all got rid of one of the top players ever in the modern league who refused to shoot 3’s lol
"John Salley was in the Bad Boy Pistons, 72-10 Bulls, and the Shaq-Kobe Lakers.   Danny Green was on the Duncan-Spurs, Kawhi/Raptors, and Lebron-Lakers.   Few other players that also come to mind as role players consistently on great teams (Kerr, Fisher,  Harper, James Jones)."
Nobody's doing shit against those three but Thybulle's going to at least make Kyrie/Harden work their ass off to get buckets. Certainly moreso than Evan Fournier or Danny Green.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoMqzDay6N0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoMqzDay6N0)  Kyrie was 6/21 with 14 points this game.
"Danny Green isn't filler for us. He's a very solid rotation piece that would get 30 minutes a game in the playoffs. Trading him and Thybulle is just too many playoff minutes out the door for Lowry to make up for.   It's Green, Scott, Maxey, and a 1st. If you aren't that high on Thybulle, then you should prefer that package anyway."
"Is it though?  - Danny Green is an expiring contract who didn’t re-sign with us the last time he was traded here  - Mike Scott is on a expiring contract and he’s averaging 4.4 points  - Matisse Thybulle is good defensively, but he’s averaging **3.7 points**  - Maxey looks nice at 20 averaging 7.7 points  Half of it looks like filler to me. I’m not necessarily opposed, but it’s not like the 76ers are giving up a ton either."
"When Danny green missed the 3, I think he and his girl were getting death threats, has that ever happpend to referees?"
"Considering danny green is one of the best corner 3 if not the best, he has a good mentor."
"Give me both plus Ennis. Add 3 rotation players in one shot.  Ross + Fournier + Ennis  For  2021 1st, 2023 2nd (we have a solid one), Danny Green, Mike Scott, Ferguson, Poirier  Orlando redirects Danny Green to a 3rd team for more compensation - ATL for Tony Snell?"
i don’t think i would trade maxey for either tbh. i would definitely include first (s...). ross could be had without trading danny green
"or fournier although he's expiring. another 2 years of ross with YoY descending salary would be niiiice.  what you think would you give up maxey for him? i doubt the magic would want maxey with fultz, but they could move him to someone for a pick i'm sure. i'd prefer doing something like that than giving up Danny Green. He takes and makes way too many corner 3's i don't think people understand how vital he is to our offense right now."
"Funniest thing is, Danny Green had a 3v1 fast break stop last night. I literally thought this was him"
"If you win the title this year, does that make Danny Green the GOAT? I hope he writes a book when he retires ""Danny Green and his years of pilgrimage""."
Danny Green is one of the GOAT fast break defenders
"Nah, I think Philly has that one in the bag. Although this season they seemed to have calmed down a bit.  Lakers fans are pretty bad too. Remember the death threats to Danny Green? Although it's hard to distinguish actual Lakers fans from Lebron fans. I'm starting to forget what the fanbase was like during the Kobe era..."
"This conversation is wild. The Raptors aren't going anywhere this year or in the foreseeable future. Thats facts. When healthy with a tight rotation they could probably steal a 4/5 series but that's about it.   The Sixers are not going to have success in the playoffs with Ben Simmons as their primary ball handler/second option. This is also facts. We've seen this with Giannis as well and Ben Simmons is very much a poor mans Giannis.  I think this Philly team as constructed will be a tough out in the 2nd round. Miami, Milwaukee, or Boston can definitely beat them. Indiana, or a even a healthy Toronto might be able to upset them as well but I think that's unlikely.   If you think Ben Simmons is better than Kyle Lowry, particularly in the playoffs, I don't really know what to say to you. Philly should be all in on Lowry, especially if they can somehow keep Thybulle and Danny Green.   Ben Simmons is a quality starter but he's definitely overrated. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Devin Booker is overrated and that dude is a flamethrower. Khris Middleton is overrated and he's a 50/40/90 guy. Overrated does not mean bad."
"First off, I want you guys to have Lowry. I like the Sixers. I think  Embiid is one of the best big men ever to touch a basketball. Danny Green is my boy and I'm a big fan of Tobias Harris. The Sixers logo with the bell is cool AF and I grew up on the VC/Iverson rivalry.  Secondly, Ben Simmons is ass. The mans averages are ass. He's a homeless mans Giannis and is probably the easiest ""star"" to plan for come playoff time. Once they can hide him behind Lowry, the Sixers will have a legit shot at a chip, until then, I don't think Philly gets out of the second round."
"Idk man, Embiid right now is comparable to KD, Steph is Steph and Simmons is better than draymond imo (love draymond tho)   Then you have Tobias and Danny Green and Seth Curry etc.. like that’s a really great bench too"
"You can tell who here doesn’t watch basketball, Danny Green has been an excellent transition defender most of his career"
"I feel pretty strongly he should be a guy who contends for all defense teams for a long time. He's like rookie Thybulle but he's a better dribbler and shooter and the gambles work a little more often with Devin. I thought maybe the danny Green comps were right but if you watched both guys play on this team, Devin is just clearly a more talented guy. He's got more athleticism, but in speed and hops, than I expected. I really think he can be a Middleton-esque player someday with a little drop on offense in exchange for insane defense and that's amazing for the 11th pick."
"In the past few years, Danny Green has been excellent in this. Don't know about now, hope 76ers fan can give testimony about this"
"He's getting better about it though, he got into foul trouble waaaaaay worse last year. I think by next year he will have a good enough instinct on not fouling, and if he's shooting over 35% from 3 he can be more valuable on the starting lineup than someone like danny green."
"and I know everyone forgot about him  because he was supposed to be the low ceiling guy, but Devin Vassell is fucking awesome. he's legit a defensive savant and shuts down off ball actions and he seemingly never gambles and loses. he's shooting 40% on 3s and he's shown more dribble and pull-up potential than Danny Green ever did, who is most scouts' comp for him. fights for rebounds, gets putbacks, passes better than I expected.  a Spurs rookie hasn't gotten minutes like him since Kawhi, and I'd be happy seeing him get even more. I am honestly really high on him. this class is really good, you didn't even mention Pat Williams on the Bulls."
The 2013-14 Clippers could've won the championship if they had a legitimately good 3&amp;D wing like Danny Green or Trevor Ariza.
When u stupid fucks kept saying you would rather have Danny Green than Derozan
"Danny Green can definitely stop a 3 on 1 fast break, but it requires him to blow out the opponent's ACL."
*dirty* danny green
"I mean seriously we started a game with Isaiah Joe, Tyrese Maxey, Dakota Mathias, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard with a bench of Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and supposedly Mike Scott I’m not sure why anyone is shocked that our differential is a bit off."
I don't think I know anyone else who can defend fast breaks as well as Danny Green
Tobias MVP campaign? Danny Green MVP?  Sixers fans the real MVPs?
They need another weapon though and Danny Green is known for choking in the playoffs lately
Danny Green against Spurs apparently
Would someone tell Danny Green that Spurs fans still hold him in high regard? It's the other guy that some Spurs don't like.
"Klay’s lower body got taken out too. It’s not a flagrant or anything, but Klay had zero major injuries prior to this and his injury was certainly caused from landing awkwardly from the foul. So obviously we’ll have a sour spot for Danny Green going forward"
"It's completely irresponsible and egotistical that Jaylen Brown chose to attend the All-Star game instead of resting his knee. It's clear the guy cares more about his image than actually winning. Mike Gorman was completely right about Brown playing for himself.  Jaylen Brown since February: 21/6/4.5, shooting 43/31/78 from the field, with 3.3 turnovers a game.  What happens when you combine an overrated player with a bum knee worse than Kemba's? You get the worst starter in the NBA.  Danny Ainge will regret not trading Brown for James Harden. The biggest mistake of his career. Green teamers will scream ""the future is bright"" until they are red in the face while we watch Kyrie lift another trophy before we do."
"For a moment I thought this may be a post about Danny Green, but then I applied my critical thinking skills"
spurs danny green did this all the time too
"Danny Green carrying us without Embiid, just like we all predicted"
When danny green becomes danny mean 😫
"danny green pushed klay mid air like a minute before that as well, he should have known better."
"I have full confidence.  We have fielded good teams through the draft and good trades.  When it comes to free agency - we get guys like DeMarre Carroll and it sets us back   When we trade we get guys like Kawhi, Ibaka, Danny Green. When we draft we get guys like DeMar, Siakam, OG. Undrafted we get guys like Fred and TD. The 905 gave us Boucher.  That's the shit that keeps us alive - we just need to ignore free agency because traditionally that shit ain't our bag"
Danny Green bout to be on both lists
off a bad push by Danny Green you mean
"When people compare  Embiid's defensive stats with Jokic, it seems like they forget that one of them is surrounded by defensive stalwarts such as Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, etc, and backed up by Dwight Howard, while the other has... Gary Harris. If he's healthy that is.. and is backed up by Hartenstein, or the #1 on the list JMG. When  perimeter defenders can't contain their players, the center will obviously have a hard time stopping 1 on 2s, or even 1 on 1 when dealing with quicker guards. It's not the same when you're defending the post against off balance guards due to good perimeter defense, and going 1 on 2 and having to choose between picking up a foul or not contesting a layup..."
"They only gave 1 FRP, and got danny green"
"Cus that single move for Danny green and kawhi made them go from second round exits to winning the chip and they didn’t sacrifice their future doing it either. They literally only gave up derozan, Poetl, and a pick."
*Danny Green enters the chat*
Danny Green averaged 5 made threes per game through the first five games of the 2013 NBA Finals. He’s has huge Finals moments for someone who is a 10 ppg career scorer
Fuck Danny Green for the 5 threes out of nowhere in Game 3 of the 2019 finals.   Still fucking pains me to this day
Here’s the thing. We’ve never had players that can shoot and also play defense and now with Danny green and Tobias being better at defense and Seth not being a turnstile our defense actually feels elite this year Even if numbers have said we are in recent years
Danny Green and the death threats he got say hi
also the whole Danny Green thing..
Does anyone thing Klay is more important? You could replace him with prime Danny Green and the Warriors would still be champions
Used to be danny green

"This one would be tough   But I feel like players need to learn to fall better   Like steph   Land and fall   eg  klay may have been able to save his leg even after getting mugged by Danny Green in mid air from behind if he headed to the floor knowing that he should eat the floor to reduce risk of catastrophic injury   And of course nba should protect players from those types of fouls but thats a diff story   As I said up top, not sure embiid could have really done anything in this situation, but I think its worth exploring."
Simmons or Tobi. Maybe Danny Green too.
"Wes Matthews +19, the guy really is a cheaper version of Danny Green."
"How long do you guys think it would take for people to start seriously take a ""good luck charm"" player seriously. Let's say Danny Green wins the next 6 championships with different teams without ever being a crucial player on the court do teams start paying him the max?!"
"What was the last team to win a championship that didn’t have Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, or James Jones on it?"
" I don’t think Danny Green would be the reason why the 76ers would win the championship.....  The reason would probably be Harden, Durant, and Kyrie breaking COVID protocol"
"Drummond and Harrell are not going to be good playoff players, that’s just the case for any post scoring big on offense who plays drop coverage on defense. The less Vogel plays them the better for the Lakers. Every minute either of them play, I will cheer.   At best, you can fit Harrell into a reserve role where he exclusively plays with Gasol off the bench for 12-15 mins of the game against the other teams bench where Gasol plays the 5 on defense and the 4 on offense and vice versa for Harrell, as Gasol can’t start and defend in space in PnR against some of these elite guards in the West. Drummond is an awful offensive player, it’s astonishing how bad he is at finishing at the rim considering his size and strength.   Gotta say as a Laker hater, I’m not really that worried about this year, as opposed to last. You replaced your high IQ role players who have played in countless playoff games and won championships in the case of Rondo and Danny Green in exchange for players who have mostly sucked in the playoffs like Schroder, like Harrell, Wes Matthews was also poor last year for the Bucks.   Lakers defense will be great, that’s obvious, it’s about whether they have enough 3-point shooting on offense to adequately spread the floor for LeBron on offense.   And there’s no stopping the Nets on offense, they are the most complete and diverse offensive team in NBA history. They are Vegas favorites to win the title and Vegas knows what they are doing with odds. The only thing that can stop the Nets from winning it all is injuries, because ultimately they have 3 stars and you have 2.   The only annoying thing about what is likely to be a Nets-Nuggets Finals is that LeBron will rethink the way he’s doing his roster and reemphasize offense in his supporting cast again like he did with those Cavs teams. As Stan Van Gundy said, it’s much more concerning as a team if you can’t put the ball in the basket as opposed to not being able to stop anybody."
"If anyone has the defensive personnel to stop them it's the Sixers You can put Simmons on KD, Danny Green on Harden and then Thybulle and George Hill take turns on Kyrie. Those aren't bad matchups.   They're gonna light it up regardless but I think the only team that has a shot to beat them through defense is Philly. The question is can they score enough to make it competitive."
I bet bugs will make it though.... I’m looking at you Danny Green
He took the Danny Green juju
Danny Green
Danny Green broke Klay Thompson... Big sad.
"Siakam, Gasol, Danny Green, FVV? Raptors in 6 lmao"
"Remove two of the top 3 players from any team along with important rotation players like Looney. And tell me. What team in the nba would stand a chance?   Seriously imagine if Kawhi, Lowry and Gasol went down. They would have a starting lineup of Vanfleet, Norman Powell, Danny Green, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. That team would get obliterated in a finals game.   Though i do agree that warriors roster construction wasn’t great especially when guys like Jeff Green or Luc Mbah amoute are signing for the vet minimum"
Thanks Danny Green!
"they don't want him to be danny green, they want him to do some dribbling and cause some disarray, he just hasn't really found a groove   can guard 1-3, can handle the ball, isn't useless on offense   they don't grow on trees"
One of the big problems with JRich is he’s done purposeless dribbles everywhere he’s gone in any context. He clearly identifies himself as a guy who can be a “bucket getter”. He has zero interest in being Danny Green  If he could just be  an A-/B+ at like 2 specific things instead of being C+ To C- at a million things it would be a lot better
"He did good, but offensively prefomences like that are weighed down by Kuzma shooting 31% from three, Caruso 28% from three, Danny Green 34% from three, and KCP who many say was phenomenal that run only shot about average at 37%. Although I am wrong though because they all did step up defensively which was very impressive"
"The raptors could have any single one of their players 1-9 pop off for 20+ btw, besides Danny, that's the reason they were so hard to play, any of their players is capable.  siakam also went 11-13 or something, for 30+ on Raymond green coverage so idk what ur saying...  &amp;#x200B;  The raptors also have the 2 best defensive centres, in recent NBA on their roster  1 DPOY, and 1 DPOY runner up..."
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
"The Spurs traded danny green and kawhi, who had barely played (9 games, 23 mpg) for Derozan and the Spurs won 1 more game than they did the previous season.  As with Kobe (who is probably the best tough shot maker of all time) his shot-making is not reflective of his overall value."
"AC Green, 3x champion with the Lakers  Danny Ainge, 2x champion with the Celtics and played on 2 other finals teams outside of the Celtics  Vlade Divac  Andre Iguodala for obvious reasons  Kermit Washington"
"Pop's bread and butter is elevating average players into looking really good. Remember Gary Neal, dejuan Blair, Tiago splitter and Danny green?"
"&gt; When considering the question of whether Duncan was a product of San Antonio, or not, we must look at his play for other teams. In his case, that requires going outside the NBA. When we do, we find that Duncan was not good, at all  Not really, you could actually just watch him play defense. Like you could literally watch him play over his 20 year Spurs career to determine whether he's an elite defender.  Tim Duncan has the most all-defensive teams of all time (nearly all of them won in the era when coaches voted for the award, not media members), so you're implying that you are in fact more knowledgeable than NBA coaches?  &gt; Similarly, what happened at Wake Forest?  You mean when he was the best college player in the world and was the unanimous #1 pick? He was so good in Wake Forest that he was the #1 pick.   &gt; What happened when Duncan had to play without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard? Even with Danny Green -- yet another All-defensive teammate -- those Spurs were mediocre. Why, exactly?  So Duncan deserves little of the credit when he was part of the very best defensive teams in the league but all of the blame when his team wasn't as elite? Terrible logic. Who's to say Duncan wasn't playing elite defense those years where his team wasn't an elite defense? And who's to say that just because Duncan had all-defensive teammates that Duncan himself wasn't also playing elite defense?  &gt; First of all, no one said anything about ""NBA"" previously. You said, several times, that Duncan was one of the greatest defenders ever, full stop. That's demonstrably not the case, which I just demonstrated. He's wildly overrated due to the success of his team -- which had more defensive talent than anyone has played with, in NBA history.  The NBA is the most talented basketball league in the world, so being the best in the NBA means you're the best in the world. Your feeling that Duncan is wildly overrated is just an opinion. To most people Duncan is a consensus top 10 player of all time.  &gt; Secondly, if Duncan was an elite defender in the NBA, why wasn't he anywhere else? Defense is typically a skill that translates well between teams and leagues. Why was an ""elite defender"" useless for Team USA? What happened during the summer of 1997 when a guy who couldn't get past the second round in the NCAA tournament allegedly became one of the greatest defenders of all-time?  The sample size of ""anywhere else"" is extremely small. You're referring to 3 games that team USA lost in 2004 as proof that Duncan was actually not an elite defender.   &gt; What happened during the summer of 1997 when a guy who couldn't get past the second round in the NCAA tournament allegedly became one of the greatest defenders of all-time?  You do realize that Tim Duncan was the consensus #1 pick in the draft right? He was an amazing defender in college which is why he was a major reason why he was the consensus #1 pick. His team not making it to the Final Four has no bearing on whether he individually was an elite defender or not."
"&gt;There doesn't have to be a conspiracy to suggest that media and sportswriters often fail to understand defensive impact well enough to accurately determine who is the best defender of the season.   And somehow this only effects Tim Duncan?  Not, for example, Bowen and 3 Spurs who did win DPOY?  &gt;Yikes, I do hope you realize how embarassing it is to to try to make an argument that Tim Duncan actually wasn't an elite defender in his entire NBA career because of a few specific games in the 2004 Olympics.  When considering the question of whether Duncan was a product of San Antonio, or not, we must look at his play for other teams.  In his case, that requires going outside the NBA.  When we do, we find that Duncan was not good, at all.  What is your excuse for prime Tim Duncan being utterly unable to do anything to even slow down those Olympic teams?  Your claim is that he, and he alone, constitutes a nearly impenetrable defense, right?  What happened?  Similarly, what happened at Wake Forest?  An actual NBA great would not have those results, and literally no one else who is allegedly in that group, does.  What happened when Duncan had to play without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard?  Even with Danny Green -- yet another All-defensive teammate -- those Spurs were mediocre.  Why, exactly?  Where did his ""impact"" disappear to?  Did Bowen take it with him when he retired?  Apparently so.  &gt; With that sort of logic Kobe Bryant is actually a terrible NBA player because he shot 38% from the field in 5 games in the 2004 Finals.   Well, Bryant is also overrated due to his teams' success.  That said, you are picking 5 games from well-over a thousand for Bryant, which is quite a bit different from looking at substantially all of Duncan's games played for teams other than San Antonio.  &gt; I do hope you realize again how embarassing it is to try to make the argument that Tim Duncan actually wasn't an elite defender in his NBA career because of what he didn't accomplish in college.   First of all, no one said anything about ""NBA"" previously.  You said, several times, that Duncan was one of the greatest defenders ever, full stop.  That's demonstrably not the case, which I just demonstrated.  He's wildly overrated due to the success of his team -- which had more defensive talent than anyone has played with, in NBA history.  Secondly, if Duncan was an elite defender in the NBA, why wasn't he anywhere else?  Defense is typically a skill that translates well between teams and leagues.  Why was an ""elite defender"" useless for Team USA?  What happened during the summer of 1997 when a guy who couldn't get past the second round in the NCAA tournament allegedly became one of the greatest defenders of all-time?  See, guys who were not even great NBA defenders, like say Patrick Ewing, took their teams to the Final Four repeatedly.  Why, exactly, is Duncan the only alleged NBA great to play four years of major college ball, and never even sniff the Final Four?  Duncan's record outside San Antonio is, as I said, frankly terrible.  Making it fairly obvious that his record with San Antonio is more about them, than it is him.  He was lucky enough to get drafted by a multiple-time 60-win team that already had one of the greatest centers ever to play in the NBA, and he rode that team, and others, to the reputation he has, but does not deserve."
"If Nuggets lose, Barton gonna get that Danny Green treatment"
"I caught the Sixers/Lakers game and they put a tweet up that said ""Of course Danny Green is gonna shoot 175% tonight"""
danny green and dwight literally the chris long n lagarette blount of the team
Of course Marv confuses Danny Green with Seth Curry. Danny only had 3 threes.
"""Danny Green"" is damn close to ""Dancing Queen"" phonetically"
Danny Green.
So prime Danny Green?
Danny Can’t Green
I can understand that 100%. But I mean I meant it literally. I read takes that Kyle Lowry was not an upgrade over Danny Green.
Danny icy hot green
What's crazier is the takes i've seen that he's not an upgrade over Danny Green.  Danny. Motherfucking. Green. (love the guy but still *wtf*)
he's more like a future danny green with a scorers mentality
"In addition to the rule changes people are talking about, generally speaking, I don't think guys were that much better at defense in those days, but most teams had at least one defensive specialist on the court at all times.  Better personnel made defenses better but offenses slightly worse.      Most of the time this was a big man.  Somebody like Bo Outlaw or maybe Antonio Davis, Theo Ratliff.  Lot of big centers who couldn't do much besides stick their arms up in the arm and take up space, and lot of PFs who were big and strong but unskilled on offense.  There were also defensive guards which would seem pretty crazy to have in this day and age e.g. Doug Christie, a man who couldn't dribble and could barely shoot was playing SG because he was an awesome defender.  Now, that player is Danny Green, who can actually shoot.      Some teams even had ""defensive point guards"" which was mostly just code for a short guy who couldn't shoot.  I can't think of a particular example at the moment.  Maybe Jamaal Tinsley?  idk      Anyway, bottom line is that the personnel was a lot different and you had guys on the court who would never see the light of day in 2021 because of their lack of offense.  Reggie Evans is kind of the human embodiment of this."
hi danny green
"A mix between peak Pandemic P, and Danny Green in the playoffs last year. I cannot hit a open shot for the life of me."
They'd be in the same situation with Danny Green on the roster. Rock and a hard place.
"2014 Champion San Antono Spurs: Bellinelli- Italy, Splitter- Brazil, Mills &amp; Baynes - Australia, Parker &amp; Diaw- France, Tim Duncan - Virgin Islands, Manu Ginobili - Argentina, Cory Joseph - Canada, Danny Green &amp; Kawhi Leonard - USA,  8 Countries"
I'm happy he passed on the extension. We should have just kept Danny Green and Rondo. Then if we got Drummond that a championship team.
"I don't how anyone can't call that Toronto team a super team. I get kawhi left. But they had a top 3 player in that postseason on kawhi. 2 other all-stars. Serge Ibaka who is a great defender, Marc Gasol who was all-defensive calibre. Fvv who was a 6th man of the year candidate. Norman Powell who was an efficient 10ppg. Danny Green who was still a great defender and whilst inconsistent is an experienced head. OG had great defence and good 3ot shooting.  They literally had 4 all-defensive calibre players and like 5 other high end role players. To me that is the definition of a super team.  If you look at those players now, norm and Fvv have developed into borderline all-stars. Siakim one year after was having an all-nba campaign before getting injured and covid."
Did you forget what *your fans* did to Danny Green
Your fanbase sent death threats to Danny Green for missing that game winning three
Danny Green
"&gt;People are more than willing to work with Presti.  Reminds me of when he everyone was wondering why he gave Danny Green back in the Horford trade.  Definitely seemed like Presti wanted to play nice with the 6ers.  I guess the Oubre trade with the Warriors was pretty 'fair' too.    Given how much interest Oubre had at the deadline, Presti probably could have gotten better than a late 1st (cuz protections) by holding on to him."
"&gt; I mean this sincerely but your context is shorted and intentionally fit to a narrative to wash away so much of 02-07 because of Bowen’s presence on the team.  See my additional comments for details, but to sum up, Bowen finished in second-place for DPOY in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  He also finished ahead of Duncan in 2004, and 2008.  Duncan only led the Spurs in DPOY votes 6 times in his entire career, and just barely over Robinson in one of those cases.  One two more occasions, Duncan was 14 and 17th, but the top Spur.  &gt; Most misleading from 02-07 as they were seasons Duncan was in argument for the best defensive player in the league every season.   No, he wasn't, and not even close.  He wasn't considered the best defender on the Spurs in five of those seasons.  There's a very strong argument that Duncan is no better than the 4th-best defender in recent San Antonio history -- behind Robinson, Leonard, and Bowen at least.  &gt; Robinson and Leonard did not anchor #1 defenses outside of their prime.    One can definitely argue that Robinson did.  In 1999, Robinson was past his prime, and was the top DPOY-vote-getter on the top-ranked Spurs.    &gt; Danny Green in 2017 was still closer to 02-07 Bowen than Bowen was to Duncan or Robinson in their defensive prime.   This is factually impossible.  Bowen was 2nd for DPOY 3 consecutive seasons.  Duncan never achieved that at any point in his career.  I'm afraid that you are just way too uninformed to be making pronouncements such as those in this comment.  Seriously, go back and look at the data.  Use my other comments for reference, if need be.  You are wildly overstating Duncan's accomplishments, and understating his teammates'."
"I see your point, but what if Brett Brown was such dog shit that any replacement was gonna get solid results from adding Maxey, Curry, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard while Embiid was putting up MVP season. Coaches can only really be judged through playoff success anyway so Doc's run with the Sixers is still a question mark, I remember when Bucks fans loved Bud lol"
"For the regular season, sure, they give you more offense.   But they are much, much worse for the playoffs than Rondo and Dwight. Playoff Rondo is very much a thing, and Dwight was a former DPOY that bought into his role and was still very effective.   The 2 best offseason pickups for the Lakers this year were actually Gasol and Wes Matthews in terms of viability in the playoffs.   If Marc Gasol was 3 years younger, none of this would matter, as he would solve so many problems for them, but unfortunately for the Lakers, seems like he's complete toast. Likewise with Wes Matthews whose declined pretty heavily as an offensive player and cannot replace the 3-point shooting threat that Danny Green gave them."
"Nets yeah, but uhhh why not the Lakers? Lakers are worse than last year and that series was pretty competitive outside of Game 1.   You had a 113.5 Offensive Rating against their elite defense last year, and now you've improved on offense with MPJ getting significantly better giving you a legit 3rd guy, and a big reason the ORating was so low was because Jokic was constantly in foul trouble.   Lakers center rotation is absolutely fucked. We've already established that Harrell has no hope vs. Jokic, but the Lakers need his scoring on offense, which is a problem. We've already established that whilst Marc Gasol has the best chance of defending Jokic, he's incredibly slow and will be BBQ chicken in the PnR for an elite scoring guard like Murray.   They are going to ask a lot of Drummond in that series, in theory he can defend Jokic in the post, has the mobility to get out on the perimeter to Jokic's pick and pops, and can hurt the Nuggets on the offensive glass with his offensive rebounds, like Dwight was able to do. But he is an *atrocious* offensive player, and he will really inhibit the Lakers offense with how poor he is finishing at the rim and how he mucks up the paint and inhibits LeBron's space for what is an already a poor 3-point shooting team.   Rondo was also huge in that series and they no longer have him, he randomly shot well on 3s in that series and gave the Lakers a secondary playmaker who could let LeBron rest off ball and make it easier for AD. They don't really have that anymore as whilst Schroder is a superior scorer, he's one of the worst passing starting PGs of anyone in the league. They lack that secondary playmaker that was so vital for them last year.   I'm not saying the Lakers suck or anything, they're clearly still an awesome team, in large part because they have 2 amazing players, but they're not *unbeatable*, and I think they are significantly worse than the team that walked to the title last year, in part because they replaced their high IQ, saavy veteran players (Rondo, Danny Rings, Dwight) with low IQ, stats-first players (Schroder, Harrell, Drummond). Wes Matthews was a good pickup to replace Danny Green, but he's absolute cheeks on offense."
"Doc is amazing at handling his stars so Harris doing better is no surprise to me. The most credit for your current season however goes to Morey who bought in Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey. Also, Dwight and of course the GOAT Danny Green.  Also, Embiid was a different beast than any other year, he personally elevated his game a bunch and i dont know how much credit Doc gets there."
"Ben Simmons wasnt a DPOY contender, embiid wasnt an MVP contender, Danny Green looked like garbage on the Lakers..."
"I would never trade the title we won, but man, losing guys who loved the team, city, and country like Demar and now Norm.. seeing the team in shambles right now, probably losing Kyle in the offseason, mercenary Kawhi bailing after the one year with Danny Green, losing Gasol/Ibaka in the same offseason..  It all feels a bit like a Faustian bargain and makes me strangely uncomfortable."
It’s amazing. Do people crown Danny green because he has more rings than kawhi or Giannis? Fuck no. He’s still a role player that chased rings. I wish the “ legacy” discussion moved away from rings.
"The years without Bowen Robinson and Kawhi were the worst seasons of Duncan’s career and more importantly the worst defensive rosters beside him for his career. Danny Green also played less than 100 minutes in 09-10 so his inclusion is also misleading.  Duncan’s defensive prime from 02-07 also featured one of the best perimeter defenders of all time in Bowen. The same was true with his 98-01 years with one of the best defensive players of all time and his late prime years of 12-15. I mean this sincerely but your context is shorted and intentionally fit to a narrative to wash away so much of 02-07 because of Bowen’s presence on the team. Most misleading from 02-07 as they were seasons Duncan was in argument for the best defensive player in the league every season. Even still, in his late career resurgence (12-15) and early years (98-01) he was one of the best and one of the very few best defenders in the league respectively. Your point would be better made on this seasons when Duncan was not obviously the best defender on his team. 98-01 Robinson was still one off the best defensive players in NBA history and Kawhi from 12-15 seriously challenged Duncan for best defender on the team if Kawhi wasn’t straight up the best defender on the team those latter few years.  If I was explaining to my 6 year old niece that the years without Robinson Bowen and Leonard the Spurs still had Duncan but didn’t vie for the best defense in the NBA, I could see why she should at first think those seasons were more indicative of Duncan’s defensive value. That wouldn’t be acknowledging the Spurs had the worst defensive rosters of Duncan’s career; even ignoring Duncan’s place on the team. Duncan himself was in the midst of his worst defensive years in which he still hadn’t cut the weight he eventually did to re-gain mobility at the expense of the weight he used to enjoy using to displace guys on offense and root himself to the ground defensively.   Robinson and Leonard did not anchor #1 defenses outside of their prime. Duncan was given the chance to anchor a defense without one of the best defensive players ever during his worst years with his weakest defensive rosters and produced top 10 defenses rather than anything challenging for best in the league. Kawhi still had an elite defensive roster in 2017 even if he didn’t have someone quite at Duncan and Robinson’s level. Danny Green in 2017 was still closer to 02-07 Bowen than Bowen was to Duncan or Robinson in their defensive prime.  Just because Duncan’s defensive prime came with Bowen is not reason to think his years without any of Bowen Robinson and Leonard were more indicative of his play than his seasons with one of them. Duncan never touched his prime defensive impact after 2007.  Anyone watching the NBA can acknowledge Duncan played with some of the best defensive players and rosters of all time and it boosted the team’s defensive efficiency. Overemphasizing the team’s results outside of Duncan’s prime, and with the worst defensive roster of his careers. is not more indicative of his value than looking at his actual defensive prime.  Nor is it fitting to compare him to guys who anchored #1 defenses in their **prime** like Robinson and Leonard. Leonard still had one of the best defensive rosters in the league around him after Duncan retired (Tim was washed in the 2016 calendar year) and was in his prime. Robinson is one of a few guys who may be better defenders than Duncan all time and anchored a #1 defense in his mid 20’s. Duncan’s prime defensive years and ones to focus on his impact are 02-07 and Bowen’s inclusion on those teams should not seriously distort your view of Duncan’s impact nor lead you to believe looking at his post-prime years, the worst of his career and worst defensive supporting casts of his career, is more indicative of his value. Context can of course be applied that in Duncan’s prime he played with one of the best defensive players ever (98-01) and then one of the best perimeter defenders of all time (02-07) but you supplied much more misleading context than that alone."
"Agreed. Although, I'm not sure the Sixers are better now. Its roughly the same lineup, except instead of JJ Reddick and Butler they have Seth Curry and Danny Green. The former was a better team, imo."
"&gt; Comment has been edited now that I can see the data. &gt;  &gt;   Not really, your comment again shows an embarrassing lack of understanding how adjusting for league average works. League offense being bad that year is already adjusted for.  And ""minimally"" better than the Pistons as if those Pistons weren't also one of the greatest defenses teams of all time? Holy hell how could one person be so dense lmao.  &gt; fact is that without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard, Duncan's Spurs were unremarkable defensively -- even with Danny Green ( and Popovich )  LMFAO ""if you remove all the years were Duncan led the very best defenses, his defense is actually not elite"". What an embarassment of an ""argument"".   &gt; Out of curiosity, do you know what else happened in 2004? Duncan became the first, and to-date only, American NBA center to not win a gold medal at the Olympics.  LMFAO and now he's gone off the deep end talking about the Olympics. Oh man this is even more hilarious.  &gt; Conveniently avoiding any years without an All-defensive teammate.  Its convenient that Tim Duncan's age was 22 to 32 in that time frame? Alright then, I've wasted enough time on this clown, it's pretty clear that you know absolutely nothing about basketball."
"So how does basketball discussion look in your mind?  Person 1:""Danny Green sure had shitty game last night, if Heat were better man could have cost us a championship""  Person 2:""setting up multiple generations of your family and giving them opportunities that might never have existed is worth more than a ring""  Person 1:""????"""
"&gt;Not my fault you couldn't figure out the website. Higher Drtng+ is better.  Tableau wasn't working when I first pulled it up, but I tried again.  As I said, I had questions about their method when I saw the Nuggets on top.  Comment has been edited now that I can see the data.  &gt; If you think Bowen is a better defender than Duncan you know even less than I thought.   Which isn't what I said.  The inconvenient -- for you -- fact is that without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard, Duncan's Spurs were unremarkable defensively -- even with Danny Green ( and Popovich ).  Robinson was better without any of those players, or Popovich.  Which is why Robinson won DPOY and Duncan never came particularly close.  &gt;And 1998-2008 is Duncan's prime.   Conveniently avoiding any years without an All-defensive teammate.  Out of curiosity, do you know what else happened in 2004?  Duncan became the first, and to-date only, American NBA center to not win a gold medal at the Olympics.  He even participated in the US' greatest Olympic embarrassment yet, that 19-point loss to Puerto Rico.  What happened there?  Why couldn't Duncan defend those guys?  Or Lithuania and Argentina, who also beat the US that year?  Also convenient that Duncan's prime starts immediately when he joins up with Robinson, and not, for example, six months earlier when he and Wake Forest were excused from the NCAA tournament in the second round by Tim Young, Brevin Knight, and their Stanford teammates.  Making Duncan the only alleged NBA great to play four years of major college basketball without making the Final Four, and not even coming close.  What happened in the summer of 1997 that allegedly turned Duncan from the guy who had more turnovers than field goals against Tim Young and Pete van Elswyk into a prime NBA great?  Oh yeah, he started playing alongside David Robinson, that's what happened."
Danny green the most
"I still absolutely love Hart, he’s going to have a great career. I see him being a Danny Green/Pat Bev hybrid type player who rebounds.  A Gritty junk yard dog who’s all hustle and heart. Every single team would love to have a player like Hart on their team."
"&gt; Absolute abomination that Duncan never won DPOY.   Quite a bit of context is missing here.  Duncan is also one of extremely few players\* to play with two different DPOY -- Robinson and Leonard -- plus 8-time All-defensive Bruce Bowen.  Without one of those three as a teammate, Duncan anchored Spurs' defenses rated 8th, 10th, and 11th, which is very unremarkable.  For two of those seasons Duncan also had Danny Green, another all-D teammate.  \*LeBron James has played with Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, and Marc Gasol, obviously, but none were close to DPOY level at that time.  A few other Spurs also played with David Robinson and Dennis Rodman, but Rodman was years' removed from that level of play/sanity.  Some 2020 Clippers played with Leonard and Joakim Noah -- the latter for 5 games.  That's how rare Duncan's defensive teammates are, which should be taken into account.  &gt; also shows that even as a 40 year old and after declining that the Big Fundamental was still great on defense.   Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated Spurs' defenses without Duncan.  Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th, as noted above.  &gt; including the greatest defensive rating in the modern era (2004)   Not coincidentally, in the second-lowest scoring season in the modern era.  Crediting Duncan for that, is disingenuous to the extreme.  His defense is wildly overrated."
Yeah wtf. He should be taking more than danny green for sure
"&gt;between AD/Lebron you're not getting meaningful cap space to retool role players.   What?  The Nets did exactly this.  Also, with LeBron aging, he probably isn't going to ask for a max by then, especially if it allows them to sign another star.  There isn't reports of LeBron recruiting Steph Curry b/c it's impossible to sign him in a couple years.  Having two max players (AD, someone like Steph) and another star making a little bit less is easy to do with proper planning.  I read that the Lakers planned out their cap situation to sign multiple stars, that eventually got them LeBron and almost Paul George, years in advance.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Lakers during Shaq/kobe couldn't   I didn't follow the team at the time, but to my understanding, some of their side players were good, better than this team, in particular Robert Horry playing like an all-star in the playoffs.    &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Heat lost/broke up because wade dropped and their role players were crap. It wasn't anything about overpaying, it's just hard to get someone like danny green or old school robert horry on a min deal.  I cited LeBron's second Cavs iteration, not the Heat.  The Heat situation was more about bad luck with health.  The other major component to my case for not giving Schroder a long-term deal is that we should still be a major championship contender in a couple years due to LeBron and AD alone, =and= LA is still one of the most desirable cities for a star.  So it's even a little different from LeBron's second Cavs iteration in that LA is inherently much more a gravity well for star free agents than Cleveland.  By all means over-pay Schroder a bit until LeBron's contract runs up, to keep him, but it's a pretty good bet that someone better than Schroder will want to join us after that.  As a long-time LeBron stan, I really don't want to see this team eventually turn into Isaiah Thomas Cavs 2.0."
Danny Green walk like he got plantar fasciitis in his feet
"between AD/Lebron you're not getting meaningful cap space to retool role players. No championship team retools role players with cap space. The warriors had the 2016 cap rise to get them KD. Michaels bull's had 2 years with baseball to retool. Lakers during Shaq/kobe couldn't and used mid level/min to get payton/malone.   Heat lost/broke up because wade dropped and their role players were crap. It wasn't anything about overpaying, it's just hard to get someone like danny green or old school robert horry on a min deal."
Should have kept Danny Green.
"i think the sixers could use another perimeter scorer, but tbh, if the nets didn't have all three guys i'd feel pretty confident about our chances. if we had this team last year, things would've been better lol  though saying simmons is just a better danny green is weird. other than being good perimeter defenders, their skillsets don't overlap at all..."
"harrell and drummond are both way better than any of the players you just named though...  as evidenced by the fact that they are going to get paid more this summer  if they were just mins like those guys you mentioned, the lakers could obviously competitively have a chance to keep them  (I include danny green as a ""min"" because I think that'll be the ball park of his new contract. at most maybe the room)"
"They're 'key' players in the same way Dwight, Javale, Avery Bradley, and Danny Green were. They can all be replaced relatively easily."
"&gt;For example, replace WB with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Gallinari, are the Wizards better?  No, absolutely not lol"
Who's guarding harden then lol Danny green?
"But compared to Danny Green cmon. Robert Horry was never considered the best perimeter defender in his team. And if you look at their playoff stats, they both averaged 8ppg but with better shooting from Green."
Danny Green is this era’s Robert Horry lol
As long as Danny Green is shooting at a good clip sure why not
so seth curry and danny green
"2012-2015 Spurs Danny Green is legit one of my favorite players ever. Deadly from 3, and one of the best perimeter defenders in the league."
"As always, when someone says ""without him"" they don't mean his sudden disappearance from the face of the earth. But, if WB is gone then his cap space is gone too. So if you put in $40 million worth of replacement-level players *instead of* Westbrook, are they better?  For example, replace WB with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Gallinari, are the Wizards better?"
If CP3 had been with Danny Green he would have 3 rings.
Danny Green &gt; MJ.  Can't change my mind.
You do realise nobody is actually suggesting Danny Green is the goat right?
Robert Horry &gt; Danny Green
Danny Green was told he was going to get moved as well.
Future ring chasers better do their best to join Danny Green in whatever team he decides to make champion next.
"Lakers fans are dumb af the pass to Green wasnt even clean, he had to move sidewards, didnt even catch ir cleanly, had to slap it then grab it and the reason for that is LeBron wanted to hit the shot so he drove but the heat packed the paint so he clutched it, realised he wasnt gonna get the layup so threw out a pass, and you just expected danny green to clean up lebrons mess, if lebrons drove and passed straight away danny is ready and the pass would be a lot cleaner, go watch the play and tell me I'm wrong"
"Danny green said this at the beginning for this year  ""i am a back to back champion, its up to the 76er to do the right things"""
"yeah cos he'd rather keep a rep as a tough  dealer for when he leaves next year, rather than take a balanced trade. But since then it's been ""Bless up Masai"" cos Danny green is playing lights out, lowry hasn't, and we get to keep all our assets."
"Raps is an interesting one. Because they didn’t lose everyone, they lost Kawhi and Danny Green mostly. Finished a second seed last year. It’s only this year it all went to hell when serge and gasol left and they tried to use Baynes as a primary big (which as a raps fan second to the heat was miserable to watch) that it really went to hell"
If Danny Green wins a championship with Ben Simmons as his backcourt mate he's a Hall of Famer.
"What about siakam,lowry,og,gasol,danny green,ibaka in toronto and pg,bev,ibaka in clippers?   This year warriors with no elite defender is top 5 in defense (not sure now but should be around there) clippers is like 15ish."
Danny green did the same thing to Rj last week
Smdh Danny Green would have eaten his first Wendy's frosty rt in the restaurant. The Absolute disrespect to the legend and the game itself.
And it's not like he hasn't actually contributed to each one. Like Danny green helped earn each of those rings.
"That's what makes people remember him, that doesn't make him a better player.  I think most coaches would prefer Danny due to the fact that he will have a better impact over the course of an entire season.  Danny Green has also hit his fair share of huge shots in the playoffs but most of this sub doesn't even remember Spurs Danny Green.    Regardless, Danny Green is 100% good enough that it's ridiculous to say he ain't got shit on Robert Horry."
"Why not?  Only one of them has ever made any ""all-nba"" type teams and that was Danny making all-defense (and getting votes many years).    Danny has been a starter for WAY more games than Horry.  658 starts vs 480.  On his career, Horry averaged 7/5/2 on 42/34/73 splits.  Danny averages 9/4/2 on 42/41/71 splits.  He's been a starter on 3 different championship teams, Horry was a starter on zero.  Horry's career high in ppg was 12.0, Danny's is 11.7  Horry is certainly has a better list of game-winning buckets, but saying ""Green ain't got shit on big shot bob"" just doesn't mesh with their actual impact on the court.  Danny Green also has many more years of ranking very high in advanced stats.    I honestly would definitely rank Danny Green above Horry on the all-time ladder, personally.  There's a reason every team that thinks they have a shot at a ring wants him as their starting 2 and has for a decade, haha"
"I completely disagree that he is a ""very poor man's Robert Horry"". I love them both, and I'm not saying Green could hit the shots Horry did, but Danny did a lot of stuff (For the Spurs at least) that Horry couldn't. It's too hard to compare them given how different they are as players, but I would say their contribution to championship basketball is pretty comparable."
"Raptors didn't win a championship. Danny Green joins team. Raptors win a championship. Danny Green leaves team. Raptors did not win a championship. That is 100% correlation,  according to the data."
Danny green is the missing piece
They played different positions and had different roles.  Robert Horry couldn't play D like Danny Green and Green couldn't hit big shots like Bob.
Repton legend Danny Green.
"Yeah but the perimeter guys are actually shooting worse this year.  Matthews was supposed to replace Danny green but he is shooting worse.  Avery Bradley actually shot ok last year but he's not here either.  Schroder might actually be a worse shooter than Rondo too.    They only guys who actually improved their percentage are LeBron and Kuzma, but LeBron is out obviously."
danny green most likely would’ve won finals mvp had the spurs won in 2013 too
"Danny Green has come top 10 in RPM several times. He has an elite-level impact.   One of the best defenders in the league, and one of the best shooters in the league. A player like that just totally warps a team's Championship odds."
"That is correct. Only 4 players have won with 3 different teams, Robert Horry, Lebron James, john salley and Danny Green."
WHY IS DANNY GREEN PATROLLING THE AREA?!?!?
that pull up air ball 3 from Danny Green right before the end of the half
Congrats on smoking our world beating lineup of Tobias Harris and Danny Green lol. You funny bro
"Don't let the lack of Embiid and Simmons distract you from the fact that Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard are all playing in this game."
shout out danny green for playing that no-look defense
Fuckin danny green man.. every time I see him play so freely and with no regard for ruining someone's career it makes me upset
"Steph, Klay, Dray and Andre all said Danny Green did nothing wrong"
Yet no ring.....no man is an Island!  I mean even Danny Green has 3 rings
"&gt; Curry only had lower stats because the he made the Warriors so dominant, he was playing 5 fewer minutes than Harden lmao.  Playing 5 fewer minutes also implies that the team could do well without him on the court for longer. It's well known that year that Curry's team was better, he had Klay and Draymond vs...2015 Dwight? Who only played 41 games? The Warriors were a deep and experienced team that year. You're ignoring all the context.  &gt;Per possession, Curry had better stats and was more efficient.  That's a lie. Per 100 possessions:  Harden: 37/7.7/9.4/2.6/1  Steph: 35.5/6.4/11.6/3/0.3  Those are absolutely comparable. Considering Steph had the better team, him having more assists makes complete sense. Harden still scores more and gets more rebounds. TS% doesn't change per possessions but it's a 3% change with Harden still above 60% despite carrying the team.  &gt;Also 33% higher TS% is more than a bit lmao.  Uh you mean 3%? Which isn't massive considering the huge role Harden had on that team. Harden still had a TS of 60.5% which is excellent.  &gt;Harden does not have a good case for 2015 MVP.  Another lie?   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2015.html  Harden almost won. He was a massively clear second, and only 250 points down despite Steph's 100 first place votes. He had 400 points more than 3rd place LeBron. Just because you don't remember what happened doesn't mean that it didn't happen.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2436979-the-advanced-stats-guide-to-the-2015-nba-mvp-race  Another article detailing how close Harden was to winning.  &gt;Harden was 8 games above Westbrook, while Kawhi was 6 games ahead of Harden, while Harden had COTY and 6MOY. Kawhi had no other all star on his team either, yet had 6 more wins.   You're once again ignoring all the context. Kawhi had Ginobili, Parker, Gasol, Aldridge, Danny Green, etc. Harden's second best player statistically was...Eric Gordon? Second year Capela? His team was way worse. That's also why D'Antoni won CotY.   &gt;Kawhi could've definitely won 2017 if that season's narrative wasnt so skewed by stats.  Well then you're partially agreeing with me. If the voting criteria was the same as it always is, the best player on one of the best teams (*Including context*), then it shouldn't have gone to Westbrook. Harden was carrying much harder than Kawhi was, on a much worse team.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2017.html  Kawhi is much further in voting from Harden than Harden was from Westbrook. If Westbrook didn't average the triple double, Harden wins that year. Harden's stats were almost a triple double himself: 29/8/11.   MVP has always been a combination of statistical dominance, high seeding, and level of carrying the team. Harden by far fit those categories the best *altogether* compared to either Westbrook or Kawhi that year. He lost to the lower seed due to another carry job (but worse than his) and stats. However, in 2015, he had very similar stats and the much harder carry job, but lost to the seeding."
"If you equate those things to Danny Green thats your choice...I don't.  Draymond's never ended anyone's season and almost always takes care to not injure players. The kicks were stupid but he wasn't taking anyone out of the game.   I HATE the zaza play, I hate seeing that happen to anyone, I hate when it happens to me in pickup, if I could wave a magic wand and make it so no one ever gets under a shooting landing space I'd do it in a heartbeat. It's reckless and dirty too but often more incidental. For instance the play they posted at the top of this thread isn't why we hate him and isn't any better or worse than Klay on Harden or Zaza w/ Kawhi."
Danny green has 3 rings
"He cuts well and has a smooth mid-range game, he's not a pure 3&amp;D.  He takes 44% of his shots from 3, pure 3&amp;D players like Covington and Danny Green shoot around 65% of their shots from 3."
The worst team LeGOAT faced in the finals is better than the best team Jordan faced in the plumber era   Lebron has had a million times better finals performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan did vs Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec  There wouldn’t even be a Jordan era if even Durant played in the d league expansion era  Old lebron &gt; prime Jordan as we saw again in last years finals.   Get over it
Evil Danny Green strikes again
"Man fuck Danny green. Dirty motherfucker did that shit to Steph all series and then jumped into Klay twice from behind while he was airborne and defenseless. Really channeling Bruce Bowen out there.  Another superstar goes down, and the Toronto crowd goes wild!!!"
As a lakers fan I can agree fuck Danny green
"tf danny green do lol imagine if it was Ibaka blocking him at the rim, coulda been worse"
"Yea, fuck Danny Green."
"I really like how he elevated k love from 26 12.5 4.5 .457 FG to 16.4 9.7 2.2 .434FG  Or bosh 24 11 at 52% to 18.8 8.3 and 49.6%FG  Let's pick role player like Danny Green. He had better FG%, 3pt% and points before and after being on the Lakers  did LeBron make him better though? I only know he played worse with LeBron and takes all the blames from LeTrump supporters. Wake up sheeple don't follow the narratives ESPN gives you."
Man fuck Danny Green
Yes. That's why its forever fuck danny green. There's an image of him riding Klay's back on a prior play. He's so reckless it's dirty.
"A third star maybe? Dillon Brooks could maybe be that but i doubt it. I don’t think Brandon Clarkes ceiling is that high, same with Grayson. I do think Bane can be a good Danny Green type player tho."
A guy like Danny green and Paul milsap maybe. They have a GREAT young team already. Need a more solid 3rd star.
That’s why Danny green has 200 iq. Built his game to counter hot. People think he is icy hot but he’s just playing 3D chess.
Evil Danny Green
Fuck Danny Green
He'd average 40 on 80% TS if you gave him those. Danny Green was doing this shit the whole series: https://nba.cdn.turner.com/nba/big/nba/wsc/2019/06/11/7a7f0047-62a3-c006-dfb5-69c451dac11c.nba_3795470_1920x1080_5904.mp4  Sometimes it's a lot less subtle: https://streamable.com/szave
Of course.  Danny Green and his family got death threats because he missed the game tying shot in game 5.
"Assuming Harden doesn’t go the 76ers, they’re a tough matchup. Allen/buyouts aren’t really slowing down Embiid.   Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, Tobias Harris is an excellent lineup against solid role players. I don’t have that much faith in LeVert to be the difference maker  If the 76ers got Harden, I would favor them. Harden surrounded with shooters and an Embiid down low is a very scary team because they’d have no weaknesses at all"
"I mean it's fcking obvious now, but it was also hard to pull off and even risky.   Dumping Al Horford on okc, and still getting Danny Green in return, I don't think many gms would've pulled that off. Everyone thought they would have to give up much more to dump him.  And Seth for JRich, that was baaaallsy, at the time JRich was def considered the better player, plus they gave up a a pick in the 30s."
"Danny Green is a winner on every level. Yeah, he makes boneheaded decisions at times, but that's the price of being in the top win percentage among active players and winning a ring with nearly every team he's played for :v"
Danny Green is good for at least 1 playoff loss
What? You mean Seth Curry and Danny Green are upgrades than 35 year-old Al Horford?!
Morey deserves a lot of credit for coming in and instantly making the pieces make sense. I’m still befuddled as to how he turned Horford and Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry.
Floor - Duncan Robinson. Ceiling - Danny Green
"The Wolves traded Wiggins and their first-round pick FOR Dlo and his terrible contract, not the other way around, they wanted him to keep KAT happy. Russ and John are playing fine, just not quite up to their contracts, on terrible teams. You're also forgetting Al Horford, who was considered the worst contract in the NBA, that the Sixers traded to OKC for Danny Green with just a throw-in second."
Pretty sure Ben is the young Kawhi and Tisse is the young Danny Green
You know how I know you don't watch games? You think Danny Green is a bum.
"I legitimately think Danny Green was the best fast break defender in the league for a number of years, particularly against 2 on 1's.  He's definitely lost a step, and that might not currently be the case, but he's incredibly smart/crafty on the defensive end and is still a really good defender."
"After LeBron James, Rajon Rondo, Danny Green, and Jared Dudley made the 2020 NBA Finals the streak reached its 37th year."
I just love how Danny Green would always average 1 blk/gm.  Sneaky player to pick up for fantasy back in the day.
If the Sixers win we can just swap Kawhi for Danny Green
"Yeah, danny green may have sucked ass in offense but his defense was great. Lakers needed him to match salary and schroder filled a need which the lakers need way more."
"Webbers a clown, acting like we've been healthy all season when Danny Green and Dwight have been the only players who haven't missed a bunch of games"
Is Danny Green starting worth it anymore? I haven't really followed 6ers this season
"As a Raptors fan, I can tell you that people just don't know the value of Danny Green. Even on off nights, he was always good on defense and he is a really great locker room guy. And when he is on, he is lethal as any shooter in the league. Ofc you would know that being a Spurs fan though."
"As a spurs fan, Imma tell you that’s bullshit. Danny green made an all-defense team and is probably the GOAT transition defender. I can’t tell you how many 2-1 fast breaks Danny Green stopped by himself. Danny green ain’t Smush Parker."
"&gt;""if Danny Green shot Tupac he would still be alive""  Holy shit this is amazing"
lmao what is this revisionism  Danny Green got traded because he was the only contract that worked to get Schroeder
"Win what now? The first round? Y’all ain’t winning shit. Why do you need a stud? You’d need to replace Dame with a top 5 player to get that kinda pull to your market. Y’all can act like you are one player away. But did you see what we needed to win last year? Lebron (living legend top 2 all time), Rondo (living legend. The last effective pure point guard. Who shot the skin off the ball), AD(Top 5 in the league who has won at all levels), Dwight (the most dominant center since Shaq. The last of that breed/ era), Danny Green (The single best role/ 3&amp;D player in the league), The Legend known as JR Smith (The Henney God) and the most emotional Lesbian... (completely useless) WE WERE STACKED LOL"
"I’m literally talking about the quote from Danny Green, who played with Kawhi Leonard, comparing Ben Simmons’ defense to Kawhi Leonard’s  go tell Danny Green that it’s outlandish! I have to go make dinner"
The strange thing is he could shoot decently from the shorter 3 point line in college. But seems he’s overly concerned with getting his numbers up instead of trying. He is absolutely capable. He just refuses for some reason. Dwight hit like 10 3’a last season. He even hit a go ahead 3 to ice the game in the finals. That Lakers team was something else man. Even down men they were nearly unstoppable. If Danny green hit that shot it would have been an insane gentleman sweep playoff run lead by a 35 year old lmfao. It’s been a while since older vets were running the league. You might have to go back to the 80’s when that was common.
"I mean on ball man to man defense, Kawhi was definitely a different tier but Danny Green does some team df stuff better"
Danny Green traded because of that finals series tbh
Danny Green says Matisse Thybulle is a young Kawhi confirmed
"The best ability is ability. I’ll trade Danny Green, who has missed 1 game (?) for Lebron right now if the best ability is availability."
My worst nightmare is Danny green dropping 30 on us in the finals lmao
"Still pisses me off that we lost that game vs Golden State because Doc trusted Matisse at the start to guard Curry then after Curry made 2 3’s he didn’t guard him again all night. Seth, Danny Green, freshly-returned Hill and Tyrese Maxey all did worse. Not to mention Curry gets so many 3s off just out of your fingers with his quick release, Matisse would have been much better."
A team that has Danny Green on it.
"Jarden Dudley's personal take doesn't prove that it wasn't safe though. And if we're talking about the death threats as a reason, Danny Green got a bunch of death threats for missing an open shot last year in the playoffs.   In the end, everyone feels a little scared abroad, but no one's going to outright murder NBA players over a tweet and everyone got home safe."
Unrelated but people are constantly yelling at him to drive to the hoop instead of passing it to Danny Green
Danny Green for Horford transformed our team
Dude is like the anti Danny Green. He'll shoot over 50% from three on high volume for several games in a row and then randomly go 2-14 to crash back down to his career average lol
How bout playing teams in the finals in the WNBA d league era that wouldn’t make the playoffs today?  Imagine being guarded by Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec in finals after Finals yet not even coming close to the finals performances LeGOAT has vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green  Imagine thinking Jordan is the GOAT after 2016. Old lebron &gt; prime Jordan as we saw last year
"Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez    They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge"
"Problem is he failed to address the part of “you’re next” directed at the officer. He needs to rescind that, that tweet is downright threatening, and if you know how many followers Bron has, even if one of them takes it seriously, the Cop is in permanent danger every time he’s in the public.  Danny Green got death threats for missing a basketball shot. Imagine those same fans acting on social issues"
Danny Green loves hitting guys in mid air
"Doc likes to randomly try out Danny Green on opposing stars for some reason. But yes, Simmons did clamp Booker until Green got switched onto Booker which allowed him to heat up and stay that way the rest of the game.   Doc's strategy really only makes sense in games against Brooklyn with Harden and KD out just so he can see how Green on Kyrie would look in the playoffs"
He's leading the Suns to the #2 seed and Steven Adams is making 25...I 100% think a team would do that.....John Stockton was very good in his old age and I think Cp3 is better then him. Id clean out the lockers of Danny Green and Seth Curry to sign him for 4 years 25 mill
"Curry, Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Embiid and then Seth Curry, Danny Green, Wiggins, Harris, Howard off the bench would be the proper lineup 🥵🥵"
"&gt;When Thompson played earlier this year, Embiid put up 42 and 38.   And both games were still within 3 points in the final 5 minutes despite Boston not having Tatum for either.  ""Who will guard Embiid?"" has always been the Philly question. Boston is 8-1 in the playoffs without ever providing an answer.   Embiid will do Embiid's thing. We have no one who can stop him, he's incredible.   Our approach has never been about stopping Embiid it's about playing well against a team that really has no one else besides Embiid. Ben and Tobias can be slowed in the playoffs. Danny and Seth are mostly C&amp;S guys scoring single digits atm.   A big step in that direction is being able to play certified NBA talent like Thompson over guys like:  * Kornet - An okay 3rd stringer * Wagner - We just waived him  * Tacko - A G-League player who's legitimately had 1 good game in 2 seasons    Does playing Danny Green over Dakota Mathias mean you can suddenly lock down James Harden?   No, but having a capable player on the floor who understands his role does help your team play a lot better overall. Which is why the earlier games with Thompson were closer even though we were missing Tatum.     &gt;And sure Fournier is a good bench scorer but do you really think adding him would have made much of a difference  Minus the rebounds, he's pretty much averaging Tobias Harris' numbers for the season on a similar efficiency.  Yeah, I think once he's brought into the roster properly (which should be soon) he'll be a pretty big addition."
"Danny green is really good, you crazy  The reasons he always gets so many minutes in the playoffs are because coaches trust him and he plays great defense"
That photo though.  Danny trying to palm his hands and Matisse going for the fist bump.  Maybe Green really wants to do more than watch film?
"Source: 13 year veteran guard Danny Green has engaged with second year swingman Matisse Thybulle regarding a potential date. There’s been mutual discussions regarding film sharing, with haggling over cuddle positions."
Danny Green should show him how to shoot corner 3s
"Embiids improved for sure, but reddick was a lot better on ball (and off) than curry. I also think people underestimate how bad Danny green is.  At the end of the day, the sixers issue will always be that their point guard is a role player on the offensive end, and as long as that holds true, I don’t see them seriously contending with Brooklyn/Milwaukee even if they are on pace to be a 55 win team"
You can thank Danny green for this totally legit and not dirty at all [normal basketball play](https://www.google.com/search?q=danny+green+on+klay+back&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS800US802&amp;hl=en-US&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=niv&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwits7ez0o_wAhXGs54KHUgNBdEQ_AUIFygC&amp;biw=375&amp;bih=553&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=IO1-5Ug2sXGmTM)
"Calling me delusional but thinks a team who's second best player can't hit a jumpshot will beat Kyrie and Kd surrounded by some of the best shooters in the league. The fact that Kyrie was able to drop 37 points while fasting on the sixers ""elite defense"" just made me lose any sort of concern that the sixers were threats to the Nets. The sixers are relying on Seth Curry and Danny Green as the 3rd and 4th scoring options 😂. The sixers are the defintion of a regular season team."
MF Danny Green is low key dirty player. In both the instances Green was culprit. Even in recent match against 76ers he poked eye of Steph.
Well Danny Green has the most threes from the corner this year. Let’s suck on his d*** then right? No because volume doesnt mean shite
"I watch a lot of games, every sixers game, and Danny green doesn’t make dirty plays like that, just as everyone is telling you"
My guy Lebron James deferred to Danny Green...
Danny Green/Jaylen Brown/Jeff Green/Wiggins/Barrett/Divincenzo
Did Danny Green injure him?
"Other than 2000 what other ones   01 pau gasol, Zach Randolph, Tont Parker, Joe Johnson, tyson chandler, Richard Jefferson, gerald wallace     02 yao ming, amare stoudemire, caron butler, nene, tayshaun prince, John salmons, Mike Dunleavy    03 is obvious    04 Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, lol deng, andre igouldala, Devin Harris, al Jefferson, Jr Smith, Josh Smith, Tony Allen    05 Cp3, Deron Williams Andrew Bynum, Andrew bogut, Danny granger, David Lee, gerald Green, nate Robinson    06 Rondo, Lowry, Aldridge, Brandon Roy, Jr Reddick, rudy gay"
I wasn't making a comparison. You can say example tho lol.  Danny Green truned out great. The Cavs are as bad at developing talent as much as picking it
"The Nets outside of their big 3 have Joe Harris (one of the top 3 poimt shooters), Landry Shamet ( slowly turning into one of the best 3 poimt shooters), Jeff Green ( very valuable role player), Blake Griffin ( still decent) and Claxton who is a very versatile defender. Who tf do the sixers have outside of their big 3? Danny Green and shake Milton? Who do the bucks have on their supporting cast? A 36 year old PJ Tucker? Lmao."
That's why the Sixers brought in Danny Green
No and the blame is on cleveland.   I don't remember the stats but every year they could've picked guys better to play with Bron than they did.   They even got rid of Danny Green
Danny Green orders *extra* pineapple on his pizza.
Danny Green
Is that all? I know warriors fans want someone to be mad at but Danny Green isn’t that kind of player
Yeah Seth thybulle Danny green got no help from the bigs lol
fuck danny green
I like how this comment is directly below a picture of Danny tackling Klay in mid air from behind.    Wait I though Laker fans hate Danny Green and chased him out of town
No Danny green hurt Klay’s hamstring buy landing on him in Toronto. Then Klay rushed back for game 5 &amp; 6 and Danny green made a dirty foul on him while he was mid air and tore his acl.
"I don't think he's a good basketball player, but I have zero hate for the man. I'll even feel bad for him when he inevitably gets the [""Danny Green"" treatment](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30091882/los-angles-lakers-danny-green-fiancee-received-death-threats-missed-shot-game-5-nba-finals) by your toxic-ass fanbase."
"Embiid, thybulle and Danny Green are all very good on defense."
"Absolutely he did this on purpose, he have no chance to actually play the ball in that situation it was an intentional faul on a flying Klay the odds he get seriously injured were sky-high, so f you Danny Green!"
Danny Green pours his milk in the bowl then adds cereal.
"Steph gotta be the first winning NBA player I can recall to make a habit of pulling up from three on a fastbreak, and not immediately get pulled from the game. I remember in like 2011, Danny Green did it, made it, and Pop subbed him right out"
"&gt;No, he won’t. He won’t leave home in the paint. He has 4 switchable defenders in front of him who are athletic and lanky enough to rotate. He literally has the perfect setup to not leave the paint.  He's gonna have to. There is a reason Gobert has never done well against the Rockets lmao. Its because his drop coverage gets him played off the floor. Kyrie, James and KD will kill him that way, be it easy mid rangers or pull up threes.  Harden will get possessions with him on the perimeter. They simply do not have enough to slow them down.   &gt;Again...4 switchable defenders. The Harden paradigm of driving around a screen and bullying to the hoop doesn’t work if the rim defender stays home. Embiid is not going to allow a lot of easy Harden layups or lobs. And kicking out works well if you pull an extra defender. This usually happens when he pulls both defenders on a pick and roll and another defender rotates to stop the lob. If both defenders don’t go after him and stay home, it forces him into resetting the defense, shooting mid range, or giving it out to Kyrie or KD to iso.  Lmao and if one of Harris or Thybulle are in there, either there offense suffers or there defense suffers. Danny Green also cannot guard Harden one on one either. He will absolutely be pulling that extra defender be it iso or pick and roll, never mind that in your scenario Kyrie or KD(two of the best iso players in the game) are still getting one on one coverage at the end of the day lol.  &gt;That’s not the lineup bud. Harris was moved to the bench and is only getting because one of the big 3 has been out at all times (minus 2 games). With all of the big 3 there and playing 40+ minutes, Harris will get 10-12 rotation minutes a game in the small ball lineup with KD at 4. Don’t get me wrong that’s a great offensive lineup and unlike KD, Harden and Kyrie stationary at the 3 point line, Harris forces rotations and creates spacing. They’re better off with him in the lineup. But they’ll be playing DAJ, who is negative spacing and can’t move or defend. They’ll be playing Blake who can’t move or defend. They’ll be playing Kyrie who can definitely hit a 3 but won’t be moving off ball and doesn’t defend. KD hasn’t had any significant off ball movement since his first year in Golden State, and he no longer puts in a defensive effort. Harden doesn’t move off ball and hits 3’s at a much lower clip than KD or Kyrie.  Joe Harris is not getting 10-12 minutes a game in the playoffs, you are dreaming.  Go check how many minutes he's played while the big three has played together. KD and Kyrie also move way more without the ball than you are implying here.  DAJ is not getting many minutes in the playoffs. Claxton is. And the 5 provides vertical spacing.  Blake can hit the three though and can roll to the rim. Kyrie does move off ball. KD does move off ball, this straight non sense which is saying you havent watched the Nets this year. Same with Harden, if the situation arises he can move off ball.   &gt;ust because a few people can hit 3’s doesn’t mean you have spacing. The Rockets had good spacing because teams collapsed on Harden in the key and they had these turrets, even if they had minimal off ball movement. But when Harden played teams (like the Spurs before Duncan was too old) with good rim protection, they didn’t collapse on him and he had a hard time getting them good looks just by kicking out. Hell, he struggled this way against the Clippers and they were never a contender. The Warriors didn’t have great rim protection, we kind of did it by committee with Dray and KD, so we had to be very rotation heavy and he got his squad good looks from 3. Embiid is one of the best rim protectors in basketball, that’s a problem for Harden because he’s not pulling extra defenders onto himself for kick outs. And that is rough because, again, no off ball movement. Kyrie and KD aren’t running around screens to get open for catch and shoot 3’s. Joe Harris is great at this, but Harden took his roster spot and will have his minutes in the playoffs when KD and everyone is back.  Yes it is, that's literally what spacing is, what are you talking about.  We had decent  spacing in Houston, not great. Turrets? We had average to below average shooters who took a lot of 3s.  That was pre floater Harden and Harden being the only all star on his team.  Damn...its a shame Harden has never beaten a team with a great rim protector....Gobert lol.   Kyrie and KD dont have to run around any screens, we didnt do that in Houston. Harden can get them open looks by them standing still. But just to be clear, KD and Kyrie to get around screens that;s a lie. Harris will be playing plenty of minutes.   &gt;Fit matters. They’re not a fit because they got regular season wins. The 2004 Lakers is an equal level of dominant talent and lazily glided their way to 56 wins, the #2 seed, and they stomped the #1 seed in the playoffs. The Pistons fought and clawed for 54 wins, the #3 seed, and getting through the east was brutal. When they got to the finals, they beat up on the Shaq/Kobe/Payton/Malone Lakers. The defensive team with chemistry and fit beat the superior talent, and it wasn’t close. You don’t want to face the realities of this and every argument you’re making only makes sense when you ignore context. Kyrie and Harden have real flaws in their game. There’s a reason Harden has struggled his whole career in the playoffs. There’s a reason Kyrie failed to be a #1 guy even when he had a great supporting cast, coach and culture. KD’s game has very few weaknesses but he can’t beat a good team alone. Harden/CP3 is a much better fit than Harden/Kyrie, and there’s not enough touches per game for 3 ball dominant stars. Harden/Westbrook didn’t work with a full squad of 3&amp;Ds. Now there’s no D, only 3’s, and not enough looks to go around or a good enough offensive set to get really good looks.   &gt;   &gt;Now watch them drop a game or two to someone they should sweep and then watch them get embarrassed by the Sixers or even another team.  This is lazy take bro. This is essentially ""there is only one ball"""
"When kuzma held the ball and was gonna shoot it, for some reason Danny green came into my mind and he missed. I am sorry guys, it was my fault for remembering Danny."
Honestly impressive that this game is this close with the Lakers having ballhandlers that are slighty better than Danny Green
"Just in the last couple years off the top of my head : kawhi, Danny green, ibaka and gasol all left in free agency right?"
I didn't know Danny Green could dunk!
"Eh I mean they still got Dwight Howard who's a big time playoff vet, George Hill, Danny Green"
"There are quite a few who have won with three teams (Robert Horry, Danny Green already) but I don’t know of any who did back to back to back with three different teams."
2020 Lakers  AD  LeBron  Dwight  Danny Green  JaVale  Caruso  KCP  Avery Bradley
Whenever we lose games it’s the same old:  “Can’t believe Danny Green/Rondo/Dwight/Javale left! Fire Rob!” Calling for Our GM to be fired lol  As if Danny Green was carrying us to victories and not the superstar duo LeBron and AD...
"Schröder/Gasol is an inarguable upgrade over Rondo/McGee. Drummond is undoubtedly a downgrade from Dwight but the Lakers will run AD at the 5 for the most part and one big off the bench. Aka Dwight off the bench last year and Gasol this year.   Danny Green is better than Wes Matthews of course, but he’s not worth paying 5x the salary when Matthews can potentially give us 80% of what DG gave us last year.   Honestly, to say the Lakers are in a worse position than last year strictly off of moves, is pretty ridiculous. 95% of the Lakers issues comes down to *health*, nothing more and nothing less. Take away any title contenders 2 best players for the majority of the season and let’s see if they look dominant."
"Are you for real? Man, fuck Danny Green. - Raps fan."
"I miss Danny Green, he is the GOAT in our hearts already"
"They were pretty good last year without Danny Green, too. Had Kawhi not left, I’m sure they would’ve been in serious contention.  I believe the opinion that you can’t contend with a small backcourt is predicated on a lack of defense, which clearly isn’t the case in Toronto. They had the 2nd best d-rating last season."
"Danny Green was their starter, no?"
76ers so Danny Green can be anointed the GOAT
"As much as it pains me, Sixers +1000. There are a lot of similarities between them and last year’s Lakers. Also they have Danny Green, who might just be the greatest lucky charm in basketball history."
"&gt; Also the difference maker stuff is ridiculous cmon man. When the 2019 lakers missed the playoffs and they traded for Danny green, Dwight and Jr they went on to win a chip the next year. &gt;  &gt; I still wouldn't say either of those 3 were the most important player.  Do you just purposely forgot AD?"
"It's so much more than that my g, people don't get this at all.     The best players in history, Jordan, kobe, lebron, etc. dont just shoot high percentages. When they're on the floor their teammates percentages also sky rocket too, because of their playmaking ability or the gravity their scoring demands.     Curry raised kd's ts% percentage by an absolutely ridiculous 12%. When curry was off the floor/injured kd shot below league average ts% on a decent team.    Kd didn't have any effect on currys shooting when he was off the floor. He just didn't demand as much defensive attention as curry.    That OKC team was decent as well. Russ more than makes up for the more deep bench the warriors had.     Also the difference maker stuff is ridiculous cmon man. When the 2019 lakers missed the playoffs and they traded for Danny green, Dwight and Jr they went on to win a chip the next year.     I still wouldn't say either of those 3 were the most important player."
"Danny Granger disappeared into the ether too. With him and Hibbert vanishing people just forget that PG wasn’t the only one there. Lance Stephenson, psycho T, Gerald Green, George Hill, DJ Augustin, and David West."
"I would probably drop Cov, slide Simmons to the 4 and put Danny Green in that lineup."
The long con was to take him away from the Celtics with an overpaid contract and use Morey magic to flip him to another team without using too many assets while getting a solid starting two way 2/3 (Danny Green).
"We had Greg Monroe and Boban. Not sure if Amir Johnson was still on the team at the time.   Yeah we didn't get Embiid a decent backup until we moved Al Horford to the Bench last year, and even then the spacing was so dogshit it never really mattered.  Turning last years roster into what we have now is the reason why I love having Morey so much. A good backup 5 in Dwight, which is a major need, but also having Danny Green and Seth Curry next to Embiid has given him so much more space to operate and gives him players who he can pass out to that make their shots at a decent rate."
Getting Kawhi and Danny Green was way more impactful than getting rid of Casey
"It would be fun to watch Butler on this current 76ers team. Simmons, Thybulle, Butler, Embiid, Howard, Danny Green trying to defend the Brooklyn big 3... now that would be an entertaining series."
Danny Green 💍 💍 💍 FTW!
"Okay so he's been top 3 in WS, WS/48, BPM, PER, VORP, RAPTOR, RPM, and RAPTOR WAR. RAPM is the only statistic that has that opinion and frankly is not a very good statistic for comparing players. According to RAPM the best player in the league in 2018-2019 was Danny Green. In 2017-2018 it was Robert Covington. In 2013-2014 the best player in the league was Andre Iguodala. My favorite though has to be in 2009-2010 when Anderson Varejao was the 2nd best player in the league according to RAPM. Clearly RAPM is either not made for comparing players or is completely useless because I don't think anyone is going to agree with any of these players rankings."
"A great midrange shooter with a weak outside shot is actually very valuable in the correct context.  For example if the defense is switching everything instead of worrying about going over/under screens, you can engineer a mismatch that a player with good creation can exploit in the midrange.  Another example would be when defenses play harder (e.g. playoffs) and stick tight to shooters and/or run them off the line. I would rather have CJ attack a closeout and get into an off-the-dribble look than have Danny Green do it, despite DG technically having a higher TS%  As a Sixers fan, this type of player might be tough to fit in our starting lineup as spacing comes as a premium for our offense, but as our bench unit often gets bogged down and struggles to score we would KILL to have a midrange creator just to get us out of tight spots at times"
"Yeah. Totally. Ben Simmons is apparently super overrated and not that good, Danny Green can’t shoot, and Tobias Harris isn’t an all star. The Sixers have no spacing, no bench, and no shooters. The Sixers have dealt with zero injuries (other than Embiid apparently missing the entire season) and no COVID issues. The Sixers are in first solely because all of the super good players I mentioned earlier took their vitamins in the morning and have immaculate health."
Replace curry with Danny green
"Less than two months after his 27th birthday, Joel Embiid looks like one of the most important players in professional basketball. He's more confident than ever for one reason: He has become one of the most complete superstars in the game.  As Embiid enters his prime, he's the centerpiece on both ends of the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers, who have become a legitimate threat to win it all.  No center has won the MVP award since Shaquille O'Neal in 1999-2000 for the Los Angeles Lakers. That drought should end this year, with both Embiid and Nikola Jokic making strong cases and reminding us that big men still matter. Not only does Embiid rank third in the league in scoring this season, but he also anchors one of the best defenses in the league, a key claim that Jokic cannot make.  Entering Thursday, the Sixers have the best record in the East, and Embiid is the biggest reason for that. Consider this:   In the 1,457 minutes he's been on the court this season, Philadelphia has a monstrous net rating of plus-12.0.  In the 1,693 minutes he's been on the bench this season, Philadelphia has a net rating of minus-0.3.  Embiid has had a breakout season, and while his place in the MVP race might dominate podcast conversations, that's just a distraction -- the real story here is Embiid and the new-look 76ers appear to be evolving into one of the most sustainable contenders in the NBA.  The arrivals of Daryl Morey and Doc Rivers signified the beginning of a new era in Philadelphia. Together, they've overhauled the vibes around Embiid and Ben Simmons. Morey quickly traded Al Horford and added good shooters like Seth Curry and Danny Green, while Rivers refreshed the actions and the rotations.  The result has been a more cohesive, more spacey ecosystem, which has cleared out the clutter and enabled Embiid to do what he does best. He's scoring more than ever, and he's doing so at a more efficient clip than we've ever seen from him. He's on pace to set career highs in both 2-point shooting percentage and 3-point shooting percentage. When you look at his shot chart from this season, you can see he's filling it up from all over the place.  Embiid is both more active and more efficient as a jump shooter than ever. He has both attempted and made more jumpers than anyone else on the Sixers. He's taking more than 15 jumpers per 100 possessions, up from 13.6 last season, and he's making more than 40% of them for the first time in his career.  Coming into this season, he'd struggled to achieve average 3-point shooting efficiency despite being gifted wide-open looks by defenses that dared him to shoot. But this season, Embiid has converted 36.8% of his 3.1 3-point tries per game.  That's a massive development because defenses now must honor his long-range game, which opens up other opportunities for him and his teammates elsewhere.  The bigger development has come inside the arc, where Embiid now shows off a feathery touch on midrange shots. He's attempting 11.4 non-paint 2s per 100, the highest such number among the 83 players who have tried at least 100 midrangers this season. Oh, and he's making them, too, converting 43.6% of his non-paint 2s this season. That's not only the highest such mark of his career by far, but it also changes the math on how teams must defend him away from the rim.  While his outside shooting has developed, it's his nightly performances on the low block that provide us all a reminder of the virtues of a style of play mostly left for dead in recent years. For decades, big post-up centers like Embiid dominated the NBA, but post play rapidly declined as the NBA fell in love with 3-point shots, motion offenses and faster-paced action. Post -ups happen more than 50% less frequently than they did just eight years ago.  Since the league added its player tracking system in 2013-14, post-up activity has cratered. That season, NBA teams posted up over 16.35 times per 100 possessions. This season, that figure is 8.17 times per 100.  But that staggering trend does not apply in Philly or in Denver, where the league's top two MVP candidates just happen to be dominating the league via old-school post play.  Get this: Embiid is posting up as an individual more per game than 27 other teams are collectively! Only the Lakers and Nuggets as teams are posting up more than he does.  Jokic isn't far behind, posting up more than 24 teams.  Just like the folks who have made us recently reconsider our stances on mom jeans, Embiid and Jokic are making post play cool again.  Embiid ranks first in the league, posting up 19.3 times per 100 possessions. Jokic ranks fourth, posting up 13.7 times per 100. And out of 19 players who have posted up at least 200 times this season, Jokic ranks first in efficiency, Embiid ranks second.  It's remarkable that the league's top two MVP candidates are both centers who are revising the conventional wisdom of the past 10 years: Centers were supposed to be endangered species; post play was supposed to be dying out.  Embiid is the only player in the league scoring double digits per game on post plays, and his MVP campaign is also a demonstration that the old Mikan-Russell-Chamberlain-Jabbar dance ain't dead just yet.  The pace-and-space era and the 3-point revolution have reformed the ways NBA front offices value the skills of frontcourt talent. The ability to thrive in the post on offense and defense used to be paramount. Now it isn't, and scouting reports for big men now examine their abilities to guard multiple positions, shoot from 25 feet, run the floor, grab rebounds, protect the rim, and serve up dribble-handoffs to the guards and wings they share the floor with.  As a result, the players attempting to stop the post actions of Embiid and Jokic might not be as common or as equipped to defend these actions in years past.  Just as post offense is a lost art, so is post defense. That is great news for Embiid, who is on the right side of his prime, one of the most imposing post players this league has seen in decades and still getting better. Embiid and Jokic would have thrived in any era, but in the context of the modern NBA, in which strength and size are less prioritized, there is a mouse in the house more than ever before.  As a defender himself, Embiid provides the Sixers with quite the opposite. As a 280-pound 7-footer with a 7-foot, 6-inch wingspan, he's among the league's biggest and best defenders.  The Sixers rank second in defensive efficiency in the NBA this season, giving up just 106.8 points per 100. While they decorate the defensive end with an imposing fleet of willing, savvy and sizable defenders, they play their best defense when both Simmons and Embiid are on the floor. Simmons is one of the world's most talented perimeter defenders. The combination of his point guard instincts, his defensive will and his own physical prowess make him a solid Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Meanwhile, Embiid is both an elite rim protector and rebounder.  The numbers are staggering.  Philadelphia is 32-6 in games in which Embiid and Simmons have played, a 69-win pace in a full 82-game season. In the 1,066 minutes in which they've shared the floor, Philadelphia's net rating is an absurd plus-16.2. That's the highest such mark among any two-man combo in the Eastern Conference (minimum 1,000 minutes played), and it has a lot to do with getting stops; with Embiid and Simmons on the floor, Philly's defensive rating is an eye-popping 102.2. If these guys can stay healthy, Philly's crunch-time lineups will be two-way nightmares for anyone.  At 27, it's impossible to watch Embiid and not think of former GM Sam Hinkie, and the early days of Embiid's pro career. It didn't look good. How many players miss two entire seasons of play before eventually turning into franchise players? Not many, but that's exactly how Embiid's arc began in Philly, which makes what he's doing right now even more impressive.  Along with Jokic, Embiid is making centers great again, but along with Simmons, he's also further validating the radical team-building process Hinkie designed eight years ago. No matter what happens from here on out, Embiid's eventual legacy will be tied to that polarizing tanking experiment.  No center has won the NBA MVP since Shaq did so in 1999-2000. That's about to change. Centers are relevant again, but that's not all. Basketball in Philadelphia is relevant, too. And even though Embiid might come up short on the MVP vote this season, it would be foolish to label this regular season anything short of a triumph. As a player, he has yet to reach his ceiling, but he has driven himself into the MVP conversation, and in the process, he has taken the 76ers from a punchline to the top of the Eastern Conference.  That was the plan all along."
"prior to 19-20 wasn't he facilitating more from the wing/paint after a guard brought the ball up the court?  It wasn't until the lakers started with no clear primary ball handler (Lebron, Avery Bradley, Danny Green, AD, Javale) that Lebron was outright called the point guard."
"I’m sorry but if you’re having Danny Green and Seth Curry run your P&amp;R, it’s not gonna go great. This is where the argument that Simmons and Jojo are not a great fit come in, they both can’t roll at the same time."
"And also fuckin ridiculous teams.  2014 Spurs Duncan, Ginobili, Parker, Diaw, Bellinelli, Splitter. That team was GOOD under Pop, even if the big 3 were old and they didn't have big names.   Raps had one of the most absurd defensive lineups I've ever seen, Ibaka, Gasol, Siakam, Lowry, Danny Green were all great defenders, Ibaka and Gasol awesome defenders. With Kawhi and it's just insane lol.  KD and AD would definitely win titles with both those teams if they replaced Kawhi IMO."
"It's got some pretty obvious flaws just looking at players on the same teams.   First example I see looking at the charts is Donte DiVicenzo has a 2.27 RPM. Jrue's is a little bit over him at 2.49 and Khris is just underneath him at 1.96. It's hard to imagine how Donte is even roughly as impactful as the other two players.   Devonte Graham is at a 3.72 vs Scary Terry's 2.77 and Ball is at 1.15 and Hayward is at 1.13. I don't think anyone would consider Graham as significantly more impactful than the other players.   Joe Harris ranks above Kyrie but the really baffling part is that Harris is a negative in offense by this metric and just blows Kyrie out of the water defensively while Kyrie is good on offense and just barely positive in defense.   Outside of the realm of teammates, you have some very big ones. Lonzo is the 9th most impactful player. Duncan Robinson rates as a better shooting guard than Lavine and Brown and Spyda. Danny Green and Kyle Anderson are the 5th and 6th best small forwards by this metric.   This whole spiel just to say that it's a wonky stat that isn't trustworthy"
"Maybe some things don’t have numbers tho because there’s no way of counting it.   The team cp3 was on was supposed to be tanking as they traded both their stars for young talent and draft picks. The other was a defending champion who lost their best player and Danny green, yes, but that team had a lot of promising players still. We didn’t expect them to just full on tank."
Really liking Seth's form as we head into the playoffs. If he's hot that could make all the difference. Danny Green too.
"They play different roles, which makes it harder to compare them. Ben Simmons is more like a shutdown cornerback, locking down 1v1, and Thybulle is like an elite free safety, roaming space, disrupting passing angles, and getting last-second leaping punch outs. (And while these roles are interchangeable, they both excel in these lisited roles) Defenses need both types to succeed as a team. Embiid behind them is like the strong safety, watching the play and if anyone (handlers, cutters, rollers) ends up in his space, he shuts down the play.  Having great defenders like these guys and Danny Green on the team means that coaches can mix and match these strong defenders with weak defenders (Shamet, etc.) for lineup flexibility."
"Simmons is one of those defenders without killer stats (stl+blk) but you can see his defensive value the moment players and teams are forced to change plans because of his presence. Of course his job is hyped by Emiid presence (another top defender) and matisse too, but simmons even if is not piling steals and blocks has the ability to force opponents to play far from their comfort zone.  There are 2 type of defensive players  \- those that bait you to make a mistake and steal of just wait you to block your shot (cp3 for steals and Duncan/gobert for blocks)  \- those that will make everything in their power to prevent you to make plays in first place. Ben belongs to the second group, same as garnett was.  Simmons and Gobert are the 2 names for DPOTY. The detail I think will give the edge on Gobert is the fact that Utah doesn't have another great defender, while Philly got 2 more, and even danny green can be good. So considering the overall contribute, I think voters will give Gobert the favour. But ben has been busy guarding whatever player gets in front of him, for PG to big guys, so that rare kind of versatility that could convince voters to give him the award.  we'll see.  My idea is that Gobert will win this season and then Ben will be a constant candidate (and winner) in following seasons."
Danny Green.
Danny Green feels attacked.
"I’d love to see him in a Sixers starting lineup. Imagine him surrounded by Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, and Danny Green. That kind of defensive power combined with his scoring would be lethal."
"Look up Cam's advanced stats his last year. His shooting splits were elite no need to discuss that.  He trounces Jackson, Barnes, and Ellington in OBPM. Advanced metrics was not tracked during McCants' time so I can't compare to him. I also believe Cam was third behind Clarke and Zion in NCAA OBPM ranking that season. His impact on the offensive end was ridiculous, UNC had a good shot to the final four had he been healthy against Auburn. If you include DBPM to look at overall BPM he is much more impactful box score wise than those three aforementioned.   The only wing player who comes close to Cam's impact in college was Danny Green thanks to his elite defense since his freshman year. Of course Danny wasn't better than Hansbrough or Lawson but he was third best on the team.  https://barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2009&amp;p=Danny%20Green&amp;t=North%20Carolina  Look at these advanced metrics and ask yourself how the hell someone averaging 12.7/4.6/2.7, 1.8 steals, 1.3 blocks shooting 47.1/41.8/85.2 gets drafted in the middle of the second round.  [Cameron's for comparison](https://barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2019&amp;p=Cameron%20Johnson&amp;t=North%20Carolina)  If you want disappointment look at Harrison Barnes' page."
"He chugged a bottle of wine at the Raptors parade like he was downing a bottle of beer.  https://youtu.be/561GQFrGy84  He was so drunk, Danny Green told the MC not to let him near the mic.  He also got smashed for the parade when Spain won FIBA."
"He's the second best wing player in the history of Roy's UNC tenure behind Danny Green. Better than McCants, Barnes, and Ellington."
So your saying they switched him. Out in that 5 seconds of darkness for Danny Green?
"Fred Van Vleet, in association with Serg Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam......pretty much the entire Raptors roster minus Danny Green who was guarding Klay. Steph hasn’t been guarded consistently one on one since KD got hurt."
While we’re at it we should expel Danny Green from the league for what he did to Klay! Unironically.
"Its more than that. You can't just go by stats He's not being asked to score. He's a tertiary shooter at best when he's the floor. Sixers have other veteran shooters when he's on the floor. If you were a coach on a playoff caliber team, who are you asking to shoot Shake Milton, George Hill or Thybulle? Seth Curry,Danny Green, Tobias Harris or Thybulle? Come on man... Plays is not running through him right now.. Theres a huge difference when you have plays ran through you instead of playing clean up. He might have to get his shine on a different team but its there. His real weakness is his ball handling. If fixes that he'll have better shots."
"thybulle is overrated too. both simmons and thybulle are alright off-ball defenders, which is why doc has to put danny green as the primary defender"
"I'll play Devil's Advocate here, although I have a bias as a Sixers fan.  I've seen teams this year, and in the playoffs last year, look for a switch on the perimeter to get Gobert.  I've seen teams this year look to get a switch so they can get anybody else besides Ben.    Ben willingly takes the assignment of someone like Dame, Luka, etc, the opposing team's best perimeter player is usually Ben's assignment especially in crunch time. Those same players who try and get Ben as far away from them as possible simultaneously hunt for Gobert on the switch in crunch time. The Sixers and Blazers played earlier this year and I remember even though Dame was going off early in the game the moment Ben took the assignment he was slowed down and the other players had to make shots in order to win, Dame couldn't get the good quality shots he was getting vs Danny Green/Seth Curry anymore. IMO as a team defender, Rudy is easily top 3 and to many top 1, In terms of overall defensive skill I don't have him in my top 5.  My 5 in no particular order are:  Draymond  Ben  Embiid  Adebayo  Smart  Honorable mention Thybulle but again I'm super fucking biased."
"Horford was traded as a negative asset. The 6ers had to attach 2 prospects and a 2025 first to him and got back Danny green, who okc would have traded to anyone for a pack of skittles, and Terrance Ferguson, who was already projected as being on the outside looking in at their rotation. Porzingis is already a negative asset too, unless you fleece someone like the kings or timberwolves"
Beal dropped 60 on Danny Green
"As a Laker fan who hated Danny Green, regular season Rondo etc (although not to the point of the death threats/online abuse weirdos), the Marc hate never made any sense to me. He’s not dropping 20-10s but he’s consistently made good plays and been a positive contributor"
"Sure. Unlike most other champions, they didn't have a dominant scorer (or two) that clearly put themselves above their teammates. Because of that, there are several players that I think could make a case as the best player, and Kawhi is one of them. I'd also throw in Duncan, Ginobili, Parker, and even Danny Green as those who have an argument. Anyway, Kawhi's case: He was the second leading scorer on the team in the playoffs with only 2 fewer points per game than Duncan. He did that on pretty crazy efficiency. In addition, he played a leading role on their defense, and imo was their most important player on that end of the floor. If you really made me choose who was the most impactful in the playoffs I'd probably lean Duncan, but Kawhi is a close 2nd. And the dude compared him to Boris Diaw, who I guess has a case for like 6th most impactful."
"So do you and others on this thread think teams should let Simmons score all he wants against 1:1 defense in the paint and just stay home on curry, green and Harris so they don’t get open looks from 3? Just curious, as I really feel like curry and green could kill teams in the playoffs if they start collapsing on Simmons or embiid too much. The addition of Seth curry amd danny green in the off season were great moves by the sixers and if they can’t make it happen this year with the addition of those shooters than they have to blow up the core. At this point, IMO embiid and Simmons are never going to get it done together if they can’t do it this year."
"Yeah, those guys were the core. Dwight didn't usually finish games though.   Rondo wanted more money, Danny Green trade was good at the time, and Dwight's situation was weird."
theres a reason danny green has been a part of 3 championship teams and always gets a ton of minutes in the playoffs
Losing Rondo-Dwight-Danny Green is so underrated   Those guys were a big part of those closing lineups for LA
"I personally think Thybulle will be a DPOTY candidate for most of his career. Thats assuming he gets a good enough offensive game to get minutes, and he is slowly getting good enough for that to happen.  I dunno if i give that up for lowry at his age and contract. Let alone adding on to that Danny Green (best corner shooter in the league this year), and a 1st, and Maxey,"
Danny Green should change his name to Corner Three
What do you think of Danny Green?
danny green or draymond
shades of Danny Green
Doc being an upgrade over Brown doesn't guarantee a series win over Boston.  &gt;His decision making when doubled is vastly improved  That'll be put to the test in the playoffs when Simmons becomes much more of an offensive liability and teams are sharper about when and where the doubles are coming from. Can maybe even add Danny Green to that offensive liability category. It's been five years since he put together a good playoff shooting run.  &gt;He is unstoppable in 1 on 1 coverage.  Always has been. Until the fourth quarter roles around and he's sucking wind.
Yeah cos KCP and Danny Green were missing wide open 3s in the bubble on purpose ...
"That's how negotiation works, start high and try to reach a middle point. The middle point wouldve been something like one of Maxey/Thybulle + 1 or 2 picks + filler.   I think people are really overrating these picks which will end up as the 27-30th pick most likely. Guys drafted at this spot generally aren't relevant to a championship team until 2-3 seasons in.   At that point it really depends on how big of a window do you think you've got to win a championship, and how much you're willing to go all in to win it. The Sixers are a weird team because while they're pretty young, Embiid is always going to be an injury concern.   The only player that even gets minutes on the Sixers is Thybulle and hes barely playing 20MPG. Maxey literally only gets grabage time and will not be in the playoff rotation.  Say if the Raptors wanted Maxey + 2 picks, those are 3 players who are most likely not in your playoff rotation for the next two years. Losing Danny Green obviously will hurt since he's needed to match salary, but you're getting a much better player in Lowry in return.   Look at what the Raptors traded for a 35 year Marc Gasol. We traded JV who was a 25 year old walking double double on a great contract along with a second round pick just for a small increase in our championship winning odds. Lowry wouldve given the Sixers a better chance against the Nets or the Bucks. This year is probably the best year to go all in given the Nets injuries and the fact that their big 3 hasn't played together much.  Miami at the very least had a backup plan in Oladipo, but the Sixers messed up IMO. Toronto fans are fine Lowry playing out the season as a Raptor tbh."
"Multiple firsts were needed from Philadelphia who offered Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green and Mike Scott, Toronto held out and demanded multiple firsts. Lakers couldn’t have put together a package that Toronto would’ve found acceptable"
"This season wasn't that bad, it was just mostly lateral. Pelinka would be known as a shit GM if he wasn't in LA though.   He let go of Brook Lopez who was willing to take a discount to stay in LA, let go of Randle who's now an all-star. Bought high on Danny Green and Dennis Schroeder after they had career years. Sold low on Danny after a slightly below average year. Didn't re-sign Dwight who was their most reliable center. His moves all seem a little impulsive.   They've drafted well but let a bunch of players go getting nothing significant back: Clarkson, Randle and D'Lo would've been huge on this roster."
"Not as stupid a take as ""AD and Lebron are going to come back from injury and dominate""  It's not even that, they lost key pieces from last year.  Danny Green, Howard, Rondo, those guys were getting big playoff minutes they basically were the lakers' depth  And now they're replaced by drummond and gasol, I mean maybe gasol is going to make up part of that missing impact but vogel needs to actually play him first"
"On paper they got deeper. You can see the rationale behind those signings. Whether it works or not is a another question on its own.  Rondo was never gonna get resigned because he couldn't offer him the money he wanted, Danny Green was ice cold for much of the season. The only questionable move he made was not resigning Dwight."
"They were deep though  Danny Green never gets respect people always trying to get him run out of town or benched whenever he misses a 3  The guy played 25 minutes per game last season in the playoffs, he's a key rotation player.  He played 28 MPG during the raptors title run  It is not a coincidence danny green has 3 championships he's one of the best 6th men you could possibly have"
I would love for the sixers to win it all for Dwight Howard to prove the Lakers wrong and Danny green and embid proving how dominant he really is. On top of that doc rivers proving he is an ELITE coach. Other than that the clippers for RONDO who the Lakers let walk very stupid decision in hindsight. And I don’t mind Kawhi as a player I think he deserves more respect. As far as the nets they are trying to buy a ring just like the 🐍 did in GS it’ll mean nothing and then he’ll get on Twitter and defend himself to me sitting in my basement
"I hate to admit this but this always happen to Lebron's teammates. We've seen this many times before in Miami and Cleveland. It's not Lebron's fault though, it's his fans who are quick to hate on players who are having bad games. I mean right from the start we know what to expect from Drummond and now they're scrutinizing him. Remember what they also did to KCP, Danny Green, Jordan Clarkson etc."
"I mean he’s certainly not in that superstar tier. But I think the biggest difference again lies in the scheme. Obviously Luka is an incredible player, but Ben’s direction of the offense, plus the pure gravity he and Joel draw in the paint open up so many more opportunities for someone in Seth’s position to reach his actual potential. Even Danny Green has had far fewer and shorter cold stretches than I expected when we traded for him. Playing on this team is very potentially one of the best positions a 3-pt shooter can be in"
"“Danny the GOAT Green sinks game winner.  Gets 3rd ring in a row with third team after receiving death threats in LA” Edit: but I’m actually a CP3 fan so Suns, especially if they have to beat the Lakers."
lmaoo now i'm just imagining danny green dunking from the freethrow line I think I'd have a heart attack.
Dwight Howard and Danny Green were the real MVPs holding that team together.
"Same reason why didn't accept heat or sixers scraps. We need young assets to get back to even have value. We aren't gonna keep duncan robinson, danny green or dennis schroeder. We need young talent on our side to have benefits too."
"Danny Green was better than Wes Mathews (and more highly paid). Heck, even KCP last year was better than KCP this year.  It seems like we've seen little of Caruso this year (and he's made relaively little splash, compared to the bubble)"
Lebron tampering Danny Green in 2014. Fine him and retire his championships
Idk man we should have been happy with danny green and  maxey or duncan robinson
"Neither claim has ever been verified. Danny Green routinely gets his entire head above the rim which MJ has never done, and the former's vertical is not exactly 48 inches."
Danny Green you bum
"“Dude is just an automatic bucket, automatic championship.”  Are you talking about KD or Danny Green?"
Or Danny Green
I have never been sure—is Danny Green doing the Hitler salute in that picture or just putting his arm in the air for some reason?
https://deadspin.com/danny-green-is-sorry-about-the-bad-caption-on-his-holoc-1643837428
"My point is that what you said is completely untrue. LeBron has never made the Finals with a team this bad, so this doesn't ""happen every year with LeBron teams.""   I already laid out why the Lakers aren't real contenders in my first message. If you wanna count on AD to replicate his fluke Disney World efficiency that was higher than any other point in his career (and historically high) then be my guest. It's not gonna happen though and the rest of the Lakers team got worse.  Drummond and Harrell is a downgrade from Javale and Dwight. Harrell has been proven to be unplayable in the playoffs because of his terrible defense. Drummond is an awful player who will be out of the rotation soon. Gasol is even more washed than he was last year.  Danny Green was a huge loss, he's way better than Wes Matthews. Playoff Rondo was amazing last year, another huge loss on the floor and off the floor as a leader. And now he's on the Clippers which improves their chances a ton."
Probably Danny Green money.
"You're joking? Leaving aside Klay with injury, there's still Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart, mikal bridges, Covington, Danny green, OG Anunoby off the top of my head."
Lebrons has a million times better finals  performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green Than Jordan did vs plumbers like Jeff hornasec and Danny Ainge  You are a joke
Is there a reason Danny Green didn’t make this list?
"I consider a 3 &amp; D player someone that only focuses on those two aspects of the game, and doesn't really create shots for himself. So some on your list like Gordom Hayward and Tobias Harris aren't really 3 &amp; D players. Danny Green is a great example of a 3 &amp; D player imo."
Danny Green is shooting 41% this year and leads the league in corner 3s. Weird example
"Gasol was an integral part in our run. Defense and passing specifically. Shut down Embiid multiple times in a series that came down to the last shot.  Frankly we wouldn't have won without basically any of those guys, besides maybe Danny Green."
"This was good defensive recovery  Sure a paint shot might be higher % in a vacuum but this shot was way easier to generate and lower odds of a TO or offensive foul  I don’t think it’s because of a schematic preference for 3’s also, it’s bc ben picks up then doesn’t relocate off the pass so he’s basically not playing scoring offense anymore when he stands where he stood and knowing his skill set   If that were someone with a better jump shot and FT like embiid or AD it’d be different but Simmons is smart here to play to everyone’s strengths  Danny green bailed out the break by finally making space too, whereas Simmons had all but run into Harris lol"
"I suppose but I think guys like Mikal Bridges and Danny Green can fit anywhere.  They have proven that regardless of who the coach is  or who is setting them up, they can take and make threes and play high level defense at a high rate.  For Bullock I have no doubt about his shooting.  He’s like Joe Harris in that it translates anywhere it’s just the defense I hold skepticism on."
Especially when he's with Danny Green who is one of those shooters who's more likely to sink a 3 than an open layup. The Denver one from earlier in the year is 10 times worse.
I've been critical of that. Instead we kept the guys who become immediate liabilities when their shots don't fall because they make one stupid decision after the next in the Kieffs and Kuzmas of the team. If Danny green wasn't making shots he at least helped immensely on the team defense side of things. Schröder does not have good passing ability and is more of a scorer. Entire team chemistry is off on the floor as far as roles are concerned and they don't have much time to fix it esp when frank plays dumb lineups trying to appease these egos
Same here.  Rondo &gt; Schroder   Danny Green &gt; Wes   Dwight &gt; Drummond/Harrell
They would easily run through the west if they were fully healthy. Danny green and Dwight does not make this team any better. Especially for how awful Danny green was last year lol.
"True, but just like last year, the role players can't hit their shots, except Danny Green, but unfortunately he is in Philadelphia right now."
List of good nicknames:  - Evil Danny Green  - Dubious Handle
"&gt;Do you think a 3&amp;D wing (hard to find) and a solid center  I'm fairness we got Danny Green back for getting rid of Al Horford and his horrible contract (along with giving up a '25 first rounder, not a big deal). DG has actually been great for us on the floor and as a leader this season. We also got Seth for JRich straight up, while not quite a 3&amp;D, still a pretty big net gain and a starter for us. And then on the center piece, Dwight has been the first solid backup for Embiid we've had in years, and we got him for peanuts.  A good GM who has some patience can go a long way in grabbing quality under the radar pickups in this league without giving up a ton of assets."
Still better than Horford or Danny Green lmao
danny green wasn't awful   he was just paid 20 mill and other players were stepping up around him   he won't be missed
"Wouldn't be paying anyone a max contract. That cap space would have been used to overpay Wes Matthews and probably Danny Green. Or possibly Pat Bev, who's been played off the floor."
No Danny Green is Khris Middleton’s nightmare matchup
"Having a Ben Simmons, a thybulle, a Danny green and embiid will slow them down even if it’s just a bit but our offense can keep up with theirs, sure they’re more top heavy but yesterday all the sixers starters scored 14+, if the sixers can play at that level all series I got some real hope"
Good Evil Danny Green
"Sixers just don’t have enough shot makers to keep up imo, when your 2 best players are not outside threats (Embiids ok wide open but it’s not a big facet of his game), all the shooting comes from streaky role guys. Can you really trust them to outshoot the Nets? A lot lies on Danny Green &amp; Seth Curry’s shoulders to hit wide open 3s. If they’re off, it becomes a math issue, even if Embiid is dominating inside.  Bucks at least have the shooting to keep up - aside from Giannis, everyone’s a threat, and they take a ton. Defensively they match up better than anyone in the league. As good a shot as anyone imo."
sounds like you’re describing evil danny green as danny green  [send him to pop](https://youtu.be/bFFvShURQ5k)
"If you're talking about the Danny Green who leads the league in corners 3s this year, then yes we are"
"I agree with most of what you said but there's very few things Wes Matthews can do better than Danny Green, come on now. He can put the ball on the floor better but that's it, nowhere near as good a shooter and not as good in defence."
wait are we talking about the same Danny Green
"Mmmm me, he can't really create though. Offense looked meh when we ran through curry more early this season, also can't get his own shot easily and that leads to lower volume that i would like.  Feel like the team should shoot more all around actually. Except Danny Green, he has been great 40% on 6 attempts is so fucking sexy"
"man, this is some revisionist shit.  you know all the cancerous shit danny green dealt with during last year's playoffs?  lebron dealt with that first after we missed the playoffs in year 1. trade talks were a part of it."
If the Sixers won this year - Would Danny Green be the first person in NBA history to win 3 straight titles with 3 different teams?
evil danny green
every time Danny Green makes a corner 3 I say hes the best shooter in the world
Waltermart Danny Green

"Dillon ""Evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
Evil Danny Green 😈
Danny Green and George Hill are elite?
"Seth Curry, Danny Green aren’t playing the Ray role?"
It's funny Laker fans were talking about how washed Danny Green was yet he's lit it up for us on the Sixers lol.
Danny Green? You mean Washed Dillon Brooks 😤😤 /s
Danny Green playing like owes someone money
green of fucking danny aint like that
Is there any player that dribbles less often than Danny Green
Imagine being as good at anything as Danny Green is at shooting corner 3s
fuck danny green
"Danny Green has just been so good this year, crazy after the abysmal time he had with the lakers in the bubble."
Uh oh is Danny green gonna go on a hot streak?
Has Danny Green ever hit a heat check 3 like that? Lmao literally why shoot that
Danny.. fuckin green
Last year Al Horford would have attempted what Danny Green just did
"Philly this is a hot Danny “Icy Hot” Green game, DO NOT waste this"
Green of danny?
Danny Green shoots like this last year he’s still wearing purple and gold and we go 16-0 in the bubble playoffs
Woo! Fucking Danny Green!
Danny Green would like you all to know that you do not defend well enough
That move is why Danny Green is low key the shit
I’m surprised the Sixers are last with Simmons and Danny Green on the team.
Tobias throwing a risky outlet to Danny green is very puzzling
dont forget about danny green
"And? That’s why we have other metrics like PPP. If you want to know if someone is a good offensive player look at PPP. If we look at a player like Danny green, we don’t care about his PPP, really only his 3p%.   Shooting % matters in the given role a player plays. Yes, PPP is overall king, but the issue is that if you analysing certain players, PPP doesn’t matter.   It’s like saying Wiggins is a bad shooter because his TS% is bad. He’s actually a decent shooter, but needs to take better shots. Or Draymond is a bad player because of his TS."
"That might get them to finals, but they would still need to add Norman Powell and Danny Green to win it all."
Yeah if it was a straight Lowry for Thybulle trade it would have been fine. It's that we were losing 2 important players plus a promising young player for Lowry. Ppl don't realize how important danny green is for Embiid and Simmons to work well
"2003: Spurs trade the draft rights to Leandro Barbosa to Phoenix for a 2005 first-round pick  2005: San Antonio trades Malik Rose, the 2005 pick from Phoenix, and a 2006 first round pick for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer. Now, this wasn't bad, since Mohammed played a role in delivering the 2005 championship but then...  2005 NBA draft: New York Knicks draft David Lee with the #30 pick conveyed through the Malik Rose trade.  ----  2011: San Antonio trades George Hill to Indiana for the 15th pick (Kawhi Leonard) and the 42nd pick (Davis Bertans).  2018: San Antonio trades Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl, and a 2019 first round pick (Keldon Johnson)."
Bronson is good. Tim Jr is like Danny Green.  But KP is supposed to be a star not crap
"also Jrue, Thybulle, Siakam, Danny Green"
"Oh absolutely, he's been a beast. Though shooters that come to the Lakers typically lose their powers (Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, Wes Matthews, Schroder kinda) so maybe he would have fallen victim to that as well lol"
Coaches catch way too much blame for this. How many times did any of those coaches get to work with a contending calibre roster?   The raptors didn't just switch out Casey and suddenly win a championship. They also added kawhi and Danny green to an already competitive roster.
Your fans sent Danny green death threats. Check yourself
More like Danny Green with a missing chromosome
So he’s the real green ranger and Danny Green is the white ranger?
Dillon Brooks also known as Evil Danny Green.
Danny Green is the perfect guy to learn from.
"I was hoping Booker would be ok, but it really seems like CP3 being healthy was the win condition for him. Without CP3 out there, the passing and playmaking just isn't as crisp... it's not like the Suns are getting blown out. Ayton's really holding his own, which is something I'm pleasantly surprised with given how ""soft"" I thought he was at times during the regular season.   Crowder's defense is really his selling point. He's like Danny Green with a lot more size/bulk. You can count on his defense, but his shooting is extremely streaky."
"Not sure if they're better but Schroder definitely solves all the issues they had around a secondary ball handler. The loss of good athletic bigs I do think will hurt them, same goes for the loss of Danny Green."
"It's even crazier because I believe it was Chris Haynes or Marc Spears who did a piece a little while back about racism in Boston and how it impacts black players, interviewing like 30 former players. General consensus is that there's racism, but if your wear the green and white nowadays, you're shielded from it.   Danny should have never made a statement on this matter one way or another."
"I think Aaron Gordon would’ve been exactly what you needed, same with Jerami Grant. Maybe Danny Green is an option for next year, he’s still a good defender"
Evil Danny Green
"I also think it was made easier when matthews fell into their laps  He’s surely not the same off ball defender as green but on ball he’s done a phenomenal job and I think he might actually be a bit better?  I think even the most pessimistic take must acknowledge theyve mitigated a lot of the loss of Danny green (when they even want to, the scheme has ofc adapted a bit around Schroder)"
my favorite part about watching danny green is that every time he actually hit a 3 we'd rattle off a mini run   i was so hyped for every make
"This guy said scorers. If you can include anunoby and Danny green in that capacity then Melo, Nurk, Powell, and Kanter at times would also count."
"the raptors had like 8 threats. vanvleet, lowry, siakam, kawhi, gasol, anunoby danny green. bro you couldnt be more wrong lol edit: powell"
He seems physically limited in certain areas.  Danny Green was a good fit for the Lakers but getting Schroder in return was great for them. Eases the scoring and ball handling load for LeBron.
The Danny Green curse.
Lebron aint hitting no gamewinner in the Finals. too busy looking for Danny Green to pass it to
"Second half of the season Wes Matthews has really been the Danny Green replacement we were all hoping for. Playing solid defense and hitting timely threes, can’t ask for anything more from a minimum contract"
Didn't Danny Green used to do the same shit last year?
"Kuzma and KCP has been ass in shooting this series,  but then they are going all out in rebound making them still have value, they are playing like Danny Green last year  oh and Wes decide to turn up in playoff"
Didn’t your fan base send Danny Green death threats for missing a shot?  Don’t throw stones when you live in a glass house.
Tell that to Danny Green
"You need length...it's sad but it's the truth. I love our guys  But dudes with T-Rex arms like Tyler, Nunn, Dragic, just won't cut it.  And even though Bam has length, he just doesn't have enough offensive skills to make up for his lack of height vs legit defenders.  That's one of the reasons I'm so jealous of you guys and the 6ers. It's harder to find great lengthy/tall players with offensive prowess (Middleton, Giannis, Embiid, Simmons) ...but then when you do, you can go ahead and surround them (when able to) with snipers to space the floor when able to.  Helps too that Philly got one who can defend in Danny Green and you guys who got one in someone who can defend, play-make, and even shoot in Jrue.  I know you guys are going to (deservedly so) rag on us hard after you win next game...but I am still going to root hard for you guys to win it all!"
"Nah I don't care if his skin is Celtic green, fuck Kyrie. I'm talking about Danny Ainge being ""*this*close"" to pulling off every blockbuster trade in the past ~5 years. I hope he sees the Sixers with Danny Green, the Bucks with Holiday, and the Nets blow up their entire roster for Harden, and looks at where they are right now. Sometimes you gotta give up actual good assets to build a really good team."
I counter with Danny Green
I miss Danny Green cause dude isn't scared to let it fly when he's open
I legit thought he could be Danny Green but better.
"It only saw continued success against us last season because we had Simmons, Embiid, Harris, J-Rich, and Horford as our starting five. Our spacing was atrocious and none of them could reliably knock down threes to take out zones (Embiid and Harris shoot from the 3 better when they aren't just camping out at the line).   Now with Danny Green, Seth Curry, and George Hill off the bench, the zone is far less effective. Yes it will still work sometimes but only at times since any of those three can break the zone."
"Don't count out the Knicks. They have the cap space to sign Kawhi, Lowry, Ibaka, and Gasol to re-unite 4/7th of the players in the rotation on the Raptor's championship team. They could even get Danny Green too to make it 5/7 if he's a minimum contract player on his next contract."
Seeing Bryn Forbes light the Heat up is giving me Danny Green ‘13-‘14 vibes
"Kawhi and Kyle Lowry/CP3. Don't even need to give Lowry or CP3 the max though, so if they truly have enough for 2 maxes, then they could go Kawhi, one of the point guards, and then another high level role player.   Knicks could legitimately just sign Kawhi, Lowry, Ibaka, and Danny Green and add a solid portion of the Raptors championship team to their squad."
Playoff Joe Harris looking like the Nets version of Danny Green right now.
Wasn't it Danny Green bumping him on a dunk and causing him to land weird?
"John Collins, Bogdonavic, and Trae Young are their top three scorers. Hunter &amp; reddish averaged 15ppg &amp; 10ppg. That’s like saying the Sixers lost Danny Green and Curry. Third/fourth/fifth option guys. Everyone else that is injured is either a 1/2 option. You missed the point!"
"Why do people say if a team were built around Ben and put in a Giannis-like role, he would thrive more? Ben this year has a near 50/40/90 shooter in Tobias Harris who can give you 20+ ppg. Seth Curry, an elite 3 point shooter shooting 45 percent from 3. Danny Green, who has revived himself back into a 40+ percent 3 point shooter on over 6 attempts a game. He also has Kormaz and George Hill, who are both near 40 percent 3 point shooters (Hill lead the league last year at 46 percent shooting). You say he needs a stretch 5, but Embiid is one of the best shooting big men in the league, as he is one of the best mid range scorers and shoots 38 percent from 3. Simmons has great shooters all around him. Better than Giannis. But even with an ideal roster built around him, and great shooters all around him , he still can't dominate a game or thrive in a Giannis-like role, because he lacks aggression and he is not skilled enough to consistently score.    The thing is, when Embiid misses long stretches during the regular season, Ben has the opportunity to shine and maximize his offense, but he never does. When Embiid was out for that stretch of games in the regular season, it was Tobias Harris who played out of his mind and mostly carried the 76ers. Ben, more or less, had the same offensive output he has always had."
We really need to stop with this idea that Danny Green is what he used to be on defense
"I think people vastly underestimate how hard it is to shoot consistently at an NBA level. 3 and D players are highly sought after. Why doesn't every athletic player above 6'5"" just work on their corner 3 and get a fat contract? Fact is, it's not that easy, which is why even guys like Danny Green who get hot and cold still get $15m/year contracts."
"I might get castrated by the fan base for this, but maybe you take a gamble and do Embiid and Danny Green for Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, Minny 1st this year (probably 4th overall) and the Warriors pick (probably 14th overall)?"
Sixers since they have Danny Green and George Hill
"The suns actually have  the best chance simply because their healthy lol every other team is either missing a starter (AD/Murray/Ibaka/Conley/Harden/Kyrie/Danny Green, Embiid is not healthy either)   or a rotation piece (hawks w/ deandre hunter and the bucks w/ divincenzo)  injuries kinda sucked the wind out of this postseason, its never been this bad with so many big names out"
"I mean yea they did just look at the road ahead  The Nets with no Kyrie and likely no Harden  Sixers with no Danny Green but also a hurt Embiid with back issues and a torn meniscus  Out west Lakers are out, Nuggets had no Murray, and Jazz don't have Conley  Really only the Clippers and Suns are at full strength rn and even with the Suns CP3 has shoulder issues"
"Really, really gross game from the Sixers for reasons that I don't think I know how to articulate. It seemed like everything that worked for our offense in G3 took a backseat, and we played a lot of heroball.   It was really obvious from tipoff that this wasn't Embiid's game. I think he missed his first, like 6 shots? And they were all pretty standard middies that he's been hitting. The whole team started the game as if there was a lid on top of the rim, and just couldn't get anything to sink.  I know he had a great G3, but I think starting Korkmaz over Milton was a mistake. Kork had a really rough showing -- gambling too much on defense, dribbling in traffic a lot -- and I think it's pretty clear that you can't expect production out of him in starter-level minutes at this stage in his career. He's not cool and collected enough to be a Kyle Korver/Ray Allen/JJ Redick type of player, and his jumpiness was a big contributor to last night's loss. -13 in a 3 point game.  You have to wonder whether Danny Green would have been able to kinda calm things down like he did over the course of the season. When the team would get into spurts of heroball and disjointedness, you would always see Danny in the huddle telling everyone to calm down, and it feels like we missed that.  I still think the Sixers are coming out on top of this series, and [if this so-far-completely-correct corgi has anything to say about it,](https://twitter.com/JGBasile/status/1402350172781395969?s=20) I think the Sixers win the next two. But Embiid's health is suddenly a big, big flag, and we're going to need to hope he can get right before G5."
Yea thats why the Spurs lost and Danny didn't win...  In the first 5 games Green averaged 17 on 58/68 splits. 68% from 3 on 7 attempts!  Also matchups don't mean anything lol Duncan was still better than Kawhi. Iggy matched up with Bron and as a result won the finals MVP. Steph is still the better player  &amp;#x200B;  Tim Duncan in 2014: 15/10 with 1.9 blocks per game  Kawhi in 2014: 12/6 with 1.7 steals per game
"Kahwi was CLEARLY held back behind the big 3, you don't go from balling out against the #1 team &amp; player in the NBA, an elite defensive team btw, to role player in the reg season, doesn't work like that.    Kawhi was put on a leash behind subpar players, Tony Parker used to freeze Kawhi out of the offense &amp; dudes like Danny Green &amp; Patty Mills used to get more shots than Kawhi because of Pops system."
"&gt;Danny Green would have been the 2013 finals MVP if they won  Lol he scored 5 &amp; 3 in the final 2, Kawhi put up 19-16, 22-11 in these games, he more than outplayed DG for the series.  So ridiculous people minimize Kawhis great performance.  And it was Kawhi vs Lebron.  Parker was badly injured in 2013 &amp; 2014 finals, while TD was matching up against Haslem/Anderson and Manu was a bench player."
"Yeah, nobody has ever blamed a shooter for missing an open shot as long as it was the right choice, ask Danny Green."
"That is why I think the knee is bothering him. Embiid has always been that guy that can just put his head down and bully his way in for a basket but just can’t do it all game. If he does that, it’s easy to kick it out to the shooters they gave him.   This is where danny green is missed and how ben simmons also doesn’t pair well with him because he provides absolutely zero spacing potential."
"He wasn’t the alpha on the Spurs in 2014 lol that was still Tim and the big 3. Kawhi only took over in like end of 2016 to 2017  Danny Green would have been the 2013 finals MVP if they won  Also I agree that the big 3 is op but I was seeing people everywhere saying it wouldn’t work and that there was only one ball, no defense, and a lot of dumb shit  Even a week ago lots of people were picking the Bucks to beat the Nets fully healthy with Harden"
"Yeah didn’t want to add them in there. Lol think manu still coming off the bench with Jackson and tmac starting. Of course they start splitter cuz they always start splitter. Diaw and manu and Danny green would be a good enough bench. They can play big and still mobile with Jackson, kawhi, tmac and manu with Duncan. Holy cow"
Already is. Danny Green has missed too much time
Stepping in for Danny Green
He forgot to mention Danny Green though
"The Hawks have shot poorly because they’re playing against a very good defense. It’s not a coincidence this has happened now three games in a row. Once someone told Doc Rivers to put one of his two all-world defenders on Trae instead of Danny Green, it all changed."
Embiid making up for Danny Green not playing...
Danny Green would've helped too
At least now we know how valuable Danny Green is.
I mean they have 3 players all defense and that’s not including guys like Danny Green
that was largely due to sloppiness and Danny green guarding Trae the whole first half. We didn't adjust until the second half and by then it was too late
Atlanta really thought they’d sweep us after 1 good half when doc left Danny Green on an island alone to defend Trae lol
Danny Green was the key to less chaos..
We honoring Danny Green with all these bricks  🇺🇸
Danny Green was the glue all along
It is Korkmaz. It's dangerous to let Simmons and Thybulle having foul troubles at the same time without Danny green.
"No, the 2019 Raptors were. And I'm not just saying this as a fan.   All 5 positions were stacked with above average starters and the team simply made sense. No awkward chemistry or parts in that lineup. You would not be able to find a single person in that lineup that couldn't play defense.  PG - lowry as traditional point guard who runs the offense  SG - 3&amp;D perimeter defender in danny green  SF - kawhi the prototypical superstar 3 level scorer   PF - siakam as the lengthy rim running 2 way 2nd option   C - you can cycle through either a switchy 3 point spacing small ball center in ibaka or the playmaking rim protector in gasol"
Danny Green is the reason Klay was out the first year.  Hope that douche stays in the street clothes for the rest of the post season.
No bench coupled with the Embiid and Danny Green injuries and Simons lack of offense?
Let me introduce you to Danny Green.
"&gt; Lebron has a no-trade clause  No he doesn't.   https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/lebron-james/report-los-angeles-lakers-owner-jeannie-buss-being-pushed-to-trade-lebron-james/95-fe547d9b-f274-4890-a25a-ebf057ba9f39  &gt; The contenders don’t have any assets  Sure they do. The Sixers have their own first rounders for 21, 22, 23, 24, 26 and 27. They have a bunch of 2nd rounders. They have Simmons and Embiid. I'm not going to do this for you for every team.  https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed  &gt; no contender has a motherlode the Lakers want.  This hypothetical scenario has little to do with what the Lakers *want*. If LeBron says he wants out tomorrow, the organization knows he can make the situation really ugly for them. The organization won't just be trying to get back value, they'll be trying to do it as seamlessly as possible to stop it from becoming a fiasco. If teams thought they could just hold out for a pile of picks, the Spurs wouldn't have dealt Kawhi and Danny Green for DeRozan and Poeltl.  If you really want a matching trade, use the Trade Machine. Lots of options out there."
Yeah that “let’s put Danny green on Trae young instead of the runner up for DPOY” coaching
I remember nate duncan had booker under a bunch of guys like danny green when he ranked the top shooting guards.
You should see the Danny Green hate on our sub sometimes
"Stephen Jackson, Phoenix Suns version of Baynes, Patty Mills, Danny Green, Splitter and Diaw on the bench is a nice bench too."
"Danny Green pushed him in the air* With Klay, still think Warriors win."
"No, with that injury he was going up for a dunk and POS fucking Danny Green helped out in breaking his fall. But that was Game 6 and we lost so there wasn't an opportunity to bring him back."
The dumbass Nate Duncan said he would rather have Danny Green on his team over Booker. What a flatfoot.
"While I want the Bucks to win, I’d be happy with the Sixers for the Dwight repeat/Danny Green threepeat"
"There’s a reason klay is probably the best role player of all time, but he still is one. What star creates less than 5% of their own shots? What star creates very little shots for his teammates? His role is to run around and shoot 3s, and create spacing for his teammates. He’s one of the best players of all time at this role, but it’s a very specific role that you would never give to a star. Who’s role is more similar to klay’s in the flow of an offense? Jae crowder or lebron? Danny green or James harden? Klay is just a really great version of the 2 former players."
Lakers traded a 1st and Danny Green for a guy theyre probably gonna let walk this year.
Danny Green type beat
"If Harden and Kyrie remain injured, and with Danny Green out, I say yes. Especially if Mike Conley has a setback too, which he very well may."
You mean evil Danny Green?
"&gt;If you think Schroder is a better fit for the Lakers next year than Lowry would be, I’d say 90% of fans would disagree with you.  I would agree with your estimation.  It's also true that 90% of fans have no idea what they are talking about, and I'm not in that cohort.  The fact is that Schroder is exactly the fit they need.  It'd be nice if he could shoot better, but with respect to spacing, that's irrelevant, because teams don't slack off him to any meaningful extent -- which is exactly why he blows by so many defenders for layups.  &gt;Remember the game against the Raptors this year when Lowry absolutely killed us? Schroder is not capable of producing a game like that.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201803200UTA.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201803200UTA.html)  41/7 on 16 for 28 shooting against Gobert and the Jazz.  &gt;The fact is, in the playoffs, Lebron is the ball handler for 36 minutes a game and Schroder is not a floor spacer.  The fact is, they got Schroder precisely so that James would not have to handle the ball for 36 minutes every game.  And they traded 40% career shooter Danny Green to do it, exactly because the former was a higher priority than alleged spacing.  &gt; Id rather have Caruso, KCP, Kuz/Matthews, and AD out there with Bron.   Schroder had a better offensive rating than all of those players except Davis and James.  And if you think Matthews is an NBA caliber player, you are quite a bit dumber than I even previously thought.  &gt;And if i don’t want him out there in crunch time he sure as shit ain’t worth 20m a year.  Luckily for everyone concerned, your opinion on that matter is irrelevant.  Before forming such opinions, you need to equip yourself with the facts of the situation.  Almost every claim you have made is demonstrably wrong, and not surprisingly therefore, so are your conclusions."
"Funny how you “haven’t missed an OKC game in the last 10 years” yet literally everything you said in this comment was wrong. There are full games from that series available for anyone to see on Youtube. You can watch it yourself.   [Game 2](https://youtu.be/pPDnUrA8K0I)  [Game 5](https://youtu.be/Nz9BPKy68VM)  The only time Kawhi ever guarded KD in half court possessions was when Russ was off the court. In half court possessions when Russ was on the court, Kawhi was either guarding him or he was helping off Roberson and playing as a “free safety”. Watch every OKC half court offensive possession in the fourth quarter of Game 5. Soon as Russ checked back in, every possession had Kawhi hounding Russ while KD was in single coverage with Danny Green  “KD actually led the Thunder in on-off every single year” Net rating by year:  [2015-16](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612760&amp;VsPlayerID=201566&amp;Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs) - the year they beat a 67 win spurs in 6 and took the 73 win warriors to 7 - Russ was a +14.4. KD was only a +8.2  [2013-14](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612760&amp;VsPlayerID=201566&amp;Season=2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs) - the year they make the WCF without Ibaka or Sefolosha - Russ was a +20.3.

KD was a -0.7  want me to keep going? :) (btw the website graphic itself is sometimes off, scroll down to the table for the full accurate data)  Regarding on-off lineups:  [Lineups with Russ and no KD had a better net rating than lineups with KD and no Russ](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612760&amp;Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=201566,201142). Russ-only lineups had an offensive rating **15** points higher than KD-only lineups.   Let’s go back a few years: from their 2012 Finals run to their final 2016 WCF run, [Russ-only lineups were a **+4.84** while KD-only lineups were a **-4.43**.](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612760&amp;Season=2015-16,2013-14,2012-13,2011-12&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=201566,201142)"
"Russ finishing higher in MVP voting in 2015-16 is only a really small part of it. He outplayed KD in the regular season and the playoffs. KD himself called Russ the best player on OKC during that season.  Playoffs:   Russ - 25/7/11/3 on 52% TS  KD - 25/6/3/1 on 54% TS  This is while Russ was the primary focus of opposing defenses. The Spurs put back to back DPOY Kawhi Leonard on Russ while KD was guarded by Danny Green in the WCSF. KD was fucking awful in the first round (26/6/3 on 37/27/85 splits, 48% TS, most misses in a playoff game in the last 30 years) and they wouldn’t have won a single series without Russ.   Funny that you mention on off net rating as your argument for KD being “by far their best player”. Russ had over twice the on-off net rating as KD. [He was a +14.4, KD was +6.8 ](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;p1yrfrom=2016&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;p2yrfrom=2016) Russ also had a higher PER, OWS, DWS, WS, WS/48, OBPM, DBPM, BPM, and VORP."
Danny fucking green 😂 that’s gotta be a joke right?
"Danny Green, Jeff Green and JaMychal Green should all form a Mecha-Green and see if they can take out the Suns"
"the thing is, this was the first championship since 2011 that had only 1 top star and the rest was just a beautiful team constructed around them. Since 2011 most teams need at least 2 stars to compete for the chip, as was seen with Miami, GSW, Cleveland, and Lakers. Even the spurs had TD, Manu, and Tony parker, and even though they were past their respective primes, they were still excellent players. But the Raps had Kawhi, the superstar, the scorer who takes over in crunch time as well as an excellent 2way player, the facilitator and leader in lowry, the emerging star and secondary scorer in pascal, 3andD danny green, an aging yet still excellent defensive and playmaking center, and a bench unit that could get timely buckets with FVV, norm, and ibaka"
Go take a look at the top ten names in most made corner threes. It’s all highly effective guys like Danny Green and Mikal Bridges.
"This feels like the Danny Green situation again, where people were blaming him for being a dirty player when he collided with Klay in the Finals. It was an honest play on the ball that went horribly wrong, nothing dirty about that."
Danny Green matters.
Danny Green too.
"Sixers - Suns Finals would be fun, Simmons guarding his buddy Book. Embiid vs. Ayton. Plus Danny Green and Crowder in the Finals again. Also would be 6 straight non-Bubble finals with a Curry in it."
Danny Green on Klay as well.
Then the Bucks would have accomplished absolutely nothing considering they needed 2 of the big 3 to go out lmao  Also Embiid has a torn meniscus and Danny Green is out. This is a near gift wrapped finals trip for Bucks
"Lmao this series is just a repeat of the 2019 Finals with the Bucks being the Raptors and the Nets being the Warriors. And knowing Embiid's injury history and Danny Green injured, I could easily see the Bucks playing 2 series in a row against injury ravaged contending teams."
"Danny Green is out for the Sixers too. And knowing Embiid's injury history, I could easily see the Bucks playing the Sixers in the ECF with Embiid and Green out/missing many games. They just better not get the Suns on top of this. Biggest joke ever."
Is that yet another Danny Green?
"Reminds me of the idiots that think Danny green made a dirty play on klay  Stfu, injuries happen in sports."
"&gt;Can Giannis guard KD?  Giannis is more of a big, when you force him to strictly guard KD, you're not really making use of his defensive strengths, (shot blocking on the weak side, help defense, switching on the perimeter,) while Grannis's length and size/strength will help him guard KD at times; getting through screens, moving around constantly can tire him out.   Historically, the best defenders on KD, (and even then that's a huge hard task to ask of them,) are defenders like PJ Tucker, Tony Allen, Danny Green. Wings that can comfortably slide around screens, use their defensive saavy/instincts to still contest KD without fouling, and force him into tougher shots.   If the Bucks had the PJ Tucker from 2019, and not 2021, we'd be having r/NBA discussions about how great Tucker's defense is on KD right now."
Is your favourite player Danny Green?
"zero chance doc plays batum at center in game 7 vs dallas.  doc can make some boneheaded decisions and refuse to correct in-game (putting Danny Green on Trae in game 1 of Hawks-Sixers), which seems like a legitimate gripe about his coaching.  But the flipside of that stubbornness, is that key contributors going through cold spells get opportunities to turn it around. In this Hawks series, Doc kept giving the sixers' sixth man, Shake Milton, spot minutes, even though he had been in a cold spell for over a month going back to the regular season. In game 3, Milton finally erupted for 14 points in the 2nd half (4/5 from 3). That can seem like faith rewarded."
The man shot 40.5% on 6.3 attempts a game from deep and was one of the best in the league from the corner but every idiot fan still thinks he can’t shoot. It’s an interesting case study in confirmation bias.  Danny Green is still a good player.
I really hope they start him against the Nets if they get past us and they just might with Danny Green out. After what I've seen this post-season I can really see how good the 76ers are and I think they'll pose a much bigger challenge to the nets than people think and beat them with Harden out. If Embiid is killing Capela (a potential all defensive team center) he'll absolutely destroy Jordan or Griffin.
and danny green
How important is losing Danny Green in this series?
"""big negative""  Would it surprise you to know that this season Furkan is positive in defensive win shares (1.5) and defensive box plus minus (.1)? Kork's defense this year has actually looked rather competent, and the stats seem to back that up; he's not been a mess, especially on team D. He's not as good as Danny Green, but he's held his own, especially when with the starters. He should sub in fine for Green."
Doc wont get fired if he doesnt win in philly. The roster isnt complete. They have ben who cant hit FTs and danny green and george hill who arent supposed to be on the team. They have not fully healthy embiid.. there is zero chance doc gets fired if he doesnt win this season
Morey Magic. He also traded Al Horfords corpse for Danny Green
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
"It's a good thing you aren't a GM of a winning team like the Celtics, Sixers, Nuggets, etc. If you legitimately believe that a GM would prefer Russell Westbrook over Danny Green on any team above a .600 winning rate, you're delusional."
"The 76ers, Danny Green is out, and Embiid has a hurt knee"
Well other streaky shooters don't give themselves nicknames lol. If Danny Green called himself Playoff D he would probably get the same amount of hate after each bad performance.
"Jazz could easily lose especially if Mitchell is out. If he misses G4 it's pretty much going to be 2-2. We don't know when Conley is coming back  Nets depending on how Bud will throw his lineups, but they still have to win a game in Brooklyn to advance and they have been horrible without their fans in arenas in the playoffs against quality opposition  Hawks could steal a game or two more if their shooters get hot. They had uncharacteristically cold shooting in G3. Danny Green is injured and that could favour them  Jazz 60% 76ers 30% Nets 25% at this rate of blowing the 2-1 lead"
"Meh, not as hard as you'd think.  Of all the starters, he was certainly the guy we could afford to lose.  Overall, I'd rank him as the 7th most important player on the 76ers, in terms of actual gameplay contributions(not off the court stuff).  1.) Embiid  2.) Simmons  3.) Harris  4.) Curry  5.) Howard  6.) Thybulle  7.) Green  Especially against the Nets... having Green on Kyrie wasn't really going to be that viable.  Sure, Green is nice to have in case Thybulle fouls out... but he was getting torched on defense this series, and was cold as cold can be from 3.  When he's not contributing on defense, and is missing his 3's... he isn't contributing that much obviously.  Against the Nets with Kyrie being the guy he'd have to guard, and considering his cold streak... not sure if he'll be missed all that much.  Obviously it's nice to have him(especially if Thybulle/Simmons get in foul trouble), but life goes on(unlike if a guy like Howard, big 3 got hurt).  It's times like these that you're almost glad it was him, and not someone who would torch our chances of competing.  A hot Danny Green in a good matchup is a force to be reckoned with.  But it's not necessary, if other players step up.  If a guy like Howard went down however... there simply is no coming back from that.  It forces you to play Embiid 48 minutes(impossible, especially considering his injury), or play a guy like Mike Scott(horrible player), or make Ben a small 5(which he has historically really struggled with)."
Danny Green Injury Impacting Sixers?
"Yea im not sure how to reply to this.   Yes he is worth the money teams choose to pay him.  Just like every other player in the league is, right?  Lol   But we were talking about overpaid and i was just saying how his value is 150% higher than what OP said so theres a different calculation there.   As far as what you said im not sure how to calculate that.  He won one title at $15/mil and was promptly traded.   He won one title at $10 mil/year after being traded (practically a throw in with the kawhi trade).  He won his other title making a little under $4 mil/year.  So theres only been 2 teams that have paid this much for danny green and one of them chose to trade him instead of pay him."
It's fine. Danny Green is the protagonist. He'll come back when it truly matters in the finals and win another consecutive title
Praying for a speedy recovery.   Love Danny Green.
"You said earlier that Danny Green was the reason the Clippers won the championship, THE CLIPPERS. I rest my case, you don’t know basketball"
&gt;I would love for Danny Green to be apart of a Clippers championship run  Then you better find a way to get rid of PG.  No way anyone is winning anything with him... not even DG can overcome that.
I would love for Danny Green to be apart of a Clippers championship run I really really do but sadly that never happened and a 50 point loss that happened in December to the team we eliminated from the playoffs means nothing
&gt;Danny Green is the reason the Clippers(and Lakers) won their championships.  lol I'm done you have no clue what you’re talking about
"People keep saying this but the 76ers also got back a starter in Danny Green for al horford. We could not have offered something like Green, I doubt we could have gotten horford."
"Yeah KD is one of the few dude who still talks his stuff, but I don’t blame anyone for PR-ing themselves.   These are “fun” narratives for people but these are peoples lives who get talked about, PG had to like lock his and his families instagrams and stuff, Danny Green getting death threats, etc."
"Danny Green deserves more respect. I get he's inconsistent and maybe overpaid, but even at his current age he is a very useful player for any team. At his peak, he was setting finals 3 pt records, while being an elite defensive player. He was the best transition defender I've seen. The man plays winning basketball, and spurs fans will always love him."
"Danny Green is the starting SF, not SG. How can Charania mess up this bad?"
"Thybulle should have gotten his minutes anyway, Green is so maddeningly inconsistently the playoffs it’s not a big deal  Edit: Danny Green on KD or Harden or Kyrie wasn’t going to be playable anyway"
Danny Green is an overrated defender. He could barely guard Trae. Nets would have cooked em anyways
"hmm Ok,     1. Parker    2. Danny Green 3. Kawhi    4. Lamarcus    5. Duncan    6. Patty    7. Manu    8. David West    9. Diao     That's all I can remember, maybe Jonathan Simmons was already on the roster too, he certainly didn't play much though."
Danny green was a 40 percent three point shooter in the regular season while playing adequate to good defense. He has struggled in the playoffs and the sixers can replace him with the bench rotation. But he's still a good contributor this year.
"I’m not saying we’re a real contender, but we’re better than people think, and the team is still super young. So you’re gonna get games were everybody plays to their potential and we dominate for a stretch at least and we’re never really out of the game. We’re playing without Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish right now as well, and game 1 was our first game without Deandre Hunter and sixers had to gameplan like he would be out there which is why they started off with Danny Green on Trae."
Nah that’s Danny green
no because there were 15 seconds left and both teams had timeouts  exactly. Lebron gave up the final shot to danny green
Why’d they trade Danny green for him
"As long as Danny Green doesn't take a dribble, I'm ok with that tbh"
"AD sucks, kawhi sucks, Murray definitely sucks. Danny green is awful. Half of those others guys weren't injured more than a game"
nah he'd probably pass up the last shot to Danny Green
People forget the **Sixers were 32-7** with Danny Green and the other four starters— he made them a Number 1 defensive unit.   And we know that Embiid was going off with a tear in his knee— **imagine if he was 100%** because it is better Shaq stats
"Don't forget Embiid, Danny Green, DeAndre Hunter.    It's insane the number of starters that have missed the playoffs this season due to injury."
"Danny Green, but a lot better"
"Lakers - AD, LeBron (played through injury)  Nuggets - Murray, Barton  Clippers - Kawhi, Morris (played through injury), Zubac, Ibaka (out for series)  76ers - Embiid (played through injury), Danny Green  Hawks - Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Bogdanovic (played through injury)  Bucks - Giannis, DiVincenzo (out for series)  Knicks - Robinson  Nets - Kyrie, Harden (played through injury), Jeff Green  Jazz - Conley, Mitchell (played through injury)  Mavs - Luka (played through injury)  Heat - Oladipo  Celtics - Jaylen, Kemba  Wizards - Avdija, Thomas Bryant, Bertans  Suns - Payne, CP3 (played through)"
They only gave up Danny Green and a first round pick so it wouldn’t really hurt that much if he left. Yeah they can’t replace his production but paying him over $80M could really put a chokehold on trying to contend since they already have 2 max contracts
"I think Spurs fans tend to overreact to Kawhi’s departure. Did Kawhi’s camp handle it well? No. But what did his poor communication ultimately cost you? *One* season where you could’ve contended but didn’t? Losing Danny Green aka NBA Twitter’s punching bag? Twilight-years Parker going to Charlotte? I mean y’all act like he left some trail of carnage on his way out, but what long-term ramifications has he really caused? The organization’s rep is still intact, and it isn’t his fault your roster is underwhelming without him. I just don’t think the vitriol is warranted by whatever atrocities (or lack thereof) he befell you"
Not your stars tho. That’s like saying Sixers lost Danny Green and Nets lost Jeff Green..
"Yeah, but in 2019, you had the shooting of Danny Green to play SG and Rondo too. Lose Schroeder and you’re running out of depth."
Forbes is worse than Danny green
"I agree Jackson is arguably the better coach, but the way this worded makes Pop seem carried by Duncan and blames him for Kawhi which is 100% not true. Duncan as good as he was wasn't the reason Tony Parker, Ginobili, Kawhi all developed into good players. This also doesn't take into account the insane amount of player Pop brought the best out of players like Patty Mills, Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, George Hill, Danny Green, Dejuan Blair, and the list goes on. The guy is a minimum Top 5 coach all time minimum and I would go even as far as to say he's probably higher than that. I think the idea that he's overrated is just simply not true."
"I can see that you're not blaming players for this, but for anyone who thinks players (or even just stars) should try to stay in one place, remember what they did to DeMar DeRozan, a perennial all-star starter, beloved by the fan base, coming off a year where he became a plus defender, averaged 28 ppg, and improved his 3 pointer as well while leading the team (along with Lowry) to the 1st seed (although in the East, and although no one really thought they were going to come out of the East over the Cavs and Celtics, still an accomplishment). They traded him for an injure Kawhi Leonard. Obviously, Kawhi was a big addition for the Raptors, but they used that DeRozan was underpaid, since he'd taken a loyalty discount when he could have made more money for the Lakers close to home, and because that made his contract more valuable, they were also able to get Danny Green. They treated him like a stepping stone, an asset. So don't expect players to trust the franchises beyond exactly what the contract says.  See also, Isaiah Thomas."
Damn honest wonder who Danny Green is playing for next year Ben is un-tradable he’s a sixes next year
&gt;My brain glossed over Danny and I thought this was Draymond talking.  Happens.  Source: friend was SUPER excited to pick up 'D. Green' in fantasy thinking it's draymond. Was Danny 🤣
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
Evil Danny Green
"""We really blaming Doc for Ben Simmons not being able to shoot?""  That's not a thing I said or I read in any of the replies to my comment, so no, we really not doing that.  ""Simmons has been in the league for 5 years and Doc has been his HC for 1.""  Yes, these are two basic facts that I think everyone commenting here already knows.  If you want to respond to what I commented, I was wondering if Danny Green was criticizing both Ben for not pushing himself and Doc for not pushing Ben and setting high enough expectations.    I also made another comment about how Danny might interpret this in light of this being a year Ben was seen as regressing instead of improving, and in light of Danny's past experience being pushed by one of the best coaches ever in Pop.    Do you have thoughts on that stuff?"
"Danny green, famous for wording things well. He had to do it one time"
Fuck Danny green
You know you screwed up when Danny Green getting a few words in
I mean Danny Green makes 15 mil a year and Jae makes 10. Those ain't cheap contracts does Utah have the cap space for that sort of contract?
"This is minimalistic. A guy can be a non-contributor on the court and still have a huge impact on the team itself. Danny Green and his championship pedigree was huge for us, even though he shat the bed in the playoffs. Experience matters. Leadership matters. The game isn't just about the ball bouncing."
What you mean. I also need a ranking for all 29 possible destinations for Danny Green.
"He shot 37% last season and 39% this season. Every role player is streaky. Danny Green is the stereotypical 3&amp;D guy that contenders want, and his nickname is Icy Hot because of how streaky he is"
DANNY GREEN TO THE JAZZ CONFIRMED  ^^^please ^^^:(
Danny Green speaking facts
"still I would imagine being a former teammate of someone would come with some camaraderie, also Danny Green not the only one to speak on Ben Simmons publicly"
Does Danny Green think he's helping Ben Simmons by defending him this way? That's horrible haha.
"TBH some of the best 3&amp;D role players in the league have been found outta nowhere. The Jazz already found one in Royce O'Neale. There's also guys like Jae Crowder, Dorian Finney-Smith, Danny Green, Josh Hart etc."
"His play in the 2nd half of game 7 with an injured leg, Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard hounding him, and Tim Duncan giving help D, made me a believer."
"Caron Butler, Matt Barnes, Luc Mba Moute, Danny Granger, Reggie Bullock, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, Josh Smith, Lance Stephenson, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson. Who was their missing piece in my opinion? Joe Ingles who they had and cut from the team without even touching the floor."
But this comes down to the nature of a player's departure.  Danny Green? George Hill? Always happy to see them succeed. I was hoping LMA could get success with Brooklyn. Kawhi - not so much.  Minny fans were probably pretty happy to see KG get a ring in Boston. Im not sure how Toronto fans felt about Bosh - but I don't think it was far off. He gave his all for the team when he was there. But ask them about VC (at least those who are old enough) and you would get a completely different story.
"Star, no. He's reaching Spurs Danny Green playoff levels here though"
Danny Green. Best transition defender I've ever seen
i scrubbed through jeremy lin danny green interview but I may be mistaken on the episode. I distinctly remember it being after they won the championship. During the Lin/green interview mid season around 18 min they talk about how lowry kinda does his own thing not explaining plays well so its up to green to teach people how offense works. Then later in episode he says lowrey shows up to practice in sweats and a towel and kinda does whatever he wants. This was in middle of season tho not after  &amp;#x200B;  Ill have to rewatch some episodes of the green room to find the coaches telling em stuff.
Danny Green. He stopped LeFreight Train so many times I lost count.
Thats Danny Green I think
That one year with the cavs bought him an extra season thanks to Danny Green.
"weird Q but do you remember what part of the podcast this was? i just tried to scrub through but didn't catch it. that locker room is lowry's through and through and would be surprised if management, which was already tense with lowry in the early months of the season, asked Lin (lol) and Danny Green to hold him accountable."
If Morey can get Danny green for a 34 year old center who was owed 27 million the next year.  He can get a lot more for a player a decade younger and coming off his third straight all star year and first time on all D.
"Sorry I didn’t realize you wouldn’t have the ability to interpret what I said instead of taking it literally  Also… if you do trade Beal (again, a big if) you should be embracing a rebuild. And getting Ben doesn’t mean you have to keep him. Teams will often have a second trade lined up, such as the potential Maxey for Lowry trade this season. Raptors weren’t going to keep Danny Green in that trade, they had another team prepared to flip Green to for more picks/young players"
"He said the exact opposite:  &gt; “I think it is a mistake that people think that he doesn’t care, I guess by his tone, his mannerisms, whatever it would be in press conferences,” Green said in a wide-ranging Zoom interview Monday. “And by his actions, you can see in his play that he cares. He’s a little afraid of certain things because of how his interviews go, he doesn’t show much, I guess emotions, but believe it or not, he cares and it hurts him more than anybody.”  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;“He’s a bigger critic than anybody about himself, and it hurts him deeply he wasn’t able to be himself and help his team win because he knows what is at stake,” said Green, a pending free agent. “He wants to win and it is going to hurt him this summer, the way it will hurt us.”  [Source](https://www.inquirer.com/newsletters/sixers/sixers-ben-simmons-eastern-conference-semifinal-struggles-danny-green-20210623.html)"
Bruh he really is evil Danny green
"No, I know, never meant to say Lillard mails it in, just that Pop (and this is pushing that same style to Hammond) doesnt like mistakes on defense and Lillard (and for that matter McCollum) have never been considered stalwarts in that department.   Tony Parker was yelled quite a few times for this and for other mistakes on the court, even when he was the main guy. Same with TD and Manu at their peaks. Kawhi got some earlashings as well, and Danny Green, Kyle Anderson, George Hill, and many more have been victimized by Pop.   This is assuming Hammond would follow a similar style, which may very well be not the case."
Nobody you named is better than the 76ers players. LOL  Nor have the experience as them.  So how will they make a difference?     Who's shooting better than Danny Green?  What about Tobias?  Orrrr how about Seth Curry? George Hill?
"That's true, I think he is worth significantly more than a minimum and that sounds about right. Looking at contracts it does get a little harder justifying paying a premium for such niche situations when at that price you can get quality role players like Marcus Smart, Danny Green, Dejounte Murray, Christian Wood. Granted some of those players are team friendly contracts but still."
"Dillion ""Evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
 Danny Green basically said Ben Simmons has no inner drive unless someone inspires him to do something   That's insane
“U mean the Evil Danny Green?”
Danny Green said that Kawhi told him he wants to stay in San Antonio like 2 weeks before he requested a trade. I'd be surprised if Lillard is on the blazers for the 2023 season and I think it's a tossup for the 2022 season. This stuff wouldn't be leaking out unless Lillard was trying to get off the team. There's basically nothing the blazers can do to seriously improve the team unless they trade all their future firsts they can
"I feel you, that's how I felt about Danny Green this year. But that's because Green and Clarkson get respect from behind the three point line. Their gravity is useful even if they aren't putting up points necessarily. Rubio doesn't get that respect."
"Really dude, FVV is one of the best PG defenders in the league. All defense teams aren't a great indicator of who the best defenders are, voters really aren't good at rating them due to defensive metrics being pretty bad and most having no idea how to judge off ball defence. E.g. Jrue Holiday making it just 2x before this year or Westbrook constantly getting votes for all defence.  Giving multiple guys from the same team all defence is very very rare and voters tend to spread it out a lot.   I think Siakam was absolutely a top 10 defender, so was Kawhi. Danny Green made all defence just 2 years ago and looked even better in 2019. Lowry is a known great defender.   That team looks like it was designed in a lab for switching playoff basketball. Siakam and Kawhi can guard 1-4/5, Lowry and FVV can guard pretty much any 1-2 and absolutely hounded GSW shooters over multiple screens. And all of these players have high defensive IQ with a creative defensive coach. Not sure I can really think of a playoff defence that was better than them in the past 15 years."
"he's so fucking bad and gets absolutely roasted on defense. imagine having him and curry on the floor at the same time with Tobias and, who, Danny Green? lord help us. Embiid would demand a trade after next year."
"Maybe lowry will settle for mle? It enables u guys to resign danny green,dwight and korkmaz. Sign and trade basically makes ur bench weak"
"How much offensive load is he given right now? He's the what? 3rd option? 4th option? I'll go Embiid, Curry, Harris before I ask Simmons for a bucket. Might even put Danny Green and Dwight ahead of him too"
"Danny Green must be back to his Spurs days, cause he did not miss on this statement."
Lowry is a free agent.  Turning simmons to beasley and rubio will make sixers worse.  They have seth curry who is a better shooter and danny green might take a paycut there.
"Middleton, Gobert, and Siakam are the 3 all-stars with G league experience  RoCo, Whiteside, Danny Green, and JJ Barea are noteable players with long careers  The NBA has over the years steadily gained in its percentage of players who have G league experience, as the G league has developed and improved its perception by NBA teams"
"Me desperately hoping Morey can work his magic to somehow replace Simmons with Dame. I mean he managed to turn Horford and Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry so maybe it just might be possible smh  Everyone who's not a Suns, Bucks, or Hawks fan is in shambles rn basketball sucks (jk I'm looking forward to a Suns - Bucks (most likely) final but the fallout of these playoffs has been rough for most teams it seems.)"
Danny Green nodded
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
Danny Green
"He was injured and the available bodies were at center.   Injury means you can't go up a position as easily. Available bodies at center means coach is playing them, Lakers didn't have good enough small guys healthy with Danny Green traded the previous off-season , KCP injured and the rest of the smaller guys not doing well"
Danny Green was big for us
Celtics for sure I believe (could just me being biased but hear me out) if we traded Jaylen and smart since he’s a FA after this year and will probably be too much to keep them whatver picks or bench guys they want we already improved offensively by a good amount we just lose smarts defense which will be big but we can fill that gap with guys like josh hart Danny green Diallo just a thought tho
Didn’t y’all allow Danny Green to play with a torn groin that ended his prime?
"What? 2019 Raptors:  Lowry, FVV, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Siakam, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Norm Powell, Chris Boucher…  They were stacked. They won the ship and probably would have ran it back the next year if they kept their horses.  A healthy Nets from this year would beat them but not sure any other team would in 7 games."
You mean like Joel Embiid (who played) and let me check... Uh Danny Green?
Danny Green
Danny Green too
"Don’t sleep on the 2009 draft, it had Blake, Harden, Tyreke, Curry, DeRozan, Holiday, Danny Green, and a bunch of good role players throughout the draft."
"Hitting a guy when he's elevated isn't a basketball play dude he literally slapped Klay's arms and elbowed his head while he was in the air, [either Danny Green is clumsy or that was 100% intentional.](https://youtu.be/oF_zSEbNL0c?t=94)   🙄🙄🙄"
If we're calling this a foul then we need to retroactively say that Chris Bosh fouled Danny Green at the end of Game 6 in 2013.
Danny Green
throw in Maxey and Danny Green and then we're talking
"Severity of what Zaza did to Kawhi is overrated. You see those closeouts all the time. Furthermore, Kawhi already injured his ankle before that possession and you see Aldridge and Danny Green pulling the same shit all series. Zaza has a lot more despicable gamesmanship elsewhere."
I guess Danny Green is a legend then?
"TF Danny Green do to Golden State?  Also, the Phoenix list is hilarious."
doc did the dame thing putting danny green on trae and that combined with meltdowns cost us the series.  one game matters. you cannot throw anything away in the playoffs.
"&gt;Yeah they took it on in exchange for another bad contract.   So follow my logic here....they use Kuzma's contract like they did Ricky Rubio, Danny Green, and Kelly Oubre to facilitate another deal which nets them more future value along with possibly a worse contract"
"I mean Danny Green was 33 when you traded for him, but you found a way to flip him. I dont think Kyle Kuzma is that unflippable on his current deal even if you dont think hes that good"
"He was a good role player and that's it, a role player.  The equivalent of him being mentioned in the HOF would be Danny Green."
"They were beat because of injuries, not because the teams they played were better. That’s my issue with this whole thing. Yeah I get we can’t know what would have happened, but let’s be real here. The bucks would have lost 10/10 times, hawks lose 8/10 times if embiid doesn’t have a torn meniscus and Danny green plays, suns sure as hell wouldn’t have beaten the lakers or nuggets. Don’t know what to think about the clippers series but I think the jazz got kinda exposed. Maybe have a healthy Conley and Mitchell wins it for them but kawhi most likely would have went terminator mode and won.  Yeah injuries are a part of the game, but this many injuries is just insane and is a direct result of the shitty scheduling."
"Tony, Manu, Kawhi, LMA, and Tim is an all-time great starting lineup along with great role/bench players in Danny Green, Patty Mills, David West, and Boris Diaw. They were legit 10 man deep as a team. All those players could've been starters on playoff teams. Not to mention they played for Pop who I consider to be the GOAT coach. That's better than any team that Harden has ever played on."
That Horford trade was amazing. Only one important pick and you got Danny Green
"2018 Cleveland was in the finals so LeBron was his link, last year it was Danny Green when they played together in Cleveland. It still lives on, but I think this year it might come to an end"
Funny watching Sixers fans shit on KCP. No doubt in my mind you were doing the same shit to Danny Green last year after his horrendous playoffs performances and then proceeded to fall in love with him once he joined your squad.

"I think if Kawhi re-signs there, they had a great chance to go back. Pretty much the same team, just missing Danny Green and we saw how good they were in the bubble, without Kawhi."
" in 2019 there was Danny green and marc gasol  in 2010 and 2008 ray allen  in 2009 dwight howard  in 2006 dwade  in 2005 and 2004 ben wallace   in 2002 and 2003 there was Richard jefferson  i can make the streak up to that point, i dont think i can with 2001"
"I remember when I started watching nba and I played 2k14, I was convinced Danny green was the best player of all time"
"The Sixers were one win away from ECF and a very good shot at the title. In a run where JoJo was playing injured, Danny Green was out, not only Ben but even Tobi played like ass. They don't HAVE to trade him when his value is the lowest. They can run this team back and be a top seed again. Either a team comes in with an offer that the Sixers like or Ben stays."
How tall are danny and draymond? Green
"Wade averaged 19.6/4.6/4 in the finals on 48% shooting (although, hilariously, he did not attempt a three in the series). He also still played excellent defense. The Heat only averaged 97 PPG in the series, so Wade scored over 20% of the team's points over the series.   LeBron shot 45% from the field in the series, and scored just over 25 points.   Bosh was mediocre to bad on offense during the series, but played stellar defense.  You're also neglecting that the Heat had a perfect supporting cast, who were lights out from three. Chalmers, Ray Allen, Mike Miller and Battier combined to shoot 48/99 from three, which is insane.   It was truly a balanced effort and young Kawhi was insanely effective against Bron, as well as having old Duncan as an anchor at the rim.  Also, I love that Spurs team, but they're historically overrated. Duncan was 36, Parkers was their best player but was hampered by a strained hamstring, Kawhi was in his second year in the league, and Manu was washed and had a horrific series. They had very good role players, mostly Diaw and Danny Green, but this was not some stacked team on talent alone.  I still think 2013 is the best version of LeBron, but to insinuate the 2013 finals was a carry job is beyond ridiculous."
Cause Spurs Danny Green was an incredible shooter.
"Unironically this team could use more role players like Danny Green, Reddick, Seth Curry, or even Duncan Robinson because off ball movement is nearly non-existent because everyone on the team is so used to being the star on their team that they forgot how to do the little stuff.   I mean look at how different Olympic Melo was from NBA Melo, he was pretty much the off-ball/catch and shoot threat on past Team USA squads because he realized that he doesn’t need to be the iso player in the international stage.  None of the players, except for Beal on some occasions, seems to realize that they need to stop playing like stars and actually play basketball like a team game. Before they realize this, this squad won’t go too far in the Olympics."
"They were probably talking about Danny Green and Gerald Green being second cousins, since they were playing against each other."
"Fair, there's a lot of faux earnest troll posts here that come up so I was unnecessarily snappy.  To give some more context, Jackson actually did a good job in 2012-13. But in retrospect, it's clear some of the things he did very well were not necessarily intentional. If anything, I'm actually more critical of Jackson's coaching job that season than I used to be.  On the second game of the year, Brandon Rush tore his ACL. Rush's career never recovered. But before that point, he was a very solid 3+D wing who figured to peak as a Danny Green type. Harrison Barnes was already slotted in as the starting SF, but he then got thrust in 25-30 minutes a game. Andrew Bogut, who was acquired the season before while he was recovering from an ankle surgery, played the first games of the season, and then didn't play again until February or so.  So only 5 games into the season, the Warriors' were down two of their top 6-7 players. Under those circumstances, Jackson was forced to make adjustments and he actually made some really smart ones. Draymond Green got rotation minutes as a rookie, even though he was an even more horrific shooter than he is now. He was very useful even though he shot badly AND he was playing the 3 with Richard Jefferson at the 2 (mind you, RJeff killed the Warriors in the playoffs 3 years later at the 4). The Warriors frequently closed games with Steph Curry/Jarrett Jack/Klay Thompson/Carl Landry/David Lee lineups. Back in 2012-13, those teams had more spacing than other NBA teams and Lee's defensive shortcomings were masked with him at the 5. The Warriors surprised a lot of teams that year and Steph Curry really turned it up to end the season after being snubbed for what should have been his first All-Start appearance.  In the first game of the 2013 playoffs, David Lee tore his hamstring off the bone. The next game, Jackson went small with Barnes at the 4 and Jarrett Jack at the 2 and the Warriors quickly took control of the series. Steph had spacing around him and with Bogut setting screens, he tore apart the Nuggets and upset them as the sixth seed.  The Warriors then faced the Spurs, who they hadn't beat in San Antonio in nearly 15 years. The Warriors came within a possession of taking game 1 in overtime and Steph Curry had 42 points. There was a defensive breakdown at the end of the game that fucked things up, but it was clear the Warriors were not a fluke. They beat the Spurs decisively in game 2 when Klay Thompson got very hot. It looked like the Warriors might actually win that series, but Steph hurt his ankle and played decoy in the final two games of the series, and Bogut also reinjured his ankle and was very limited in the end of the series.   But in the final games of the series, Greg Popovich figured outsmarted Jackson in a way that later seemed prophetic. He put Tony Parker on Harrison Barnes and because the Warriors had a perceived mismatch, they fed Barnes in the post over and over again and Barnes had high volume scoring performances in the final games of that series. But the problem with a Barnes-centric offense is that it takes the ball out of the hands of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. The Spurs won the math battle in those final games of the series and Popovic figured out a very exploitable flaw in Jackson's philosophy, which is that Jackson will attack ""mismatches"" whenever he sees them."
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Danny Green last year this sub.
"Yah, Danny Green is the prototype 3&amp;D wing. Nearly all of his shots are spot-up 3s, and a decent chunk of them are without a defender within range to contest as whichever star teammate is on the floor with him draws the attention of the defense.  Harden and Lillard take frequent off-the-dribble, highly contested shots, and almost NEVER have wide open 3s, so it's only natural their 3pt% is lower. Plus, they're expected to take at least double the amount of shots Green is.  That's not to take away from Danny Green though. There's a reason he has multiple rings and is always in demand by playoff contenders. He's also genuinely one of the best transition defenders of all time. When he was on the Spurs he'd semi-frequently stop 2-on-1 and even 3-on-1 fast breaks, which for most other defenders is an automatic bucket."
"Here's a fact about Klay Thompson that pretty much sums up his impact as a player:  Of the all-time top-50 players in 3pt% (coincidentally, everyone above 40%), only three players have made an All-Defensive team: Raja Bell, Danny Green, and Klay Thompson. Here are their stats:  • Raja Bell: 10ppg, 40.6% from deep  • Danny Green: 9 ppg, 40.1% from deep  • Klay Thompson: **19.5** ppg, **41.9%** from deep"
People love to hate on Danny Green but he’s like the perfect role player at the 2 spot. Can be trusted to guard anyone on the perimeter whether it’s a wing or a smaller PG. Streaky but he’s good enough to where you can never just leave him open. You HAVE TO close out on him. That’s beneficial even if he’s 0-10. He doesn’t have multiple rings for no reason. Def knows what it takes to win. And he knows his role in that and does it well. Great locker room guy too. Guys like that are essential to championship teams. HOF Role player forsure. Would’ve killed to have him instead of Andre Roberson in the middle of the 2010s.
"It's refreshing to see a teammate willing to actually have Bens back, that's gotta feel good considering you have Danny Green pretending his opinion matters, Glenn Rivers trashing you directly after the game, Embiid throwing you under the bus, your own fans lighting your jersey on fire, etc. Am I the only one who thinks you're a casual if you actually think Ben Simmons isn't an above average player?"
No he didn't. We missed the playoffs 2 out of 3 years with him when he basically replaced Danny Green
&gt; Or he's just in a fuck it mentality  Danny Green is 34.  He only has a few years left and everyone knows what he brings to the table. He is not going to get run out of the league for a very reasonable quote.
"It's also just that's where he's at in his career.   Danny Green isn't a star but he's established enough that he can speak his mind without worrying about his market value tanking.  24-year-old Danny Green couldn't afford to speak like this or he'd be labeled a disruptor and have a harder time finding a team to play for.   Everyone knows current Danny Green can step onto just about any team and immediately contribute, so there's no real risk of being alienated."
"Wasn’t Danny Green the same guy who, in the 2020 finals, shot so many bricks that he *actually* rebuilt Atlantis?"
"He is 3 and D  Also if not him choose from a ton of role players like Jae Crowder, Danny Green, DFS etc"
He’s just a 3&amp;D player. Role player shooters are streaky. Danny Green especially is known to be streaky. It’s why he’s called icy hot. Nothing bad happened to him. He had an insanely good shooting year with the Raptors and was back to his normal self with the Lakers and sixers
"I haven't really been keeping up with Danny Green lately, but what happened to him? I remember him being a pretty good 3-pt shooter on the Spurs. I think he broke a record for 3-pointers in a playoff game in their championship year."
"Laker fan here…Danny Green criticizing pad shooting is the epitome of the pot calling the kettle black.  When he was with the lakers, his defense was the only thing keeping him on the court.  He could hit a key shot in any game.   Of course, the moment he leaves, he gets his stroke back. But pretty amazing how he has forgotten how bad his shot was during the laker championship run last season."
Danny Green can be 0-10 in a game and he still would take the open shot. Perfect mentally for a shooter.
Danny Green acting like he wasn't an absolute walking brick during the lakers playoff run
Atleast he consistently can't shoot. Danny Green decides he doesn't know how to shoot everytime the playoffs role around
This is a horrible take. Danny Green is an elite defender and his 3-point percentage was not as bad as everyone was trying to make it out to be last year. Green is definitely a winner. Why would you ever replace green with a person who actually blew the game for their team in the finals?
That is how the person I replied to framed their comment. They literally said “[danny green] won for [the Lakers]”. You have to be braindead to think that. They also insinuated that the Lakers had a bad season because Danny green left. Learn how to read idiot. Lol.
Obviously no one thinks Danny Green is a superstar. Lol.
anyone ever see danny green and lionel ritchie in the same room?
This man is trippin. No laker fan wants Danny green back
"What about this is a hot take? It's straight facts. Duncan was nowhere close to as-good as you'd like to believe he was. The inconvenient -- for you -- fact is that without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard, Duncan's Spurs were unremarkable defensively -- even with Danny Green ( and Popovich ). Robinson was better without any of those players, or Popovich.Which is why Robinson won DPOY and Duncan never came particularly close. Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated Spurs defenses without Duncan. Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th. Speaking of which, why was Bowen 4th in DPOY in 2004, compared to Duncan's 7th? Duncan had a whopping 8 points in that vote."
"Wait... you think Danny green leaving is the reason the Lakers had a bad season? Wtf?? Danny green didn’t win shit for anyone. He’s a solid player who always contributes whether that be offensively or defensively, but it’s not like he’s a superstar."
"Danny Green didn’t help at all. He wasn’t good enough on defense to guard the elite guards, he missed every wide open shot, he kept trying to drive and take floaters which never worked. You could have took him off the team and gave his minutes to JR smith and we still woulda won"
Danny Green criticizing the shooting of others
Danny Green is calling Ben Simmons a big fat baby who refuses to grow up!
"schroder had 17 and 8 on decent percentages when bron and AD were out, nearly 20 games. danny green has never averaged that in his career. and who would be running the offense? caruso?"
"I say the Clippers. The spacing, the chemistry, the defense, the depth would be enough to beat the 76ers. The 76ers with a frontcourt of Dwight and Embiid would be scary. Also having Simmons, prime Danny Green, Tobias, prime George Hill, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, and Warriors Anthony Tolliver would be nice, but I think the Clippers would beat them in 7."
"I think most people don’t understand that there are only a few teams that can build an effective wall to stop him. That raps team had Kawhi, Siakam, Danny Green, Marc Gasol &amp; Ibaka. Bam on the heat along with Crowder &amp; Jimmy Buckets was a really unique combo of strength &amp; versatility. If teams could guard him they would - there just aren’t that many in recent history that can"
"Coulda had Lowry, LeBron, AD. And still keep Danny Green, Mathews, Caruso, Kuzma, Kieff, Gasol, Dwight, etc.   And probably also some additions on the edges like Batum, Ariza, etc"
Forbes is giving me Danny green vibes from last season
Naa it's lowkey Danny Green. If Philly had him they get past the Hawks.
"I really disliked the 2019 Lakers offseason where they signed Dwight, Rondo, etc. Since I was dead wrong there, I gave them a pass in 2020.   But now in hindsight, I'd probably do a lot of this season's moves differently:  - I'd definitely rather have Dwight over Harrell, especially since using the MLE on Harrell hard-capped the Lakers and really hampered their flexibility.  - I probably would've traded THT for Lowry, I think it could have swung our load management in the regular season, and it probably could've swung the Phoenix series - I might rather have Danny Green and a first round pick over Schroder. DG has flaws, but he's still a better shooter, defender, and decision-maker than Schroder"
Where was I talking about the finals  If you read the first 4 words of my comment you would see that I said he had a better series but Danny Green would have been the 2013 finals MVP if the Spurs had won while def not being the best player in general
"If he could hit as many threes as Danny green,  he’d be playing 35 minutes a game"
Danny Green gang need to step up
"respectfully disagree  if he got as many looks as Danny Green did this season, i'd rate him to hit more than Danny, especially in clutch situations."
"To me, vets are generally the guys who've been on a squad for a while as well as in the league for a while. Fred and Pascal play that role for the Raptors if Kyle Lowry isn't back next year. Danny Green was an excellent vet in his year in Toronto."
"Danny Green was wildly inconsistent  He had 29 points on 73% shooting, the next game he had 2 points on 20% shooting and 2 games later he had 21 points on 53% shooting   He was the definition of Icy-Hot"
Danny green had the best regular season of his career with them too. Even though he stunk in the playoffs
"One of the narratives that never gets discussed is that when Durant signed with the Warriors, he turned down the Spurs who had just won 67 games and had a top 10 SRS rating all time. They could have won 70 games but they took off the end of the season and dropped 3 of their last 5.   The roster featured an aging big 3 who were all still highly effective in 25 MPG type roles, a budding superstar in Kawhi, LaMarcus Aldridge at his peak and a cast of role players that included David West, Patty Mills, Danny Green and Boris Diaw. One of the deepest rosters the NBA has ever seen and a suffocating defense.   In terms of setting himself up for easy championships, Durant made the right call. All healthy and no drama and GSW is going for their 5th straight right now. SAS was going to have a lot of churn on its roster in any event and were clearly near the end of their window. But going to SAS would have probably still meant a couple of rings, Kawhi might have stuck around, and would have forever changed how we perceive Durant."
"I don't know if we would have made it past Milwaukee, but I definitely think we win the Atlanta series. Having him instead of a rotation of George Hill, Furkan Korkmaz and more Thybulle minutes after Danny Green went down would have been a huge upgrade."
That's less than what Danny Green made this year lmao
"They were capped out and planning to run out the clock on most of those contracts though. Sure it's unlikely it turns out to be a top 5 pick but no team in the NBA is infallible. I think it's really glossed over just how much came right for Miami all at once. Outside of Jimmy going there, Bam took a jump that season with his on ball skills in particular. They literally got Herro from a coin flip, they had two undrafted guys turn out to be amazing high level role players (Robinson and Nunn), Dallas waited so long trying to sign Kemba then Danny Green that Dragic decided not to wait and went back. Crowder was a salary match, their focus was Iguodala plus dumping Waiters. All these things happen to well run teams with good FOs, development and scouting staff but they very rarely all happen at once."
He's gotta be the second worst finisher in the game just behind Danny Green.
"On paper, Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for Demar, Poetl and a pick is terrible for the Spurs"
This was back when he was with the Lakers:  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30091882/los-angles-lakers-danny-green-fiancee-received-death-threats-missed-shot-game-5-nba-finals
"This is how I came to feel about DD as much as I love him. This is why the deal was even better for the Raptors than people realize.   I truly believe that if we traded DD for Danny Green straight up, the Raptors still improve, in a Rudy Gay type, addition by subtraction way."
Lol yeah nobody but like Danny green type players cost that little nowadays. Any young player who shows upside gets paid
Ah yes we’ll dip into our 0 cap space to sign a perfect 3&amp;D guard. Danny Green is actually gonna pay us to play here I heard.
I’ve personally been down on derozan from day one. Poeltl is good but so offensively limited he’s barely worthy of a starter spot imo. Best thing for me was the pick that turned into Keldon.   And don’t forget they gave up Danny green too. Crippled the defense
"It's crazy because at times Middleton looks like Durant-lite with his in-your-face threes, turnaround fades, and iso play that can carry the team for a quarter or so...and other times he looks like a bench player who you're begging to stop shooting. It's got to be so frustrating to not know what you're getting game to game.  Jrue has been really good with Giannis in the PnR and is a disruptive defender, but he's never been a reliable scorer. They just need a Monte Morris/Satoranksy type playmaker and one more Danny Green/Reggie Bullock/Duncan Robinson shooter to kick out to, but idk if they can get it the next season or two."
Yo Danny green is soft. How bout don’t suck and you won’t get boos
"The bucks never played the sixers and the sixers were only missing Danny Green... Ben Simmons was the biggest issue for Philly, not injuries."
You have Danny Green on your team lol
Mega Danny Green
"Dillon ""Evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
"Embiid gets criticism, but definitely less. Hard to fully blame a guy who averaged 30.4/12.7/3.9 with 2.0 blocks and 1.0 steals while playing 37.4 MPG on a torn meniscus. Outside of game 4, he has a pretty great series.   Most of the blame comes down to Simmons lack of aggression and Doc Rivers less than ideal rotations with 5 man bench units getting way too much run.  Combine that with Danny Green going down, shooters going cold, guys like George Hill who were brought in to contribute but didn’t were all big factors in blowing big leads to close out the series"
Sucks that the Danny Green miss overshadowed and all time duel of Jimmy vs Lebron last season
"Giannis was doing everything he could to keep them in it. Bledsoe tried, but Middleton was bad tonight. Lot of rushed jumpers and in-transition heat checks.  Suns on the other hand were all in sync. Ayton and Paul were a bit off, Bridges and Crowder made up for it. Cameron Johnson reminds of a young Danny Green, he has been pretty handy to have off the bench. Bridges is having a great coming out-party in this role. He plays so well as that 3rd option.  Bucks gotta be less content to settle for bad shots. Middleton especially. Onto Game 3"
Payne channeling his Danny Green
Nah it’s got to be Danny Green. He trends on Twitter on nights his team isn’t even playing a game.
Danny Green and George Hill are All-NBA players?
Cam Johnson giving some San Antonio Danny green vibes right now.
And some Sixers fans are saying that us giving away Bridges on draft day and getting Zaire smith was a good thing (even in hindsight) lol   He would’ve basically been a great younger version of Danny Green
Ask any player on the Lakers if Danny Green helped them win a championship and see what kind of answers you get.
especially two players that are just coming off a championship  Danny Green is coming off 2 in a row
"I mean I thought the Sixers were shit a year ago, and Morey somehow managed to finesse Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and trade Danny Green for that Al Horford contract. Those two players were just what they needed. The team didn’t win this year, but those were impressive moves nonetheless.   I wouldn’t be surprised if ownership was the main factor in a Harden for Ben Simpson’s deal not getting done."
"Danny green really got death threats and a ring with the lakers. His numbers were low and all but man  Lakers twitter would blow up any time Danny would have a bad game with us, like the ex that did not  move on"
"Being serious for a sec, Philly genuinely has one of the best zoos in the country.   Also, fuck Danny Green. We love effort. We will root for anyone if they leave it on the court. Ben Simmons VERY decidedly does not.   Fuck off Danny."
"Yeah, I think we’re in a weird spot in NBA history right now.  As long as there are billionaire owners and lots of people making money from the players talent, you can always argue that the players deserve more, and you would be right.  That being said, I think over the last 10 years or so, the huge new TV deals have made contracts for any decent player go to insane values. I mean shit, Danny Green is not a star by any means, is almost 35, and has made almost $40mil in the past 3 years alone. Fuck.  In the past, it felt like the players were rich, but now it feels like a lot of them are *wealthy* and have a lot more in common with those aforementioned billionaire owners than they do with you or me.  It’s made me lose a lot of sympathy for players when they complain about being booed, or when they want to force their way off a team, etc."
"Imagine being a longtime 76ers fan, and you have an aging guy who has been there for 1 year telling the fans that ""things need to change"". Not necessarily fully disagreeing with his sentiments, but c'mon... you're not the vocal leader for Philly that these diehard fans are going to be like, ""Hey, spot up shooter Danny Green is telling us what we can't do!""  Expecting nothing but positive reactions from a home crowd just sounds like entitlement/delusion to me."
Dwight Howard and Danny Green just seen Ben Simmons chuck their whole season away cause he can't make a free throw/scared to take a layup yet they aren't pissed about it?      Crazy
Danny Green getting booed next season: CONFIRMED!
Danny Green spent years in San Antonio and we loved him and still do :-)
I just mentally add #Holocaust to the end of every Danny Green quote now.
Can we talk about why Danny Green is throwing stuff at the Zoo animals?
Danny Green should know this. He was a huge fan of the San Antonio Zoo.
Fuckin Heisenberg era Danny Green
Danny Green is spot on. The fans should have been way more supportive of the team blowing multiple 20 point leads in the series
We could've used this version of Danny Green this year lmao.
"Nothing but good things to say about Danny Green. Elite shooter, elite defense. Pretty much the perfect 3&amp;D player"
Danny Green needs to read Animal Farm
"&gt; but when things aren't going well, they can't turn on you. That's the one thing I would disagree with or dislike  Sorry Danny Green but Philly's MO is turning on their players when things aren't going well lol that's not gonna change."
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There’s really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year’s team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."
"Tbf they don't need both in one guy, one of each is what they effectively had last year (KCP/danny green + rondo)."
"The 2016 spurs were so weird. They had a lineup consisting of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green, Patty Mills, etc. and didn't even finish first in their conference with 67 wins."
"Last year's title winning team had more shooting than this year's iteration did.   KCP, Danny Green, and Avery Bradley are all players who have shot a high % from 3 and all have ""gravity,"" they're going to be guarded at the 3-point line. You could put those 3 around LeBron and AD and that would be a great offense.  2 of those guys are now gone. Schroder sucks as a 3-point shooter outside of one outlier season with OKC. Who are the above average 3-point shooters on this roster besides KCP who are not absolute turnstiles on defense (looking at you McLemore...)."
I supposed Kawhi and Danny Green to the Raptors sort of counts? Spurs definitely didn’t want to do that though
That tuff fouls name? Danny Green
&gt; willing to let Danny Green decide the outcome of the game  https://imgur.com/fx380rm
simple answer? doesn't have the killer mentality  same reason why he was willing to let Danny Green decide the outcome of the game against Miami last year when he had an iso at the top of the key
"Lmao you probably should have checked last year before posting that. Last year we had LeBron and AD with a positive O-LEBRON rating, Kuzma and Danny Green at 0. Everyone else negative. And we won the title. Try again."
"Warriors: Danny Green, Jae Crowder, PJ Tucker, any of those guys. Hopefully Klay hasn't lost his step"
"His close-outs on shooters are fantastic. We all know pump faking a shot is effective tool for an offensive player. But Crowder pump fakes as the defender, getting the offensive player to hesitate pulling the trigger on their jumper. This gives him time to close the gap without committing the cardinal sin of letting the offensive player drive past him.  I think Crowder is exactly the type of dirty work player that every championship team needs (a la Udonis Haslem, or Danny Green). I would argue that it's no coincidence that he's been in the playoffs almost every year of his career (Dallas, Boston, Cleveland, Utah, Miami, and Phoenix).  Great content, OP."
Danny Green or Nunn perhaps
I still think it’s Knicks tbh unless Bulls can add some solid defensive rotational guys like Danny Green to the roster.   Thibs is a reg season sweat so I think they can still over achieve tbh
Yes this is a very correct statement. Lakers’ Danny Green shot 36.7% compared to Sixers’ Danny that shot 40.5%.
"Maybe a HOFer. If Danny Green doesn't make it though, who can be sure?"
"A lot of guys got snapped up quickly two years ago which had a lot of all star level players as FAs. Danny Green was probably the best player left after a few days. FA being wrapped up quickly is the new norm, even with lots of cap space and stars IMO unless the NBA ever decides to enforce tampering rules."
I can't get all 3. I'd get Danny Green
Are you basing this off of one month where he hasnt made a trade yet? Just last year he turned Horford and JRich into Seth Curry and Danny Green.
We have the same exact team just flip Howard for Drummond and no Danny green the same roster that was just the 1st in the east ?
"Danny green is trash, javale is trash, quinn cook is trash, westbrook is better than kcp, wtf u want us to do?"
"do Seth Curry and Tobias Harris not exist to you? re-signed Korkmaz, who is a shooter  also Danny Green hasn't signed anywhere...  if you're gonna make fun of us for not making FA or trade moves, say the roster in general is not good, whatever. But the shooting thing is not really the leg to stand on atm"
I think he's consistent though. Not sure what he's saying. Sure Patty isn't dropping 25 PPG like jn FIBA but he gives you a solid 10-15 PPG on good efficiency. Definitely more consistent and reliable than Danny Green as a shooter
Danny Green when he signs for the Vet Min
Funny how you assume the sixers will still be contenders after Danny Green leaves (+ Drummond is going to kill this team)
"Danny Green? DeRozan? Oubre?   For real though, find the oldest free agent and see if he wants 6mil and there you go lol"
Danny Green?
Hey Danny Green... about all those death threats....
"OG didn’t play in the playoffs. Not sure what your first point has to do with anything since Serge, Gasol, Danny green and Kawhi were all traded for, then ofc left as soon as they could. Incredible timing making them all available for trade doesn’t negate the fact it’s a super team.   You’re not biased at all or anything lmao"
I think the Sixers are going to offer Danny Green him more than the MLE
Last piece to the puzzle is hopefully Danny Green or Avery Bradley
I'd rather spend the MLE on Danny Green. I don't like the idea of Dennis being the backup PG because I want Russ to spend as much time on the floor while LeBron sits (and vice versa) as possible so our backup PG should be someone who shoots well enough to play with LeBron.
"TPMLE - Oladipo (hail mary), Danny Green, Reggie Jackson (likely a hail mary as well) Re-sign Oubre and seek a trade? or Oubre Sign &amp; Trade?  Those are really the only things left."
My projections  *  Kawhi Leonard (LAC) * Demar Derozan (DAL) * Dennis Scrotum (OKC) * Spencer Dinwiddie (WAS) * John Collins (ATL) * Josh Hart (NOP) * Victor Oladipo (BOS) * Danny Green (LAL) * Andre Iguodala (GSW) * Patty Mills (SAS) * Reggie Jackson (LAC)
I never claimed anyone is for sure going anywhere. These are all just guesses. And no way would anyone give a full MLE to Danny Green at this stage in his career.
Get Danny Green back lol
"Danny Green likely isn't taking a minimum... he could easily get TPMLE somewhere, if not the regular MLE from a fringe contender.  Hell, he might even stay at Philly."
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
"Both of them are likely out of y’all’s price range, unfortunately. I figured Danny Green would get brought back pretty early in the day when free agency started.  Apparently Melo is on the Lakers’ radar. He definitely helps with the shooting and his defense is at least a little better than it used to be."
Mills on a 2 year 12m deal (taxpayer MLE). Green on a minimum. And I can see Danny going for a minimum because he has lost a step on defense and his 3's are streaky as ever. The fact he hasn't been signed already on a small deal shows there isn't serious interest around the league.
Yes to most of your points I’m just saying that calling Danny Green worth 15 mil for a season is a bit of a stretch because he provides more than just box score stat tallies
Hoping the Mavs go in for Danny Green. Add to the 3&amp;D guys please.
"My guess is Lakers pick up Patty, Melo, and Danny Green, let Scrotum walk, and leave their final spots for THT their two-way rookies."
If you know me then you know the absolute last thing I do is pander for upvotes. Please.   All you need to do is look at Embiid’s reaction when Simmons didn’t take that dunk. Doc saying he doesn’t know if he can be a championship winning point guard. Danny Green talking shit on his podcast.   Like the fuck out of here and get off Instagram.
"Pop: ""And Danny you're really fucking up...is Green not on this team? Dammit. Well he knows I'm not happy with him either!!"""
"i mean obviously I would disagree lol. McDermott was also a slight overpay, but not by much.   I think you’re putting Danny green’s contract in a “these days” context when the cap has risen by almost 20 million since then hasn’t it? like dude it was a bad contract when it was signed and it’s honestly still a bad contract.   I’d take Danny green for like 8mil max. dude got picked apart on defense in the playoffs this year too"
I swear you people are living in the past regarding Danny Green
"Haha yeah, I’m waiting for the Lakers to fill their roster. I’m hoping we can get Patty Mills and another decent wing, I’ll take Danny Green back any day."
"Shitty teams in cities like New Orleans have to pay higher for free agents.  Teams like the Heat / Lakers / Warriors / Clippers / BKN Nets get to pay less because they're hot destinations.  They also open up much better endorsement opportunities for players, so it's not even really a pay cut.  Bottom line is the Lakers would never have paid Danny Green $15M if it weren't for Kawhi bailing on them deep into free agency."
Still a bunch of names out there yet to sign.  -  John Collins  -  Reggie Jackson  -  Danny Green  -  Melo  -  DeRozan  -  Dipo  -  Oubre  I know I took a bit of a nosedive at the end but still solid names.
I think you’re losing perspective on what players are going for these days. He’s a very capable starter still. Guys are getting 12-15 a year that are usable bench players McDermott just got that money and green blows him out the water. If you think Danny green is in the class of a 5 mil a year player you’re smoking some good stuff lol
"Not just perimeter too, legitimately excellent transition defender. Any team is happy to play danny green as a starter and that's not worth 15 million?"
"No, but I’d still say it doesn’t make up for a 15m contract. I like Danny green as a role player. He’s not gonna get anywhere near 15m now, because that contract was a huge overpay"
What did Danny green do?
yeah danny green was a pile of shit. Keep believing that while he has made an entire career out of being a valuable role player for contending teams.
"Pause, atleast  he’s not a Massive asshole like Danny green"
"No? Just as I said, his contract value was increased because of the free agency situation.   I would definitely say that looking at a player who has scored more than 10ppg 3 times in his career and saying “he is worth a 15m per year contract” because he was overpaid by a team one year due to desperation is obtuse, absolutely haha. JJ Redick got a similar contract because he was coming off an 18 ppg season.  Yeah there are variables, like dumbass GM’s overpaying players in desperation lol. Danny Green isn’t and has never been worth 15m.   We absolutely can do that with players w similar contracts/similar stat lines haha. That brings you to the objective truth that he was overpaid. He isn’t a very productive player, and more productive players were paid similar/less money than him. I don’t get what makes you think that means my perspective isn’t part of the real world/life you arrogant weirdo hahaha"
"You know I had to do it one time lol - Danny Green, probably"
JJ Redick was coming off an 18 ppg season. Danny Green has broke double digits in ppg three times in his career
"I honestly might say that Danny Green has never been worth 15m during his career, and it just gets further and further from reasonable when you account for cap% as you go back.   That contract would be a huge overpay for any version of Danny Green. dude has scored in double digits like 2 seasons in his career and even then he barely broke 10 pts I’m pretty sure, plus his defense has gotten pretty suspect.   Don’t get me wrong, he’s a decent role player w playoff/championship experience who can shoot an ok clip, but he’s nowhere near being worth 15 mil."
"Level 2 Pop is when Danny Green made a stupid foul in some random regular season game. He tried pleading his case and Pop replied “that’s not the point, shut the fuck up! that was one of the stupidest fucking things I’ve ever seen in my goddamn life” or something along those lines lmao"
Danny green is a great player and worth 15 million. Not a good example lol
We need bigs not danny green
"You gotta keep so much cap space open for his ass.  Then when he inevitably screws you over, you're paying guys like Danny Green $15M/year."
"I would love Danny Green on the Bulls, we have a lack of Small Forwards right now. If we get him, we could roll out a starting lineup of Lonzo/Lavine/Green/Williams/Vucevic with Caruso/White/TBJ/Thad off the bench. Would just need to fill backup center then and that would be a really nice lineup."
Danny Green ran through the same scenario of burying Pop so many times he wrote it down (to get it out of his head) JUST so he could think of new scenarios. He now has a book.
"Danny Green: *""But I don't have any first round picks ...""*"
I’m glad we’re active but I don’t think we need Danny Green with the depth we already have. He was also a step slower already last year.
"""Danny Green has people calling him offering $20 million a year contracts. Other teams better bite now!"""
Daryl Morey wants 1 all-star and 4 FRPs to sign Danny Green
"Idk if bucks want a Danny green right now , but that will help    But they kinda Hella need a backup pg lol"
"Keep in mind he made All-Defense second team in his 2nd year and half the minutes (18min/gm) of the other selections. Hopefully these Olympics is exactly the development he needs to be able to take over a starting spot (with Danny Green possibly gone). More minutes = lock for All-Defense first team...and maybe..just maybe a run at DPOY, but that wishful thinking...maybe."
Not that many wings left. The best one left is Danny Green and I doubt he wants to come here.
Lol fr this is nothing compared to how pop used to react to danny green
"&gt; the sixers had simmons-thybulle-danny green who are all elite transition defenders and still had the worst transition defense in the league last year  That seems like a Sixers problem. I don’t see how that relates to 2021-2022 Lakers. Unless you’re seriously suggesting that your backup center was bad enough to tank the entire team’s transition defense, which is a laughable take, imo."
when they’re bench unit is made up entirely of guys in their mid 30s? probably. the sixers had simmons-thybulle-danny green who are all elite transition defenders and still had the worst transition defense in the league last year
"With no Danny Green or Tony Parker to chew out, it must have felt cathartic to Pop."
Danny Green no longer the meanest green machine
"I’m hoping we can get Patty Mills, Danny Green, or Kelly Oubre, Gay, and hell why not Reggie Jackson.   We’ll do a sign and trade for shroeder and Drummond to to any team for pocket lint or chewing gum haha"
I think he’s still clearly missing Danny Green the whipping boy even all these years later
I feel like Danny Green is a free agent every year
Imo I think id rather have Danny Green on this Lakers roster. 3&amp;D is a better fit for their current roster and Green should be cheaper?
One Danny Green and/or Patty Mills for me please.
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
"i was used to him in goggles, and totally thought he was danny green"
"Lakers are not done obviously.   People don't see it.   They didn't signed THT yet. Schroder still unsigned as well.   DeRozan is likely the one Lakers-Clippers-Spurs are fighting over.   But Kawhi too hasn't signed with the Clips.   I sense a bigger wave coming. Especially with these contenders role players in Danny Green, Reggie Jackson, Andre Igoudala, Carmelo Anthony, etc are still staying put. Oubre hasn't signed as well.   Something is up for sure."
Lonzo is definitely not a consistent shooter either. I wouldn't want him on my team because his three point game consists of going 2 for 8 two out of every three games and going 6 or 7 of eight that final third of games. The fact that he's improved every season though is a big plus and hopefully his streakiness can die down and he isn't stuck as a Danny Green type shooter.
"Hey they made a layup. For a while there, I thought this team had all gone to the Danny green school of layups."
Danny Green and Boucher also
Laker fans never shitted on him like KCP or Danny Green. That is how you know he was a solid player. Gonna miss his defense and energizing dunks
If they some how get Danny Green and Rudy Gay  re-sign Markieff and THT and they’re set. Maybe take a run on Otto Porter.
"You'd do well with a 2 guard instead but I don't think there are any better than Ellington rn. I guess Oladipo, but again...injuries  Edit: Oh, duh...Danny Green is still available"

"We don't have cap space. We got Korkmaz on a good deal, and could still re-sign Danny Green. We were never keeping Dwight. We're fine."
"yeah and danny green, dion, JR, etc. are all really streaky in general"
"Haha if they can somehow get Buddy, I’ll eat my words. I don’t think there’s anyone left but I don’t mind Danny Green, Porter Jnr, Oubre, or Patty Mills. I would like those signings for the Lakers"

"He very well be replaced by Danny Green and Buddy Hield. That’s the thing with the Lakers you have 0 job security day to day, much less year to year."
I think it’s gonna come down to Danny Green or Otto Porter for the Lakers MLE. Really hope it’s DG.
KCP was ungodly streaky like Danny Green. I think it’s the Lakers focusing on win now and getting a superstar rather than building a team like other franchises.
JUST FORGET ABOUT DANNY GREEN PLEASE
danny green was an idiot
"I hope the Lakers can get Oubre somehow. Or at least Danny Green. I miss the bubble team, underrated in my view. I was even hoping for Austin rivers, I like him in the playoffs. I honestly don’t know how the Lakers will fill out the rest of the team with nba players"
3 times NBA champion Danny Green
So who are the best remaining free agents ? I can think of Dinwiddie Derozan and Shroder also Danny Green but not on the same level.  Who's you got ?
"And Joel Embiid had a torn meniscus. Hunter is a bigger loss, I’ll give you that, but the 76ers’ biggest problem was shooting, don’t underestimate the loss of Danny green. I think Embiid’s injury + no Danny Green outweighs Hunter and Reddish."
"danny green was not a bigger loss for the sixers than deandre hunter was for the hawks, come on. we were without our second best player and best perimeter defender the entire series"
"Agreed. People seem to forget Danny Green was hurt and Philly blew huge leagues. Still huge props to the Hawks for winning, but I think the 76ers win more than 50% if you play that series 100 times."
"That's a fair counter point for sure.  Lonzo is admittedly streaky, but at least he is in the positive-direction of streaky -- having good 3 point percentages over the course of consecutive seasons on a lot of attempts a game means he's sorta in the ""Danny Green"" mold of good/great shooters -- can be very streaky, but averages out to a well above average 3 point shooter.  No arguments to Lauri potentially being a better shooter, I was just trying to counter the notion that Lonzo doesn't have a chance of developing a consistent long range shot because he already has developed at the very least a pretty good one."
Danny Green still unsigned so far?
So wall green porter wood and Danny?
"The Lakers want all three of Mills, Gay, and Danny Green. I think this helps them get two of them, one through this TPE and the other through the 5.9 mle"
"They got such a bad haul for him specifically BECAUSE of him tho, he tanked his own value so damn hard. They should've been getting like Siakam, OG, Poetl, DeRozan and a pick for him and Danny Green.   Even the Lakers weren't putting Ingram in the trade, there were no good options for the Spurs and with LaMarcus and Rudy on the team, you've gotta get established players to try and keep things going."
Evil Danny Green
Just doesn’t too 2020 Danny green he was to good for the list
"Thank god you've got Ben Simmons anchoring your defense with such notable liabilities as *Danny Green*, *Tobias Harris*, *Matisse Thybulle*, and horrible defensive center *Joel Embiid*. Without Simmons those guys would be lost on the defensive end."
"Unless they can get a legit two-way star or a top 5 on-ball creator, they need his defense at the point of attack badly. Thybulle can’t really be counted on to guard the best guard/wing all night until he learns to stop with the Kent Bazemore fouls and Danny Green is more of a team defender.   Morey took an L this off-season, Simmons isn’t wrong to be upset with how Doc and Embiid treated him, and team needs to face reality here."
"Ok I didn’t ask if the signings were successful so I don’t see the point in that comment.   But let’s break it down. LeBron and Shaq are our 2 biggest feee agent signings. Malone and Payton were big so that gives us 4 even tho 2 of those signings were past their prime. Ron Artest should not count as a superstar/great player signing. He wasn’t close to being an all star so you’re reaching. Dwight Howard was traded to us and he left. We got him back after he was bought out. He wasn’t a great signing, it was a smart signing because few teams wanted him. Steve Nash was past his prime and was 38 when we got him. Kind of reaching by including a 48 year old wouldn’t you? Melo is no longer an elite player. There’s no way you can count him as one of our great signings. He’s the definition of a role player and has been for the last couple of years. Mid tier role players aren’t great players. I asked you to  make me a list of all our great player free agent signings. Danny Green was a great signing but he wasn’t a great Laker, Trevor Ariza is washed, Fisher scammed the Jazz and signed with us but he isn’t a great player. He is a Laker legend tho for his contributions. Rondo was viewed as a bad signing. People said he wouldn’t fit with the Lakers because he’s ball dominant and can’t shoot. Funny how the narrative changed.   Perfect let’s talk about those players, PG didn’t give us a meeting after bitching that he wanted to go to the Lakers, Kawhi didn’t sign with us after rumors came out that his preferred destination was the Lakers before he got traded to the Raptors, DeRozan didn’t sign with us, AD was traded to us, iguadala didn’t sign with us.   No team is getting free agents on discounts in the last decade? I guess the Heatles didn’t exist, i guess the warriors didn’t get a ton of great feee agents, i guess the Nets didn’t just get every free agent last year? Lmao come on man.  So out of all those players you were only able to give me 2 Laker great signings (Shaq + LeBron), 2 great players in Payton and Malone and then a bunch of role players. Nash wasn’t great even when we signed him, he came off a season averaging 12/10. And the. You named a bunch of role players.   So go ahead and name all the GREAT PLAYERS  that we signed because so far you were only able to name 4 and I’m giving you 2 of those"
"I wont qualify whether they were sucessfull or not, cuz that was not your inital statement. but look at the names the lakers pull in free agency.   Lebron, shaq, malone, payton, ron artest, steve nash(snt), dwight howard. melo. mid tier role players as well, danny green, trevor ariza, fisher, rondo, schoeder(was sought after prior to last year). Numerous other recentish players who wanted to or rumored to go to want to sign  or force their way to the lakers, Kawhi, Paul george, DeRozan, AD(obv), Igoudala etc etc.   not gonna accept the ""but nash was garbage and payton and malone were old"" arguements cuz they arnt relevant here. No other team is consistently over the last few decades getting free agent veteran players that want to play for their team at a discount.   gtfo"
"03 Suns: 7  Tom Gugliotta, Anfernee Hardaway, Joe Johnson, Stephon Marbury, Shawn Marion, Antonio McDyess, Amar'e Stoudemire  96 Suns: 7  Sam Cassell, Cedric Ceballos, Michael Finley, A.C. Green, Kevin Johnson, Jason Kidd, Danny Manning, Steve Nash (- and to be frank, Wayman should've made at least one as well)"
"I would argue Boston and Houston are clearly above philly in recent history. They actually have big names sign like Kemba, Hayward, Horford and J lin, Dwight, Gordon respectively.    Best 76ers signings are JJ Reddick, Elton Brand, and Danny Green this off season. Doesn't really compare."
"You just criticize his moves without even understanding them. Furkan is young and is clearly developing his game outside of 3pt. paying him 5 mil to be our 8th man is more than okay. You said ""  I never didn't give him props"" but you have gone through the effort of trying to find a fault in nearly move he's made since he's been in Philly. you are shitting on him. I'm not calling him a genius but clearly he is good at his job. He has brightened the 76ers future significantly while putting a fun team on the floor.     You comments highlight how misinformed you are. I can be less insulting and just say you have a far worse grasp on the 76ers and how the league functions internally and within the CBA than you think. Your ""tone"" really comes of matter-of-fact-like when almost all the time you are either wrong or missing the point entirely.    For example, you keep attributing his deal to get Curry as just the Mavs misevaluating Richardson so Morey isn't smart for that. IDC if it doesn't make him a genius its just him doing his job very effectively. He took a trash player about to expire and got 3 years of a more useful player. He still had to find that value make the calls and do the deal. Just because Sarver is a cheap bastard doesn't mean they indiana front office doesn't deserve praise for getting a contributor for super cheap. In fact it makes them that much better at their job for getting the most out of a player.   Situations are tough and the 76ers backup 5 has always been a struggle. You can hate on Drummond all you want, but honestly who would want this role at the minimum who is better? Yeah bringing Dwight back would have maybe been a better move, but we all know where dwight wants to play. Philly isn't LA New York or Miami. Its a rough city who's best appeal is its proximity to other great places (and decent suburbs for kids). We don't have Lebron or KD so no decent vet would choose us over them, especially when theyre also better teams.      Why areyou criticizing a GM for signing a young shooter who is developing a lot of his game to a team friendly deal on a contract that is a good size to supplement trades? Probably because you don't understand that even though it wont win us a chip it matters in the margins to become a better team.    Capped out teams have to ensure their important players (Danny Green) either come back or get traded. We can't let Danny walk without and pay somebody his money. If you are over the cap the money isn't there for another player and it would just be a straight loss in value.   What you dont seem to get is the Horford salary cap dump was good. Again hes not a ""genius"" for this move (some weird goalpost you keep setting up) but it really helped the 76ers flexability and also gave us Danny Green who will now be on the team for at least 2 year after the deal. Again another contract that can then be moved for other players unlike vet min."
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our “GM”). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I’d say he’s done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
"FVV and Brogdan can also operate the half court offense and finish at the rim, Lonzo can’t. His value is as a 3 and D guard so he should be compared to similar players like Duncan Robinson or Danny Green"
"You just somehow have no perception of nuance. you pick a narrative and make the ""facts"" fit it. you ask questions like youre so profound but really you just don't understand how the inner workings of basketball go. You have no concept on how teams build, maintain, and sacrifice value. If you did you wouldn't ask stupid questions and make idiotic points I would't make this assumption.    Why would the 76ers needs a back up 5 when historically Embiid misses 20 games a year? Why did they sign drummond to a min and not just sign Jarret Allen to thew miniumum.    Dude every team could have gotten Curry but Morey did. Thats not something you can just ignore.    We paid Danny Green double what most competitive teams could offer. However a team like Chicago could have offered him the same contract and then he's choosing on where he wants to be. Why risk losing a starter over 5 mil.    Lol how are you even shitting on the Korkmaz deal. You clearly dont watch ANY of his game if you think he is useless as a 3% shooter. He is literally paid less than 5 million for a good minutes sponge and especially with how shooters are being paid.    Horford was literally so awful on this team. The fact that Morey was able to get back a starter level player for a protected first is impressive. you are just a charmin soft hater that can't even props a guy for one thing.     You play too much 2k and don't actually understand how the nba as a league functions. I'm sure you know how basketball works but you dont understand the cba or how teams effectively function under it aside from super teams. I normally would't care but you speak about the 76ers as if youve actually watched them play. its clear you havent. Sure 76ers fans may be ass hole but we have no shame in telling a guy on his soapbox how much of an idiot he is being. What team do you like. lets analyze their offseason and see if your takes are only so cold when you watch Philly"
"Got lucky with injuries? What are you talking about? We were missing DeAndre Hunter for the entire postseason after the first series, Cam Reddish didn’t play until the ECF, Bogdanovic was clearly hurt from the second round onward, and Trae got hurt in the ECF. Sixers were only missing Danny Green and the Bucks didn’t lose Giannis until after Trae had already gone down. We made it to the ECF despite our injuries, not because of injuries on other teams"
danny green had an amazing year with us the fuck
"Wow drunk off the Haterade. Why can't you accept that he has made some  good and savvy moves. Do you remember the 76ers roster before Morey? If you asked r/NBA we had 3 of the worst contracts in Horford, Simmons, and Harris. It was a horribly fit team tied up for like 4 gd years man. He got us off the 2 worst players with an incredibly cheap 3pt shooter and back to back Champion 3&amp;D Danny green. You're points are stupid. You sound stupid. I don't know how you typed this many letters with a hardly functioning brain.    IDK how a back up center that soak up like 20+ regular season games for this team is really a horrible fit. He wont see the floor with Embiid thats fine.    No BETTER team would give Danny 10mil because they could all only offer 5. Are we supposed to just let him walk. ""just a 3 point shooter"" to a developing offensive player who we would replace with a scrub from the bottom of the barrel."
1. Then 28 other GMs had the opportunity to get Seth.   2. A large portion of life is making the most out of opportunities. The time between the Lakers flub and Dwight being a Sixer was like 5 hours.   3. Danny Green for $10M/year with the second year being non-guaranteed is a fantastic contract to have.  A 24 year old legitimate NBA 3 pointer shooter for $15M/3YR is a better value than a lot of signings this off-season.
"&gt;stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  Just because the Mavs FO is dumb doesn't mean Morey is a genius.   &gt;got Dwight, Embiid’s best backup so far, on a vet min   Because the Lakers fucked it up. But where is he now?  &gt;re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  No other team was going to give Danny 10 million a year. Furkan is just a 3 point shooter."
"In his one year in Philly, Morey has :  **Pros**  * got the Sixers to the 1 seed in the East  * unloaded the horrific Horford contract while acquiring Danny Green, a very useful role player  * stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  * got Dwight, Embiid’s best backup so far, on a vet min  * re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  * drafted some promising young players, such as Maxey    **Cons**   * not acquiring Harden because of a personal vendetta from Tillman  * the George Hill trade was kind of weird in retrospect   I’m feeling pretty good with Morey at the helm."
"I remember when the Spurs would run this play relentlessly with Manu &amp; Danny Green, and it felt like it was money every time"
This series would've been over in 5 if Danny Green could hit a shot at all
Good for Josh. Still strongly believe he can follow the Danny Green archetype path. Solid wing defender that hits catch and shoot threes at a good clip.
I definitely don't blame Raptors fans as a whole. Danny Green absolutely should know better than make a dangerous play when he's beaten on the break though. CP3 coulda done some serious damage when he did the same to Giannis this year.
"I think people see scottie plays pf and siakam plays pf and draw the conclusion they cant play together at the same time. Our GM literally said on draft night they they consider the lineups to be positionless. The best lineups we had over the last 2 years have been without a center for one reason or another. given the lineup we have now, looks like they are gonna run with that idea.    Also Scottie played a bit of point in college, If he gets a shot there's no reason he cant just be playing guard. We also tried OG at shooting guard last year and it looked ok. Just played the danny Green role, play defence, hit threes."
He meant danny green as the legit starter that came along with kawhi
"Nah the legit starter was danny green, the finals MVP being Kawhi"
Danny Green was the legit starter.
That’s the finals MVP. The legit starter was Danny green
I was admittedly ignorant to anything Grizzlies related and so I was never interested in watching the Grizzlies until I caught that first round matchup last year.  Ja Morant &amp; Evil Danny Green convinced me that I’ve got to watch them. They showed so much heart that  it was easy to be a fan of what I was watching.
"Draymond &gt; Klay  Klay is perhaps the best catch and shoot offensive player ever, and his defense is wonderful. He's like the HOF version of Danny Green, but still being a great 3&amp;D guy isn't being the unique talent of Draymond. Dray is the most versatile defender in a generation AND an offensive mastermind without being a shooter. No one else in league history was really like that."
I got downvoted last year for suggesting that Danny Green would be better than him. He was certainly more valuable
they even have an evil danny green
"I don't know, if he's going to be a star, but I can see a Danny Green type of career"
"I feel like there's almost no way he doesn't unless his mental is truly shot. Been a brutal few months for him but he's still 25 year olds and ber athletic supreme body control LeBron like freight train 6'10 245.   Even the old Ben Simmons was a damn good player. Always led or near the top of the league in hustle stats that don't show up on the box score like screen assists, deflections, diving for loose balls, things other all stars don't usually risk their energy and bodies to do very often.  I honestly believe he's a better shooter than Giannis, Giannis just has a much better confident mentality. But honestly a couple things go differently in the playoffs like Kyrie doesn't get hurt for the nets and they 4-1 or 4-2 the bucks, and Danny Green doesn't get hurt for the sixers and they eke out the series over the hawks, the heat could have been on Giannis for airballing free throws instead of Ben."
"They had tim Duncan , Tony Parker , kawhi , ginobilo , diaw , Patrick mills , Danny green etc maybe I don't consider parker- duncan - kawhi a big 3 ( because kawhi wasn't a super star yet ) but the teams were Very equal"
Chris Bosh fouled Danny Green in game six
"It would remind people how dominant he was in that game overall, but I don't think anyone holds 2013 against him specifically.  The Heat were just better, Danny Green could only be so hot for so long, Kawhi needed more time to develop, Ginobili choked down the stretch, and Allen hit a shot for the ages."
"I wouldn’t necessarily say they imploded. Circumstances dictated the direction they had to go in.  Kawhi left to go home, Danny Green leaves in free agency. And they were still only one possession away from the ECF the very next season.   Next, they lose their center rotation as an ageing Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka move on.  Then you have the covid ridden disaster season, where half the team misses extended periods with covid, along with the senior coaching staff, all while playing the entire season on the road, as the entire franchise is displaced for a year.   If anything, I would look at their situation and say they are on course for one of the quickest turnarounds we’ve seen in a long time. They’re about two years ahead of schedule in their rebuild, with keeping their young-ish core of Fred-OG-Pascal together while adding Barnes with the fourth pick, along with a few young, good potential, development prospects, and they currently have a roster where not a single player is over the age of 30.  The upcoming season will be all about development for the newer, younger guys, and the growth into full time  leadership roles for the more established core in the absence of the long time leader Kyle Lowry. I would expect them to be a playoff team, at the very least in or around the play in spots."
"Kawhi (and Danny Green) left and they could do nothing to change that outcome outside of literally moving the team to San Diego.  They finished with the 2nd best record the following season without Kawhi and DG (after numerous media outlets said they wouldn’t even make the playoffs) but the 3 month COVID hiatus and lack of home court advantage due to the bubble completely killed their momentum and playoff potential, Gasol/Serge got older, Gasol/Serge left.  In their second full season post-championship they then had to move the entire organization to Tampa to live and play out of the Marriott for the entire 72 game season with no home games and literally half the team contracted COVID, Lowry is even older, now Lowry has left.  It’s really straight forward, no team could adapt to or overcome those extenuating circumstances, I’d argue they handled it better than almost any other team could’ve.  FTR they’re in a retool on the fly, not a complete rebuild, yet."
"Yep, they've got 3 All-Defence players in their rotation, Danny Green is still great and even dudes like Tobias are big enough to hold their own. I'd say Milwaukee are a close second too with Giannis, Brook and Jrue anchoring everything."
They lost Danny green
Is the perimeter defense that much of a difference if you replace draymond with Simmons tho. It’s not like Simmons made these differential possessions on the perimeter against trae young and the hawks. Danny green was the difference maker of that series once he went down was the start of the hawks resurgence
The fake GOAT wouldn’t be relevant if he was guarded by athletes instead of pe teachers   Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs subway sandwich makers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Also LeGOAT has the best game 7 performances in nba playoff and finals history.   Think before you type my dude
"I didn't say its the same stat, its just implying that because Wade was 1 in RAPM for a season, it doesn't mean a lot. For reference, Danny green was 2nd in 18-19 and Jae Crowder was 4th the year beforee, it has itts weakneses even though it involves less of the boxsccore.  Where can you find Wade's RAPTOR +.-?, because Harden has been dominating RAPTOR for a while."
Luka-Danny Green-Mikal Bridges-OG Anunoby-Myles Turner  Bench: Thad Young-Jordan Clarkson-Richaun Holmes-Jalen Brunson-Otto Porter
He reminds me of a mix between Danny Green and Klay Thompson (obviously no where near as good as either yet) more than anyone. My guess is he'll eventually be a starting 3&amp;D wing for us once we part with either Caris or Brogdon.
"I mean Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Shamet are pretty much better shooters than anyone left on the Warriors in 2019 after Klay got injured. Blake was also very good once he moved to Brooklyn.  Pretty much everyone outside of Draymond/Iggy were like out of rotations the very next year. Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, injured Boogie weren't rotation quality players. And the two guys who were in Dray/Iggy are poor shooters who defenders will happily not guard - even an injured Harden receives more defensive attention.  The 2019 Raptors were also a better team than the 2021 Bucks. Kawhi was at the height of his game and EVERY single player on the Raptors was a very good defender and a good shooter and most of them good playmakers too. FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol all good passers for their position while being able to shoot and defend, and then Danny Green, Norman Powell, Ibaka all being more 3 and D (+ more for powell)."
"That's true for a lot of ""good"" defenders in the NBA.  You can keep defending wings by being smart and long, but once you lose a half-step you just literally can't stay in front of these 22 year old point guards.   A great example is Danny Green - still statistically a very good defender, still has the rep, but he could not stay in front of Trae Young in the playoffs, it just wasn't even an option.  Trae blew by him so many times in a row that the Sixers rightfully had to stop even trying, granted they had other options at least."
"&gt;Lakers might not even had made the playoffs running back with the 2020 squad if everything played out the same with Bron &amp; AD injuries  There is no chance they sniff the playoffs with Danny Green instead of Dennis Schroder in 2021, all else being equal."
"&gt;He opted to not bring back Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Dwight Howard after the Lakers won in 2020.  The Lakers could not afford to bring that team back, as most of them got raises to leave.  McGee made as much as Gasol and Howard combined in 2021.  Green made more then Schroder, and provided far less.  Rondo got a 325% raise from the Clippers.  Pelinka is not a great GM, but bringing back the 2020 Champs was never an option."
"this is an insulting question lol, he's in the conversation for GOAT and if you don't have him #1 , he should be your #2 without question  The rings argument is so dumb honestly, let's put Bill Russell as GOAT then. Phil had a prime MJ and Scottie for all 6 rings. A prime Shaq and prime Kobe for 3 rings and a prime Kobe and prime Pau for 2 rings.  Pop had prime Duncan for 4 rings, prime Parker/Ginobili for 2 rings (05, 07), and a pretty good Drob for one ring (99). 2014 he had a lot of good talent, but no one really in their prime.   Pop has actually coached through multiple eras and shown an ability to adjust and BUILD a team. Phil has proven that if given all the pieces, he can take them to a ring (which is important).   Who did Phil actually develop? Did he develop Shaq? Kobe? Pau? Pop developed so many countless guys from Manu, Parker, Kawhi, George Hill, Baynes, Gary Neal, Patty Mills, Danny green, etc.   At the end of the day I think if you give Pop and Phil an identical set of 5 players, Pop will get the most out of them."
"It's the best time to be a 3 and D guy. D-Rob, Danny Green, Klay, K-Money, etc. 3 and D guys who get major money and focus because of their skill set."
"I think the lakers will be just fine, and no Danny green would not have solved whatever potential issues the lakers have in 2022"
Danny Green
"Danny green can shoot. Ac got a wack jumper, no jimmy"
If you are a Laker hater let me tell you this first...me too fam.  But all these clown makeup and fan-favorite stories around Caruso combined with his 40-year-old insurer look makes his game really underrated and underestimated. His playoff performance in the Orlando bubble was much better than Danny Green who always turns out as a starter yet doesn't even deserve to be in the NBA especially at that much of a salary.
"Danny Green, perfect championship role player, never gets paid like it"
"You're right and I was too hard in my comment without context. It read to me like this was bottom-feeding context as I'd hate for a fanbase to go ""damn I could have had Danny Green"" when in reality it was a pure tire kick  with a courtesy low-ball offer to the agent.   Thank you for your reply"
"Would say that the 76ers are more well rounded thanks to embiid taking all paint duties. Danny green would probably guard the best perimeter threat and they will try to hide Seth and Dame. If they don't have good defensive guards as backup they might struggle. The warriors have an amazing small ball lineup, and maybe the most impressive defensive small ball lineup I've seen. If they don't play against Jokic, Giannis or Embiid they could succeed more. Both teams are godlike offensively."
Danny green not getting hurt makes the sixers beat atlanta
How will portland get embiid tobias danny green and seth?
"I agree Simmons and Dray won’t mesh. But I also gotta say a Lillard, Curry, Green backcourt ain’t gonna work AT ALL on defense. Move Green and Harris up 1 spot and get a 4. Even if you’ve gotta start Niang imo. If not Warriors have Simmons to guard Dame and Green to guard Klay. Now the Sixets have Danny Green to guard Curry while Thompson and Porter get to pick on Lillard/ the superior Curry bro. If the Sixers can get a competent PF though I’m taking Sixers in 6."
Yet lebron has more 40 point games than him in the finals vs Defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny ainge and Jeff Hornasec
"Right.  But the leading in scoring was partly because who he was playing.  The Knicks don't have elite defenders (awkwardly enough we picked up Bullock to fill a 3&amp;D spot lol) and PHIs best perimeter defender was either out for the whole series or early on, I forget exactly.  Talking about Danny Green.  Then Embiid's cartilage issue obviously makes the lane more available.   The 48 game was truly remarkable but doesn't mean we have to forget the 14 pt, 9 turnover game in the same series."
"I thought he was good beforw I saw these new rookies and realized he was going to be like Green, danny green played like tyrese when he was younger just entering the league and over time settled on just being a marksman because SA spurs system"
"Danny Green? Did you watch the Kings at all last year? That comp makes no sense. Green is a better defender, but Haliburton is 20x the playmaker Danny Green is. Like they’re not even comparable in that aspect. They’re not similar at all."
Do you really see haliburton being more then a danny green type player?

People always remover danny green for his misses. But dude is still a very solid defender with vet savvy and solid shooting numbers. People always hate on Green too much.
"&gt;It was the only way we could open. Amax slot to get LeBron in the first place.  That part is false. The Lakers already had their roster set for the upcoming season, buying Deng out when they did didn't alleviate his salary for the 2018-2019 year. What it did is it reduced his cap hold the following summer from $18 million down to only $5 million (although it then added $5 million in dead cap to that year and the next two). That extra cap space eventually allowed them to sign Danny Green a year later."
"Uhh no, I doubt Masai wanted to pair DeMar with Kawhi especially with Danny Green coming back. And Lowry had better postseason numbers in the year before Kawhi's arrival so not sure where you got this idea that he suddenly learned to be a good player from kawhi at age 32.."
"I dont dislike Danny Green. I just think the title of the article is a bit comical. It’s a fine signing, but nothing that alters the landscape of the East in any meaningful way."
There must be an explanation to why you dislike Danny Green and the Sixers
Danny Green has been a starting caliber 3&amp;D player his whole career. Signing him would be a pretty big boon for any team in the league
That sounds like it says more about Philly’s roster construction than the ability of Danny Green.
Philly is really trying to spin signing a 34 year old Danny Green into a big deal.
He grew in that series honestly. Through the first 5 games he was outscored by Danny Green (lol) because LeBron was in his own head and didn't trust his own jumper. It was looking like it was gonna be another Dallas 2011 and probably would've been if the Heat didn't pull out game 6 miraculously (Kawhi bro just hit your FTs damn).

"A single play, or the most important moment in his career up until that point. He plays defence on that shot and they possibly get to a higher round then he ever has before.  You aren't trying in the final seconds of a game 7, when are you gonna try.   Simmons played 1 amazing defensive game against Trae in gm 2 and was pedestrian after that. Frankly imo the bigger impact was removing the permanent Danny Green check and sliding in more Thybs."
"Damn, you know things have gone terribly wrong when a player everyone remarks as extremely professional is involved in a brawl.  This would be like, if Danny Green got into a fight rn"
"&gt;*He's not right.  The Pelicans clearly want a PG to run the offense, or they wouldn't have gone balls out to get Lowry.  We can argue about whether that's the best use of resources, but its clearly what the Pelicans want to happen, and they let the perfect fit for that walk.*  ***Not why we wanted Lowry.***  We were interested in Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry because we don't have any lockerroom leadership. We're still a very young team and every time we've brought a vet along (Adams, Jrue, JJ Redick, Bledsoe,) they've been well-received/friendly in the lockerroom but don't hold people accountable, or act like 'leaders.'  BI and Zion haven't really taken leadership over the team or point out when guys aren't giving their all or motivate their teammates + pick up the energy on the court when it's needed. And they can't close out games.  So FO was trying to get vet leaders in to teach them.  Once Dinwiddie, Lowry, and Paul said 'no,' they moved on to grabbing shooters like Reggie Jackson, Danny Green, THJ, etc. Guys who could play off of our two main guys. We didn't really get a locker room leader into the mix like we wanted.  Kyle and Chris can change *the culture* of a team.  That's why we wanted them."
"Because his usage rate was lower than everyone that played except George Hill and Danny Green. Sure, he does some things exceptionally, but he’s a much less valuable Draymond Green when he plays this way."
"PG Curry 40  SG Danny Green 8  SF Lebron James 39  PF PJ Tucker 5  C Brook Lopez 16  Bench  PG Jamal Murray 8  PF: Markieff Morris 2  SF: Igoudala 2  No one beating this team  Covers everything. Everyone can switch on defense. Good defenders around Curry that can shoot, just enough playmaking with Curry, Murray, and Lebron. Spot up guys that don’t need playmaking In Tucker and Green. Able to go small with Lebron, Igoudala, Tucker at the 4-5 late in games. Everyone has plenty of playoff experience and in fact all have great reputations in playoffs"
With everyone healthy so many things would change. 76ers would have beaten the Hawks with Danny Green and a 100% Embiid. I think the Nets vs Bucks series would still go 7 games and be up for grabs even with healthy Kyrie. Lakers would have been the favorites to win the WCF too.
"I’m not sure where you’re getting your information from, but they let Kawhi manage his injury pretty’s early on.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/11/23/16693304/kawhi-leonard-trade-rumors-history-timeline-spurs-gregg-popovich  Potentially as early as September of that season he was first reported as injured. (This is during preseason, the first game of the season hasn’t even happened yet)  If Kawhi’s group was managing it that early on, who is truly to blame for holding him out?   https://www.reuters.com/article/us-basketball-nba-sas-leonard/spurs-leonard-to-miss-preseason-with-thigh-injury-idUSKCN1C50SE  In this article they mention he was diagnosed with a right thigh tendinopathy, which is the exact injury his camp argued the Spurs missed.   February is where he goes off to NY to rehab where the Spurs ultimately lose contact with him. This is when we hear “Kawhi is day to day, should return soon”  Spurs players and coaches ultimately get frustrated with the lack of info with results in Manu saying he has ruled out Kawhi, and Parker making the “infamous my injury was 100x worse” comment which was taken out of context.   The very next day the Spurs have a players only meeting where they talk with Kawhi (no one was in contact with him, and they were about to start the playoffs so they have the right to know what their teammates status was.)  Kawhi doesn’t show to any playoff games. Then off season where he is demanding to be traded.  Pop and Co. try everything to avoid this, even go as far as going up to NY to talk with Kawhi after Kawhi’s group says okay to meeting up.   Duncan and Pop both fly to NY but Kawhi ultimately backs out and doesn’t even meet with them. Didn’t even give them a chance, just tells them he wants to be traded.   I fail to see where the Spurs mismanaged his injury or Danny green was told to keep his mouth shut.   Kawhi wanted LA, which is fine. But dragging the Spurs through the mud was such a shitty thing to do, especially with the Spurs history with managing injuries and load management."
"I mean we offered contracts to Lowry, Chris Paul, Dinwiddie, THJ, and more (Danny Green/Reggie Jackson.)   I don't think Pels did any leaks about tampering, I think the 'one minute after the trade happened' leak to Woj by Klutch is how shit got inspected.  NBA can't ignore a deal made four seconds into deadline."
… and you have yet to make it past the second round. The Raptors lost Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green in one offseason and then made it as far as the Embiid Sixers ever had in the postseason LMAOOO. Stay mad and stay watching second round exits until Embiid gets old or leaves.
"I think we wanted to see Kyle go home to Philly, and were prepared to root for y'all if it happened. Then the offer didn't come.   Objectively, if you trade maxey, Danny green and Mike Scott for Kyle lowry, do you make the conference finals? I think we were all rooting for it."
Danny green has four rings and you don't see him as being one of the best players in the league do you
"They tried to keep him from going and seeing a personal trainer in New York. He wanted to manage his own injury with his uncle because he was initially misdiagnosed. Remember, this is an injury that only takes a few weeks to heal, yet the spurs trainers were keeping him out for months. Once he got away to new York there was no getting him back. Danny Green even tried to speak up about what was going on and was told to shut his mouth by the likes of Parker and Manu."
Danny Green is always around the drama
PG: CP3  SG: Danny Green  SF: PG13  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Rudy Gobert
You think the fact that Danny Green hasn't spoken with Ben in a month meaningfully impacts his trade value?
"This is so wrong lmao. We already the saw the ceiling of a derozan led team, i.e u cant win in the playoffs with derozan. The trade for kawhi allowed us to go all in for a chip, or if it didnt work out, we could go into a rebuild immediately, as we didnt give up a lot of picks nor any good young assets. It was actually a bad trade by the spurs tbh, they could have gotten way more for kawhi and danny green than what we gave them."
DeRozan for Danny Green would have been a good trade for the Raptors.
"Very interesting. I had this other unpopular opinion take on the trade, and that is I cannot fucking believe the raptors not only got Kawhi for derozan straight up in this trade, but that they ALSO landed Danny green in the deal and raptors only had to include jakob fuckin poetl.   Now of course there’s so many factors to consider, especially Kawhi’s value after he basically sat out all season and was on an expiring deal AND likely to leave after one season unless he was specifically traded to LA but I still feel like I can’t believe the raptors got him for so cheap. Kawhi is this all time great talent and while yeah Demar is a hell of a player is straight up not even close in comparison to Kawhi, and then you also get the Spurs 3 &amp; D ace in Danny green? that is just not a fair trade for me and I understand that the Spurs probably got the best deal they could I just felt like Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green is a LOT to give up for Derozan &amp; poetl"
The only people Trae cooked on the switch were Seth and Danny Green but even still that's way more effective then letting the man with the best floater get to his sweet spot.  Trae is a good not great iso scorer and he takes a lot of deep threes even though he isn't the best at that.  That's far more effective defense as the Bucks proved than walling off the rim and allowing for open threes from great spot up shooters.  Remember in the Bucks series he pretty much bullied Brook Lopez off the court in game 1 and the Bucks had to start hedging higher on the screen and occasionally using low resistant switches with their traditional big men.  Ultimately going to Giannis at center and switching 1 thru 5 stopped Trae when he was healthy because again he isnt the best iso scorer.
"You would think the last year would be a player option. Still a lot of money and I think he is young enough to get a couple more big mags. Reminds me a bit of Danny Green, who took a team friendly deal the first time around. Now fast forward a bit with his latest contract will cross the 100 mill mark. I respect the fuck out of Cam for how he is handling this. Just a great way to create positivity and to show high character the exact opposite of Schroder."
[Neubeck] Danny green texted Ben and said have fun in Portland as he texts Damian Lillard and welcomes him to Philly
agreed with 1.5 of your points. Your first point is facts and there is no chance they beat them healthy. As for your 2nd point I agree both are overrated and Maxey does not matter much but I think Thybulles defence will be a loss for them. Hes pretty awful offensively but a stud on D and there starting lineup is gonna be Dame-Seth-Green-Harris and Embiid. Thats gonna put A LOT of pressure on Embiid to carry the D as even Danny is not what he once was on D
"Simmons, Maxey or Thybulle, Danny Green and picks for Dame and Covington."
"I guessed Danny Green for #3, so I’m gonna call myself half-right."
"You would have to believe it was a problem with the Simmons, Harris, Embiid pairing.  The argument is that you can’t run a modern team where your three best players average 5 attempted 3s a game.  I think Danny Green took more 3s per game than all of them combined, and he got knocked out of the hawks series because of injury."
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that’s why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can’t have two non-shooting players on the floor in today’s nba. Ben also prob isn’t gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You’re not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
"At this point it really is though.. 76ers brass should be pissed at Doc, Joel and Danny Green for being so vocal about Ben being ass. Killed the relationship and ultimately Ben's value."
What’s funny is Simmons is literally teammates with arguably the best of those 10 centers you mentioned. And then the other 3 positions are Seth Curry (historically great shooter) Danny Green (3 &amp; D) and Tobias Harris (Offensive star that can shoot and play D). He literally has the perfect fit around him in Philly right now and we all saw what happened.
"Toronto.  We gave them Nando de Colo for Austin Daye.  Then we gave them Kawhi and Danny Green for DeMar, Jakob, and a FRP that became Keldon Johnson."
By who? He was guarding Danny Green mostly.....
"Exactly. Who do they have better than Simmons? Tobi maybe, then what? Matisse? Danny Green? Seth Curry?"
Danny Green got lit the fuck up by him game 1 and Doc left him there. He struggled a lot more after that
&gt; Danny Green would be our best perimeter defender   When did Thybulle get traded?
Not to mention Embiid would be a DPOY candidate if he didn't miss too many games and Thybulle would be more of a DPOY candidate if Simmons weren't in front of him (they can't play together on offense). And don't forget Danny Green is solid and Tobias Harris is average.
I've always thought of him as someone who would be considered one of the great role players (like Danny Green or Jae Crowder) in the league if he ended up on a great team that consistently went deep in the playoffs.
"CJ makes them pretty dang good, though I'm biased as a Blazers fan.  Danny Green &amp; Tobi next to CJ makes his defense a lot more manageable and you put him in a pure point role and he's getting you an efficient 25+ PPG"
"Ben has been treated with kid gloves until this offseason. He gets way more support than ESPN will make you believe. Danny Green, Covington. Those type of players the philly fan base doesn’t understand and boo way too much, not Ben."
"We have shooting on this team, another sniper is nice but we'd just become a worse team, playoff fit with Simmons be damned. Danny Green would be our best perimeter defender and Hield solves none of our perimeter creation issues on offense. I'd take the Timerwolves offer over the Kings"
Danny Green is a good role player. I’m not sure why Detroit would want him right now though.
"&gt; Detroit: Jaden Mcdaniels, Taurean Prince, Danny Green  Bruh"
Absolutely not. After Danny Green went down Ben was pretty much the only defender that consistently shit Trae down without fouling.
"Wiggins can't run the second unit, his handles are pretty bad. Simmons as a playmaker, ballhandler, and defender is clearly better than Wiggins while Wiggins is a much better scorer and shooter. Wiggins had a good season defensively last year for the first time in his career while Ben was in consideration for DPOY. This is like saying Danny Green is as good as Steph at 3s becuase they have a similar percentage."
"I brought up the Free throws as just one example of why you could run it back. You can “dig into” it as much as you’d like, but Ben Simmons shot historically bad from the line in the playoffs and it is extremely unlikely that he will shoot 35% from the line in another playoff series.   There are other reasons why you can run it back. Joel Embiid is a year old but has improved every year and I fully expect him to do so this offseason. Tyrese Maxey showed promise and could potentially share some of the ball handling duties with Ben — something most Sixers fans have been asking for since Boston exposed his half court flaws his rookie year. Tobias Harris had a 4 point game in a 3 point loss at home. That was quite literally his worse shooting performance of the year in one of the most important games of the year. $36million cannot equal 4 points, and I don’t expect it to again, Tobias played pretty well outside of that game. Danny Green going down with a coach that is NOTORIOUS for not making adjustments was a deadly combination and we saw that when Lou Will was torching George hill and the second unit in the huge comeback win ATL had in Philly or when Huerter was absolutely cooking Seth on the offensive end.   Point being, the team underperformed and I think people focus on Simmons’ shortcomings because they are glaring and have been around since he entered the league. Running back the #1 seed from a year ago retooled with Niang and Drummond could still be a contender."
"It's on the table.  Expanding CJ's role could be interesting and bringing back a wing defender would probably be the best bet for the Sixers to be really competitive again next year. Because for all Simmons weaknesses if we don't replace him with some sort of playmaker and/or a player that can defend bigger wings we're in a bad spot IMO. Like trading for DLo could give us a decent playmaker, but our primary defender would be Danny Green."
"any lineup with matisse/dwight/simmons was dogshit the entire season. doc never experimented and ran his stupid all bench lineups the entire season.  then he surprised pikachu face when tobias harris couldn't carry a bench unit in the playoffs.  aside from Ben, doc also chose to put Danny Green on Trae to start the series, essentially throwing game 1 out the window for no fucking reason.  he's an awful coach."
Why? I don't like the idea of Danny Green being the 3
"It was his role because the Sixers don't have a single other PG on the roster man. Theyve had a bunch of SGs like Seth, Maxey, Danny Green, Richardson etc.   They've yet to have a single player next to Simmons that can actually run an offense.   You can't have him in a Draymond role without a PG. And there's no PG in the entire league that runs the PnR more similarly to curry than Dame. All he has to do is run the 4v3s Dame creates.  Will he be draymond on defense? No. He's a perimeter defender. But he can easily be him on offense. His BBIQ may be lower, but he's also taller and more athletic, a better passer, and a vastly better finisher that actually puts pressure on the help defender"
He obviously won 4 more rings but there's an argument to be made that Danny Green is a better player than Horry was. Green is a much more efficient scorer
"he was also the one huerter was attacking over and over again in game 7. huerter had 27 points on 18 shots and there was a stretch where he scored in 4 straight possessions in the second half that really sucked the life out of our squad  i love love love curry, and he’s got an amazing contract, but *if* there’s an improvement over curry on the market i’d take it. gotta remember if we wont have ben, seth isn’t gonna be able to hide as well this year next to danny green (yet another year older) and whichever point guard we have"
"Don’t be blind.  Warriors have a lot to offer.  Just probably not what Philly wants or they just want to fleece other teams…but Morey is messing this up imo the longer you hold onto a depreciating asset in terms of rep, then the less value you’re going to get over time…especially when that player (Simmons) doesn’t even plan on showing up to camp  On another note, even Danny Green was already coming up with trade scenarios for Simmons.  Like that’s next level, your own teammate wondering what you’ll get back in return with some random podcast lol"
"I thought this sub would think I was disrespecting Danny Green, lol."
"Tobias Harris had a 4 point game in a 3 point loss at home. Doc Rivers left Danny Green stranded on Trae Young island for an entire half, costing us a game. Joel was forcing everything on the offensive end in the second half and his turnovers were brutal down the stretch. Curry was lights out on offense but absolutely BBQ chicken on the defensive end.   Youd think Ben Simmons was out there pulling a Dallas Rondo and was the only reason the Sixers lost the ATL series with how this sub talks about the Sixers."
His name is Danny Green
"Yeah, LeBron is the only player to win finals MVP with three different franchises.  I think that there are only four total players to win with three different franchises (Danny Green, Robert Horry, and John Salley are the others).  In terms of being a dominant player on three Finals teams, Shaq might be the only other comparison right now.  At the end of the day, I do think LeBron will be remembered as an individual foremost, but as a Cav more than as a member of another team.  I feel like the 2016 championship kind of cemented his legend in a way that his other championships haven't."
"Tbh I think he gets a lot of hate because of his fit in Portland and their lack of playoff success. Him and Dame are pretty redundant and are a terrible defensive back court. But on a team like Philly, a guard rotation of CJ/Shake/Maxey/Seth/Danny Green would actually be pretty good. If you need CJ and Seth out there stick Thybulle with em and he'll take the best player and you can at least hide one of them."
"Ben for CJ straight up 100% makes us a worse team and anyone who thinks it would help us has not watched the sixers over the years when we have not had Ben.  Look at Tobias with and without Ben, go watch Danny green or Seth Or Tobias try to throw entry passes to Embiid, or consider that now our best perimeter defender in the starting lineup is Danny green"
"I actually think maxey is overrated and thybulle is underrated. Play tobi at the 4, danny green at the 2 and start thybulle at the 3.  His negative offensive impact was very much exacerbated by playing in doc’s atrocious bench lineups (pairing ben with dwight, leaning way too hard on shake, mike scott existing, etc etc)."
"Im sorry but porzingis and hardaway better than anyone on the hawks? Really? Did u see the way tingus pingus played against the clippers? Are u saying a cast of capela, collins, heurter, bogdonavic, galinari and lou will is in any universe better than porzingis, hardaway, finney-smith?, boban??  And also, why do we always use team achievements against individual players. Do u realise the team luka played in the first round happened to be the clippers? U know, the team that pushed the suns to 6 games in the WCF without kawhi? Meanwhile, trae gets the benefit playing against the randle-led knicks, who had the worst shooting percentage by ANY player in the playoffs to get past the first round, then played a sixers team who were missing danny green (key starter) and whose best player Embiid was playing through a knee injury (torn meniscus i think?).    I keep telling people this: there’s too much going on in the game of basketball for u to simply use team achievements to judge a player’s skill level."
Mostly cause we didn’t want Danny Green or Marc when they “took” them
"Not true, I have to disagree.    The team have been propping up Ben ever since he's been in the league.   He's gotten top minutes, credit and glory of a top player and is paid like one too.   This is on Ben.   Doc gave him the green light to shoot more and from range, Ben decided not to.   It wasn't Doc or the team that shot 30% from the line in the playoffs, it was Ben.   It wasn't the team that decided not to abuse a 6'1 guard on the blocks, it was Ben.   The team didn't pass up dunks out of fear of getting fouled, it was Ben.    With the big money, the All Star appearances and the endorsements of a superstar,, also come the pressure and expectations of a superstar.     There is absolutely nothing stopping him from hiring a real shooting coach (that's not his brother) to help him.   Nothing stopping him from practicing hitting 500 free throws after each practice.   He's played with and have coaches that are/were elite shooters.  How do you play with  JJ Redick, Seth Curry, Danny Green and not ask then for tips and help?   Embiid worked on his game as an All Star.   The Joel of the past season is miles better than the Embiid of 2 seasons ago.   This is all on Ben and this is coming from a huge Simmons fan."
"I don't know why you think CJ's shooting is a hotstreak??   He's a career 39.8% 3pt shooter averaging 5.6 attempts.  He's shot 39.6% or higher in 5 seasons, and 40+% in 3 of those, including this season.  That's the player he is.  I wouldn't want to include Nance unless we were getting an equal rotation player back.  Thybulle can't fill those minutes, so it'd have to be like Danny Green or something.  I don't want to give up an additional rotation player without someone to fill those minutes"
"The only guys I think have gotten an unfair amount of boo's were Covington and Danny Green when they missed shots. I thought booing RoCo was a terrible look. He was just going through a shooting slump and booing him during it wasn't going to change anything. Booing effort is way different to me.   As for Simmons and Fultz, I felt like the city bent over backwards to explain away their issues until the last few months in both situations. Fultz basically leaving the team because Brett Brown played TJ over him and Simmons/Klutch making this a big public thing is a tough way for it to end."
Y'all were better off keeping Danny green.
"lol acting like Tobias Harris actually wanted it in that series, putting Danny Green on trae young when DG has the lateral quickness of a turtle now a days, doc's gameplan going into the series was dogshit, you gotta acknowledge that"
"Joel also turned it back on us, the fans. Danny Green did it too. Ben's asking to leave, the team's not forcing him. Is he not a diva and are we just the baddies???? Markelle dying, Colangelo's burners, Jahlil Okafor existing, Zhaire literally almost dying- has it been our fault all along"
"So hard to know.  What do the Sixers want?  How does Masai feel about Simmons?    I've given up on prognosticating trades, the Kawhi to the Raptors deal was the last straw.  Even as news was breaking I was skeptical.  ""No chance Pop would trade Kawhi and Danny Green for some replaceable big and Demar Derozan.  The Spurs would be lucky to crack .500 with that lineup!"""
"I would argue Seth Curry certainly accomplished that. Especially in the post season. Danny Green was a great shooter. I would agree that the lack of shooting the year prior was a nightmare. I’d also argue Fultz was literally brought in to accomplish every single thing you listed until he got the yips.     Daryl Morey personally brought in Doc. He wanted him in Houston too. He’s a coach who’s improved his players in every stop, including here.   Which stretch five was available? We signed Dwight for the minimum. I’d have loved an other option but I don’t see one. We also were a defensive minded team and Dwight held down the rim while Embiid sat. Dwight also played most of his minutes with the second unit. The star he player most with was Tobias. Not sure what game taoe you’re watching.   Joerger is a good coach. So is Doc. So is Cassell. We have a great staff. It’d be a shame to lose any of them     I don’t think you made very good points. Your argument is a gross simplification of how hard it is to win in the NBA. The Sixers fell apart and Ben got in his head. We failed. It wasn’t a bad shot     Typing good arguments on a discussion board is not a bad thing. If you want to meme around, there’s way better places for it"
cringe ass reddit psychoanalysts lol y’all really think mfs respect danny green more than like westbrook or harden???
 But he's said similar things about Matisse and Danny Green.
I agree but do Raptor fans just like to pretend Kawhi wasn't the main reason you guys won? Lol yeah danny green had a ring but y'all had motherfucking Kawhi Leonard. A finals mvp dawg. Sure Lowry was the emotional leader but everyone on that team looked to Kawhi to lead them into battle. His fearlessness and pure talent paved the way for the Raptors to buy into the team. He instilled confidence in players like Lowry and Siakam to reach their full potential knowing Kawhi would be there to bail them out if need be. Some players need to lead through their words. Kawhi leads by example
"No, a leader can do it without having a ring but having the ring does make it easier.  Lowry was the leader of the Raps in 2019 without a ring but he also had Danny Green who had a ring to jump in and support him when necessary."
"* Nuggets aren’t giving up two franchise cornerstones, one on a rookie deal for Simmons. Simmons’ playmaking is wasted with Jokic and Murray might be a better player 1:1. * Blazers win that deal too handily, CJ is overpaid, streaky, injury prone, and a defensive liability. RoCo is good but Danny Green and Harris more or less already fill his role. * The most realistic deal so far, I think the Raptors give up too much for a deal that gives their team no spacing, and I doubt the 76ers throw in a first- they view Ben alone as an asset. * ~~Very realistic deal, doubt the 76ers give up Reed/Springer or view White/Murray as good enough return but that’s pretty close to what Ben is actually worth.~~ Missed that Vassell/picks were included, that’s too much for the Spurs. I think White/Murray together is about fair. * Wayyy too little for Ben, Sexton is a massive defensive downgrade and doesn’t solve their playmaking issue, Okoro projects as Andre Roberson rn (and the 76ers already have a better version of that in Thybulle), Rubio is washed. * 76ers aren’t giving up Green or picks, Wolves won’t give up D’Lo who’s KAT’s buddy. * Again, 76ers probably aren’t sending young talent. I think this deal is a little low for Simmons but not awful.  To me, Simmons’ best value swap is someone of borderline All-Star level- a good win-now player. I thought the offer of Brogdon + picks was about right, and an offer of FVV/filler or Siakam would be about right too."
"Man, Danny Green has not held any punches when it comes to Simmons. Goodness.   Is there any back story there?"
"Woah now context? This is Reddit, context means absolutely nothing. There’s a Danny green quote on the front page that leaves out the part where Danny calls Ben the best defender in the league."
"Giannis I guess? But KD still went fucking nuts.  Probably someone like Jrue, but I'm actually gonna say PJ Dozier because that man's defense is fucking ridiculous.  Jrue  uhhh.... Giannis I guess  Kawhi+Serge+Danny green apparently  His knees  A really good defensive center like Nurk or Ayton hurt like hell without Murray.  I'm betting it'll be Simmons when they meet up.  Jrue. Duh.  Jrue. Duh.  Kawhi  Jrue or Dort  Jrue or Dort  Jrue or Dort  Probably Kawhi  Embiid / Ayton / Nurk probably  Clutch situations.  Probably someone like Gobert."
"His co-star honestly &amp; rightfully so threw him under the bus, the coach &amp; GM has as well and shit even the role players (Danny Green) &amp; fans turned against him, shit Ben himself has turnt against everyone in the organization as a whole I don’t see how it’s exaggeration"
"Because they can split Tobias into Hield and Barnes. Barnes is  worse than Tobias on offense but better on D. And is making considerably less on a 1 year shorter deal. He can replicate some of What Tobias does. Hield gives them another knock down shooter to help embiid.  They could run Maxey, Hield, Barnes, Siakam and Embiid. With Curry, Danny Green, Milton, Drummond and Thybulle off the bench. I’m not sure what the trade value of Tobias Harris is but I originally had them giving him straight up for Hield and Barnes but people complained the Kings wouldn’t do it so I added picks. The Picks for Simmons would be lightly protected while the ones for Harris would be heavily protected."
"In a vacuum, I agree since I see McDaniels being a pretty good 4 in the NBA, but the 76ers prefer already developed players. I also don't think Beverley moves the needle much, especially since they kept Danny Green, so if we are comparing Barnes/Hield to Beasley/McDaniels, I think Philly prefers the Kings offer. Plus Simmons is a dicier fit in Sactown so those picks could be perceived to be more valuable."
"Rondo didn't start a single playoff game for the Lakers, just FYI. Danny Green and KCP were the Lakers starting backcourt all throughout the playoffs."

Danny Green meant a bucket of hot wings.
shit I love me some danny green and he's never even played for my team
For the [one time](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412786363021/Danny-Green-010.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0c50a8ff634729f29efe912f09fa1110)
"me, a Spurs fan, trying to rationalize what the fuck Danny Green was thinking at the time."
"This  Danny Green has been on a lot of teams, has won a bunch and is generally considered a great locker room guy. It's not like this was coming from a huge asshole of a player or something.  Ben gone and the rest of the team really just does not care"
"Danny ""Daryl Morey"" Green just trying to jack up Ben's price so of course he's gonna present him as some amazing defender (he is great, but not better than gobert)"
"Regardless of how bad Ben was, let’s not forget how the whole org completely threw him under the fucking bus.  While Ben is a very flawed player on many fronts, I don’t think either party is really innocent here.  This is an *awful* quote from Danny Green, all I can say is I hope it’s out of context."
"right but you’re not danny green. he has been shopped around himself plenty, and seen disgruntled superstars up close. if anyone wasn’t to be offended by this it’s absolutely green"
ben+young guy+pick’s return would be a significant upgrade over seth curry or danny green  its not an important argument really but maxey could start for us and id be okay with it as long as our 2-3 spot is upgraded a good bit
"Maybe he and Simmons are friends (they are with the same agency) and hes upset about about the Simmons situation too   ""Those are great vets,"" Maxey said Monday. ""They talk to me all the time. I literally just talked to 'Tisse and congratulated him. Ben, I talk to him all the time. Danny Green texted us before the game and was just telling us to go out there, go hard, and compete.""  This was a very recent quote from Maxey himself, saying he talks to him all the time"
"Morey built the only team that pushed the unbeatable Warriors to the edge. they spanked the Cavs in the finals repeatedly. Dude still has forgotten more basketball knowledge than anyone on this sub will ever know.  He also turned Horford into Danny Green.   Jrich into Seth. and that was just offseason one.  the Harden trade will never be confirmed but at the end of the day Ben Simmons + 2 1st still is better than Kelly Olynk and 4 late picks. but reports are Rockets wudnt deal with us anyway and that our final package was Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle and 2 1st so idk.     Lowry didnt want to be here. He forced his way to the heat and made reports take a poo poo return of Dragic and Precious and a 2nd for their best player all time. then he resigned to 30mill. did we want Lowry yes, did he want to come here or would resign here, we will never know. did we want to give up more than Danny Green and Maxey hell no and it was right to feel that way.  not firing a coach after one seasons isnt indicative of anyone over the hill lol this post is all over place."
[Danny Green always knows the right thing to say](https://i.imgur.com/RPGzhRU.jpg)
Danny green thinks wolves are gonna give up DLo and Jaden. Absolutely delusional Danny
Danny Green is also one of the biggest vet advocates for getting that check. He's been on the outskirts of the league and can say he clawed his way into being a coveted vet with a transferable skillset. I'd say he gets it more than a good portion of the league.
Danny Green invited the entire NBA
"Danny Green in response: ""You know i had to do it one time lol"""
"I don’t get it. Doc and Embiid made pretty reasonable comments in the minutes after a devastating and shocking playoff loss, then turned course and said all the right things. The claims that Simmons was “thrown under the bus” are insane considering the lengths EVERYONE in the organization (Doc included) went through to publicly defend him all season long. Danny green called out the fans. Doc said the infamous “you don’t know basketball,” line.   Up until this playoff series, even the fans jumped through hoops to defend the guy. And then he gets pissy that people are justifiably mad at his atrocious playoff performances?  Fuck Ben. Absolute clown."
"I think *ideally* for Philly, and **this is a longshot to happen** is a trade to the Raptors for OG and FVV.  Ben has a lot of faults, but the two things he can provide are ball-handling and defending the opponent's best player. Having both of those duties for 1 player is huge and to realistic replace those duties it'd require 2 players back. FVV and OG provide that.  A shittier version of that would be one of Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton and Harrison Barnes.   That's always been my issue with a CJ trade - Philly is going to kick and scream to get Robert Covington back too because if Ben's gone - who's going to defend the 3 on the 76ers? Old-ass Danny Green?"
I'm starting to think Danny Green isn't a huge Ben Simmons fan
"What is wrong with these wolves fans on this subreddit lmfao. Like you are just throwing up horrific trade packages. Would you accept Shake milton, Danny green, and jaden springer for Anthony Edwards?"
&gt;I don't remember the last time a player on a team so openly talked about what they expect to get back in a trade package for a player still technically on the team.  This tells us a lot more about Danny Green than Ben Simmons imo. He's *been* open in interviews.
Danny Green 3x Champ!
"Hate to break this to you and Danny Green, but Ben Simmons is still on the sixers roster"
Danny Green HAD TO DO IT FOR THE ONE TIME
Trade Danny Green now and let’s just see mayhem
I was hacked - Danny green
This combined with the danny green post is kinda damning.
"I was pretty concerned with Avery Bradley opting out of the bubble but overall they were able to burp out an 8-man rotation that worked fine. Definitely carried heavy by LeBron and AD though.  Starting lineup: Lebron, AD, KCP, Danny Green, Caruso  Bench: Kuzma, Rondo, Markieff Morris  Howard played like 10 minutes a game but was a horrible matchup against Bam"
I haven't listened to them since they went premium but for an overall solid nerd show they had some absolutely ridiculous takes. The worst one I remember was ranking Danny Green ahead of Booker is SG rankings in 2019.
G - Rickey Green aka Fastest of Them All   G - Danny Green aka Icy Hot   F - Jeff Green aka Uncle Jeff   F - Draymond Green aka Day-Day aka The Dancing Bear aka Dray   C - AC Green aka Iron Man    Backups   G/F - Gerald Green aka Hot Chocolate   F -  Johnny Green aka Jumpin Johnny   PF/C - Sidney Green aka El Sid   C - Mike Green aka Count
This the same [Danny Green](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7a-p5fTSPSrp0RSK3rsdc1zb_TXpXF4LbXg&amp;usqp=CAU) ?
"Lakers had Danny Green, KCP in 2020"
"I'm going to ignore the strawman presented here.  I'm in the belief that Barrett will be better this year because he is a better shooter [True Shooting Percentage is not a measure of being a better shooter, its a measure of scoring efficiency], a better defender, and frankly I don't value someone of LeVert's skill-set because your team isn't going anywhere with him playing the role he does.  LeVert's usage doesn't allow for other perimeter players to flourish on-ball in a way which Barrett's skill-set allows. LeVert needs the ball to have his impact  and it takes on a usage where other players can't have the ball.   I always think about the DeMar DeRozan vs Danny Green comparison. I would take Danny Green over DeMar 10/10 times."
"Met Danny Green at his meet and greet for the one season he was in Toronto.   The number of people that showed up was than expected so Danny stayed back several hours later than he was supposed to, to finish autographing and taking selfies with everyone."
"&gt; If KD goes down, the Warriors still have a big 3  *Danny Green has entered the chat*"
"&gt; Hasn't regressed on defense or as a passer/playmaker. Just lost faith in his shot. &gt;  &gt;   His AST per 36 has regressed from 8.7 in 17-18 to 8.1 in 18-20 to 7.7 in 20-21. His Defensive Win Shares has regressed from 5.0 in 17-18 to 3.3 in 20-21. His VORP has dropped from 4.5 to 3.8 to 2.8 to 2.2.  &gt;Same guy who is only 25!!, elite on the fast break, elite defending the wing, a great passer, and who scores 15 ppg despite a clear mental block. literally all he would need to be effective in the playoffs is getting ft's up to 60% and building confidence.  And has a reputation for putting in as little work in as possible. Plus, wing defense is overrated; it's better to have a great defender who can score than a shut-down defender who can't, because there isn't a single ""shut-down"" defender who can actually shut down a superstar scorer.  &gt;Identify the player Phi could acquire who would be better than Simmons (since you are trading away potential/youth/team control) and the picks that would accompany him.  Patrick Beverley and Robert Covington would be better for the 76ers than Simmons by virtue of taking up less of the salary cap, while providing defense and scoring. Even Danny Green, washed as he is, would probably be better value for the 76ers.  &gt;If the answer is no one, then it's a terrible trade.  Yeah, it's a terrible trade both ways. Simmons costs to much for what he is and does, and there's no way the 76ers will be able to get what they believe to be commiserate value because others teams simply don't think Simmons is worth what they're asking.  To put it another way: Simmons is like a very beautiful woman who you've married in Vegas after getting really drunk, except when you actually get to know her, you discover she's vapid, a persecution complex, complains to the manager of every business she walks into, and has a Hitler tramp stamp. And all of this ends up on display because she makes enough of a scene to be on the local news.  You might be into her for how good she looks and her potential to become a good person once you fix her, but most people are going to look at her and think she's not worth the trouble."
Makes them much better offensively while giving up a good chunk defensively. Embiid is still a DPOY level player. Danny Green is solid. Thybulle is an all-defensive level guy.
"I know I'm biased but the Lowry trade was right there for them. IMO it would have put them over the top against the Bucks, never mind the Hawks. Giving up Maxey and Danny Green would've hurt yes, but I think Lowry could've made up 70% of DG's defense and Embiid/Simmons would've stepped up to cover elsewhere"
"I remember seeing this live and fucking dying. Just a few minutes before, Danny Green purposely fouled Gerald Green (or the other way around I can’t remember) and Mike Breen called it by saying something like “shoves his second cousin to get the foul.” That’s why JVG produced this masterpiece of words.  Also second cousins means they are the children of first cousins, thus sharing one pair of great-grandparents."
"I don't even know why people do this. Klay got injured in a contested dunk by Danny Green (not blaming DG). In another timeline, that injury doesn't happen. Now, KD probably should have rested that calf, so I can see people thinking that the Achilles injury was inevitable with playing time. But still no guarantee he tears it.  And a healthy(ish) Warriors would have murdered the 76ers."
"Well yea that was happening but even at the time I remember nobody going ""Danny Green is anti-Semitic"", people mostly going ""Danny Green is an idiot"".  I still maintain if this happened to a less likable/less talented player, even with a less potent cancel culture than we have now, that dude would be getting the Meyers Leonard treatment"
"Really? At the time I remember people understanding it was a stupid and insensitive thing to do, but didn't represent Danny Green as a person."
"He apologized, and even of the time anyone who spent 10 minutes watching Danny Green understood it was an insensitive and boneheaded move, not exactly him being anti semitic or anything and doesn't represent Danny Green as a whole."

danny green is an idiot both inside and outside the nba- his airball versus the heat was embarrasing last year  there are athletes who i respect intellectually such as kobe but green aint it
"[Danny ""you know i had to do it one time lol"" Green](https://media2.fdncms.com/sacurrent/imager/danny-green-makes-holocaust-gaffe-on-faceb/u/original/2326184/danny-greenjpg)"
Danny Green lmao
Watched nba since the early 90s   Lebron is better and it’s not even close   Million times better finals performances vs million times better teams  More 40 point games in the finals vs defensive players of the year like leonard and green than Jordan did vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   There wouldn’t be a Jordan era if even Durant played in the expansion era 90s  Imagine only making 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history
"This only confirms what I've been saying about Danny Green for years. The dude wins, and every casual who complains about his ICY stretches needs to shut up and watch him bury dudes in the playoffs."
"Wall for Tobias Harris and Danny Green, would be a better deal, IMO.   Wall could allow the Sixers to play Simmons more like a mobile big/point-forward hybrid.    And once they get out of Wall's contract, they would potentially have space to add a key free agent. Or they could trade him again in his last year at hte deadline for some help.  At this point, why not?"
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Jordan had less 40 point games in the finals vs Pe Teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   than Lebron did vs defensive players of the year Like Leonard and Green  Not starting an argument just stating a FACT
"Clippers, Lakers, Warriors, Nuggets, Nets, Hawks, could all make the same case. Shit, even the Suns have a case with Dario going down, CP3 getting a string of nagging issues, and Booker getting his nose fucked up by Pat Bev. Sixers also lost Danny Green and had Ben Simmons battling psychological damage"
"Danny Green doing his wedding right. Minus the walking bush thing, that looked like Kim Kardashian at next years met gala."
"Yea, that’s not very many attempts.  Especially when your other two best players are Embiid and Simmons.  I think combined, they averaged less than 5 or 6 attempts a game (Danny Green shot more than all of them combined)."
"&gt; The Heat were by far the more talented team, younger and athletic team, and it only went to game 7 because LeBron underperformed for so much of it when in reality they should have throttled the Spurs.  You cherry pick example of bad decisions (e.g. Bagley vs Luka) while ignoring good ones (e.g. Mavs trading to get Luka)... and forget that we're still talking about the best basketball coaches in the world. You're not talking about some occasional mistakes... you're saying that most of them don't bother and *you* have figured it out. Come on man.    And also, you ignore the fact that 1) Lebron and the rest of the Heat admitted that attempting the to break the win streak (and ""only"" managing 27 games in a row) took a lot out of them  2) The Spurs broke THREE finals records to earn those victories. They didn't just have ""good games"" they had *historic* games.  Including Danny Green being Steph before Steph was a thing (finals record), record low for turnovers (in a one possession loss against a Heat team that fed off them) and highest team percentage for 3p% in a finals game (at one point they were shooting like 75-80% from the 3 in the first half iirc).    And the idea that the Spurs -- who the previous year were two wins away from the finals before Harden went off, and the following year would destroy these same Heat to win it all -- were some kind of pushover team is nonsense. Kawhi was starting to come into his own... while they still had Manu, Tony &amp; Tim. And of course Danny ""I can't miss in the finals"" Green.    Yes, Lebron did worst against them. *Because they are a great team with great defense*. And you're talking about Pop, one of the greatest coaches of all time, having all day to plan to stop Lebron specifically... vs regular season numbers. Those aren't meaningful comparisons.    Hell, Jordan himself -- a career ~50% shooter -- shot .427 in the '98 finals. Did that mean he ""underperformed""? Or, was it that the Jazz had all day to plan for specifics and could make harder.   Truth resists simplicity.    (also Aside -- Simmons isn't someone I take seriously as a commentator on all things Lebron)."
Danny Green was as good a defender as Kawhi back in 2014.
"Defensively, he's better than Danny Green and Pat Bev. He has the size and versatility of those top 3 guys in your post that neither posses and both are also past their primes. They have both lost a step in the last few years imo. Shooting wise. yes, they are both better. I think he's a better overall player now than both, so I would place him 4th on this list right now."
He would be. Imagine if the other team had to put their second best guy on Lebron. Instead of Kawhi in 2014 is Ginobli/Danny Green
How would you stack the Mavericks players up against the low end of the list?  Let's say Danny Green and Jae Crowder
"Danny Ainge would probably be a pretty good player in today’s era. Give me prime Jeff Green though, he was really good for like one year"
Danny Green is more 3 and above average D than 3 and great D. He’s regeressed a little due to age.
KCP is better than Danny Green in my opinion.
Of course he played a vital role. Danny green was also vital on multiple championship teams
Yea and I don't see people blaming Lebron for that loss lol I see them blame Danny Green for bricking a wide open 3  Likewise we should blame Draymond for bricking the game winning layup
I think Kawhi would’ve done a good job on LeBron but Danny Green wouldn’t be able to guard Kyrie
4 of the 6 times it’s happened it was steve Kerr related Steve Kerr did it Chris Boucher won one with the Warriors and one against them  Patrick McCaw won one with the Warriors and one against them Danny Green won one against the Warriors
Joel Embiid and Danny Green are also players on the Philadelphia 76ers' roster.
"yo Dlo on the 6ers could be great. Goes all in on shooting/scoring around Embiid. Joel by himself is a passable defense + Green and Harris is solid enough and they have some specialists if needed (Thybulle) so I doubt defense will be a huge problem (except when Embiid sits...) and that starting 5 would be INSANE on offense. Dlo/Seth Curry/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid. You have 3 guys who can create, all 5 are respectable to great from 3, and you can spread the floor like crazy when Embiid wants to take over + if Dlo also can take over sometimes if Embiid can't for some reason.  Honestly that sounds like a load of fun please Morey do it!"
danny green is still getting paid for that one play off series
You actually putting it on Danny Green?
Or if Danny Green had made his shots
Danny Green
Danny Green and Patrick McCaw were the first two that came to mind
Danny Green  Pat McCaw  Steve Kerr
Danny Green
"Crowder is such a clown. Look at him hooking LeBron’s arm as he fell trying to injure him. Crowder has consistently been one of the most overrated players in the league. He gets cooked on defense by every decent wing, and is basically a 2020 Danny green on offense"
Danny Green
"Danny Green 2013 Finals. He was shooting lights out from 3. He shot 69% from games 1-3, 3/5 on game 4, 6/10 on game 5. He would’ve been the Finals MVP but rebound Bosh, back out to Allen, and bang."
"Joakim Noah and KG becuse they were fake tough guys. All bark, no bite.   Lance Stephenson and Pat Bev. Bone headed antics. Spending most games just running  around while doing jack shit.   2020 Danny Green. Mans had no business putting the ball on the floor. Everytime he tried to go off the dribble I would just sigh and assume a turnover (which for the most part was true)"
"Yeah, Ben has led the league in 3 pointers assisted since he entered the league. It’s no coincidence guys like Saric, Danny Green, Covington, etc had their best 3 point shooting years here  https://www.google.com/amp/s/thesixersense.com/2020/03/30/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-3-point-manufacturer/amp/  Only reason Embiid takes as many threes and mid rangers as he does is because Ben forces him to the perimeter. He has been very vocal about this during the off season. The fit is not great"
"Longley vs McGee: At their respective career points, I'd say it's a wash.  Rodman vs AD: this is the kind of player Rodman was born to guard. Quick enough to keep on the perimeter, and AD isn't big enough or strong enough to take advantage of Rodman's size in the post. Not to mention he'd be in AD's head by game 3. They'll be great to watch on the boards, though.   Pippen vs Lebron: absolute clash of titans. Obviously you give Lebron a slight edge, but over seven games, it could go either way.  Jordan vs Danny Green: lol.  Harper vs Caldwell-Pope: KCP has always been a fine role player. Ron Harper was a pretty good player who would've been a second option on most teams in the league. He put up 20 ppg three times when he was younger, including the season before he joined the Bulls. He also shot .362 on threes that year (on a minuscule for today 2.5 attempts).  Harper has at least one game where he's the difference.   &amp;#x200B;  Bulls in 6. I'm not saying Lebron would be shut down, but you've got two of the best individual defenders ever to throw at him. And there's just no answer for Jordan on these Lakers. Lebron could probably do it, but that's a big ask at this point in her career."
Danny green in the finals that one year. I think there was a game him and some other random role player torched the Heat and blue then out
"While I think the Bulls take it, I think people are forgetting AD was playing some of the best basketball ever by a center (55/38/85 ish) and LeBron was dropping 40pt trip dubs on 70% fg. It's closer than they'd think.  Their wing problem got xontained when AD played C and they could throw quality defenders like Danny Green at people"
Danny Green throwing away the ball near the end of Game 6 2019 finals
Danny Green turnover in game 6 raps vs warriors
"Game 6 2019 finals, Raptors have the ball up 1 with ~11 seconds left.  You'd think the Warriors foul and send someone to the line to hit their free throws. The play's set up for Danny Green to pass to Pascal Siakam, however he throws a horrible pass that barely hits Pascal's hands.  Warriors get the ball, Ibaka has a decent closeout on Steph, and the Raptors get the ball and have free throws to ice it.  That could've gone worse for Danny in more than 1 way if that shot hit."
The salary cap is almost triple what it was then. Danny green was a 5ppg guy at the same phase of his career as herro is now. If Jeff green didn’t miss an entire season with a hear condition when his value was highest hed be paid a lot more.
"Sure it’s possible but is it that likely? He’s not a star nor a star in the making. Jeff Green’s lengthy career is gonna hit $86M at the end of 2021-22, Danny Green will be at $91M at the end of this season. Obviously pretty random comps, but both Greens are certainly not nobodies and have been around a long time."
"If there's a word that combines the disposition of being both naive and delusional then I want to know because that's what I would describe you as. Anyway.........                              &gt; Imagine only making 6 finals in 16 years in the weakest era in nba history               Weakest era? In the original top 50 players of all time, 19 of them won championships or MVPs in the 80s &amp; 90s. 29 of them played in the 80s or 90s. If you look at the top 20 players of all time, 12 of them played against Jordan in the 80s and 90s. That era was stacked with all time greats, you should probably put that narrative into the bottom shelf where it belongs.              With the Bulls, Jordan literally played only 11 full seasons, two were cut short by injury and retirement. His years on the Wizards are an afterthought in any reasonable thinking person's mind and should be disregarded. So he basically made 6 finals in 11 seasons, a 54.5% rate. If we take a similar tone with LeBron, we disregard his rookie season as he was just out of high school but he soon hit his stride in year two averaging 27/7/7. That's 17 full seasons. He's made the Finals 10 of those, a 58.8% rate. Impressive but not a night and day difference, *and* he's been building superteams that entire time, basically breaching anti tampering and collusion guidelines in the process. Hardly something that deserves the respect of fans aside from those who are equally bereft of morals and ethics. If we take that further and look at championships won, well Jordan remains on 54.5% while LeBron falls to just a 23.5% success rate on his custom built superteams.                &gt; But he sure did beat Shawn kemp and Drexler.                    And LeBron sure did beat DeRozen &amp; Lowry on his way to the Finals in 2018. Yet you'll talk about him carrying that team to the Finals like some kind of superhero, how he beat 19yo Tatum in the Conference Finals like it was some kind of historical achievement.                    &gt; Lebron has more game winners in the playoffs than Jordan, Kobe and Curry COMBINED                Define 'game winners'. This thread is about buzzer beaters and the sample size is so small that it's a ridiculous statement to make. What if LeBron had 2 and Jordan had 1? You'd probably come out and say 'OMG LeBron has TWICE the game winners as MJ!!'. It's just dumb.                &gt; Million times better finals performances and more 40 point games in the finals   Now you're just plain embarrassing yourself. You honestly sound like a 15 year old. Both Jordan and LeBron have been phenomenal in the NBA Finals, both have stratospheric stats. There is no way any rational thinking human being could summise that LeBron was 'a million times' better. It's a nonsensical conclusion given the evidence at hand.             Sure, Lebron has 8 40 point games vs Jordan's 6 in the Finals but he has played 55 Finals games to get those 8. Jordan played 35 Finals games. Also, LeBron averaged 28.4ppg in the Finals. Jordan has averaged 33.6ppg. Despite the disparity in ppg, the TS% is negligible, 55.9% for Jordan vs 56.2% for LeBron.                   &gt; vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and Green than jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec                              In his 6 Finals appearances, Jordan faced a player who was named All Defense *that same season* five out of six times. The only time he missed facing one he still had an opponent who was an all league defender just two seasons earlier. Also, it's a *team* game. Jordan's Bulls faced a top 10 defensive team in all but one series. LeBron has faced a team outside the top ten three times.                     &gt; Best finals and playoffs performances of all time                 *Some* of the best. But so does Jordan. What the hell is your point here?                 &gt; Scored more than Jordan on 2k less shots                     This is such a dumb argument. LeBron literally has twice the number of shot attempts within 3ft of the rim than Jordan has. This stat is simply a reflection of their playing styles. Jordan has ten scoring titles, LeBron has one. Nobody on this planet is stupid enough to think LeBron is the superior scorer simply because he took less shots to make his points. It's insane.                      &gt; Jordan wouldn't make the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 Cavs teams LeGOAT took to the finals. Im talking about in the modern era not the expansion era where Jordan made the playoffs going 30-52.                 Oh, we're making purely subjective points now are we? How the hell do you know what Jordan would have done on those teams? It's impossible to say. Also, that 30-52 team was his freaking *rookie* season and nowhere near the expansion era.                  &gt; There wouldn't even be a jordan era if even Durant played in the expansion era 90s                     More subjective nonsense.                         &gt; Literally never won 1 measly playoff series without Pippen guarding the opposing teams best players                        You have no idea who Pippen was guarding. Bulls won their first playoff series with Jordan averaging 45/5/5 with 4.4 stocks. Pippen was a rookie averaging half of Jordan's minutes and had a worse defensive rating that series. In fact Pippen never made an all defensive team until 1991, meanwhile the Bulls won 5 playoff series prior to that season. You're just straight up making stuff up right now.                 &gt; Played with way more ALL NBA AND ALL NBA Defensive teammates                    More straight up lies. LeBron has played with 26 All NBA &amp; All Defensive players in his career. Jordan played with 9. In case you are wondering, 26 is greater than 9.                    &gt; Its not even close anymore bud, and i watched nba since the early 90s                       Well it is close, kind of, but it isn't Jordan who is running second here. He is still sitting on the throne. Most sane people realise this, it's why 70% of respondents on average, across many surveys with 100s of thousands of respondents, all put Jordan as the GOAT while just 15% have LeBron as theirs. That's a landslide victory. Those surveys not only include fans but NBA players, NCAA coaches etc. If it were an election result it would be an embarrassing loss for LeBron.             Not only is public opinion heavily in Jordan's favour, so are the important aspects of a basketball player's legacy. I'm talking about stats, accolades and team success. Team success is an easy one, 6 championships vs 4....and LeBron got his four by stacking his teams with All NBA talent (as evidence above) building superteams everywhere he has played. It's a shameful act of deceit how he has in fact accumulated the team success he has, literally by breaching anti tampering rules and talking top ten talent into joining up. How can you admire a player who does that? He is taking the easy road to the Finals every damn season and somehow you think that is praise worthy? It hurts my brain to think about.           In terms of personal accolades, it's quite clear who is on top. 5 MVPs vs 4. 6 Finals MVPs vs 4. 1 DPOY vs none. 9 All Defensive 1st teams vs 5. 9 scoring titles vs 1. 3 steals titles vs none. The only thing LeBron leads in is All NBA teams and he has one assist title. But Jordan did pretty much all that in just 11 eligible seasons on the Bulls while LeBron is going into his 19th season and still won't catch up. Hard to beat 13 All NBA 1st teams when you play just 11 eligible seasons and another 2 as a near 40yo on bad knees.              Finally, MJ has LeBron beat in just about every advanced metric which aggregates box score stats and which can be applied to career numbers. In terms of *per game* numbers, he leads Lebron in BPM, WS, VORP, PER, RAPTOR +/-, RAPTOR WAR in *both* the playoffs and regular season. Hell, if you want to apply game score to their career numbers then MJ is ahead. The only statistical argument LeBron has is in longevity biased stats, so career totals...but that will happen when one guy plays 61k minutes in the regular and post season and the other plays 48k.           For someone who claims to have watched the game since 1990 you sure seem to be struggling in your analytical skills. I'm thinking maybe Jordan torched your teams in the 90s and stopped your favourite players from winning chips? There must be some kind of stupid bias here. Oh wait, I've got it, you must be a Cavs fan. MJ ripped your team's collective hearts out several times while LeBron is your cities greatest champion. No wonder you're so blind to the truth. Makes sense..."
"Loaded without KD? I mean we were good for sure, you don't win 73 by being bad. But in terms of pure talent were the 14-16 warriors really better than a team like the '19 raptors? That team was on a 60 win pace without Kawhi or Danny Green. And it's not like the Thunder or Cavs, or even the Rockets were devoid of talent. Most championship teams are loaded, one man carry jobs happen once a decade at best."
"I think as usual with these questions, the Lakers would be one of the favorites. Lakers would have  PG Gary Payton  SG Mitch Richmond  SF Dennis Rodman (he came into the league as a SF, won his first DPOY with the Pistons as a SF and that was arguably his best overall season in his career)  PF Karl Malone  C Maurice Lucas (or Spencer Haywood who’s a HOFer or Tyson Chandler or Andre Drummond just for laughs)  That’s 5 HOFers and there are plenty of guys you can put off the bench who were solid like a Haywood/Chandler, Caron Butler, Danny Green   Adrian Dantley played 1.5 years, otherwise he would be on there too."
"thats a good one. with hedo, danny green and billups again"
Billups  Danny Green (?)   Kawhi   Marion  Hakeem   6man j o'neal
Danny green
"Lebron has more game winners in the playoffs than Jordan, Kobe and Curry COMBINED  Million times better finals performances vs defensive players of the year like Leonard and Green than jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec   Best finals and playoffs performances of all time  Scored more than Jordan on 2k less shots  Get over it. There wouldn't even be a jordan era if even Durant played in the expansion era 90s"
Danny Green gets his ring baybay!
"Danny Green was more important than any of those guys, and still, that's not the core. Those are the players around the core. Put any NBA players in the right position around Lebron and AD (healthy) and they're a finals lock."
"It's fair to say he underperformed but that does happen to a lot of shooters in the playoffs. If you're a 3-point specialist like Harris, your space just disappears when defenses key in.  Look at Danny Green lately in regular season vs playoffs.  It may have looked different if he was sharing the court with KD, Harden, and Kyrie."
Transient Danny Green fan?
Danny green was never as consistent as joe during a regular season. He has always been up and down.
"Barnes had one season at 40-41 3pt% with the Warriors, Harris has had TWO with ***47.5% \[BOLD AND ITALICS TO INDICATE IMPORTANT INFORMATION\]***, league leading both times  to start missing everything in the postseason while also being the entire league's idea of a shooting specialist? Why, that's a Danny Green, Hold The Defense."
"The Danny Green turnover up 1 with 10 seconds left, Game 6 of the finals."
How can u not love Joel and “had to do it one time” Danny Green
"By 2013 and 2014 Wade was no longer an elite defender.  He wasn’t even doing a good job on George Hill and Danny Green.  Bosh was still a beast and though nowhere near as good as the other two he was a great fit as a small ball center.  But I will 100% argue that Gasol was better at everything on a basketball court in 2009/10 minus fast break/small ball center than Bosh.  Calling him a 19/10 guy is minimizing how good he was.  He was an elite passer who could run their offense from the high post, a solid rim defender and he was hyper efficient.  He scored the same as Memphis on far fewer touches per game.  He also was definitely not a natural fit next to Kobe, he 100% changed his game from post ups to moving to the high post for Kobe’s spacing.  Not that he couldn’t shoot from the high post before, but in LA operated only out of the high post.  You’re right that Fish and Artest were role players, but they were both better than any role players on the Heat, not to mention Lamar Odom, who was playing at an all star level.  There was a definite talent discrepancy at the top in favor of the heat, but the Lakers were the more complete team, especially for that era.  Wade was a top 3 in MVP in my book that one year, but he wasn’t too 10 by the time the Heattles teamed up, knees are a bitch.  So listing the accolades he had when he was younger is kind of irrelevant.  Also, a lot of those role players like Shane Battier, Birdman, Haslem, Chalmers, Cole etc, were made much, much better by LeBron.  A lot of them washed out of the league after LeBron stopped propping them up.  If anything it’s more evidence of how good your big three were.  Bosh’s before his time spacing, Wade’s Jack of all trades skill set, and LeBron I don’t need to say anything.  Kobe did not make his role players better.  In fact, I’d argue players had to definitely do less to play with him."
"Spurs cause they should have won in 2013 but completely choked it away  No hate towards the Heat but in game 6 they blew a 10 point lead going into the 4th and missed multiple FT and Ray Allen and hit the most incredible shot in history   Even on top of this the Spurs lost the OT to go to a game 7 where Tony Parker goes 3/12, Danny Green 1/2 and Tim Duncan bricked a crucial layup. Meanwhile LeBron went god mode, Wade chipped in an efficient 23, and Battier came in huge with 6/8 from 3s after going 6/19 in the first 6 games"
Anyone who thought that was or is *likely* to occur was ridiculous. But I don't think most fans thought that. We just *hoped* it would happen. There's a difference between thinking and hoping and I don't think people deserve hate for hoping. There's at least some chance it could have happened if Dame demanded out. We aren't talking like giving up Korkmaz and Danny Green for Dame. It was always about a young DPOY contender as well as picks and other young players for Dame. It wasn't outlandish if Dame wanted out.
if trae doesnt get hurt do the sixers get a healthy embiid and danny green
"God forbid you go for a rebound...  Alternatively, maybe small guys should avoid going towards the trees because the injury risk goes up precipitously. There can be very little sympathy for a guy that goes hard at the rim and gets injured somehow, because there *are* basketball moves (for the other side) that will injure them. Reminds me of Danny Green undercutting Klay Thompson. This is the playoffs, you never give up the rim."
Danny Green and KCP immediately were the guys I thought of.
"&gt; You just have to get lucky on second round picks  Im pointing out that even when they did, they let those players go. Also, yes, Danny Green is an impact player. Man was minutes away from an FMVP in 2013.  Hes not Middleton tier, of course. But it is possible for cleveland to get lucky, because they did and then squandered it."
Danny Green is not any sort of impact player. He’s fine to have as a fourth option on a playoff team. But he is nowhere near the player Middleton is.
"That's just incorrect, you have Danny Green who can make entry passes to the post.   You'd also get CJ McCollum who averages 4.7 assists alongside playing a main ball handler. If CJ is put in the point guard position, it's very likely that his assists would go up.  Again, the problem of sixers isn't distribution, once Ben gets across half court, he just passes it to Embiid or Tobias and goes standing in to the dunkers spot.  CJ on the hand can play off ball and run pick and rolls with Embiid or Tobias. Which is what the sixers need desperately."
Cavs got Danny Green and let him go.
"Also why does no one give Doc the slight benefit. He was in a heated emotional moment. The Sixers just lost the series and it was pretty clearly because of Simmons. If Simmons was a 50% ft shooter that series, the Sixers would have one. Aside from his unwillingness to shoot the ball.   Of course the coach is pissed. It’s also clear that there’s not a ton of love lost within the Sixers org for Simmons. Pretty much only Danny Green stood up for him."
I mean I think besides this whole Simmons ordeal he’s been pretty good at philly getting Seth in aswell as getting off of horford for cheap while still getting in a usable player in Danny green.
"A reason for the fans, but Rivers doing it is stupid as hell.  Same with Danny Green recently, you'd think that everyone would have the common sense to take a step back and see it wasn't constructive."
My guy Danny Green should be mentioned his nickname's icy hot for a reason
"Not sure if he's the best, but won't Danny Green come to anyone's mind?"
"Doesn't take much for Lakers fans to turn on their own, though. Their treatment of Danny Green after game #5 of the 2020 Finals was despicable."
Plus they were pretty inept with drafting/developing. They had some picks along with lebron. Man they had Danny Green and Joe Harris at some points
"It just depends how far Morey _and Embiid_ are willing to go.  They have their first this year. And next. They could make up some bullshit injury for Embiid, load manage Tobias Harris and Danny Green, develop Maxey and BBall Paul, and just generally Process it up until Simmons decides he might actually like to have a career."
"If he really thought he would get a trade that would be a win for him after Ben fucked up as bad as he did. The SAS „only“ got DeRozan, Poeltl and a protected first for Danny Green, who is a career 40 fucking % shooter from 3 and Kawhi Leonard who is 10 times the player Ben is or ever will be. And I rather have 2 good rentals than a piece of shit car that could break literally any minute"
"Thybulle is a weird guy to call overrated, but sure.  I agree an Tatum. I feel like he's Danny Granger 2.0 (both players awesome).  I agree on the talent part, but not the overall product.  Screenshotted the Jalen Green take as I want you to get full credit when you turn out correct.  You may be right on Kyrie. Not really sure to be honest.  COMPLETELY AGREE about Butler and the Sixers."
"That 100% would have happened. Take Danny Ferry for example, he hardly ever got playing time cuz he was a 6'10 shooter that got outmuscled in the paint. Sam Perkins is the only other big I can think of that was given the green light to shoot from outside. It really wasn't until dudes like Jonathan Bender came around that teams started letting tall guys play like guards, and I'm pretty sure that's just because bender is so lanky that it would have been impossible to bulk up"
"I feel like KAT and D’Lo for Embiid would be a more interesting question. Obviously the salaries don’t work, but the whole point of the trade rumors is that Simmons and Embiid don’t work well together.   Would a lineup of KAT, Ben Simmons, DLo, Tobias Harris, and Danny Green contend for a title? I think it would. The 76ers also wouldn’t need to worry about Embiid’s health.   For the Wolves, I feel like they could talk themselves into being able to build a contender around an Embiid + Ant pairing. Embiid is also locked in for another 5 years, so they wouldn’t need to worry about him re-signing, like they will with KAT. A lineup featuring Embiid, Ant, McDaniels, and Beasley has a ton of potential. They’d just need to find a good starting PG."
Sometimes thats all you need from a role player. The most Danny green scored during that run was 14 points but the both played decent to good defense consistently. There aren’t AD-like expectations attached to role players so yes he did contribute to winning a championship.
"He really wasn’t, I don’t know what people were watching. If kobe was a spot up shooter and his defense remained the same he would be viewed like a danny green type defender. Still pretty good, but best defender you’ve ever seen? Not a chance"
I'd say Danny Green has more value honestly. 3nD is too valuable. Plus the Curry connection to the Blazers.
Chris Bosh fouled Danny Green at the end of game six
"Dude they put Danny Green and Seth Curry on the team. Plus added Tobias Harris. Forkmas can shoot. They have plenty of shooting. Stop making excuses for Simmons. He’s a point guard. Period. He shouldn’t be playing short corner dunker lol. That should be embarrassing for him. He should be ashamed of the fact that defenders play him 3-4 steps inside of the 3pt line. That he can’t shoot free throws.   Until he learns to shoot and can put appropriate pressure on a defense, he’s going to hamper the offense. Period. Come playoff time teams will play his accordingly and will highlight his inabilities.   He comes off like a prima-Donna who’s insecure about his game. God forbid Rivers and some of his teammates demand more of him and try to hold him accountable. The reports out there seem to indicate he really doesn’t give a shit too. He’s more concerned about living somewhere he can go out at night then becoming the best player he can be.   If that’s his prerogative - fine. Different things are more important to different people. But let’s not give this guy a pass and make excuses for him. It is what it is - dude is a liability in big, important games."
"Part of the issue with players of Bens caliber is that he is way tooooo valuable of an asset to let walk over a few million, but as you said, he needs the right players to thrive. So building around him AFTER he has received his extension is hard af. Ben (35M) Tobi (35M) jojo (31M) Danny Green (10M) is already your entire cap space (112M last season).    Stretch bigs are already hard enough to find. The bjelicas, Bobby portis', ilyasovas, they cost more than that. The best stretch big youre going to find for what Philly can spend is luke kornet. I love my guy luke but you would rather have Dwight.    You gave morey some credit but not nearly enough. He turned al horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth curry. I try not to syck morey off as much as the rest of this sub, but truthfully I am not sure if many gms can pull that off."
"I remember that after a game or two, people were discussing whether or not Danny Green should be allowed to be awarded FMVP.  Danny fucking Green"
i still try to wrap my head around it. the reason i give doc credit in ben’s scoring reluctance is because he said he doesn’t want ben to be a scorer but i also believe ben doesn’t like to be the scorer either. danny green said ben won’t go out of his comfort zone unless he’s pushed. brett and doc coddled ben but ben does has to take it upon himself to be motivated.
" Danny Green, Draymond Green, Gerald Green, Jalen Green, JaMychal Green"
"&gt;Everyone knows Patty Mills and Danny Green from their Spurs days,  This is what brought up the general public"
"&gt;Wherever I can **maximize earning opportunities both on and off the court.**  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;And that is why the Lakers should always be good at getting FAs. **A role player on the Lakers are better known by casuals than really good players off smaller market teams**. Kuzma has more advertising clout than Sabonis, and with the max contracts that advertising is where the money is left for stars to he made.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Not disagreeing with your core point but I feel like Sabonis is a bad example. He's a foreign player who talks very little. Everyone knows Patty Mills and Danny Green from their Spurs days, and at best you could call them elite role players there.  You brought up the general public in your first comment, but really the 'general public' doesn't really matter when you're a role player.  You're not making any money from the general public as a role player.   if you as a player are trying to 'maximize  earning opportunities both on and off the court' as the OP replied to the question 'f you were in the NBA and a free agent what would you prioritize the most in picking a new team' - well, outside of getting better and becoming next Kobe... what can you do?   You can maximize earnings even as a role player when you're on the team like the Lakers that can get you the followers, as Kuzma clearly have. Even Caruso had a few commercials and endorsements lined up."
"When he drove to the basketbal, the heat collapsed their whole squad to him, which is why Danny green was wide open. It wasn’t even that long ago deathstarlineup/disneybubblegangster/goatofgoats23/mickeymouseshoulders/privileged_whiteman/olympicgoldjavale"

I mean it’s still a choke. Kawhi still gets shit for the 2020 playoffs even though he been playing on one leg for about half a decade now.   End of the day Ben Simmons did not choke a 26 point lead by himself. His free throw shooting sucked and he wasn’t aggressive but he was a net positive all series and played elite defense. It was a collective team melt down and the coach couldn’t adjust to the Danny green injury. You have a top tier defense with several elite defenders and you’re telling me they couldn’t slow down a 3rd year guard who had never been to the playoffs before?   Doc rivers is a known choker who has caused several locker rooms to implode before bailing. He coddles stars then throws them under the bus when they fail. I’m honestly shocked he’s once again getting away with his dumb antics and Ben is taking the blame. Doc should honestly be shouldering most of the blame given this is the second choke job in a row on two separate teams that were favorites to win the series
"That’s not really slamming Ben, it’s been widely reported Ben has had no direct contact with the team and has talked solely through his agent. And rich Paul is remarkably stubborn, so Idk how you can get mad at him for throwing shade at an agent.  We’re Danny’s comments insulting ? Seems like just a standard observation from bens entire career. He doesn’t take risks. He sticks entirely to the few things on the floor he’s comfortable with. That’s a fact of his game. It would be like someone else in Philly saying Danny green isn’t comfortable as a ball handler. I do appreciate you showing your receipts though.  The leak part however is nonsense. For starters, people like Stephen A Smith CAN make up whatever they want as information from “sources” since it’s impossible to verify or fact check. Secondly even if a source did say that, it could be literally anyone. It could be a data analyst working for the 76ers. It could be a low level trainer. It could be literally anyone. Why would the words of people like that come into play?  At this point, anything they say is completely justified. He’s proven he has no respect or loyalty for his team so why should they keep censoring themselves ? It seems most of these quotes came out around media day / after the season started, and at that point Ben had not only continued to ghost the team, but stood up his team mates after they flew out to LA to talk to him and then dodged training camp, and then when he finally went to a practice he refused to run and half asses the entire thing. Before Ben made those decisions, the only “insulting” comment came from Doc and since then, the team bent over backwards to make him happy"
"I mean I just gave you an example of the coach doing a media tour and trashing Simmons in the process.  &gt;""There's times that I think we're getting through,"" Rivers said. ""And there's times that I think that I'm talking to people who still believe Trump won the election. So I'm not sure, but I'm going to keep trying.""     And:   &gt;Danny Green on Ben Simmons: “You can tell Ben’s the type of kid if he’s not encouraged, if he’s not pushed or forced to do it, he’s not the type to take that risk.”   And as for leaks during the offseason:  &gt;ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith has delivered another slam from an unnamed source who texted him during First Take. “I just received a text from someone very, very close to the situation in Philadelphia about Ben Simmons. This is a quote, it’s not me, it’s them. Quote: ‘He doesn’t work, he doesn’t listen, and everyone around him is family, and he’s constantly babied’. That’s the word out on Ben Simmons,” Smith said  And:  &gt;But according to multiple sources, many within the team questioned whether Simmons had actually seen the masseuse -- or was just trying to get out of playing as he battled the basketball version of the yips.   Or you can look at the multitude of Woj quotes on the topic over the past couple of months (with most Philly fans accepting the team is using Woj and Ben is using Shams)."
Yeah and the rest of our bench is currently starting. Our only starter is a recently old and injured Danny green who was put on the bench due to minutes restriction
"In all fairness, 76ers have lots of great defenders. Simmons is a DPOY-level guy. Same for Embiid. Thybulle is an All-Defense level guy. Danny Green was All-Defense and still is good.  I would think anyone would have issues scoring against you guys"
I like Maxey a lot; I actually think the biggest need is wing now. Danny Green is about to be 36. Korkmaz is tall but he’s too weak to defend wings effectively.
"Never liked Tatum, Jaylen Brown is outplaying that man 😂😂, yeah we lost to the hawks, but let’s not forget the circumstances, Embiid played with a partial meniscus tear and was slow  that whole series, Danny Green who during that season was one of our best shooters and defenders was out with a sprained ankle, and like I said our Bench unit was almost unplayable because of how terrible they were, that is not the case so far this season, the difference is crazy! And nope, I didn’t watch that video, I have a brain of my own. You should try using yours!"
"Ok, his trade deadline deal for hill didn’t work. He managed to turn the albatross of horfords contract into danny green, and fleeced the mavs in the Seth curry move. Maxey, Joe and BBall Paul were a master class in drafting, and his free agent additions of Drummond on the minimum and Niang have been perfect so far this year. So. Yeah. Miss me on the injured George hill swing he took last year"
Even… Danny Green fans?
"Don’t have a way to replay a game, but off the top of my head:  Drive on Niang, elbows first, then extends the elbow into a full arm to clear space  Drives on Reed during a fast break, lowers shoulder to knock him down.   Drive on Danny Green that plows him over which created the Portis corner 3  Screen at the FT line on Korkmaz where he leaned his ass backwards into him to initiate contact.   That’s 4 in the 2nd half alone"
Imagine if Danny Green hits the game winner...out of all the things that could happen that would be last on my list.
Danny Green is actually a descendant of The Human Torch so his fingertips burned Giannis.
Wow you must have some special eyes that you figured out the “minimal contact” without any replays while the incompetent refs who are 10 feet away call a foul and Danny green doesn’t complain
Good old Danny green 😂😂
Danny Green back to earth...
"Luckily posters aren’t graded on their worst moments, otherwise Danny green would’ve been spending the better part of his year playing for the Shanghai sharks starting 8 years ago"
"His elbow doesn't make contact with anyone (comes close but no contact) and Danny Green hacked him, what are we talking about"
I mean Danny Green literally intentionally fouls him here...  Unless the foul was called on someone else?
The wildest shit this game is Danny Green becoming an elite shooter out of nowhere. Spurs and Raptors cans are shaking.   Honestly i am too..Danny green torched us in two finals series.
danny green has hit two threes since this comment lol
#DANNY FUCKING GREEN
Danny Green remembered how to be a clutch 3pt shooter.
DANNY GREEN LMAO
"Maybe, but they wanted Maxey, Thybulle, a first and Danny Green would’ve been needed to match the salary."
"76ers entire starting 5 is out sans (Danny Green) plus Isiah Joe, and Matisse Thybulle."
Danny Green +10 0-1 0/0/1 King
"Do we even have enough players for this game to be played? We're down Embiid, Tobias, Simmons, Matisse, Isaiah Joe, and now Seth.    That leaves Maxey, Niang, Korkmaz, Drummond, Danny Green, Paul Reed, and Shake. Is Charles Bassey our eighth man or is he in the g-league? Either way, I hope these guys stay healthy playing so many fucking minutes since this is our fifth game in the last six days."
I feel bad for the dude because he gets the Kuzma/Danny Green treatment on the regular now.  “Westbrick” trends so often that you’d think it was his actual name.

"Why does anyone have Lebron over Kobe? These same people had Lebron over Kobe since like 2013.  If it's because of MVP count, MVP's are a regular season team achievements. If your team isn't a top 4 seed, chances become increasingly lower to crack MVP even if you are putting up the best stats in the league. 2 of Lebrons MVPs didn't even turn up to be a championship nor did they even result in making it to the finals. The other 2 came from being on a super team. I guess Kobe deserves less credit because he stuck with his team during a rebuild during his prime and had to carry a bunch of people who didn't know what they were doing? Even today you always hear the phrase - ""Best player on the best team""- which is pretty accurate most of the time.  If it's about Lebrons gameplay;   Scoring wise Kobe was always more successful because he pulled multiple defenders out of the paint and out past the 3 point line, similar to Curry today, that pushed his teams into winning more in the post season. This allowed more fluid movement in the paint and much easier baskets for him, forwards and centers. Sure Lebron has a higher TS%, which is highly to do with his base FG%, but that is also highly based off of him scoring much more in the paint area, which clogs the paint causing conflict for bigs (K Love, Bosh). This has always allowed opposing teams to create more blocks and strips because of how the paint is always heavily congested. Teams with elite rim protection has always been the bane of Lebrons existence early in his career and this is why he left the East more so than anything imo with the rise of Giannis and Embiid but that's another topic.   Assists? Well, you have Lebron playing a PG type role most of his career and most of the minutes while he's on the floor. He's constantly chucking the ball out from a kick out or PnR. I'm surprised Lebron wasn't averaging PG amounts of assists (10+) for his career considering how good of a passer everyone makes him out to be tbh. You couldn't argue to me that Kobe couldn't play in a system like that, Kobe's passing was always on point. Some of his greatest assists of all time are the most skilled you could get while passing. Not to mention that the triangle offense that Kobe ran with most of his career spreads assists out and allows for bigs (forwards and centers) to become the center points of facilitating. Shaq and Pau's averages for assists during their time with Phil were at the highest of their careers meanwhile Kobe's assist average started sky rocketing with Phil out of the picture.  Rebounds? This is short and easy, Lebron is taller and is usually guarding forwards in the paint. He's going to grab more boards. Also, Phil Jackson's role for guards in his system was for them to be ready for outlet passes from bigs and stopping fast breaks from occurring which pushes them to have less rebounds by design.  Defense? I think Kobe's defense is crazily underrated for his championship runs and he's had more elite defensive runs that lead to championships than Lebron has. Lebron had probably 2 good defensive runs with Miami championships and thats it where as I feel Kobe played his best defense in all of his championship runs. Everyone said Kobe's defense went down during those runs but anyone who actually watched knows that's not true. Kobe guarding Melo and vice versa was intense af to watch in the playoffs. Kobe played mind games with players and dared them to shoot if they were average or below average shooters. If they missed it was demoralizing for them and they would shoot less often. Watching Kobe do this to Rondo in the finals was classic Kobe mind game defense where Rondo averaged less points and less assists than what he was regularly doing earlier in those playoffs.  All of this and Kobe was never on a super team (that won), meanwhile Lebron has still yet to do it without creating a super team. Miami? 100% super team and even more so when Ray Allen arrived. 2nd stint Cleveland? Got the best rising young PG and rising star from K Love who was putting up 26 and 12 for the wolves. Lakers? There were attempts to get Kawhi or Paul George with AD who was guaranteed to go, but then ended up with AD, Howard, Rondo and Danny Green who was considered one of the top 3 and D players in the league. In the end, Lakers were a balanced duo and Lebron never realistically carried the team like you want out of someone you are talking about being ""GOAT"". Kobe carried a non-superteam to 2 championships as the best player head and shoulders over the next best player on the team, which Lebron has never done a single time in his career ALL while doing it out in the grinder/gauntlet that is the west. Oh did I mention Kobe also beat the team that Lebron was so afraid of facing in the playoffs he had to create his first super team to beat? There's also that.  And obviously, 5 &gt; 4 in chips as it stands currently. I would put Lebrons 4 rings on the same level as Magics 5 rings, all done with stacked af teams compared to the competition outside of the finals.  My top 5 list goes: Wilt, MJ, KAJ, Kobe, Lebron in that order and it's pretty much solidified. KAJ never passed Wilt, but MJ definitely passed KAJ. I don't see Lebron carrying any team to a finals and winning again which he would need to do at least twice for him to be over Kobe in my eyes."
"&gt; Eh, one of the original spreadsheet boys (Hollinger) literally had DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agents last year behind guys like Duncan Robinson and Danny Green.   Yeah that’s why it never made sense to me because anyone who looked at advanced offensive stats beyond box scores could see how much valuable he’s been than just ppg"
"Eh, one of the original spreadsheet boys (Hollinger) literally had DeRozan as the 12th most valuable free agents last year behind guys like Duncan Robinson and Danny Green. He had his value at 15.3 million a year, and by comparison, had Bruce Brown at 14.8 mill. They played each other head to head yesterday and Demar put up 28 on 20 shots, and Bruce Brown put up 0 points on 8.  The real question is why advanced stat heads looked at a guy shooting at a 59 TS% in high usage and not think he might do well on a team that he isn't the main scoring option all the time."
"Don’t forget fvv, pascal, Danny green, ibaka, hell even norm had his games. We were a really good team"
"Lakers fans were salty at Danny Green for being IcyHot, and then they got salty at KCP.  Now they'd do anything to have them back. The season after losing DG the Lakers proceeded to let Caruso fly East and traded KCP.  Mind-blowing."
im honestly convinced danny green haters just do it because they think it's funny and never actually watch him play
Danny green seems low
"&gt;Lakers will take Simmons for Westbrook swap in a heart beat, that tells you what is real trash  The problem here is that another core player would need to be included to salary-match, looking at the'6ers roster probably Danny Green.  With the idea that Westbrook's having a horrid start and will eventually play up to his averages of the last few seasons, and that maybe Doc Rivers is an actually somewhat competent coach who will actually tell Westbrook to box out, maybe both teams agree?  Especially if Lakers include one of their minimums (salaries would still match within 10%)?"
I love Shake. The 2nd unit came together once he came back.   Danny Green is my answer as a Sixers fan. If his shot is off he does not do much else.
Korkmaz is great when he’s on but him and Danny Green have both been streaky players. Wood is a PF not a C.
"The Seth Curry disrespect is real. What we actually need is a reliable starting SF who is solid and offense and defense, not SG. Heck I'd take another quality PG over starting SG.   Danny Green has been off, and Thybulle is offensively weak. I like Kork there but having him come off the bench and late game to torch teams is ideal."
"The trade would probably have to include Danny Green for cap purpose.  43million going out and 42 million incoming to the Sixers who are currently 6 million over the tax line.  Morey probably doesn't make this trade judging from his asking price unless the Kings include multiple picks and swaps.  But IMO, the Sixers would be a much better team with Barnes and Hield.  Curry and Hield would be two of the best 3 point shooters in the league on the same team, though they would be defensive liabilities in some matchups.  Barnes is a very good starter and his 3 point % and TS% has been good to excellent the past few years.  He's solid defender and versatile player who doesn't need the ball to play well.    With Embid, Barnes, Curry, Hield, Maxey, Thybulle, Tobias and Korkmaz this Sixer's team would resemble the the 93 Rockets of Hakeem, Horry, Cassell, Jet, Maxwell, Thorpe, Ellie.  Both teams have dominant center who drives not only the defense but the offense, surrounded by 3 point shooters and good versatile defenders.    The 93 Rockets were one of the earlier pioneers of utilizing the 3 point shots.  They shot 50% more threes than their opponents."
holy shit sixers are missing Thybulle Danny Green and now Embiid??  It's Drummond time
Maxey is a starting caliber player for a playoff team. Danny Green started on 2 of the last 3 Championship teams.   4 out offense has been the way teams are trending for a while now. The Bucks won the title last year running a lot of 5 out offense.   Simmons is great in transition but when things slow down like the playoffs he is a negative on that end. I can’t see anyone who has watched Simmons career try to argue that point.
They have 11 players (+ Danny Green might play) which is definitely more than 6 and not enough to cancel a game
I see Danny Green getting swapped instead of Thybulle. Brown would likely replace Green in the starting lineup
Danny Green
"I definitely think they would have repeated if Kawhi and Danny Green stayed. Not to mention, they would have OG Anunoby back"
Danny Green would’ve stayed*  He delayed his free agency decision until Kawhi made his because the Raptors would only offer him a deal/he would re-sign if Kawhi also stayed. Once Kawhi left the Raptors let Danny walk instead of paying the luxury tax. IIRC Dallas and the Lakers were his other main options and LA ended up working out for him and getting back to back titles.
Danny Green might have stayed as well
"Danny green hitting shots lmaooo, glad you signed that comment with your self portrait &gt; 🤡"
Truly the Danny Green of the next generation
"He could have had Danny Green, Maxey and a Frp.  Hes a good gm but he fucked up getting value for Lowry badly"
"I mean, to be 8-2 rn with a max contract player sitting at home, Tobias Harris and Danny Green out for a few games is impressive enough for me so far. Nobody is acting like the 76ers are winning the title, and Doc himself says it’s early."
I miss Danny Green
Danny Green and Tobias is significantly better than Cov and Dario.
"We also don’t have Mattise Thybulle, Danny Green, and Tobias Harris. This team is playing insanely well"
"Yeah but on the road with no Tobi, Tisse or Danny Green is a pretty big one right now."
"As long as he's eating up $35 million in cap space he'll be a negative regardless of his playing status till we replace that car space with useful production.  Simmons wasn't one of the ones I was referring to though, moreso Tobias and Danny Green."
"The Sixers are 8-2 without Simmons, Tobi for the last 4 games, Danny Green for the last three games. But yes Morey a dum-dum"
"&gt; I’d kill to have him playing next to Lebron/Davis  Yes, because CJ would be a perfect fit alongside Lebron and AD as he can play offball unlike Russ and would be a significant upgrade over Bradley or whoever your 2 guard is. In addition, he can be a primary ballhandler when LeBron is off (Like Russ), only he wont be a volume shooter whilst LeBron is on the floor.  Upgrading Curry or Maxey with CJ does not move the needle for us at all. Danny Green is our 5th option, and is not good enough on the defensive end as a primary stopper anymore. I would rather upgrade him in our starting 5, unless we got an all-star caliber player like Dame, Fox, Harden etc."
I'm fairness the Sixers were up pretty much that entire game including up 10 with 5 minutes left and blew it at the very end when Danny Green suddenly forgot how to shoot a basketball and kept chucking up garbage 3 point attempts. So maddening.
Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals than Jordan while being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Jeff hornasec and Danny ainge   Jordan would be a poor man dorezen if he played outside the shit 90s
Looks like the offense is better with Danny Green and Tobias Harris too
Those Cavs teams were built properly (shooters + defense) around him.  The 2020 title team was (KCP/Danny Green).  This one is the first one since probably the 2011 Heat where outside the stars it's weak in depth.
"First off we’re 8-2 not 7-1… making me question if we’re talking about the same team  Second off, I know this is hard for some people to understand, but Danny Green is 34.5 years old… he’s been out of his prime for a few years now, and it’s hard to be a 3&amp;D guy when you can’t physically keep up with younger guys, and it’s hard to shoot well when you’re winded from chasing 25 year olds around.   Anyway, it’s obvious to anyone with eyeballs that our offense is better with 5 players on the court. Getting Ben’s deadweight out of our half court sets has been a revelation.  Edit: Oh and lastly that’s not what the word “reactionary” means lol. Try google. You’re thinking of “reactive”. Reactionary is a political position."
Danny green shot 40% from 3 last year btw
"They're so good. Doc Rivers is coaching his ass off, the team has elite ball movement and Embiid is becoming a legit passer. Mind you, Tobias Harris, Danny Green, and of course Ben have all missed time. Embiid has also shown that he is not 100% healthy, although he did look great tonight. So far, they're one of my favorite Sixers teams ever."
"Testament really to Daryl Morey’s GM skills  For some reason this subreddit likes to shit on him but the man’s an amazing GM. The Curry trade, trading Horfords terrible contract for Danny Green, drafting Maxey (and Paul Reed and Joe), signing Niang, signing Drummond….dude has been elite  Our role players are just awesome. We can run a shooters+Embiid lineup and it looks as good as everyone has always thought it would"
Don't forget Tobias Harris has missed the last 5 games too and Danny Green missed 3
"The Sixers are #1 in the East not only missing Simmons but also missing Tobias, Danny Green, Thybulle, Shake, and Embiid for stretches of this early start...most games with more than one of them out. Korkmaz and Niang could legit be starting on several teams the way they're playing so far.  The only other team that comes close to having the bench talent we are currently showing would be the Warriors."
"- Danny Green, Tobias, Simmons (lol), and Matisse out - only 9 active players - 3rd game in 4 nights - away game  The ultimate trap game."
"No Simmons, No Danny Green, No Tobi, No Thybulle, No problem"
"Sure but we're also down Tobias, Danny Green and Thybulle (our best defender now)..."
Danny Green isn't a 3 level scorer. And since Lamelo can't finish at the rim or get to the line. Perhaps his comparison should be Tim Hardaway Jr who can pass.
So Danny Green that can pass. That's not elite
It would be a bigger problem in a hard capped league. Ben is not going to provide us any financial flexibility by disappearing from the roster so we need to get something of value back for it to help.  We’re also in a situation where we don’t actually have a pressing need for anything(I had actually thought that we’d probably want a point guard by now but Maxey is far more developed than I had expected) and have a shockingly young roster with only Danny Green and Seth Curry over 30.  This means if anything trading Ben could actually accelerate our window rather than extend it.
"Actually, come to think of it, after that quite a few fans came to the Warriors subreddit and apologized on behalf of the assholes.  It was quite sweet and left a good impression.  A LOT of Warriors fans still really hate Danny Green though 😬"
"Danny Green, roco, Jlin, Gerald Green, Shaun Livingston, Jj barea, Quinn Cook, yogi ferrell. Lots of serviceable young guys coming out of the g league."
"So you telling me 2019 Lakers wasn't a fit for Bron? Danny Green/Bradley, KCP, AD(who can spread the floor) D12 and Bron? That's not much off of Kyrie. JR Smith, Bron, Love and Mizgov/Thompson. Then they grabbed Morris who shot well in the bubble too. Now no one thought that Lakers team would shoot it well enough but in the bubble they did. However those players don't work well with just AD when Bron sits. That's where Rondo was important but he didn't play well until the playoffs. I had Lakers winning that year because I thought it was enough if healthy.  Last year team made no sense to me at all with the signing of Harrell and letting D12 walk. Even healthy I didn't have Lakers winning. The p  This year team will struggle all year. Nothing fits to be honest. If AD didn't play vs OKC and Bron did, Lakers would of probably lost still. This Laker team is crazy similar to the 2018 Cavs before the trades."
"Someone’s still salty the Trailblazers couldn’t beat a Sixers team missing Embiid, Harris, and Simmons (and Danny Green who got hurt during the game)…"
Danny Green🤣🤣🤣
"Yeah I forgot Caruso, KCP, and Danny Green are on this Lakers team."
"Lakers won the 2020 championship with Lebron basically playing point guard and running the offense. It worked very well that year and Lebron led the league in assists.   Then they traded Danny Green so that Schroder, who isn’t even a great playmaker, could take over pg responsibilities.   Then they traded KCP, Kuz, and Trez (and let Caruso walk for cap space), so that Westbrook could take over pg responsibilities.  Just stunning how bad these moves were. Let Lebron run the offense. Find a cheaper, decent playmaker to run the offense on the second unit."
"There is a reason Danny Green has 3 rings, he's a great role player."
"I expected him to be Danny Green, not prime Redick."
"I think they messed up not keeping Danny Green way back. Sure he is streaky but so are most shooters. He consistently had top 2 net rating on the team, played great perimeter defense, and could space the floor.   But overall I don't think any 1 player like Buddy could fix this team. They lack consistent shooting top to bottom and I think their 3pt% are mainly inflated from being left open against bad teams. A great playmaker still needs guys that can knock down shots when they're fed. Caruso and KCP were fine for the team."
"The lakers have had one consistent problem since trading for LeBron. Poor shooting. They got lucky in the bubble with KCP being unsustainably hot at the right time, and other than that have struggled to shoot well.   Regardless of whether or not Buddy Hield shoots his usual percent with the Lakers, he is a massive upgrade over who they have now.   Also let me remind you, the lakers passed on Bojan to try and make a run for Kawhi even though he obviously didn't want to go, and instead overpaid for a year of Danny green. They also let Brook Lopez walk for nothing, and he just played a big role on a championship team.They are not making good moves in the slightest, and I dont get how Pelinka still has a job."
Frank Kaminsky / Danny Green / CJ McCollum
"It certainly is something no one predicted. Even less people would expect it when Embiid got hurt, tobias went out and danny green went you. It's just something to talk about"
"Draymond’s great no doubt, but you don’t have to put down the rest of the team to talk him up. Those warriors teams were stacked. The truth is, you just don’t have a top 1-2 defense with only one good defender. There’s a reason that the warriors defense hasn’t been top-10 until last season when they got Wiggins.   &gt;	 Whilst Bogut, Klay, Iggy are great defenders in their own rights, they aren't driving high end defences. Which Duncan and Danny Green could do  Danny green can’t drive a high end defense. He’s great but he’s nowhere near that great. Bogut probably could at that point, you’re really underselling him. He was a hell of a rim protector. And yea, you’re right the spurs had better defenders off the bench, but they were pretty similar 1-5.    &gt;	 it's pretty obvious Dray should have won both DPOYs in those years.   Idk, this argument has happened a million times. At this point it’s just whatever your opinion is. People wouldn’t be upset if Draymond had gotten DPOY over Kawhi, it could’ve gone either way. It just depends what skills you value most.    I hate the argument against Kawhi though. I’ll die on the hill that Kawhi was more than a one on one defender. He was one of the best defensive playmakers I’ve ever seen those two seasons. He jumped passing lanes, had great help defense, and  routinely made clutch blocks and steals. It’s just flat out wrong to discredit his defense by saying he was “only” a one on one defender.     I think people forget because he hasn’t played with quite the same intensity on defense the last few years since his offensive role expanded so much."
"Danny Green, Ben, Tobias are all out dude lol"
"My point is more that Draymond was the system. Kawhi was like the cherry on an ice cream sundae. His defence back then is the equivalent to KDs offence. Amazing one on one player go can help a team. But when forced to carry the majority of the burden it leads to subpar results. Duncan still averaged 2 blocks a game and was an all-star in 2015 primarily off his defence.  And Whilst Bogut, Klay, Iggy are great defenders in their own rights, they aren't driving high end defences. Which Duncan and Danny Green could do. Also you had David West who I know was still a a very effective defender until 2018. I'm obviously not sure how slow-Mo was in 2016 but again he's been a historically good defender.  Now I can't comment on the rest of the supporting cast defence wise for the spurs so you'd have to tell me. But for the warriors at least outside the ones you mentioned, Steph, Barnes ish and Livingston the rest of the roster was pretty disastrous on defence. Mobuckets, Barbosa, Clark even Rush were pretty bad on defence at that point.  I think it's pretty obvious Dray should have won both DPOYs in those years. He should ahve at least 3 to be on par with the guys he's actually on par with historically in terms of defensive impact."
"I don’t know if this is definitely true. The warriors had Iggy, Klay, and Bogut in addition to Draymond. The Spurs had Duncan, Danny green, and Aldridge playing the best defense of his career.    I’d say it was pretty close. Duncan might push the spurs over the edge. I think the main point is Kawhi was more than just a one on one defender. He got plenty of steals, forced turnovers, and made plays."
Danny Green didn't have his feet set. It wasn't getting overturned.
"We’re missing Tobi, Ben, Danny Green, and Korkmaz.  We have no one else to play :-/"
he put danny green on trae young in game 1 basically forfeiting that game. he also refused to bench dwight and play any version of small ball.
Nope. Danny Green was on Trae game 1 and after that Ben got him.
"Tatum for Simmons, Danny Green + 3 picks + 3 swaps."
"I think taking KCP out would've been honestly a big blow on that 2020-2021 team, at least at the time.   They just traded Danny Green away for Schroeder, so in essence the Lakers were getting Lowry in exchange for DG and KCP who were huge part of their defensive sets with their length.   Caruso is only about an inch shorter than KCP, but KCP had longer wingspan. And KCP was pretty much the only 3 point threat on the team. Wes struggled all year staying in front as well as shooting.   Who knew Dennis would fold THAT hard in the playoffs, but I don't think it's crazy to think that having Dennis + KCP + THT at that time would seem better given that team's roster construction."
No thanks. That's an overpay on the Sixers part. I want to keep Danny Green.
&gt;  Kuzma gave you 10 inefficient ppg and basically nothing else during their playoff run.  Kuzma played good defense during that Finals run actually along with other bigger guards/forwards that they had like Danny Green.
"Buddy would be insurance against our really streaky shooting. Seth, Korkmaz, and Danny Green can all go cold at any given time. Definitely don't want Buddy and Seth on the court for any long defensive stretches, but you get a match up with a team that isn't strong defending the perimeter, and it could be a quick way to run 10-15 points in a few minutes."
"A trade where everyone wins:  Pels get Fox   Kings get Simmons   Sixers get Ingram   Note: I am leaving sweeteners like picks and fillers out for simplicity's sake   For the Pels Fox and Zion is a much better fit than Ingram and Zion with virtually no talent dropoff. The Pels also desperately need to find a proper replacement for letting both Holiday and Ball walk. This trade should make the team better once Zion is back.   For the Kings, the Simmons + Hali combo works quite well and this instantly improves their defence. The Kings roster are a good fit for Simmons and even though his value is at its lowest right now, he's still the most accomplished player out of the 3. A team with Ben is best suited to have a secondary ball handler so the fact that Hali can play both on and off ball makes this a clean fit.   For the Sixers, going from a no show Ben to a 20 point scorer is a great return. Replacing Danny Green with Ingram in the starting lineup makes us dip a little on defence but the offensive uptick more than makes up for it. Plus Maxey earned the starting spot and I personally wouldn't want to put him back to the bench."
"How is it a huge upgrade? CJ can't shoot as well as Seth and with the numbers Maxey has put up so far, he's nearly unbenchable. The only real thing CJ has over them is his upgrade to playmaking, which isn't that big of an upgrade.  Also, a 3 that can create his own shot, decent at 3s and above average at passing slots in perfectly in almost any team, including the Sixers. And he would allow Danny Green to come off the bench, which would bolster our bench defense."
"All I’m saying is this kinda proves that Morey is right now to sell low on Simmons since value is so volatile. Simmons is a somewhat known quantity, he obv has drawbacks but he’s still young and he will help you make the playoffs.   Also wonder how Sixers would feel about like Barnes/Hield/1st for BenSimmoms/Danny Green"
"Could have had a line up of Danny Green, KCP, Caruso, AD, LeBron.   Reserves of Dwight, Bradley, Reaves, Ariza, Nun."
"How can you they forget about three time championship winner Danny ""3 n D God"" ""Perennial Mercenary"" ""Icy Hot"" Green"
I agree with most of this but Danny Green absolutely still gets all that from Philly fans lol
danny green too
Not a star but is the other one you were referring to Danny Green? I know he was considering the Mavs or the Lakers but he said the Lakers were more ready to compete. But yeah the trade exception from the HB trade resulting to nothing is one of the biggest smh my head moments
Sixers got better in year two post Butler after we flipped Horford and J-Rich into Seth Curry and Danny Green.  The heat were completely average last season.
"Frank isn't getting fired. Lakers fans just need someone to blame. Last year it was kuzma, kcp. Year before Danny green."
"With such attention, you also get the most hate. KCP and others are probably enjoying being in Washington so much because they have had bad games and do not become trending on Twitter with hateful ""fans"" spewing some toxic bullshit about them.   Danny Green probably is not getting death threats for a missed shot in a series we were in control of. Kuzma prob does miss LA and  I would not doubt him leaving for another big market either"
Ngl that team sounds like it’ll be fighting for the 8th seed. Cp3 would be flopping and bitching at the refs even more than his tenure on the clips. Gobert and ariza would be taking turns getting into scuffles from frustration every time they get nutmegged or dunked on. Danny green probably going to be posting more than one weirdass tweet at all the memorial sites he visits
Evil Danny green is also out sadly. Dillon is injured
"There wasn't downside other than not being able to sign other players for that money.   Kemba wasn't the answer, so the alternative was maybe to try and build a deeper bench with someone like Seth Curry, Danny Green, or even JJ Reddick (who shot 45% from 3 in 2019).   As for the draft - yeah it's a crapshoot, but his constant drafting of project wings who lacked traditional skillsets was frustrating. Yabusele, Semi Ojeleye, even Grant to some extent, Zizic, Bird...a crapshoot means you hit once in a while beyond the lottery, and since 2016 we legit are 1/12 or 2/12 depending on how you slot Grant.   If you go out and spend on big pieces in FA, you need to have a better hit rate in the draft to fill a deeper bench. But you can't sign the wrong FA, and miss in the draft consistently.   Again, his moves before Kemba were good. But 2019 and 2020 were both major misses, and it wasn't looking like the tune was going to change in 2021, so I welcome the change."
"Honestly he showed a lot of hustle out there. I'm surprised he didn't get more minutes.   Also, damn, they keep forgetting about Danny Green when they mention who was out for the Sixers"
Danny Green and other 3 and D players for sure
"I think a playmaking PG might be unnecessary because the offense revolves around giving the ball to one person and getting out of the way.  I think the best real life example was the Sixers team that made the finals. Even though Iverson was the SG the ball was pretty much just in his hands. That team just surrounded him with elite defenders who didn't care about being getting the ball. Eric Snow was the ideal PG since he really only needed to direct the offense if Iverson was likt triple teamed.  Of course this worked due to no zone defense so you'd probably need people like KCP, Danny and Jeff Green who can hit open threes."
"I didn’t take that personally at all for some reason. Cost us Danny Green and one title-contending season, just didn’t bother me. He handled it poorly but it’s obvious he was leaving no matter what. Idk, honestly the high from 2014 has probably made me tolerate a lot of awful shit"
"I didn’t say the whole offense would be designed around him, I just said that he would be the leading scorer, which he probably would be if he was starting alongside CP3, Gobert, and let’s say Danny Green and Trevor Ariza since 2017-2018 was the year I was looking at."
That’s because Evil Danny Green in play.
"they don't even play the same position, tobi plays the 4 barnes plays the 3  you start georges niang at the 3.  danny green also plays the 3 when healthy  barnes is just a really good two way player who can ball handle and create his own shot if needed.  he would play great alongside literally anyone on your roster.   it would give you a lot of lineup flexibility having more wings"
"barnes is having the best season of his career, he's in his prime right now  he also gives you a veteran championship winning presence.  he was a big player on that 73-9 win warriors team.   he got a lot of minutes that season he was a big reason why they won so many games.   but he was young at the time, he's only now reaching his peak  having too many good wings is never a problem, they already have depth issues at that position with danny green missing time due to injuries  talk about fit all you want if they got harrison barnes he would be a productive player for them immediately and when they get healthier as a team he would make them even better than they were when they went 9-2.   he's definitely better than georges niang  I mean I don't want them to get barnes because it's better for me if the sixers arent that good, but he's by far the best piece they could get from the kings in order to improve their team"
"Damn Danny Green doesn’t even get mentioned as being out, talk about not being nice."
"well sure, hali is much better than fox  I still think you'd do better with wing upgrades considering how tight your guard rotation is.   Do you get rid of shake milton or korkmaz?  danny green also has a lot of injury issues recently having some good wing depth would be pretty nice for you guys"
yeah for real philly would immediately get a lot better  especially having barnes with danny green having so many health problems these days
"Ben, Seth, Danny Green, Tobi, Embiid  5/5 starters from last year, all out. Still beat the Kings lol"
Evil Danny Green
Danny Green the numbers and my eyes both say he’s not very good.   He’s been on some great teams and can get hot from 3. He’s been fading fast the last year and a half though.
Joel Embiid   Tyrese Maxey   Tobias Harris   Ben Simmons   Seth Curry   Danny Green   Mattisse Thybulle   Furkan Korkmaz
The drop off from the Lakers 2nd best to 3rd best player is beyond massive. Lakers fans wanted to burn Danny Green at the stake a couple years back. Imagine how they’ll feel about Russ come playoff time.
"It was Cwebb, now I’d say maybe Billups.  STAT was an mvp caliber guy in NY one year and was great for Phoenix.  Tyson Chandler might have a HOF case, Joakim Noah might not make the hall but he was a really great player.  Luol Deng too.  Jermaine O’Neal sticks out as a snub.  Throwback Andrew Toney the Boston strangler.  Joe Johnson was one of my all time favs hope he makes the Hall at some point.  Mark Aguirre bad boy Piston is not in the hall despite an awesome college career and really really good nba career  Andre Miller also one of those guys for even how remarkable his career was has no shot at the HOF but deserves to be remembered by fans  At the time in the mid 00’s I think most people would’ve assumed that Rasheed Wallace would make the hall before Ben Wallace but that did not happen  Human highlight reel Shawn Kemp is not in  Just some names that don’t belong in the Hall but deserve a shout out, Derek Fisher, Gerald Wallace, Shane Battier, Kyle Korver, Marcus Camby, Danny Granger, David West, Andrei Kirlienko, Mehmet Okur, Nikola Pekovic, Josh Smith, Gerald Green.  I fricking love the nba so much"
"You could add Danny Green too (since that’s who they originally wanted with what they paid Delon Wright instead)  In fact, just have the Mavs and Sixers combine teams"
"Who cares, he got every call. Literally broke Looney's collar bone with his charge and got 2 free throws. Danny Green injuring Klay twice. Warriors had a trash bench and Curry was all alone on offense. His best spot up shooter was Iguodala at one point."
Danny Green: 😳
Mother fuck Danny Green. He did that shit twice to my guy.
" &gt;Safe to say, the “anyone but Steph” defense may have its limitations this season.  I mean this team is much deeper than that team they beat...plus the Warriors only had one injured superstar this time around...and he's been out for a while so the team has already adjusted.  If they still had Danny Green to hip-check another shooter while in the air though..."
fuck danny green
"Its not as easy when you dont have kawhi leonard, danny green, kyle lowry, marc gasol, serge ibaka, either"
"It was not dirty.    Steph, Klay, Dray and Andre all told Danny Green that he did nothing wrong. Shut the fuck up"
Danny Green is a dirty player never forget. Two tainted rings with Craptors and Mickey Mouse bubble season
"Every preseason since 2020 ring, Lakers have told us they improved their roster dumping brick star Danny Green for 6MOTY Schroeder and then gaining veteran experience by getting rid of scrub Schroeder and Kuzma. How things have turned"
"Lakers really had a Death Lineup of Caruso, KCP, Danny Green, LeBron, and AD and let it go for...reasons?   Like it's going to be hilarious looking back at how they screwed up their unlikely but highly successful championship formula."
The Danny-Green-when-he's-on-a-cold-streak special lol
I've always liked Tobi + Danny Green/Thybulle(not both) for CJ and Roco.
"This dude said Danny green..... Maaaaan fuck u, fuck your grandma too. I would never want to see Danny green play for the Lakers ever again"
Ben Simmons &amp; Disco Danny Green
"The depth on this team is absurd already.  “The Sixers could really use a point guard to split time with Maxey and Shake. Or a shooting guard to split time with Seth Curry and Isaiah Joe. Or a small forward to split time with Matisse, Furkan, and Danny Green. Or a power forward to split time with Tobias and Niang. Or a center to split time with Embiid and Drummond.”"
"Two more guys huh, it'd be great if we could get someone like Caruso or KCP or even Danny Green, they might help."
"Just about everyone in the oration was a great defender. Kuzma was solid, Danny green was good, Avery Bradley is above average, Wes Mathews was okay, plus all the people you mentioned. The only truly bad defender was Ben McLemore who barely played for that reason."
Evil Danny Green has to be one of the best nicknames ever.
Danny green?
Alec Burks and Danny Green are examples
Traded Danny Green and a 1st round pick for Schroder to try to pay him $21m/year (thankfully he declined)  Traded half the roster and a 1st round pick for the right to pay Westbrook $45m/year  -  I think next up is trading AD and a 1st round pick for Ben Simmons
"Caruso and KCP absolutely. Danny Green regularly got cooked on the perimeter by quick guards, though."
"Sorely missing Caruso, KCP and maybe a lil bit of Danny Green ?"
"What? It should literally be expected that team mates would be grouped together in this stat.  Of course Manu and Danny Green have a higher +/- than Dirk, KD, Hakeem,  etc. they played on more winning teams.  It would be really weird if this list wasn't dominated heavily by Lakers, Spurs and Warriors players. They won 13 of 20 championships. Between 1999 - 2019."
Mickey Mouse Danny Green
I'd call him bulky Danny Green tbh
Evil Danny Green be hacking and fouling a fuck ton tho  Also is he tryna be Mickey Mouse or Waldo with that outfit
Evil Danny Green is something else.

"3/3/2 on 0/5 FGs and 3/4 FTs in the 2nd half + Sonned by Charles Bassey and lost to Philly without Embiid, Simmons, Thybulle, and Danny Green.  Nuggets are gonna be fighting for a play-in spot this year and Jokic has no shot at MVP."
Danny Green is FMVP if Spurs win in 6
"Lebron mentioned if they had lost, Riley would have broke them up, I'm assuming he goes back to Cleveland or traded somewhere else, not sure, but 2016 doesn't happen and Lakers doesn't happen. Pretty sure Danny green would have won the fmvp."
"surprised that he isn't doing a podcast or something like every other guy that's angling for a career in broadcasting after retirement (JJ Redick, Danny Green, etc).  I'd think some practical experience like a podcast would help him get a career in media afterwards more easily than a piece of paper."
"no embiid, no danny green, no ben simmons, no matisse thybulle, no problem!"
"I think Danny Green is also out so we’re gonna have basically zero defenders out there again. I get that anything can happen in theory, but this is probably going to be a good 3 point shooting game for the nuggets."
We don't even want to trade Maxey &amp; Thybulle honestly. They both have so much upside. We'd rather trade Tobias Harris &amp; Danny Green.
"The Harden Trade alone is bad, but he also moved Horford's contract for Danny Green and got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. Also his analytics driven approach to... everything just makes it seem like he's more interested in squeezing out hidden value than he is trying to mutually benefit both teams."
"Lakers and Wizards Ariza in early years was actually doing some off the dribble stuff, he was not a stiff with ball handling like Danny Green or Robert Covington or PJ Tucker…  I mean at least the Ariza comp is like a low ceiling. Another ceiling comp is maybe Gordon Hayward? Hayward does have a better mid range and off the dribble shooting that maybe Franz can develop those one day"
"What, like a Danny Green or a Seth Curry or a Thybulle or maybe Niang? We got ‘em all, plenty of role players. Trading him for picks only makes sense if it’s not a star."
Danny Green
"The sixers think very highly of themselves and somehow imagine their championship window as very long. Yes, the have Harris and Embiid locked up, which I've never thought is a good fit for 70 mil a year. Seth Curry has one more year at 8 mil. He is worth more than that clearly. Niang one more year at 3.5 mil. Maxey is locked up for 2 more on a team friendly contract. Danny Green, one more year. Korkmaz, two years on a team friendly deal. Thybulle one more year.   Here is my point. Their championship window is next year. It becomes very very hard to win a championship without a top 5 player if you dont have cheap roll players. At the end of next season they will have Korkmaz and Maxey on a team friendly deal. They will not get anybody to come back for less than they make now, except maybe a 36/37 year old Danny Green. I dont understand this plan at all, ""multi-year thing""??? They have this year and next and then without a major free agent splash/trade etc. their window closes.   Also, James Harden? Are they fucking crazy. Why would he want to play in Philly. That should not be a plan you think about. Same with Dame. And next year, even if Dame becomes available you are now offering players on expiring deals who would have to agree to extensions for any of it to make sense. After next season, unless Simmons becomes a superstar they will have nobody in which to sweeten the deal for a true superstar in that trade."
Tobias put up 22ppg in last year's playoffs. That's perfectly acceptable for a third best player  Danny Green has been a starter on 2 of the last 3 championship teams  I don't understand your arguments
"Hope he sees this bro. Didn’t the previous two championships give heavy minutes to Danny Green? Tobias is a fine 3rd player, not many teams in the league have a better one  You lose son"
"You don’t think the Sixers lost because they were giving heavy minutes to Danny Green and Tobias Harris was their third best player?  Nah, must be because the 3x all star was actually just bad the whole time!"
No Embiid. No Thybulle. No Danny Green. No Seth Curry for two of the losses. Tobias missed some and just came back after actually being impacted by COVID. That’s the reason they’ve lost the last 5. They were 8-2 before COVID impacted them.
No Embiid. No Danny Green. No Thybulle. No Tobias for some of those losses and no Seth Curry for 2 of them. A classic case of just looking at the record and not understand what happened to the team due to COVID.
"Their picks are expected to be shit if they're trading for someone good. Also they can't add that many picks until the draft this year because of the Stepien rule and what they have committed already.  Maxey has 0 value to me if I'm trading for Ben. As a Portland fan haven't you seen 6'3"" or below superstars can't carry? You need actual wings these days. Best case is he pans out well and then what, you're paying big money to another short guard.  Thybulle is like a young Danny Green. Good role player but not gonna be a star."
The Raptors the season afterwards had a top 5 record with a similar roster other than him and Danny Green off it.
"I know Simmons worth ethic has been ridiculous this off season but wtf? The team tried to move him for Harden, publically destroyed him after Hawks, Danny Green literally was proposing trade scenarios for him and now he’s going to be traded in a public brief? Forget his shooting, that’s disrespectful to any player"
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers’ combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there’s no need to take on more players of that ilk.   Cue armchair experts moaning about how Sixers should trade him for a bunch of role players."
"I really think Danny Green deserves a mention here, key big defender on three strong defensive champions, and some of the most amazing transition defense I’ve ever seen particularly on the Heat in 2013."
\+Danny Green too. Can't make 3 pointers to save his life.
&gt;  it would be Simmons + Danny Green.      I like Westbrook and I'd still absolutely love this. Simmons is getting a lot of hate - most of it justified although some out of hand but there's no doubt that he's an amazing basketball player who can do it all besides shoot(which admittedly is probably the most important part of the game).      Here's a hot take: Simmons will have one of the best contracts in the league by the time it's in its last year.  Add in Danny Green who fits on any team and is proven to be able to win with LeBron and you have a slam dunk(no pun intended).      By the way didn't LeBron take a liking to Simmons calling him young prince and stuff like that?
"Westbrook played decently in Houston, wasnt this bad.  Westbrook changed the course of the Wizards season, getting them into the play-in when they really had no shot.  Name one team that would even think about taking Westbrook.  Ill make it easy for you.  Here are the teams that would NEVER trade for him either because they dont want him or dont have the pieces to send back in a trade to match salaries (mostly because they dont want / need him):  - Mavs - Nuggets - Kings - Warriors - Clippers - Pelicans - Thunder - Suns - Blazers - Spurs - Jazz - Hawks - Celtics - Knicks - Nets - Hornets - Bulls - Heat - Bucks - Raptors - Wizards  Which leaves you with:  - Pacers  - T-Wolves  - Sixers   **Pacers** could trade a combo of Brogdan + Sabonis/Turner - but would they even consider that?  **Wolves** are doing horrible but could move DLO + Beasley - but would DLo want to return to LA and would Towns be ok with trading his best friend for another selfish player (like Edwards) who needs the ball in his hands to be effective.  **Sixers** - they want to get rid of Ben Simmons but they need someone that can shoot - Westbrook is one of the worst 3PT shooters in the league - it would be Simmons + Danny Green"
"Bro, we went from Hinkie getting sacked by the league, to a dude who beyond being a terrible GM in trades and the draft, was literally calling out his best player on twitter on burner accounts, to Elton Brand who never had any experience in that type of role and spent the last amount of cap space on Al Horford.  Morey came into this shitty Ben situation, and was not helped at all by Doc after the playoffs. With zero cap space, Morey traded Josh Richardson for Curry, somehow got off the Horford contract without hemorraging blood, drafted Tyrese Maxey, brought in Danny Green, etc. The Ben Simmons situation has always been 24/7 drama, no one in the organization is actually that upset he's gone, if anything it's galvanized everyone else on the roster. I know everyone loves to shit on Philly and Morey, but just caving and trading Ben bc you feel you have to right this second isn't helpful."
"Half the guys playing now aren't going to get minutes in an ECF, but keep kidding yourself. Just don't pretend to be shocked when Danny Green disappears again and Drummond doesn't contribute."
Danny Green was great on defense
"Morey is the best in the business.  The Rockets won the second most games of any team during his tenure despite playing in a loaded West and not paying the tax.  He started with a washed up core of Yao and TMac and despite not working for a glamour franchise that got free agents just won every trade and maximized every dollar in free agency.  They were the only ones to take the KD Thunder to seven games.  The Rockets just cobbled together mid-tier free agents who overachieved and flipped them into stars, from Harden to Dwight to CP3.    Now the sixers look good despite having literally every starter miss at least some time if not the whole season.  Free agent signings Niang and Korkmaz are lighting it up, his trades of Horford and JRich for Danny Green for Curry have balanced the roster, improved the talent and kept payroll low, if he's not the best GM in the league he's damn close."
"Most overrated GM in league has in one calendar year done the following, but please, go on, tell me more   \-Flipped Al Horford for Danny Green  \-Acquired seth curry for some guy named josh richardson  \-Signed Niang/Korkmaz to below market deals, currently both wayyyy outperforming their contracts  \-Drafted Tyrese Maxey"
Chris Bosh (that season after LeBron left before the blood clots)  Brandon Ingram   Kuzma (so far)  Danny Green (post first Cavs stint)   Kyrie Irving before he absolutely meltdown after his injury that first season   Schroder so far is looking as if he’ll have a career year   Korver   I’m not tryna give an entire list but these are prominent examples of players who were “trash” and slandered a lot for being no help
"The bubble Lakers were far from mediocre.  Kuzma, Caruso, KCP, Danny Green, Dwight, Rondo, McGee all had very well defined roles and executed them. Those guys played great defense, that's why those Lakers were 3rd and 1st in defense during those seasons.  This year so far? They're 14th. We traded away that defensive core for some offense in case Bron or AD got hurt again and so far, it looks like a downgrade."
"2018 Demar Derozan Fred Jr, CJ miles, Delon, JV   2019 Kawhi, Fred SR, Danny Green, Marc Gasol  There was huge changes in the roster not just kawhi  Also cant really say we were built to beat Lebron in 2018 when we've got no defense and CJ Miles is making Kevin Love look like Embiid"
This is a good way to show just how defensively dominant those Pistons guys were. They made this list despite being a tier below on offense from just about everyone on this list besides Danny Green.
Danny green regen + transition passing
Put Danny green in there for the one time! You know he had to do it!
The fit issue is that Tobi/Joel/Ben take like half our shots and average a combined 5 3pt attempts per game.  Danny Green averages more than that by himself.
"Shi, put Danny Green in there too why not"
"You're way underestimating guys like Caruso and KCP.  Hell, throw Danny Green in there too."
Kinda hard to make that argument when Lakers fans will hate on solid players like Danny Green and still act like they are no bonafide scrubs despite having good seasons elsewhere.  And even now the consensus is that Andre Drummond barely even deserves a roster spot after one underwhelming season with LA
"&gt; Watch the footage  This is exactly what Bills fans were saying about why Nathan Peterman should be starting over Tyrod. Peterman would then go throw 5 interception in a single half lol.  Doing something in preseason is not the same as doing it in a real game. Players are not playing at full speed in the preseason.  Watching this clip of highlights, the only consistent things I see are him bullying smaller defenders and lazy perimeter defense by Danny Green.  It's easy to keep doing new things when you're having success with it. What I'd want to see from OG before declaring him a vastly improved player is how he responds when his new stuff doesn't work and when his defender isn't playing three feet behind the three point line flat footed.  Definitely a promising start to the year for him, though."
"Since this isn;t the Sixers sub where all of this has been discussed endlessly here, a couple points to throw out to let you know where I am coming from here:   1.  Joel Embiid is a MUCH better OFFENSIVE player with Ben Simmons on the court vs without him.  More efficient, better shooting percentages, better advanced stats.   2.  Sixers starting lineup with Ben Simmons is +15.9, and was statistiaclly top 3 in the league amongst starting lineups OFFENSIVELY.  Without Ben Simmons on the floor, the Sixers had one of the worst Offensive ratings   3.  The Sixers have no financial flexibility.  Approx 24 million over cap so no signings of deep meaning will happen, Tobias Harris is an above average player but is a negative trade asset and is under contract for years.  This contract is a huge limiting factor, so one of our 3 max guys would cost us more to move him.   4.  Ben Simmons is the only playmaker / primary ball handler on the roster.  Even if Ben was playing, about 10-15 minutes a game a 30% shooter in Maxey (who is more of a 2 guard then playmaker anyways) or Shake Milton would be the backup and would again cause our offense to tank without Simmons, and in 2021-2022 we now have 48 minutes a game of no PG to look forward to at this point.   5.  Biggest need for the team was a shot creator to play alongside Ben.  If Ben is traded, our biggest need becomes a primary ball handler.  Spacing around Joel is not the biggest need (see the Sixers offensively with an on shooter in Simmons).  Perfect world we trade Tobias for a guy like CJ Mccollum and Ben suits up.  That would provide a bigger then 0% chance to advance and improve upon our squad from last year.  Unfortunately this ship has sailed and has no shot of happening, Ben is never going to see the court for us again.   6.  To address your comment about Embiid...If Ben Simmons is traded for peanuts, then yes Morey will trade Embiid in the next few years, and will trade Danny Green, Seth Curry, and other role players this year most likely.  It is definitely rebuild time.  Luckily for us Ben Simmons is under contract for 4 years, so there is no panic."
Danny green is a legit 3&amp;D player
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
He was 2a/2b. Siakam was the second option and played solid defense.  Rondo was an elite defender whereas Lowry was simply very good. Rondo was always the best perimeter defender on the Celtics and was probably a top 5 defensive guard of the early 2010s whereas Lowry has been outplayed defensively by both VanVleet and Danny Green.
"A think a 3rd team will be involved in any trade with Simmons.. Maybe the Rockets. John Wall, Simmons, Brogdon, LeVert and maybe Danny Green or Maxey...shake and stir, throw a bunch of draft pics and pick swaps and hope for the best.  Pacers get John Wall and Danny Green or Maxey Philly gets Brogdon and LeVert Rockets get Simmons  TBH, I have no fucking ideia what I'm doing..."
"Danny Green and CJ are both dudes who would be great, but I'm looking forward to Jimmy being unleashed without team PR"
Klay tore his Achilles because Danny Green fouled him going for a dunk.  How was Chelsea Lane going to prevent that?  Steph broke his hand because Aron Baynes fouled him while in air.  Once again how is Chelsea Lane preventing that?  The Warriors played the most playoff games in a 7 year stretch.  All those extra games and wear and tear is the reason for the injuries.
"He literally averaged 27/10 while being guarded by the best defense in the NBA, Jrue, Ben Simmons and Danny Green"
"We’re a year away and they’ve completely replaced a complimentary roster of great 3-and-d role players— Caruso, Danny Green, KCP, Kuzma— with the worst volume shooter in nba history, 2 centers who should rarely see the floor (let alone see the floor *with* Davis), and a few old heads wildly past their prime. Ariza literally got hurt before the season even started.  The only way— the literal only way— this team is good is if the three youngish, versatile-ish players (THT, Nunn, and Monk) each have career years and transform their games into that of a complimentary role player.  You’re an idiot."
Yeah they could have just added him to the team and the bulls would have taken Tobias and Danny Green!
"Well I put this one in real quick but   To Pacers: danny green, simmons, buddy hield, possible picks   To blazers: Tobias Harris   To 6rs: bagley, levert, CJ , Brogdon possible pick   Kings: sabonis some sort of pick movement"
I didn't realize Danny Green was 34
"I mean I agree in principle but I definitely disagree with  &gt; We ... have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.  The Sixers have managed to surround Ben and Joel with good shooters every year except for the 2019-20 disastrous team. Last year in particular the roster was packed with good shooters, which we hadn't really had since Ben's rookie season with JJ/Cov/Dario/Belinelli/Ilyasova. The real issue with the roster construction is that nobody can do anything off the dribble. Ben is a savant at finding open men but we've only ever had Embiid as the guy who puts pressure on opposing defenses. I mean how many times does the team end up aimlessly swinging the ball around or with Ben handing off to a shooter who's tightly covered?  Good shooters can only do so much to get open. The roster has always needed some kind of perimeter oriented scorer to put pressure on the defense to get our 3&amp;D. Fultz was supposed to be that guy. Jimmy was that guy for a short period. JJ almost looked like that guy (if you squint) and he looked like a god in Philly because of it. Just adding another knockdown shooter won't really help, the team really needs a three-level scorer to unlock everything else.  Also I'm not sure where you're seeing the Danny Green numbers? I see him as [18th in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html#totals_stats::fg3) last season. Looks like he's pretty firmly in the tier of ""dudes who shoot a lot""."
"Over the last 4 years the sixers have steadily declined in 3PA per game, finishing last season right around 27th.   We have one of the most dominate paint players in the league, and have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.   Sixers fans have been quick to say buddy is lacking in defense or other aspects of his game, but we so desperately need a high volume shooter, I struggle to see how he would not immediately make our offense flow better.   Would love if they found a way to get him on the squad.   For reference - last year, Danny Green was our leading 3 point shooter in terms of volume at just 6.3 attempts per game. After that, it was furkan korkmaz and seth curry at 4.9 each. Then we have a steep drop off to Tobias Harris at 3.4 attempts per game.   Further, Danny Green's 6.3 attempts per game ranked him at 48th overall in total attempts, just .1 attempts ahead of John Wall.   All that is to say, Sixers fans should reconsider their desire to have Hield on the team. He's one of the best volume 3 point shooters in recent history."
Curry and CJ is a bad fit. Imo Danny Green is getting slightly washed. Plus they're not gonna get a borderline all star and two quality starters for Simmons alone.
Like Covington Danny green is good with help defense not as good on the ball.  I’m still a fan of his defense however
"Facts he'd be so good on the Sixers. If I were the Sixers I'd try to do something that ends up like this:  Lost: Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green  Gained: CJ, a decent defensive guard who can shoot (someone like Lonzo, Caruso, Smart, Huerter, KCP, etc.), and a small forward to replace Danny Green."
"Would love them to send a heap of capital and salary to the Hornets to grab Hayward, that would let them make a play at Simmons + Green with the Sixers getting back Hayward as the star (SF) and one of the 235435  PG/SG owned by the Hornets / Timberwolves.  &amp;#x200B;  Maybe Rozier and Hayward -&gt; Sixers, Ben -&gt; Wolves and mad Draft capital Danny Green, Beasley and Prince to Hornets."
"Oh for sure danny and matisse are not completely out of place at the 3. The problem is that the sixers are not a powerhouse offensive team like the jazz that can afford to put out smaller lineups. They've always leaned on their size to stifle opposing offenses. I just don't like the idea of a defensive oriented team trotting out danny green at the 3. Even if mcdaniels is raw, he shot 37% from 3 last year and is a good onball defender. Come playoff time I'd put mcdaniels on tatum, durant and middleton before green and thybulle.  Also with dragic and boucher, I'm not 100% sure on their fit, and the fact that they're making a combined 26 million means the sixers are getting back 1 more player at most. Don't feel good about boucher and 35 year old dragic being the main ""win now"" return on a simmons trade."
Danny Green still hasn’t gotten his Toronto ring from 2019!  This has been the longest 14 days in history
"Zach Lowe has never been a hot take artist. You think he's putting the Lakers ***way down at #3*** because he wants to be controversial and get clicks?   You don't think that MAYBE one of the best basketball analysts in the game has actually put a considerable amount of thought into it and has some lingering questions about a roster that added 11 new players?   In the actual article he gives very valid concerns:  * LeBron is 37, second all-time in minutes, and injuries have derailed 2 of his past 3 seasons.  * Westbrook will help greatly in the regular season alleviating the load, but he is an awful off-ball player and in the playoffs you want the ball in Lebron's hands  * In the past two seasons, the Lakers have made their mark through defensive dominance. When you replace guys like Caruso, KCP, and Danny Green with Westbrook, Monk, Nunn, Rondo, Carmelo, Ellington (all guys who have shown multiple seasons in a row of defense that ranges from bad to awful) then that at least is worth a slight pause.  It shouldn't be thought of as a Lakers diss and more of *the Nets and Bucks are just THAT good.* The Nets have three superstars and the Bucks are coming off a championship with a terrific amount of continuity. Not everyone with hesitancy about this Lakers team is a hater just looking to be controversial."
"I mean, is it a “narrative” if it’s true? Lakers fans are known for being obnoxious and Philly fans are known for being… aggressive. Lakers fans threatened Danny Green after he missed a big shot. Ergo, it wouldn’t shock me if some Philly fans, being more aggressive than Lakers fans, did the same."
NBA Champion for the Toronto Raptors Danny Green will be getting his ring this year at some point
There was a huge chunk of the fanbase that hated Danny Green
"You guys thought Danny Green was a horrible player too.  Not saying Drummond will be anything more than a bench piece, but Drummond certainly isn’t miles worse than a player that just fouled out in just over 10 minutes of play in the preseason."
"Assuming it's just a straight CJ-Ben swap, CJ would be the starting point and I'd imagine you'd probably run either Milton, Korkmaz or Thybulle as the starting 2-guard. Ideally it's Thybulle if he can figure out his 3-point shot.  Also I've said this for a while but I'm not the biggest fan of having Danny Green as the long-term 3 but if you're doing a 1-for-1 swap that's what your left with.  Not really a fan of any of these moves but if this situation continues to go South then maybe Morey's hand gets forced. I don't know."
"I think the lack of spacing isn’t an issue. People just see Westbrook and flip shit.   This is also going to be a year where AD plays primarily at the 5 and Lebron primarily at the 4.   Their spacing will 100% be better, and likely is an average team shooting the ball. Defensively they will take a hit, I’m just not sure how far a Lebron-AD anchored defence will fall as the Lakers were a great defensive team even without having amazing defenders.   Danny Green is a solid team defender, and Caruso and KCP were both plus defenders, but overall their impact is replaceable. Chemistry will be a minor issue, they will figure out how to make it work if they can stay healthy."
"Unless they want to totally compromise their defense, they will be much worse shooting the ball. That championship team had role players that could defend and shoot at a decent clip. (Danny Green, KCP, Bradley, Morris).   Their shooters now are Malik Monk, Nunn, Melo, Ariza, and Wayne Ellington. Monk is a terrible defender, Nunn is bad, and the other 3 are either old as shit, terrible at defending or both."
"People misread our situation in my mind.  I think turning JRich, Al and 1st into Danny Green and Seth Curry(on a 3 year deal) bought him a lot of goodwill.   Plus he wasn't the idiot who was looking to eventually move Embiid, or his minions left over after burnergate who pissed through so many assets and so much cap space and left us with Al, Tobi and JRich to go with Ben/Jo.    It really was just a multi-year run of ineptitude that rivals anyone in the league outside of Vlade.   So he has a bit of a runway b/c of those things.     For me, I'm really happy he's being patient.  Ben for all his flaws, is a 25 year old all star.  He was just recently in a poll of GM's listed as the 2nd best perimeter defender in the league(behind Jrue) and the 2nd most versitle(behind Giannis).   He has 4 years left and is allegedly not being overly picky on where he ends up, so that should allow teams like Portland, Indy, Cleveland who fear trading and having the guy leave Kawhi style to get involved.   He is better than everyone who has been mentioned as potential trades.   Teams will get antsy once the games start being played.  There are stars at multiple teams that are on the last year of their deals like Beal, Levine or are entering the end of their prime like Dame, or have young stars like Fox, KAT and do not want their guy to be the next one looking to leave and could start to pony up Ben's worth in a few weeks/months.  If not, then you can still take a shitty deal and then you know the roster rebuild starts then.   tl;dr;  i'm fine with how Morey handled this so far.   Shitty deal will always be there; but there are many teams that seem happy now that might not be come December."
"No that was Essentially just the media hyping a 1 on 1 matchup and trying to give more credit too a star and less to the not star teammates, the zone and wall built for Giannis used multiple guys as the main one guarding Giannis including guys like Danny green sometimes, but siakam was was by the numbers the best Giannis defender in the league that year and in the playoffs and did the best at the point against Giannis, he also was big in getting out in front of Giannis in transition to totally stop the ball even getting to him or Giannis being down the court and open, no one else on the team had the speed and size to do that. Yeah siakam wasn’t carrying the team defensively but he was still the number one defensive tool for those playoffs for the Raptors."
"&gt;Kawhi, Tatum, George,  all 3 of those guys are all around stars that wouldn't just be a 3 and D role player so I think considering them to be the same kind of player as Bridges is a bit disingenious. Bridges's comparisons would be more guys like OG, Gary Harris, KCP, Danny Green, Jae Crowder and Klay (Who I'd consider to be the best among that role) so saying he's one of the best might not be that far off."
main charater = danny green
"And now Sixers would have to give up a haul of assets + Simmons to get Lavine lol and Bulls probably still say no  Also that thread is wild, people saying Lavine should be traded for Danny green, Kuzma and pick 28. Or Lavine for Al Horford and 2 picks."
Ah yes primary ball handler Danny Green
With Thybulle and Danny Green in the backcourt
My boy Danny Green was Bricking as many open shots as I've ever seen any player do. I really like the DG too.
"Yup. Klay Thompson shot 30% and 35% in the 2015 and 2016 Finals.   On the Lakers, he would have been ran out of town for performances like that.   Just look at what happened to Danny Green."
"He's  been doing this since college, this is why he dropped in the draft and why his efficiency is actually pretty medicore in his regular season and playoff career  He's like the Danny Green icy hot level in terms of inconsistency"
"Captain Jack of all trades had to be in the convo. Stack.  Action Jackson baby. Great 3rd/4th option on a contender. As close to great as you can get as a 3 and D player without being truly elite at either but definitely a solid, tough defender and  knockdown shooter. Really good slasher and decent finisher at the rim. He could beat some guys off the dribble when he was young and quick, had a few nice moves but I don’t think he was ever great.  Also developed a nice mid-post, back to the basket game a little later in his career and would run actions from the post/elbow occasionally in his second stint with Spurs. Not a great playmaker by any means but unselfish and good enough to initiate offense, make entry passes to TD then knock down the 3 when they doubled. Very important piece to the 2003 title run. By all accounts a great teammate and would literally fight for his teammates (Malice in the Palace anyone) but also had an ego which caused him to be cut from Spurs right before the 2013 playoff run bc he thought he should start over Danny Green and would not accept a bench role. Probably cut his career shorter than it could have been as well bc of his inability to swallow his pride and take a reserve role but no doubt a real one and near the top of the list imo."
Most sports media was predicting a Danny Green FMVP. Duncan's name wasn't coming up at all for FMVP.
Id make the argument Danny Green wouldnt even start for the Wolves and we suck .  Would you put both Dlo and Malik Beasley on the bench and start Ant and DG? You could... not sure if that would get the best results though.  Or i suppose you could go small but that always seems to bite us
"He’s definitely better than Caughnoton, however you spell it, the Divicenzo guy, PJ Tucker. Whoever started alongside the big 3. He’s 100% starting on the bubble lakers and he probably replaces Danny Green on that Raptors team."
i think there are a bunch of teams danny green doesnt start for
Danny Green
"Playing for a contender right now, I'm looking at:     Guard - CP3 ($4)  Wing - Danny Green ($1)  Wing - OG Anunoby ($2)  Forward - Jerami Grant ($3)  Big - AD ($5)  Defense, switchability, shooters all over the court, and athleticism. Biggest thing this team lacks is playmaking outside of CP3, but AD and Grant all have some ability to move with the ball.  Struggled a lot with AD vs Embiid, and while I think Embiid is the better player, I went with versatility here."
should have to wait till Klay returns  FUCK DANNY GREEN
Dame Danny Green Cade OG  AD
"Danny Green literally led the Spurs in scoring through 5 games and there were tons of articles talking about him as  FMVP going into game six. Here's one for proof:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2013/06/17/danny-green-takes-nba-finals-3-point-record-nba-finals-mvp-award-next/amp/  Despite a lackluster game 6, it wouldn't have been enough to change the narrative to Duncan. Green would have won  I'm also just really sick of kids and people who weren't even basketball fans back then giving this revisionist history that everyone was all in on Duncan being the lone star of the spurs and obvious FMVP candidate in 2013.  This wasn't THAT long ago. There are many of us who literally remember this series, every game, and the coverage. And I'm telling you the consensus was for Danny Green going into G6. And one bad game wasn't gonna take it away."
Boris Diaw  Danny Green (Spurs)  Matthew Delavedova  Deshawn Stevenson  Shaun Livingston  Fred VanVleet
Always knew Danny green was more of a 5.5 incher than a 6
Danny Green was a Ray Allen 3 away from winning FMVP
"The bubble Lakers is an interesting one. Kuzma, KCP and Danny Green all played really good defense through the playoffs and replacing any of them with CJ probably creates a defensive lapse.  However, the Lakers weren’t really tested much at all during those playoffs due to how dominant LeBron and AD were in that run. So I would say that CJ in that lineup instead of any of those guys would still lead to a championship that year, simply due to how easy the run was.  The Raptors one is a different story. I think Freddy’s defense on Steph in the finals is severely underrated, and agree with your initial thought that CJ instead of FVV in the finals against the Warriors probably doesn’t get it done because it may allow Steph to go nuclear. However, given how many injuries the Warriors had in those finals, it’s possible they also manage to win with CJ on the squad instead of their 3rd best player, but only due to a weaker opponent and not because CJ’s skill set puts them over the top.  Fun hypothetical debate 🙂"
I think my team has you beat:  PG - Brogdon  SG - Danny Green  SF - LaVine  PF - OG   C - AD
"PG: Cade Cunningham $2  SG: Donovan Mitchell $4  SF: Caris LeVert $2  PF: OG Anunoby $2  C: Joel Embiid $5  --------------------  You have to give up value somewhere, so I think taking Cade for $2 is a worthwhile bet.   Embiid is an obvious choice IMO.   Anunoby for $2 seems like an absolute steal.   Then having to decide between either getting another $5 player and a $1, or taking a $4 and a $2, and IMO I'd rather take a guy like Mitchell and the step up in talent from $1 to $2, than have a $5 talent and have to somehow shoehorn someone like Danny Green into the lineup."
"Harden, AD, Duncan, Cade, Danny Green."
"Harden, Danny Green, Duncan Robinson, OG, Embiid,"
PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Danny Green  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: OG Anunoby  C: Joel Embiid
"James Harden, Donovan Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Vucevic, Danny Green"
"point guard that can run the offense himself but can play offball and hit 3s off the catch, shooters, and a center that can protect the rim without killing spacing. maybe something like  steph/dame/brogdon (if you want ben as focus)  danny green  mikal bridges  ben  myles turner  seems really solid"
seth curry danny green tobias harris joel embiid :(
Also didn’t help that Danny Green forgot how to shoot. Finished games 6&amp;7 with 2-19 and 2-11 from 3.
&gt; The Raptors had a better defensive rating in the year after Kawhi and Danny Green left (although both years they were #2 to the Bucks). It never meant that Kawhi or Danny Green were overrated defenders.  IMO it did further cement the case that Kawhi was a pretty neutral regular season defender.
The Raptors had a better defensive rating in the year after Kawhi and Danny Green left (although both years they were #2 to the Bucks). It never meant that Kawhi or Danny Green were overrated defenders.  If the Sixers are still great on defence without Simmons I still don’t think that discredits how great of a defender Simmons is.
"Credit to the heat.  I'll also give a shout out to AD who had a heel injury (+reinjured) and fought through it, despite it visibly hampering him  Obviously, the heat had it worse, wonderful spirit from the team. Kudos to butler, and i thoughr spo did a great job. Udonis also with that inspiring talk/tongue lashing  danny green really ought to have hit that shot. He was poor shooting all along, but was in perfect position. Also got abused on d by butler"
"It 100% depends on the system around you. I’m just pointing to the countless attempts at super teams that have flopped while the only outliers I can recall are the Heat, Cavs and Warriors. Let’s point to the Sixers 3 seasons ago against the Raptors. Simmons and Lowry were around the same level at the time, Redick was better than Danny Green, Kawhi was better than Butler, Harris was arguably better than Siakam at the time and Embiid was obviously better than Gasol. The team put together 4 guys who were all star players and put him next to a sniper from range. They still lost though. You could argue they lost by lucky last shot which is fair, but it shouldn’t have got to that point to begin with based on talent on that roster. You’re right in saying good coaching does wonders and I agree, but what if you replaced Jimmy with a guy like Khris Middleton, who can shoot from anywhere, doesn’t always need the ball in his hands, and is great on defence as well. Then have someone like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon at the 4 instead of Tobias. I personally think that team would’ve been way better than the one the Sixers had constructed. Despite the three maybe not being as good of players as the players previously on the team, their fit is better and the coaches job becomes easier."
"Yeah, I can’t for the life of me understand wanting out. He thrived playing with CP3, who is arguably more difficult to gel with given his reputation.   The only thing that makes sense to be is that, perhaps the pressure of playing under the proverbial microscope just got to him. Playing for the Lakers is a total catch 22 for an important role player. Danny Green, a total pro and one of the league’s more respected vets was raked over the coals and heavily scape goated on some nights. Shroder was scapegoated heavily for an injured Lakers team failing to advance. It’s just a lot of pressure and Dennis seemingly  lacked the playoff experience needed to drown out the noise."
That last block. I remember Bosh even said earlier that day that Danny Green wont be open anymore on three and he delivered.
Warriors would’ve crushed us. People might be forgetting that Danny Green and Gary Neal demolished us from three. *Gary Neal*. Steph and Klay would’ve ate us alive.
"It's the one thing I *do* somewhat sympathize him with a little. If my wife leaves me for Pedro Pascal, I *get* it, but I'd still be pissed. Playing for a team that tried to trade you has got to sting.  But still, it's the NBA, not a marriage. Joel talked about how if he was being traded for Curry and Klay he'd be sad but understand. Danny Green had Morey on his podcast after the trade deadline and was able to laugh about the fact that he was very close to being traded. The problem is I think Ben's got this inferiority complex because he's not the #1 guy and the Harden situation made it all the worse for him."
ibaka in spurts was genius or a complete bonehead. same w danny green…sans the genius
"It's easily Jokic and you can see it in the records.  Embiid hasn't reached the ECF in a weaker conference. Embiid has also lost a first round series. Again in a weaker conference. Meanwhile, Jokic has reached the WCF and has never lost a first round series in a tougher conference. On top of that, he did all these carrying injured rosters.  The whole defense argument is really stupid. Jokic is not a great shot blocker but he defended Aldridge well in their series against the Spurs. Also, the players surrounding him are not good on defense like Murray and MPJ. You surround Jokic with All Defense guys like Simmons and Danny Green and you'd never hear this talk of poor defense."
"Over a 7 game series, 2019 Kawhi = 2021 Giannis, 2019 Lowry &gt; 2021 Jrue, 2019 Siakam &gt; 2021 Middleton. Plus the Raptors had a better supporting cast with Ibaka, FVV, Danny Green, and Gasol. 2019 Raptors beat 2021 Bucks in six."
"Especially when you look at some of the role players since then. FVV and Norm became 18+ ppg guys, Siakam became 20+, Ibaka was a very good 6th man, Gasol was still an excellent defender, Danny Green a solid 3&amp;D wing and OG didn't even play and he's one of the best 3&amp;D wings in the NBA."
"Yeah nothing says no shooting like Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Joel shooting 38% percent from three."
"why? bc he didnt get better? fine. but everything hes done since the playoffs has been a direct response to the sixers acting like hos.  they were out on him before he decided not to come back.  they wrote him off postgame, then spent the entire offseason trying to trade him while nba media destroyed him w not a single sixer but danny green coming to his defense.  and now that they couldnt trade him, theyre pretending  theres no reason for simmons to trust them or feel they have his back. and so he wants out"
Danny Green
Yea but the refs let them play at the end... off the turnover danny green clearly was intentionally fouling bron on the drive and they didn't call it either.
embiid and doc started it in the post game presser. then no one but danny green had his back all offseason  then the team pretended they liked him for a hot second when they thought they could get him back to raise his trade value  then the very next day the biggest star went right back to dogging him after the team realized ben wasnt gonna play along.  idk why you all have to lie to feel like you came out roses here. the sixers fucked it up and ben isnt forgiving. it is what it is
"Leonard was guarding Durant a lot, in tandem with Danny Green, who was also an elite defender at the time."
"It stayed consistently elite because he always played with another DPOY level player. DPOY voting is literally the subjective measure of players' impact. It is not fool proof, but the opinion of those voters could not be more clear -- Duncan was nowhere close to as-good as you'd like to believe he was. The inconvenient -- for you -- fact is that without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard, Duncan's Spurs were unremarkable defensively -- even with Danny Green ( and Popovich ). Robinson was better without any of those players, or Popovich.Which is why Robinson won DPOY and Duncan never came particularly close. Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated defenses without Duncan. Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th, as noted above."
"yeah there'd definitely be times to play all 3. But generally Danny Green would be the starting 3 with Brogdon and, imo, Curry at the 2 and 1 respectively. That would be the best starting lineup considering Brogdon and Green provide good to great defense, Brogdon and Curry provide good ball handling and playmaking between the two of them, and all 3 provide good to great shooting."
Yes. It was started by idiots like Bayless. Somehow Danny Green is an awesome player because he was on three championship teams.
spurs danny green was insane
"[Yep, this was just 10 months ago:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)  &gt; ""I did this off-the-bench stuff already in two years with OKC,"" Schroder, who finished second behind teammate Montrezl Harrell for Sixth Man of the Year for his role with the Thunder, said on an introductory videoconference call with reporters Monday. ""I think I try to move forward, and I think with [Anthony Davis] and LeBron, I can be helpful as a starter in the PG position.""  &gt; Schroder said that he has not spoken to Lakers coach Frank Vogel about his desire to start, however his representatives, Alex Saratsis and Jeff Austin of Octagon, discussed that aspect with the Lakers front office prior to L.A.'s trading guard Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in the draft to the Thunder to complete the deal.  &gt; ""I think my agent talked to the organization before they was trading me,"" he said ""So, that's that.""  I guess the selfish approach didn't work towards getting himself paid so now he's willing to try being a team player and see if that works."
"Westbrook was guarded by Kawhi, KD was guarded by Danny Green lmao  but yeah go on how he was “clearly better statistically” while ignoring context"
"His asking price was ridiculous.  For example…Wiggins + Wiseman + Kuminga + Moody + multiple 1st round picks?   I’ll have what he’s smoking.    Between grabbing Drummond even though Embiid hates him, Danny Green coming up with Simmons trade scenarios with some random podcaster even though Simmons is still on the team, and Docs comments saying Simmons may not be the pg going into this season…the sixers organization couldn’t have handled it worse imo"
"Raptors have one of the brightest futures IMO. Top tier FO, top tier development team, probably a top 5 coach in the league, great young talent in OG, Gary Trent Jr., Siakam, and *hopefully* Scottie Barnes. The biggest thing working against us is that we're not a great FA destination beccause we're in a different country.  Raptors were a bad for awhile, there was a lot of effort to improve the FO and development team. Recently, even with the shortcomings in the playoffs it was mostly LeBron beating us, we had a solid team and the COTY.  Kawhi and Spurs had a falling out and we were able to get Kawhi for 1 year by trading DeMar, which was risky trading our star for an injury prone player who wanted to be in LA. We also traded an above average starting center for aging Marc Gasol who was the star in Memphis for awhile, picked up Danny Green, and fired our COTY to promote Nick Nurse. All these moves turned out and the Raptors were one of the best teams, we probably don't beat the Warriors with KD, but they didn't so we won. Still beat a super stacked 76ers, Bucks, and Warriors  The bubble season which was the season after we won we lost Kawhi, Marc looked washed af, we had one of the most injured teams in the league and we managed to have the second best record, and I think we would have made the finals and given the Lakers a run for their money if Siakam hadn't regressed so much during the pandemic start.  Last season we didn't have a playable center and we got unlucky with injuries and COVID, we had the 4th best record at one point until half our starters and coach got COVID.  The teams that I might avoid because they're inconsistent would be: Knicks, Hornets, Timberwolves, Pelicans, Magic, Cavaliers  Then there are middeling teams that are content with being average: Pacers, Blazers, Grizzlies, Wizards"
I watched every game and I can't remember a single memorable play other than Danny Green missing the game 5 three and Jimmy Butler going off for 40+
"Yeah he's spindly and frail compared to a lot of his peers.  Hope he goes the Danny Green route and just becomes a truck with crazy lower body strength, would probably help with injuries"
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"Lol, in 2013 Danny Green would definitely get some considerations for FMVP if Spurs won that year, and it tells you how well-rounded that team was."
"That pick turned into Jakob Poeltl, who then became part of the trade for Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard."
"I mean, Morey did somehow dump Horford and Josh Richardson and still get Danny Green and S. Curry. You act like he's done nothing right."
"Ben was exposed in the ECSF, Embiid couldn’t score against Gasol, but Jimmy was finding ways to produce despite being guarded by Danny Green and Kawhi in stretches. He was the most important player and the one that struck fear in the opposition. Nobody was worried about Simmons or Embiid. It was Jimmy and JJ as the two major threats."
You guys managed to choke for 6 mins without Simmons. That was certainly something I just couldn't believe what I was watching and those two danny green airballs just lmfao
Danny green is one of the best 3pt shooter in the league lol. How many guys have a career 40% shooting from 3?
Danny Green is not a good player wtf lol
Thats not true at all everyone was ready to kill danny green at any shot he missed lmfao
"Now, I don't like Doc Rivers at all but he was right in not challenging the Danny Green blocking foul... that was totally a blocking foul his feet weren't set at all and refs have called blocking fouls before on a lot of instances that were better/closer to being a charge than that one..."
"Why was Danny Green in when he’s not hitting shots? The easy fix would have been to put Thybulle in, esp when 76ers had the lead to close"
Yes but only Danny Green was hitting the side of the backboard on his corner 3s
3 Danny Green Airballs  2 calls that Doc should have challenged so that they can get the ball back  1 terrible outlet pass by Thybulle  All to convince Simmons that they really need him to play.
"Being out of control doesn’t change the fact danny green was moving his feet when they made contact. If he was set, it’s a charge. Simple as that"
Him and Danny serviced my team on 2k for years love the green brothers
man did you see danny green earlier? 3 straight airballs in critical time in 4th quarter
The most Danny Green thing ever.
3x NBA champion Danny Green
"I mean korkmaz was sitting there while danny airballing his third , i know korkmaz is not that good D player like green but they were melting anyway."
danny green #1 trending on twitter for poor shooting lol  at least we got new drama instead of worrying about his shooting every game
76ers outshot the Nets from 3. Danny Green even shot better from 3 than the Nets. An airball doesn't hurt the team more than a regular miss.   76ers lost this one on the boards. No excuse to lose the rebounding game to the Nets.
I dont watch Danny green consistently but is he actually any good? Hes always coming up short in crucial times
What they really need to review as a team is Danny Green.
"Danny Green is a good player. If you don't think so, you a literally a casual."
"Iirc wasn't the package Morey wanted from the Raptors something like OG + Siakam + picks? Cuz yeah, that's kinda crazy. Literally more than we gave up for Kawhi + Danny Green, and Kawhi is like several tiers above Simmons"
"Combination of bad calls by the refs (or good calls if you're BKN), missed challenges by Doc an good ol' Danny Green.  Nets had no business winning LOL"
After he buried his first 2 threes I was afraid it was gonna be one of those Danny Green flamethrower games. Glad I was wrong
Danny Green special
Fkn danny green should retire after those three clutch airballs
"Huge comeback win for the Nets...its shocking that the Sixers lost this. KD was KD and Aldridge saved their asses, along with Danny Green. Thank god, since Joe Harris is already in playoff form. 🙃  Still, I'm worried for them cuz the Sixers weren't even at full strength. Idk how they're gonna get out of the east having to go thru these guys and the Bucks again without Irving."
How can doc be blamed for thybelle and Danny green fucking up
Better than Danny Green fo sho
Danny Green and horrendous shooting.
Sounds like Danny green
"Like clockwork, Danny Green trending on twitter again. Poor guy."
?? Without the Nets making their shots it wouldn’t be a dub. Obv Danny Green helped
Not Danny green though lol
Danny Green my hero lmfao
Danny Green bad
"Wouldn't blame Philly for being irked at the officiating down the stretch, but I would start with Doc Rivers being an idiot and Danny Green air-balling three in a row."
Playing Danny green in the clutch is a recipe for disaster
I kid you not danny green air balls 3 shoots in a row and dov fucking rivers is our coach
"Aldridge was huge for Brooklyn, but Danny Green and Doc made sure they pulled it out"
Danny Green masterclass
I knew the Nets would win once Danny Green air balled 2 3's back to back.  The real MVP 👏🏾
I’m not gonna sit here and act like the nets are these world beaters doc rivers and Danny green fucked us
"Danny Green with 3 airballs in the 4th quarter.  A total disasterclass by the 76ers in the last 5 minutes, blunder after blunder."
I can’t wait to wear my new Danny green jersey &lt;3
It’d be easy to blame Danny Green but the whole team was Danny Green in the fourth
I dont miss Danny Green. Emotional roller coaster
Danny Green fucked up so hard down the stretch haha god hes awful
I mean it’s not his fault Danny Green airballed 3 in a row
I appreciate Danny Green and Doc Rivers being such good teammates and making sure that Ben Simmons isn't the only one being booed at Sixers games if he comes back
"The Nets called time-out with 5:32 remaining, trailing 98-108.      From there the 76ers were outscored 16-1, a span where they shot 0/9 from the field and turned it over 3 times. This stretch had 90% free throw shooter Seth Curry missing a free throw and 40% three point shooter Danny Green airbailing back to back threes."
Legend has it that Doc Rivers is still waiting to use his challenge. Danny Green missed charge call led to 3 points and Nets lead for the rest of the game.
"Doc's gonna have to use that saved up challenge for his termination if he's not careful  Edit: Shout out to Danny ""how many more (will he miss)?"" Green for reprising his bubble role."
I was pissed at this game for the first 43 minutes. Then the last 5 minutes came and man i'm happy we don't have Danny Green and the Sixers do. Dude straight up choked with those airballs. Nice win on the road.
Danny Green had 3 airballs lol he was getting booed after the 3rd one
"Somebody check the stands for monstars, because Danny Green forgot how to shoot basketball."
"I know people will blame Doc but bruh Danny Green three airballs and the third one was a confident one like he was shooting 5-5 from three gave Brooklyn the momentum, and a terrible pass by Thybulle as well he wasn't even looking, their individual play in the clutch was terrible  LMA was huge in the 4th, he won them the game"
"I mean Danny green missed bad, but he also got hit in the face on one of them with no call.  Bkn got very physical at the end with 0 repercussions, the rules of the game completely changed for one team but not the other"
don't forget danny green awful shots in the 4th as well
Kissing Danny Green and Doc Rivers for being chokers
Poor Danny green? He airballed 3 straight 3s that could’ve iced the game
Is it really poor danny green? Didn't he airball like 3 or 4 three pointers tonight?
I feel like literally everything went wrong for Philly in the clutch.  - Danny Green 3 air balls.  - Turnovers.  - Seth Curry missing.  - The calls.
"You’re right, I also blame Danny Green"
poor danny green why did he come back to this team
Tobias Harris blew like 4 layups in the 2nd half. Danny Green airballs 3 straight field goals. Doc decides he needs to save up his challenges for the end of the season. And the refs take control of the game.  I have no business being this mad but this was an extremely frustrating game I can’t believe what I say and watched.
"Refs, Glenn, and Danny Green all had money on Nets tonight.   I truly don’t understand how Glenn Rivers keeps getting coaching jobs in the NBA. What a joke"
Shoutout to Danny Green for the 3 airballs in the 4th lmao
What about Danny green air balling 3 3s in a row
"Doc, Tobias and Danny Green owe me $10"
They took Danny Green out of the game bruh
Back to back calls on the Durant outta bounce play and this Danny Green charge. Coulda challenged doc .
Danny Green is an all time choke artist
Does Danny green get any blame? All I’m seeing is doc slander lol I swear he’s become a scapegoat at this point of his coaching career.
why the fuck is danny green playing when korkmaz is a literal god. doc rivers truly sucks.
Danny Green smirking rn
Doc is a clown. Refs suck. Danny Green is Danny Green
Danny green with the b2b airballs from 3 LMAOOO
"I mean I’m still stuck on Danny Green airballing the fast break 3, what are the Sixers doing lmao"
Danny green 3 point specialist: three air balls from 3 in the 4th
"lol why is doc rivers still employed  Danny Green really airballed his last three 3 point shots, pretty impressive."
"That call wasn't getting overturned, worry more about Danny Green airballing 3s by 10 feet lmao"
Danny green lmao  and does doc not realize you can't carry over challenges for the next game
Danny green is elite at drawing charges.. like wtf doc. You literally cost this game by being a dumbass
Danny Green is trash
Danny green hitting nothing not even the net 3 times fueled the Nets comeback.
He's a 3 &amp; D player who airballed 3 out of 6 shots and made only 2. That's definitely a Danny Green game but not ideal for a specialist
Y’all Philly fans different lmao blaming doc for Danny green losing you the game
Danny Green sold like 5 plays in a row😂😂😂
Not sure why Danny Green or Aldridge are playing
"Danny Green doesn't just miss does he, fucking launches it into the bleachers like that kid from Shane Gillis' special 😂"
3 straight airballs by Danny Green..ouch
Danny fucking  Green lmfao. How did Lebron win a ring with him
Never change danny green never change
Danny Green about to give Simmons a day off on most hated person in Philly lmao
Yo is Danny Green serious?
3 straight airballs from Danny Green lmao you know that man will trend AS USUAL
man sixers have got to get danny green out the game. that dude trash.
Never trust contract year Danny Green
Three airballs tonight for Danny Green?
ok real talk i have never seen 3 airballed 3s in a row from danny green no less
When Danny Green fucks up it's always hilarious. Two airballs in a row from a career 40% shooter lmfao.
"Danny Green kicked PJ Tucker in the head just last season in the bubble lol. PJ fell down while he was in the paint, DG went up for a put back, and kicked him in the head on the way down. His head actually bounced off the floor. Man, PJ Tucker really did die for that team lol"
A lot of people think he's a scrappy defender but he and Danny Green both sort of just foul and get away with it
"He’s been our missing piece this year along with a preforming Tobias, and then Danny green gives us some shooting along with them im really feeling the Sixers right now"
"We'll just have to see. I think that makes sense   At the same time, i think Shake will close games in a lot of matchups. Better defense now that he's gained weight, better creator, and still a very good shooter.  It will depend what they need, but the overall construct is so much better. If Josh and Danny Green are about the same type and level and contract,  then we exchanged Horford for Seth Curry plus an improved Shake - holy shit."
"Mark Jackson saying what happened today is not surprising is a shift from when he said ""we're better than that"" in response to Danny Green getting death threats for missing a shot, and JVG said ""I'm not sure about that."""
2019 Raptors: Danny Green started every playoff game      2020 Lakers: Danny Green started every playoff game.      I also don't think any title contender would mind having Curry as their 4th/5th best player.
"So basically, it's just Danny  Green and Draymond Green."
Seth is white hot. Danny Green is hot. Embiid also 2 for 2 from beyond. Can’t remember the last time the Sixers shot this well
I see 2013 Finals Danny Green has appeared
Danny Green getting cooked like the Eagles secondary rn
why is ben not guarding beal. he is barbecuing Danny green
he’s getting another Danny green type bag next time he’s a free agent
&gt;My favorite part was when they note that DG through 8 games last year was performing better than Wes is now  I'm sure part of that was due to Danny Green putting up 28 points on opening night against the Clippers last year. Over the next 27 games he averaged only 7 ppg.
It is the Danny Green Effect.
Danny Green*
So you're telling me if our boy Stanley Johnson undergoes a legal name change to DeThrone Green. Raps are back in the fight to the finals for 2020? Obviously have to face former Toronto Raptor Danny Green in the ECF against Philly.
Is Danny green gonna make it 3 for 3?
Literally the last two title teams had Danny Green as a starter.
&gt; That's his superstar treatment.  Danny Green &gt; MJ confirmed.
I'm also not sure that a 33 year old Danny Green and Seth Curry are two players every team would love to have as starters. At least not title contending teams.
"I mean, the Sixers have  3 max players but also have a very solid supporting cast. Seth Curry, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, all of those are players any fan would love to have on their team."
Yoooo that was running through my mind the whole game. He’s just Majin Danny Green
He also looks like Danny Green on coke
"&gt;best upgrade that’s actually obtainable without giving up Simmons  Yeah lets be real this proposal isnt actually a particularly compelling offer, an expiring contract of Danny Green, two late protected picks and Matisse Thybulle these arent high quality assets. It's a bunch of C- level assets. I would agree the circumstances under which a player as good as Lowry being realistically available for this kind of mediocre package are probably unique, probably wont get another chance as good as that the next 2 yrs. The thing you might roll the dice on is if you can find talent at the margins the next 1-2 yrs and get like 2 dirt cheap UFDA/2nd round type real rotation level players where if you do that you can offer this general kind of package but maybe get someone even better. But it's obviously a gamble.  &gt;his season, he’s almost welcoming the doubles  Yeah he has I'm not going to be 100% entirely sold on it even if he keeps up until it happens in the playoffs but it's a good start. Beyond shot creation I still do think the lack of playmaking beyond Simmons who has his half court limitations is a problem, it goes under the radar but teams who lack playmaking really just dont win at the highest levels it's quite rare. This is where Lowry would really help   &gt;I’d feel a lot worse about our chances if Boston or Brooklyn swung a trade for a star after we sold the farm for Lowry.  Keep in mind Dinwiddie injury really weakens BK's chances of making an in season move to improve their defense. Boston I think the Kemba injury is a big thing, I think this might be a relative down year for them and they might also know it internally. Things are kind of aligning in a way more and more where this season might be the most open the East is the next 5 yrs.   &gt; large looming trade pieces (and more will appear  Yeah it's always impossible to predict and guys will get dealt thing Ill say though is I think we might be headed for a quieter next 2 yrs in terms of transactions. You look at the top stars and the top young players, just so many of them are under contract through like 2024 which wasnt how things were the past 3-4 yrs with all this chaos"
What picking up Dwight Howard and Danny Green will do for ya
Must be the Danny Green Effect.  I will congratulate the 76ers now on their championship.
gary neal and danny green 2013 nba finals game 3
Team went 9/31 and and almost half those makes are from AD lmao Lakers really shot like an open Danny Green all game
Danny Green was just paid more handsomely for his championship resume.
"I’m sure some were clearly joking, but then people legitimately said “the rich get richer” and “upgrade over Danny Green” and “Bron was right, kid is beyond special”. Those were all comments that I saw that were not in jest. Those people were way out of touch, and yet they were validated by others that were just as out of touch. Again, I know my pedophile example was extreme, but it’s the same kind of thought processes that led those people to those thoughts.   “Well other people think it so it must be true.”  That’s the whole crux to my point as to why the internet is toxic. Obviously, being a THT fan isn’t the same as pedos as THT is 19 or 20 after all, so people can ride his dick all they want with no intervention by the law. Joking aside, I hope you can see why it’s similar even though one is about basketball and one is about people who should rot in prison.   I’m not trying to come off as an asshole (well except to the guy that called two paragraphs an essay), though it seems like people think that, I’m just trying to show that echo chambers lead to bad things. And yeah, having shitty basketball takes is nowhere near pedophilia, but the point was not to compare those things in terms of detriment to society, it was simply to show that internet toxicity via echo chambers leads to unsound thought processes that are rooted in confirmation bias instead of rooted in reality."
THAT AIN'T BROOKS MANG! THAT'S FUCKING DANNY GREEN!!!
It was over the moment the Danny Green clone flexed on Lebron.
Brooks is so trash. Pass the ball Danny green jr
Cool. Ya i think cuz Philly is his hometown it would be a nice story.  My offer would be Danny Green and Mike Scott (both expiring) plus Thybulle and Maxey (or Thybulle and picks) for Lowry and 1 cheap player Toronto doesn't want to keep.  &amp;#x200B;   The last time I checked this was doable though I think Toronto might have to cut one player which might be too much to ask for.
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, JaMychal Green, A.C. Green, Rachel Greene. Lakers in 4"
"Yep, and getting Wes Matthews to replace Danny Green is a pretty even swap on the defensive end (and Wes might be the better offensive player/shooter)."
Im all for 4x NBA champion Danny Green
Somehow I had missed that Danny Green is on the 76ers now.
"With Danny Green, that's quite the trio."
Coz u have danny green + howard
"Danny green, Mike scott, Thybulle, Maxey and a first round pick for Lowry and (insert one cheap player you don’t want)"
Ya but losing danny green probably made us better... lol
Page Six: Danny Green hip thrusted Paul Reed for his first time scoring
"YMMV, worked wonders on KCP but not on Kuz and Danny Green"
"They've lost Kawhi, Danny Green, Marc Gasol, and Ibaka from the championship team. That's 3 of the starting 5 and 4 of the top 7 players."
"&gt; We haven’t had an “Ill fitting” super team in recent memory.  The Heatles were great, but they definitely weren't an ideal fit playstyle wise.  Wade and LeBron both relied heavily on driving, and Wade's poor outside shooting couldn't spread the floor to make room.  Also because of the fit and need to keep the lane open somewhat Spo constantly struggled to find a way to utilize all of Bosh's tools effectively.  He was largely relegated to a catch and shoot player offensively, like a rich man's Danny Green.    Luckily for them, Bosh adapted and massively improved his defense, becoming a far better defender than he ever was in Toronto.  If it weren't for that I expect they would have lost in '13 and the Heatles experiment would have been considered a failure.    I suspect that if LeBron went to the Bulls (for the 2 superstars + good roleplayers route) it would have been a better fit for him than the Heat were (pretending that Rose didn't get hurt), and he likely would have stayed for a longer tenure.  They had a grip elite defenders at basically every position (Noah, Gibson, Boozer, Brewer), Korver (who was basically a straight upgrade from washed Ray Allen) and a few other capable shooters (Watson, Lucas, Deng).  Then they picked up Butler in the draft."
"Danny Green is going to win his 3rd consecutive ring while being called overrated, with some merit, every single time."
"I totally forgot Dwight and Danny Green remained teammates after the trade. Like, I know both are in Philly but it did not connect in my brain that they were also teammates in LA."
"And Tobias, Thybulle, Danny Green, and Shake who all have various degrees of good defense"
"Nobody cares about pickup games you play with random bums. We’re talking about basketball at the highest level, and on this level an offence that has role players attempt a high volume of mid-range shots is gonna suck and be competent unable to keep up with teams that actually play correctly.   Sure, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker can take a lot of them because they’re actually good shooters. Danny Green and Robert Covington and like 90% of role players should be shooting threes or layups almost exclusively because 40% mid-range shooting is terrible."
Expansion teams have plenty of cap and would for sure take Tobias  No reason to protect Danny Green
"Embiid   Simmons  Seth Curry  SM  Maxey  Thybulle  Danny Green  No sense protecting Tobias Harris, no one's touching that contract with a 10-foot pole."
Danny Green and a pick?
I don’t even think that’s the case.   The reason why we’re winning so many games because of Simmons defense.   People underrate how impactful he is on the game. They focus on his shooting but watch how it impacts a game.   Josh Richardson was not a good pairing with Ben Simmons last year. He’s not really a shooter. Now that we have Seth and Danny Green it’s completely different.
"We lost danny green, kawhi, serge, marc through FA.  Add in JV and demar u realize we lost 6 high quality starters with no replacement."
"This is not incorrect. Kawhi, Danny Green, Gasol and Ibaka all walked in FA for one reason or another."
Sixers is the logical option. Danny Green + Mike Scott + Terrence Ferguson + Horford trade exception.
What did Danny Green do to you?
We had Danny Green last season.  Trez+Wes combined are cheaper than Danny.  Having both of them vs. Danny is a HUGE upgrade
Fuck Danny Green
"I fucking dislike Gobert and I am a huge wolves fan but I can’t blame him. That was a basketball play, you blame Danny Green for the Klay ACL tear?"
Lol thats funny cause i was pretty mad we didnt trade for schroder ourselves as we couldve beat 28+green with 21+ j rich....but im much happier now that we have seth and maxey. I guess danny ainge and daryl morey might be a bit smarter than us
"Would the Grizzlies drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 when Harden, Rubio, Curry, DeRozan were all still on the board?  Even Danny Green at #46 and Patty Mills at #55 would have been better picks than Thabeet."
then Kawhi and Danny Green leaving what?
Shoulda traded for Danny Green
"Danny Green, Mike Scott, Thybulle (😢), and a protected 1st from Philly? Would sting to give up on Thybulle but Lowry would be a much more consistent shooter than Green and would be an ideal secondary ball handler for us in the playoffs if we don’t want to rely on our young guys."
"76ers off to a great start.  If Danny Green wins a ring with them this season, he'll have a record breaking championship with 4 different teams (Spurs, Raptors, Lakers, and 76ers).  He's currently tied with Lebron, Robert Horry, and John Salley with rings with 3 different teams."
"&gt; He's out Chris Bosh/Kevin Love.  I think he's more of a Paul Pierce guy for us (not as good but similar role). Honestly at least so far, our starters kind of line up a bit with the Doc Rivers Celtics  Simmons - Rondo (good passers and defenders with poor shooting)  Ray Allen - Seth Curry (elite shooting)  Tobias - Paul Pierce (well-rounded forward who can create his own shot when the offense isn't clicking as a team)  Embiid - KG (Paint monster on both ends)  Danny Green - James Posey (total 3&amp;D with probably better defense than shooting)  ______________  Now I'm not saying these players are on the same levels or are identical, but it is funny how there are some striking similarities just in terms of player archetype lol"
"Celtics if you’re talking about talent, Sixers if you’re talking about assets used to build the roster out. The Celtics were more talented but the Sixers sent out a bunch of assets for Jimmy and Harris and used cap space to eventually turn all of that into Seth Curry, Danny Green, and losing a first."
We lost Kawhi then Danny Green then Serge Ibaka then Marc Gasol  That's a lot of talent without assets coming back
No Danny Green.
"matisse, Danny green, mike Scott, and a 1st"
"Kawhi, Danny Green, Ibaka, Marc Gasol  That’s 4 players from the championship rotation all left for LA haha"
They lost Danny Green and haven’t been the same since
They’re missing Danny Green from that championship run
Danny green?
Lmao even the announcer starts cracking up.  I love the anticlimactic Danny Green dunk juxtaposed against Melo’s lifeless body on the ground.
You blame everything on Brett but last year he didn’t have Seth Curry or Danny Green
"Danny ""Not Streaky, really"" Green"
Since when does Danny green run an offense though? He’s always been a shooter not a ball handler
Danny Green looking like himself past couple of games. Really good to see
Danny Green about to three-peat.
"Danny Green. I personally don't agree with it, but he's the one who's name is brought up the most"
Danny green
Danny Green
oh man lamelo just got taken off the dribble by Danny green
"KCP and Kuz are just the hate lightning rods on the Lakers squad, Danny Green too for the short time he was here. ://"
"&gt; So why does Curry's high net rating show he's indisputably a top 5 player in the NBA?   When you're top 3 in net rating every season with PPG, TS%, and record to back it up, you're almost certainly a top 5 player   &gt; but nobody would say that Danny Green is the best player on any team he played for.  No but that doesn't mean his impact is severely underrated. That's what the stats show, they show things beyond what people perceive to be common sense.   &gt; Do you have stats for the starting lineup minus Steph or just every lineup without Steph lumped together?   You can find plenty of on/off numbers online, jsut check pbpstats. Curry without all stars has had a 70+ win net rating over the last 3 seasons. His PPG is on par with prime Harden/ Kobe on higher efficiency with Klay and KD off the court.   &gt; AD is the only one who shouldn't really be there but they still criticize him for his lack of success.  Because AD hasn't proved anything. It doesn't if he had a bad team because we're evaluating based on accolades, not potential. Curry's 2017 performances in the playoffs were as dominant as Kawhi's, he led the net rating that playoffs too.   &gt; And finally, FIRST TAKE.   You do realize I said it's a collective of media, r/nba, and twitter? They're by far the biggest collection of fans on the internet and drive the narrative."
"&gt; You only have to be careful comparing it across teams but within a team, it's the best non-processed stat we have on impact.  So why does Curry's high net rating show he's indisputably a top 5 player in the NBA?  Or were you just saying he's the most important player on GSW?  &gt;Danny Green consistently has one of the best net ratings on every team he's played on, just look at it starting from the Spurs.  Yes, but nobody would say that Danny Green is the best player on any team he played for.  &gt;Anytime Curry was off, the impact metrics showed Curry was the driving figure in these high net rating lineups  Again, context matters.  Do you have stats for the starting lineup minus Steph or just every lineup without Steph lumped together?    And finally, FIRST TAKE.  Lmao if you are getting mad about first take then I understand your frustration.  But why take it seriously?  That video btw is from 2017 right after the Warriors won the ring.  Even still they had Curry in the top 5 right? Lebron, Kawhi off a dominant performance vs GSW before being hurt, KD after a FMVP, AD, Curry.  How is that unfair?  AD is the only one who shouldn't really be there but they still criticize him for his lack of success."
"&gt; Net rating doesn't tell you much about a player individually.  Yes it does, all impact metrics are based on net rating. You only have to be careful comparing it across teams but within a team, it's the best non-processed stat we have on impact. Danny Green consistently has one of the best net ratings on every team he's played on, just look at it starting from the Spurs. His defense and spacing are constantly underrated. I'm pretty sure he scored higher than AD and virtually anyone else during the regular season except LeBron.   &gt; The year before that the entire GSW starting lineup was in the top 6.  We have on/ off metrics, the net rating I'm talking about only shows on numbers but that's highly correlated anyways. Anytime Curry was off, the impact metrics showed Curry was the driving figure in these high net rating lineups. In 2019 that was very obvious when Curry came #1 in net rating and his teammates didn't even come close.   &gt; ESPN even noted that Curry dropped to 8 I think this year because of availability last season.   I'm not talking last season specifically, even though the takes after last season are absurd too.    This was a take in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpaty9VujYk. And somehow KD coming off an Achilles tear was predicted to be guaranteed top 5 while Curry gets taken over by guys like Luka Doncic and Trae Young as a top 5 player. That's absurd."
"&gt;AD, Harden, and Giannis being ranked above Curry is ridiculous, mind you I'm not talking about regular season stats which are debatable, I'm talking these guys making actual top 5 lists based on who can carry their team.   Well those player rankings every year are based on regular season.  ESPN even noted that Curry dropped to 8 I think this year because of availability last season.    &gt; if you look at the net rating Curry comes out first the last 5 seasons  Net rating doesn't tell you much about a player individually.  Danny Green had the second highest in the 18/19 season.  Eric Gordon was tied with Steph the year before and played the same minutes per game.  The year before that the entire GSW starting lineup was in the top 6.  Last year 7 of the top 10 were on the Bucks.  Also, his lack of FMVP awards definitely hurts his legacy in the eyes of the general public."
"&gt;They shored up the biggest weakness without adding any new problems  Yes I agree that firing Brett Clown and replacing him with one head coach and three assistants who are all better than him and actually believe in movement on the offensive side of the ball has been tremendous.  Completely, completely agree on the Dwight addition. Whoever on the Lakers hypnotized him into being a leader deserves a medal.   Obviously Seth. Danny Green also is a really nice effective glue guy."
"Goddamn, Sixers get swept in the first round but add Seth Curry and Danny Green and all of a sudden they could beat the Bucks because **the Bucks** are the ones who underperform."
"It’s weird that LeBron makes nearly everyone around him better, except for Danny Green. He sucked early with LeBron that first year in Cleveland, got good on the Spurs, balled out on the Raps, and then sucked with LeBron on the Lakers again. I’d be willing to bet Green has a better year in Philly now..."
We literally have Danny Green and Simmons lol Seth currys D has yet to be a problem in literally any of our games
"We got shooters though, replaced Danny Green with Wes and Dennis."
"Players with very good bball IQ that seems to know how to make good decisions but doesn't necessarily dominate scoring are always underrated. Just playing consistent smarter basketball, making the right decisions, not messing up or missing plays, or missing defensive assignments. It affects every part of the game and goes so far and it's so obvious when your lineup is missing players like this but something easy to take for granted when your team has it.  I still remember watching the first few games after Raptors first got Kawhi + Danny Green in the starting line up to replace Demar and OG in the starting line up. Then when we got Gasol to replace JV. I loved the previous players but you can tell how much better the team got in the intangibles just from the bball IQ upgrade."
"Wow, so you are using r/lakers as a source for how well a player is doing this year? That might be the dumbest thing I've heard all day. I will admit that Harrell has had some rough patches so far and definitely needs to improve in certain areas for sure. I don't even see how you can argue that Wes Matthews is an average pickup when he plays similar level defense to Danny Green and has been shooting better at a lot better contract value. As for your argument about Interior Defense, yes the lakers haven't been as good as last year, however they are allowing a lower fg% close to the rim than the clippers are this season, even with the signing of Ibaka. So if the Lakers are bad at interior defense, then what would the Clippers be then?"
I can tell you don't really watch games. Wes Matthews &gt; Danny Green on a way better contract. Marc Gasol has been a net positive. It's also good that the Lakers only have one of the best rim protectors in the league also. It's ironic that a Clippers fan is calling another team pretenders when you guys consistently find ways to choke when it matters.
I guess I should have said more Thybulle than Danny Green
Danny Green goes from Roberson to Curry so easily.
I wish Danny went to the Warriors so we could get some hot green curry
Danny Green is definitely Icy Hot lol  3 pointers made/attempted  First 3 Quarters: 7/12  4th Quarter + OT: 2/9  Total: 9/21
"I think Danny Green hitting 9 threes helped to compensate for that loss.  I'm just saying, basketball is a team sport. Always has been. We can say Embiid has relatively limited support, without calling them trash."
embrace it this is the Danny Green way
wonder if danny green read this before his game today
"Danny *""I got three rings *****""* Green"
Not if he comes out to jinx Danny 'Icy hot' Green every game. ;)
"How many times did the sixer announcer say ""Danny Green for the record!!!"" And just bricked all of them lmao. Fun game nonetheless. Gg sixers"
"Danny green has been and always will be streaky shooter, missing like 6 straight after shooting 9-15 is completely on brand for him. Just expect him to always play great D and draw the opposing defense to him, then, when he hit's some shots be pleasantly surprised, otherwise you will want to tear your hair out. Also hope that you have enough ball handlers available because when the man dribbles, bad things happen"
Danny green shoots a lot of 3s too!
But you also have to account for Danny Green using one of his 10 annual pop off games
#Danny “for the record!” Green
Danny “Icy Hot” Green
"I mean, Danny green starts but shake finishes games in his place and we are also missing thybulle"
"Ben actually hurt bro, you could see him visibly limping. And Embiid was clearly healthy enough. Sixers coming off heavy minutes while the league let your guys sit at home and rest. You fucking think Danny Green and Dwight Howard were notable mentions, fucking lol"
I cant believe Danny green took 21 3s in a game
"Danny ""Three Rings"" Green"
"Clearly injured Simmons, fucking Dwight and Danny Green? Lol Dwight is a 15 minute bench dude who hasn't been good so far this season and Danny Green has had awful shooting for the most part. These guys have been playing heavy minutes over the last few days with no rest and one healthy starter."
"I concur, I think he'll be 2nd best all time, ahead of LeBron and Jordan, and behind Danny ""franchise record"" Green"
Danny “for the record!” Green
Danny Green is blocking out the haters
"And y'all had embid, simmons, Danny green, Dwight Howard.........."
"Literally every fucking three that Danny shot the Sixers commentator said “Green with another three, he has nine right now if he gets ten that’s a new franchise record!” So that fact has been burned into my mind"
ironic coming from a lakers flair whose fan base sent death threats to danny green and his wife
We had to rely on Danny Green as our 3 point shooter so...
Danny green may be the worst non-big ball handler I've ever seen
I don't think 2013 Danny Green would've missed 3 clutch threes but yeah other than that accurate. Joel had a Hakeem-like performance.
Bro he was out there running point guard for the last 12 minutes of the game.   Dakota Mathias should count as a -3 when it comes to adding up 8 players.   Mike Scott. Isaiah Joe. Danny Green. That was our finishing lineup.
Y'all had ben simmons+danny green stepped up tn
"As a Embiid fan seeing this performance on a back-to-back is cathartic! Thinking back to all the early days of short seasons, injuries, not even playing back-to-backs, to see him deliver tonight with a monster performance is a sensational feeling.  Shout out to 2013 Danny Green for showing up too"
I can't believe I exist in a world where Danny Green takes 21 threes in a game.
Yesterday I said I’m never going to see Danny Green make a 3 and at the end of the year I’m going to look and he’s shooting 35%. I didn’t Get to see a single Danny Green 3 today. Just the end of the game. Looks like we are right on track
Nothing is more Danny Green than hitting 9 3 pointers and then proceeding to brick a bunch of good looks for the record.
only danny green would make 9 threes and in the same game miss 7 in a row
Danny green the GOAT
Danny Green with 9 3s and 3 rings
Holy shit Danny Green took 21 threes
Danny 'FOR THE RECORD!' Green
Danny Green probably went to Reddit to see people shit posting about his 0/9 game and said 'Its time for redemption' and went ahead to drop 9 threes in the next game
Danny Green heard y’all talkin shit
Players on the court this game:  - 2013 Finals Danny Green - Joel 'The Mailman' Embiid - Tyler 'Reggie Miller' Herro - Duncan 'Klay Thompson Who?' Robinson
This is probably most meme game I’ve ever watched lmao it had everything from Danny Green going crazy to some guy named Dakota Mathias hitting a clutch 3 in OT
Danny Green attempted how many threes now?
last game the sixers were cursing danny green haha.
The Sixers almost wasted a Danny Green game. Phew
YOU GOT OUTREBOUNDED BY DANNY GREEN MULTIPLE TIMES WOW
"This game has been awesome. Got Danny Green going crazy for three quarters, Tyler Herro and Joel Embiid taking over in OT, someone named Dakota hitting a shot to take the lead, Precious Achiuwa playing amazing, and potential for more of the Heat can score."
How is Danny Green outrebounding the entire Heat team?
DANNY GREEN WHAT
This sixers announcer has to stop jinxing Danny Green lol
"zu is jinxing danny green with this ""for the record"" stuff"
Danny Green getting all those offensive rebounds
Danny Green is pretty hot
Danny green has shot 20 threes. What the fuck
"Danny Green and bricking game winners, name a more iconic duo"
I wish we had a g league ball handler. Would be a step up from Point Danny Green lol
we're probably gonna lose with danny green bringing it up but this has been fun. Shout out to Ben Simmons going off for 5 whole points and fouling out
"this game is batshit fucking crazy.  both squads only playing 8 players, shoutout danny green with the 45 minutes played in regulation lmfao"
"Danny Green had an amazing three quarters, just to absolutely suck when it mattered most."
Never seen someone jinxed out harder than when Danny Green tied the team record for 3s.
He waited a long time for Danny Green.
WTF is Danny Green doing
that might have been the most danny green thing i've ever seen
Just wait for ball handler danny green
"danny green giveth, but he also taketh"
Danny Green gonna be trending again
LMAO Danny Green for the sideboard brick!
Danny Green pulled a Paul George lmaooo
I'm just here for Sixers 3 pt legend Danny Green to set the new franchise record ... he just gotta hit another one haha.
#THATS CLIPPERS OPENER DANNY GREEN MY GOD
The most Danny Green thing ever
Danny Green living up to his name

[Danny Green tonight](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ipfc070sy1A/maxresdefault.jpg)
NO DANNY GREEN SLANDER TONIGHT
Danny “I got 3 rings” Green
Wtf I love Danny Green
The Danny Green wash cycle
danny green really took that fan's heckling to heart
Danny Green will be putting up Harden numbers when he has to play in front of an actual Philadelphia crowd every night.
Friendship ended with Seth Curry.   Now Danny Green is my best friend.
Wtf I love Danny Green again
Everyone bitching about simmons not shooting...but danny green doesnt have a near career night if he isnt looking to find open shooters all the time
When was the last time Danny green took 18 shots in a game? Without looking it up gonna guess 2017
"""dAnNy gReEn iS wAsHeD"""
Who is this guy that looks like Danny Green and what did he do with the real Danny Green?
Hello police! I’d like to report a murder. Danny Green killed the Heat
Simmons has been our worst player on both offense and defense so far. Joel is hitting a good rhythm now but he was pretty bad earlier too. Danny Green is maybe our best player so far.
"He's huge for sure, but we are missing all of our other shooters as well. Unless you count Danny green."
Danny Green  Kyle Lowry  Joel Embiid   Tobias Harris   Boban Marjanovic
"Simmons is amazing  Also I don't think Silva will be back next year. If you can't stretch the floor, rely on dunking and get blocked by Danny Green...that's pretty bad."
"And lo, on the twelfth day of the first month, the LORD said, ""Let Danny Green make his three point field goal attempts,"" and it was done."
Philly fans against the Hawks i saw the first defender sagging off of Danny Green. Does that happen often or was that a one - off? I feel like his reputation as a good 3p shooter may be at a tipping point.
"nah danny started every game of the playoffs  As shitty as Green was in the playoffs, FVV was even worse for the 1st two rounds.  Then green was complete shit vs Milwaukee and FVV started killing it after game 4."
No one hurt me as much as Danny Green rupturing Klay’s ACL
If I have to watch Danny Green go 0-9 again so help me god
The Danny Green 3 point forecast for this game is ‘hot’ - Danny is gonna hit 5/10 3s.
Well I got 10 Os in my bank account - Danny Green in the shower after thinking about this interaction.
And Danny Green will leave the Sixers to team up with Brandon Ingram on the Pistons in due time
He’s a worse shooting but more athletic Danny Green on offense. Certainly not ideal but boy can he play defense.
Same. Amazing how replacing Horford with Danny Green and Seth Curry (i know he didnt play but still) has opened up so much of Embiid’s game.
I tried convincing people that danny green had a thing for breast milk during the off season
Yeah Ben+Danny Green is probably the best almost any team can come up with for guarding Harden and KD. Seth on Kyrie isn't ideal but the rest of the starting defense is good enough to help limit Kyrie to a reasonable degree.
I mean so is James Harden against Danny Green
"Your point about being able to make huge team changes is super valid, but it definitely wasn't just one or two guys that did that for the lakers, it was a combination of a lot of personnel changes.. Frank Vogel was a super well-fitted coach for the pieces they had to work with and they completely surrounded both of the stars with champion role players like Danny Green and Javale McGee and Rondo who knew how to work deep playoff runs and guys like Dwight and Alex Caruso who (for obviously very different reasons) had something to prove.   I will agree that in the end, the difference was still obviously AD and LeBron being able to show why they're the dudes and go super big (and the fact that refs giving AD free throws the moment he approaches the paint), but they couldn't have put AD on that team the year before and won the title without all the other changes they made."
There are fanbase that have done worse than that. Lakers fans sent actual death threats to Danny Green and his fiancee. Celtics fans (and Boston fans in general) have a long history of racism. Detroit fans threw the drink that caused the Malice In The Palace + all the other fuck shit they did that day. Utah has a history of racist fans. If some dickhead fans cheering when KD went down was the second third and final nail in the coffin I want to see what type of nails you used for other fanbases.
Why you gotta disrespect Danny Green like that
"The whole team earned that ring. Their team defense and playing Curry hard, yes with rough play that bordered on fouling, and staying close to him helped edge them the series. Role players matter, everyone plays a part.  Just like Danny Green for our team last year. No one deserves to be just excluded because fans expect role players to perform at an all nba level and if they don't ""they didn't do enough""."
Damn Danny green actually good at getting clutch offensive rebounds
Danny Green is 6'6?!
Doc Don’t ever listen to Danny green when he wants to challenge...he’s always wrong lmao
Danny Green couldn't pick up the big man so they pushed him out LOL.
that was a wicked pump fake by jaylen. I cant believe Danny green stayed down on that
That was Danny Green with the pass but yeah
"So obviously that call is annoying as fuck but out of curiosity... look where Danny green ends up when smart hits the deck ... he’s fully standing exactly where smart took off... they call fouls, even flagrants if you even get a shoelace under the shooter while closing out from the front, which makes it hard to see how you don’t call that as annoying as it is"
He's young Danny Green basically. Making nothing and good enough to start on finals teams while guarding the opposing teams best guard and shooting a nice % from 3.
"Call me crazy but I think the Sixers have the personnel to defend the Nets. Embiid has the length to bother KD, Simmons can defend Harden, and Danny Green can bother Kyrie. I don't think they can lockdown defend them though"
"Big time disagree with Oregon  Terrell Brandon, Danny Ainge, Mike Dunleavy, Damon Stoudamire were all better than AC green. That’s as an OSU homer too. Fuck it, even sabonis or Terrence Ross from today would be better."
"&gt; If Giannis will not be the closer, that means Middleton or Jrue will be the guys making the decisions down the stretch.  Can you win with your best player not taking the shots though? Because defense will always force the ball out of the number 1 and number 2 options. That would mean Jrue needs to do a lot of scoring.   With Raptors championship team for example. They have Lowry, Vanvleet and Siakam willing to shoulder the scoring load. That's on top of Gasol and Ibaka hitting timely threes. Danny Green in selected games could get hot too. Raptors 4 players could take the scoring load any night. Plus 3 solid role players who can score.   Can the Bucks win games, if teams can limit Middleton and Giannis from scoring?"
"I think the Kawhi comparisons are way way too early. Kawhi was a much more well rounded player with his size advantage which gave him more versatility in guarding bigger players, while also making him a much more above the rim player on both offense and defense especially in regards to rebounding and play finishing.  Dort is great, but he's more young Danny Green than young Kawhi. Guard the team's best 1-3 &gt; shoot 3's at 40%."
"Schroder wasn’t had for just a pick though. He was traded for Danny Green, who is a useful player, whose contract matches closely to Schroders. And then used again to help match salaries and land them more picks from Philly.   The only player we had on the roster whose contract would be close would be Smart.   And I keep seeing people mention these sorts of transactions, where picks were involved but people skip over the useful players in the deals too. Lakers didn’t get Schroder for a 1st round pick. They got Schroder for Danny Green plus a pick."
If only Philly had traded for Steven Adams instead of Danny Green.
I don't think it would be a godfather offer from 76ers. But Danny Green + pieces and assets would be likely
"There's precedent for this, the league gave a 'cease and desist' so to speak to the spurs, and fined them for benching Duncan/Parker/Manu during the Heat Vs.

Danny Green was also the one who hip checked him and caused the hamstring injury earlier in the series.
Imagine how we feel. Robbed two years if his prime because of Danny Green
"Danny Green, Mike Scott, that awful Celtics center and then we have an $8 million wiggle room. We have a fair amount of expirings. Throw in some picks."
"This is one of the things that got me off of sports radio.  The Celtics are simultaneously a team that can't attract big name free agents, but also won't trade for them because Danny loves his picks too much, but also keeps rolling over picks and never drafts anyone, but also is full of players that the ""Green Teamers"" overvalue, but also is full of players who are underachieving with Brad."
Did u just compare Michael Jordan to Danny green??? It’s completely obvious those who critique MJ never watched him play.
"You could go back through pops career and probably find more guys he pulled out of the mud than any coach in history. Danny Green wasn't even going to have a career in the NBA, and ended up starting on multiple finals teams."
You do realize what an outlier game is? Danny Green shot like 60% from three at like 7 a game in the finals for four games in a row... that doesn’t mean I would want him taking a final shot over LBJ or Curry lol
Ben Simmons + Danny Green or Shake Milton
"&gt;Harden, Embiid, Tobias, Curry, Danny Green is as good as any starting 5 in the league.  And I hear what you're saying, but that is not a super team..."
"Harden, Embiid, Tobias, Curry, Danny Green is as good as any starting 5 in the league. The spacing. The defense. The pick n roll game of Embiid and Harden would be elite. Would be spooky.  And if I recall, the deal was Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle and picks...meaning Shake is the 6th man and Dwight is the 7. Add an 8th guy (Ariza buy out? who knows)...and that Top 8 is damn good."
Wonder if Bron would rather have Danny Green on the floor at that moment
Like when Dwight grabbed Seth Curry by his jersey and held him so that Danny Green could hit a 3. I have no sympathy for the Lakers lmao
Danny Green
Danny green missed a ton of threes with the lakers too. And the raptors in the playoffs
Do you want to see point guard Danny Green? Because that’s how you get point guard Danny Green.
We traded Danny Green for this man lmao. Pelinka manna from heaven.
"i remember some laker fans, and even some dumshite media like john hollinger, saying that giving up danny green for schroder was 'too much' FUCKING LOL"
Friendly reminder: Lakers got Schroder for Danny Green and the 29th pick.
#PELINKA STOLE DENNIS FOR DANNY GREEN
How the fuck did the Lakers get Schroeder for only Danny Green and a 1st round pick?
Eric Gordon and Danny Green send their regards

brooks looks like an alcoholic danny green
Saying a 33yr old Danny Green isn’t worth over 15m a year is trolling? Guess I’m a troll then..
Danny Green is a net negative player now? Now you're just trolling me.   And why do you think they're even late firsts? Once their stars eventually leave they're not going to be good for a while.
Has anyone seen Dillon Brooks and Danny Green in the same room?
"Offensively yes, defensively I don’t think so. He’s below average where Danny green was pretty good and still can be. Brooks can do a bit more on offensive too."
Is Danny Green a good player comp for Dillion Brooks?
We've had Seth Curry and Danny Green which is just kind of hilarious
The disrespect to Danny Green
Smush Parker would 100% be this generation’s Danny Green in that he would start trending on Twitter 5 minutes into every Lakers game.
"Sixers just traded Al Horford and a garbage 2025 first for Danny green, but sure nobody wants late draft picks."
The Danny green special
"I think the 76ers would have been better going by O’Connor’s report  James Harden/Shake Milton/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Seth Curry, Thybulle and Dwight Howard off the bench  I don’t see how you stop them"
"If this was structured like the DeRozan/Kawhi deal I would have taken it for sure, but it just isn’t.    Like imagine if getting Kawhi cost you DeRozan, Van Vleet, Powell (if you believe they asked for Matisse) and three firsts and also didn’t return Danny Green.  Is it still worth it?"
Danny Green in shambles
Looks like Danny Green is in the wrong business then
"I think LA was much deeper last year than people realised.  LeBron, AD, Danny Green, KCP, Rondo, Caruso, Kuzma and Dwight were all legit big minute guys in the playoffs. Bradley would have been if not for his son’s health issues. And that’s not counting Kieff cos nobody knew we’d get him. So Lakers had 9 legit playoff guys + Javale who can play some minutes.  Thing is people think of depth in terms of how much your bench players score per game instead of everything else, which the Lakers had.  I still don’t love Brooklyn’s roster but there’s zero reason to believe this is the roster they’ll have by playoff time.  At a similar point in the season last year, the Lakers were playing Quinn Cook and Troy Daniels major minutes, and waiting on Boogie’s return. Their rotation changed a lot by the playoffs and I suspect Brooklyn’s will too"
No Lakers were not getting Danny green that's it.  Kcp Avery and everyone waited for kawhi's announcement.    There is a reason that the moment kawhi's was announced in the span of 5 minutes Lakers filled the team.
"We’re not getting Danny Green, KCP, Avery Bradley etc if we get Kawhi. Still better off with him but it’s not the exact same team"
"Most people thought that Simmons for harden was the trade even tho harden wanted Brooklyn.  I think the 76ers will regret not trading for harden even tho their team has improved from a year ago with doc, Seth curry, Danny green and tyrese maxey."
"JaVale was a decent player overall, actually statistically better than Dwight for the most part.  Rondo wasn't good until the playoffs, but he wasn't awful like a lot of people on r/Lakers made him out to be, again when you looked at his advanced metrics.  Danny Green was overpaid, mediocre shot for an SG, but was a plus-defender.  This is all to say that, last season, the Lakers weren't especially good past LeBron and AD, but weren't some trash team like Golden State's non-stars."
"Lowry might go down as one of the most underrated players of all time, honestly. He got both Siakam and Derozan onto 2nd team all NBA for being top scorers on teams where they weren't even the best players. Prime Lowry was an elite two way guard but his true strength has been in how good he makes others. So many guys have had career years next to Lowry (Derozan, Ibaka, Danny Green, Patterson, Biyombo, I could go on...) that it's hard to argue that at his best he wasn't a top 10 player. People fall victim to box score watching. But Lowry has gotten results that guys like Wall, Irving, Kemba, Rondo etc have never gotten."
"Shake needs to start over danny green the same way fvv would occassionally start over danny green. Dont tell me about shake running the bench blah blah, hes too good amd improves the teams chances of winning the morr minutes he plays. Dont fear change, hes not a bench player his whole career"
He will finish games ahead of danny green the same way fvv would finish games ahead of  danny
Dude thinks he’s curry but in reality just Danny green
"Is everybody in this thread intentionally being a dumbass blog boy?  It’s not difficult to separate at all.  PJ Tucker and DFS are not better shooters than Harden or Trae. Your percentages can be skewed by taking contested deep threes. Eye test will easily reveal that these guys hit shots when open. Luka’s biggest problem is taking after the Harden school of abysmal threes, but in both cases it helps their driving game.  I can’t remember a time where these guys missed shots the roleplayers take. It’s plausible a Tucker or DFS or a Danny Green will miss a wide open uncontested three. When Harden or Luka or Trae are open?  They will have a disgusted look on their face and drain it (Luka), literally look down on the defender with broken knees (Harden), etc."
Trez. No Danny Green. Schroeder. There ya go.
"&gt; you keep signing $5M players for $1-3M.   Who exactly are you referring to? I feel like you're really misremembering what the Lakers' circumstances were before last season if you think they just attracted a bunch of ring chasers for cheap. Keep in mind the Lakers had a max cap slot for Kawhi, and when he went to the Clippers the Lakers were left with all that cap space (~$32 million) to sign players. Danny Green didn't come to the Lakers for a discount, he came cause they gave him a 2 year $30 million deal. KCP re-signed with the Lakers because they gave him a 2 year $17 million deal. It even took offering Javale McGee a 2 year $8.2 million deal to get him to re-sign. Kuzma was on his rookie deal still and they signed Caruso coming off of his 2-way contract.   Other than that the Lakers signed Dwight and Rondo to minimum deals because that was the most *anyone* was willing to offer them. A lot of people thought they shouldn't even be in the league anymore. Dwight had been traded to the Grizzlies on a $5 million deal and they bought him out cause they didn't want him, and there weren't any reports of Rondo being offered *anything* that summer other than the minimum the Lakers gave him. The Lakers signed Avery Bradley to a 2 year $10 million after he too had been bought out by the Grizzlies and most people thought that was an overpay.   *This* year the Lakers probably got some ring chasers for cheap (Gasol, Trez and Matthews), but that wasn't the case last season. Next summer Brooklyn isn't going to have $30+ million in cap space, they'll just have the taxpayer MLE ($5 million) and vet mins to offer. And this season of course there aren't any vets available as they're all already signed. But next summer the Nets could sign a guy or two for cheap, but of course they'll be competing with the Lakers and everyone else for those guys."
&gt; saying how they're too inconsistent and shit like that.  Danny Green
"To be fair, Tobias was money on every single shot he took late in the game last night. Danny Green missed a 3 he should’ve hit and Dwight missed a dunk he should’ve made and the two consecutive free throws he had after being fouled on said dunk.  With that said, you’re point has merit. Shake is just built different. Our 20 something turnovers cost Shake player of the game"
"&gt; The Lakers got absurdly lucky with all their pieces hitting  Nah, it's the LeBron effect. Rio Chalmers, Norris Cole, Birdman Andersen, Matthew Dellavedova, Timo Mozgov... Even players more proven like Battier, Jones, Shumpert, Smith... Why are they different than Danny Green, KCP, Rondo, Dwight, JaVale etc?  They're not. Playing with LeBron makes you the a championship roleplayer... The Lakers could pick up 7 G-Leaguers and he'll make them look legit"
"Javale McGee got 4M and was seen as a minimum contract player  Dwight got a minimum and was only signed late in the offseason because Boogie got hurt, he literally wouldn't have gotten signed if the Lakers didn't sign him  Rondo signed for the minimum because he was seen as a terrible ball hog  Avery bradley signed for 5M and was waived by the Grizzlies, no team had cap space left by the time the Lakers signed him so 5M was the most he was gonna get  KCP re-signed with the Lakers after being there 2 years prior  Caruso signed for 3M and hadn't played regular NBA rotation minutes yet  Danny Green got 15M  Nobody was going to offer any of those guys more than what we offered. Only this year with Wesley Matthews, Montrezl Harrell, and Marc Gasol have we gotten ring chasers, and none of those caliber players are going to hit the buyout market."
"Yeah, if the OP is talking about who Brooklyn could get this summer then that's one thing, but they aren't gonna find any ring chasing vets this season cause those guys are already all signed to teams. Also, for people thinking the Lakers just used the allure of LeBron and AD to sign a bunch of ring chasing vets for cheap, that's wrong too.   Once Kawhi turned the Lakers down they had over $30 million in cap space they'd earmarked for Kawhi that they then used to sign players with. Danny Green came to the Lakers cause they gave him $14 million, not cause he was ring chasing. KCP came back to the Lakers cause they gave him $9 million. They got a couple guys on the minimum (Rondo and Dwight) that nobody thought were worth anything, and who a lot of people thought maybe shouldn't even be in the league anymore. They were not guys who turned down larger offers elsewhere to sign with the Lakers. The Lakers used the BAE on Avery Bradley and most people thought that was an overpay.   Next summer Brooklyn is gonna have the taxpayer MLE (about $5 million) and vet minimums to offer. They might get some guys with those, but teams like the Lakers will have the same things to offer as well."
Playoff Rando would be Danny Green imo
"I don’t think he has enough ability to create for himself to be the next Jimmy Butler right now. He has improved pretty rapidly so it’s possible he improves that part of his game, but right now I would say he’s more like Klay Thompson lite. Maybe a thicker Danny Green back when he was in his prime? He’s essentially Tony Allen with a jump shot which is pretty dang good"
as if you guys didn’t shit on rondo kcp Danny green and Kuzma all year until they got better and now acting like you’ve loved them all along
Justin Holiday is getting paid 6 million this year to do what Danny Green and KCP are doing for 2-3x the price
97 Suns  kidd Nash KJ Sam Cassell Finley Rex Chapman Horry  tisdale hot rod Ced Ceballos AC green danny Manning  If all in their prime — best smallball team ever?
"Danny  Green got 15M, wtf are you talking."
"Definitely not first but surely overlooked, the 2009-10 Cavs at their peak would’ve been devastating for a lot of teams   Mo Williams, Danny Green, LeBron, Antawn Jamison, Shaq"
"The only good-value ring chaser Lakers had last season was Dwight on a minimum last season and Markieef Morris after his buyout.   Caruso was on the team for a while already so he doesn't count, Danny Green was definitely paid above market value, Avery Bradley was pretty washed up the prior season, Rondo looked horrid in the regular season, Cousins didn't even play a game.   The thing now is, who is available in the trade/buyout/free agent market suits the Nets' needs?"
"Yeah. Dwight, AD, LeBron, Danny Green, Rondo would be a pretty good starting line up"
"Zero doubt that Trez, Gasol and Danny Green all could've gotten more, or at least longer contracts at the price they signed.  Rondo had a surprising good first year with the Lakers and then resigned for 2 years at half of what he could've got.  You're probably right about Matthews   &gt; Are players not allowed to want to play for team that will compete over earning more and sitting in the lottery?  of course they are, I'm not arguing aganist it at all. I'm just saying it happened to LAL and will now happen to the Nets. Folks need to keep that in mind when considering their current depth issues"
Manu Ginobili  Paul George  Danny Granger  Draymond Green  Kevin Garnett
"Oladipo isn’t a good fit in Philly. Needs the ball in his hands, playmaking is up and down, not an efficient half court shot creator, takes too many shots he’s not good enough to take, doesn’t complement Embiids skill set really at all. The Oladipo Simmons fit also is no good   Kyle Lowry is the guy who that kind of framework did a trade is something I would consider much stronger if Philly. Danny green mike Scott two protected firsts"
"Danny Green isn't a bad salary filler. He can be flipped for a 1st straight away (as OKC did).   &gt;Danny Green, a FRP, and maybe a young player  So the trade is really:  * PHI Receives: Dipo  * HOU Receives: Two 1st round picks + A young player  That's pretty decent to be honest"
"Are you really saying old as fuck ray allen, fucking mike Miller, fucking shoot less than 30% Danny green, fucking don’t know the time JR are amazing? I guess regular all-stars like Blake griffin must be a god for you."
"It would be the FRP and the young player included in the deal, those are the main pieces. Danny Green is just salary filler."
Danny Green as the main piece for oladipo? u good?
"Our best lineup is easily shake, seth, simmons, Tobi, embiid. I doubt statistically there's a better a lineup in the entire league so far with a 30 min sample min. It's a whooping +50 lineup in a 30 min sample. Our starters when healthy have been very good with Simmons, seth, danny green, tobi, embiid with a much larger sample at +15. Our starters started the season in the negative but got extremely hot before the bug hit us. Seth in particular was becoming virtually unstoppable. To Docs credit shake does close tight games.   The issue with this team isn't really who starts, the issue is really Dwight, Bradley, and Poirier all can't really play with Ben. This is also a familiar problem, we didn't have it last year because Ben and horford lineups were really strong when embiid sat. It's not a huge issue when embiids healthy because we can just keep Embiid and Ben attached.   I actually think the solutions might already on the team. I think Paul Reed and Mike Scott make should fill in for embiid when he's out. Reed can really switch on D, he's gonna be a + defender in the nba. Scott is a wide body who can set quality picks and stretch the floor. The main issue with that is Reed is on a 2 way and Scott is having trouble with fitness and health. I'm also not sure Doc gets how difficult it is to build lineups around Simmons when embiids out either. He's been very timid about smaller lineups with Simmons anchoring the defense even though Simmons has looked rock solid in that role."
Simmons shouldn't hold the ball until the last second if he's not a threat to shoot it. Give it up earlier.   Likewise I think Danny Green should've done a better job getting open for 3. I feel like Simmons could have found him with a long pass.
"Hard disagree tbh. Once Kawhi left (and to a lesser extent Danny Green), the Raptors were left with a team built around  33 year old Kyle Lowry, 35 year old Gasol and Siakam. Unless you get Giannis, it was time to hand the keys over to Siakam and Anunoby and start the rebuild"
"Over Danny Green, absolutely"
Man had Danny Green on him and just jabstepped for 5 seconds then got the ball stripped
Really? A Danny Green 3?
I’ll upvote you. Raptors Danny Green was a premier 3 and D guy.
Watch Danny Green makes 7 threes
 Can you compute SD on 3fg%? I'm particularly curious about Danny Green.  A neat visualisation would be to plot error bars or SD on 3fg% as a function of time (I guess you can compute SD via a moving average). Basically try and capture the growth and decay of some players in time.
Can you use common sense? 18-19 Danny Green is what got him his 15m contract. Why would I talk about current Danny Green. Everyone knows he sucks
I'm talking about 18-19 Danny Green. Those numbers are what got him his 15m contract. That Danny Green is way better than Robinson.
Danny Green shot 45% from 3 and played excellent A+ defense the year the Raps won the chip. Then he got paid. I'll take that Danny Green over Robinson any day. Robinson can't play defense at all.
in what world is Danny Green waaay better than Duncan Robinson? Duncan Robinson’s 3 point shooting numbers rival prime Klay Thompson. Danny’s defense isn’t what it used to be and his shooting is league average now with stretches of him just disappearing. The 2019 Lakers likely get better with Duncan instead on Danny considering it wouldn’t be difficult to hide him on defense.
Danny green way better than robinson ? or am i reading wrong ?
Danny Green got 15m and he's way better than this guy. And 15m was considered a slight overpay. I'd be surprised if he got more than 10m
"Thompson was replaceable on those teams, if you put Jae crowder or Danny green there instead those warriors team still probably wins the finals. Peak draymond was not someone you could remotely replace, not only was he the best defender in the league and the reason their defensive scheme worked, but that team especially pre-Durant needed an additional playmaker to curry, who has never been an elite shot creator for his teammates."
danny green is shook right now
We should start calling this The Danny Green
"I just wanted to specifically point out the backboard steal he had near the end of the game.  The ball gets tipped away from Danny Green in the corner.  Ben is standing in the middle of our lane and immediately notices the possession is about to switch and the Pistons are going into a fast break.  He leaves his man and sprints down the court, catching up to the ball, and **purposely** slaps the shot off the backboard, knowing that Kork is just behind him to gather the ricochet.  It's one of the quickest, most high-IQ plays you'll ever see, and Ben does stuff like this **all the time.**  *This* is why he's an all-star.  *This* is why you don't trade him.  He is the engine that runs this team, and if you can't see past his lack of an outside shot, you simply aren't paying enough attention or you don't know enough about the subtleties of basketball.  Ben Simmons haters, please shut up or learn more about basketball.    Or both.  Both would be great."
"Tatum shot 36%, 28%, 31% and 37% against the Sixers with Ben guarding him in their last 4 matchups. Danny Green guarded Brown last two games. Ben literally owns Tatum, it’s a fact 🤷‍♂️"
"Chase Down blocks is LeBron (Prince honorable mention)   Transition Defense is Danny Green (Draymond also good because of his IQ)   Cutting passing lanes and stealing the ball, very underrated Ricky Rubio as a defender (CP3 too)   And I can make a bet right now that Haliburton is gonna be also one of the best at it"
Wayne and Danny Green both out here tonight repping 2009 UNC Championship team!
Might have to trade Danny Green to sort this out
ill be damned if danny green become a champion again
"Wasn't there a bunch of news about him fighting with the rookies and causing trouble with Koby?  And the cavs look like they have a decent squad. If you guys added Danny Green or oubre with love's salary, I could totally see a playoffs push. 30m can get you a lot."
"Yeah, we ended up with Barnes who was decent but not preferably starting caliber, Wes Johnson who was awful, Jeff Green who was inconsistent, and Danny Granger past his prime. Just was never quite enough to put us over the hill."
I second Danny Green. At least top 5.
"I don't understand where this narrative has come from that he out coached Nurse. Coaching didn't make Danny Green forget how to shoot, nor did it make Fred 6 foot trying to shoot over guys like 8 inches taller than him."
Danny Green is sneaky strong in this category.
Not ashamed to admit that I’m rooting for the Sixers to win a title this year just so Danny Green can win 3 in a row with 3 different teams and end up not getting his rings from any of them
"&gt;They're pretty comparable shooters, arguably Giannis shooting similar  percentage on 30% more volume makes him the better 3pt shooter.  My god did you watch the playoffs last year? ""AD and Giannis are pretty comparable shooters""? Also, a 3% difference is the difference between the league average and Danny Green!"
we didn't have kawhi or danny green last season when Nurse won COTY
Even Danny Green is a good passer. He can throw an entry pass at least. Underated ability
"Funny you say this as the Pacers have the exact same record and underlying metrics (NETRTG) through their first 15 games as they did last year despite having better injury luck this year.  Also, the Raptors acquisition of Nurse was accompanied by Kawhi, Danny Green and Gasol."
"Signing several 3 point threats (Seth Curry, Danny Green) and replacing a coach that was only there to tank has unlocked this team. Who would've thought?"
"I’ll double-down on my point.  He’s 28 and having a really really bad year and worse thing is he’s getting paid 24m.  He’s too old to be rebuilding with a young core to meet their timely e and contenders can’t afford 24m for his limited skill set.  Sure he can help teams within 8-12 seed like the Knicks or Magic, but why would they give up young core or future 1st round picks, how does it help their future to win the championship?  Buddy might be an elite shooter but lacks consistency in finishing at the rim 43% last year and 37% this year He also lacks ability to get to the line averaging &lt;2 FTA per game, this shows in his true shooting % which is extremely low for a guy who is an elite shooter.  His defence has been arguably his weakest points, having one of the worst defensive BPM and defensive rating amongst the Kings roster in the last two years.  RAPTOR impact metrics put his season currently at 224th out of 250 players who played over 200 minutes or bottom ~10% of the league this year. It’s scary and contenders aren’t going to risk it.  If you’re getting paid that much on a team trying to contend you should be either 2nd option like CJ, Kemba/Brown or 3rd option with elite defence or other skill sets  like Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons.   To put it in an example, 76ers could use shooting but they’ll have to give up something like Danny Green + Seth Curry (having a career year) + young asset in either picks or Maxey, Shake or Thybulle? Hard to make an argument for any package for Buddy   Money’s tight when going for the chip."
I mean depending on the week a Rim vs Danny Green game might favor the Rim.
I bet there’s gonna a game where everyone gets sick except for Danny green and the league is gonna be like “y’all can still play”
"I mean he’s not entirely wrong, but it’s definitely a combination of both. Horford absolutely wrecked our spacing and we basically swapped him and Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and Danny Green in the starting lineup"
Do you thing it’s a ego thing? He did the same thing with Danny green. I’ve been exploring this a lot lol like does he feel empty internally or something why does he feel the need to always bring himself up to be relevant when in reality none of that seriously matters. You can be broke in the streets and be content. I don’t even think it’s about the money at this point. It’s straight up seeking validation attention power approval etc etc
Yeah I don't know why Coach Rivers doesn't put him on the stars late in games. Maybe he's saving it but seeing Danny Green on Brown was pretty annoying. But if he didn't put him on Beal when he had 60 I shouldn't be surprised he didn't tonight.
"Our offense wont be the same lmao, are you even watching us? Embiid looks way better and he was already a top 10 player. Then we replaced Al Horford and J Rich with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Dwight. We're  a way better team."
"It was weird that Coach didn't put Ben on him in the fourth except for a few possessions, especially since those possessions went well. He was mostly being guarded by Danny Green. Who would be my fourth option on him if Thybulle was out there."
"Blockbuster trade scenario. Clippers gets Lowry, Toronto gets Kawhi, Serge, Danny Green, Philly gets Stanley Johnson, 2022 FRP"
You ain’t kidding.  We love Danny Green though!
Danny Green and Seth Curry change things.  Shake Milton will have his nights.  Furkan can get hot.  We just have more shooting now.
Danny Green be shooting some contested 3s
Danny Green 😂
I mean it's Danny Green. If he's shooting well there's nothing you can do to stop it but if he's cold you can leave home open
He's got the shot. Just needs to hone it in. You can say that about a lot of his game. Hone it in haha. He could end up a Danny Green type if he makes the right improvements. But with like way better D.
Bro take Thompson out at this point how do you let Danny Green get rebounds over you
That had to be a makeup call for letting Danny  Green get intimate. What BS reffing tonight
Same with Danny green
Danny Green and Seth Curry aren’t in his way like Horford and Josh Richardson were last year too.
"*looks at flair* Ahh, right. To be fair Shaq and Chuck rarely call good players trash, it's just the bandwagon fans. I wouldn't be surprised if the Lakers' fans who sent Danny Green death threats were in fact LeBron fans who keep jumping teams (not hating on those fans but the love for LeBron vs the team has to be so one-sided for those letters to happen)"
Someone get Danny Green a map
"Honestly sick to death of this shit. The NBA has such a toxic environment around it. NBA fans always talk about how they're ""fans of the players"" but shit on every single one of them at any given point. Like, you're not a fan of the players you're a fan of the Kardashians and bring that drama shit to basketball. At the beginning of the season this sub was calling their old Golden Boy Luka fat and overhyped. Like some trash talk is expected in sports but fucking Danny Green got death threats for missing a shot.  It doesn't help like that guys like Shaq and Chuck perpetuate that shit and make fans think that's how you should treat the players."
"Don't see how anyone could think the Lakers defence was going to be much worse. Schroeder is one of the best POA defenders in the league with constant energy which replaces Bradley. Danny Green for West Matthews is like for like, and Gasol and Howard are very different defenders but both very effective."
"I mean if we wouldn't do it for harden why the hell would we do it for Beal?  I think the only trade sixers may make (in terms of a ""big trade) will be a package centered around Danny Green (because of his salary).   If i had to guess, i'd say the only ""big trade"" the sixers would make would be Danny Green + some of our deep bench guys (for salary) + 1 decent young prospect (Thybulle, Maxey, or Korkmaz) plus as many FRPs as we can stomach for the piece we need.   I think it'd be a similar trade like the Bucks made for Holiday. More picks than most thought he'd command, but worth it for the bucks.   My dream target is Lavine in that scenario but not sure bulls would bite/they could get better players offered.   This offer from sixers is all about the picks we include, not the players."
Danny green got us Dennis so I ain’t complaining
"You guys are resistant to trade anyone for a star, you think teams are gonna fuckin trade stars to you for Danny Green?  Put up or shut up. Gotta risk it for the biscuit. Gotta trade someone worth something"
Danny Green has 3
As a Lakers fan I have always liked Philly. With the addition of Danny Green and Howard they definitely have a shot at a championship this season. Nets are in the spotlight with all the big names but goddamn they've had so much drama in the last week or 2.
Really haven't considered the logistics of the trade - just threw the name out. I would presume Danny Green would be involved in the trade
Danny Green will always be undervalued by most fans. Defenses respect his shot a ton and he plays smart defense.
"Wb, Oubre, Danny green"
"Except when George Hill, JR Smith, Danny Green and the poor Morris brother decide to fuck him over"
I can't believe we gave Danny Green so much more money
"Bol bol, Danny green, Paul George: Am I a joke to you?"
"now that Danny green is gone, Dennis Schroder must become the target of lakers fans cyberbullying"
Danny green would like a word
Alright here's a list of guys from mid-majors that had at least decent careers.   Chris Kaman Central Michigan  Kevin Martin Western Carolina  Danny Granger New Mexico  Patrick Bryant Bradley  Paul Milsap Louisiana Tech  Rodney Stuckey Eastern Washington  Jason Smith Colorado State  Jason Thompson Rider University  Courtney Lee Western Kentucky  George Hill IUPUI  Steph Curry Davidson  Gordon Hayward Butler  Paul George Fresno State  Larry Sanders VCU  Jimmer Fredette BYU  Kawhi Leonard San Diego State  Kenneth Faried Morehead State  Norris Cole Cleveland State  Shelvin Mack Butler  Damian Lillard Weber State  Kyle O'Quinn Norfolk State  CJ McCollum Lehigh  Isaiah Canaan Murray State  James Ennis Cal State Long Beach  Cam Payne Murray State  Larry Nance Jr Wyoming  Richaun Holmes Bowling Green  Ja Morant Murray State  Obi Toppin Dayton
i'd take Klay  imagine replacing Danny Green with prime Klay in our team
"Back in the boobie gibson, jj hickson danny green on the bench days. Jj off a two gather would yam it on most"
The way that man went up for the ball and then wrestled Danny Green for a jump ball was just straight up tough
Danny Green
If I was playing in the NBA I’d be worried for my life. Hearing Danny Green talk about what other players went through is scary enough.
Indeed! The thought of that makes me enraged at Danny Green for some odd reason too.
Sixers have Thunder legend Danny Green
Based off last year:  1. Bogdan 2. Fournier 3. Caris Levert 4. Danny Green 5. Eric Gordon 6. Gary Harris
"He was hot shooting like 45%, then got injured and went cold shooting about 15%, then shot something in the 30-ish% in the bubble  Shot looks good, he’s just young and sometimes gets too antsy then tries to cut too much when he should just stand in the corner  Danny Green should honestly be the perfect mentor for him, Green apparently already said that Thybulle is way better than he was at his age"
"Simmons or Tobi would guard one of them, I'd say Tobi on KD and Simmons on Harden with Danny Green on Kyrie"
"Tier 1- (Levert, Bogdonvic, Fournier) Tier 2-(Gordon, Danny Green, Harris)"
"They still have shooters like crazy. Curry, Danny Green (looks regressed but still hits shots), Shake, Tobias looks better, and even the 2 rookies Maxey and (especially) Isaiah Joe can hit from 3. This team can go far even without a second shot-creator type player since they have so many shooters. If they try to double Joel, there will be someone open who will make you pay. If they don’t double, then who’s gonna stop Joel 1 on 1?"
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
1. Eric Gordon  2. Evan Fournier  3. Danny Green  4. Caris LeVert  5. Gary Harris  6. Bogdan Bogdanovic  Downvote me and tell me I’m wrong. I don’t care
Think the raptors could definitely get a better deal than one centered around getting a Danny Green rental back on the roster.
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
Danny Green i suppose
"Well your first problem is defining small forward. I'd probably rank them:  Harden, Beal, Mitchell, Booker, Jrue, CJ, Oladipo, Curry, Danny Green"
"Danny Green and Mike Scott to match salaries, one of Thybulle or Maxey, and a frp."
"Seth, Simmons, Tobias, Danny Green, and Dwight are way better than steph's supporting cast. Juan Toscano Anderson is our best center"
Almost FMVP Danny Green
Like last year and the year before.  The championship goes through Danny Green. lol
"His nickname was Josh Barkley in his rookie year. He has been an amazing rebounder from the get go. He will be a Danny Green type winner role player, hopefuly for you guys."
That was the danny green year.  Not sure what 3 records he is talking about but danny green was breaking all the finals 3 point records up to that game and would probably have been fmvp had ray allen not hit that shot.
My man Danny Green still laying those bricks for sixers     what a player will bring great defense tho guys
Danny green as well from the Cavs OP
Well 2020 also had Danny Green and Rondo
look at danny green
"Funniest Clippers fan fic I've ever read. Now do Gasol to Clippers for Pat Bev and Danny Green for Lou, Lowry and FVV for picks. And if course championship magnet Patrick McCaw for future considerations.  Put all those players on a team with Kawhi and Ibaka, man you've got a stew going."
"Funniest Clippers fan fic I've ever read. Now do Gasol to Clippers for Pat Bev and Danny Green for Lou, Lowry and FVV for picks. And if course championship magnet Patrick McCaw for future considerations.  Put all those players on a team with Kawhi, man you've got a stew going."
"Sixers has agreed to trade Danny Green and Matisse Thybulle to Toronto for Kyle Lowry and u/TopBeer3000, sources tell ESPN."
"The Lakers with 2 superstars won it all with a supporting cast with a ton of meh role players, what tells you the Nuggets can’t?  The Lakers had KCP, Danny Green, Kuzma, Dwight, Caruso, Rondo and Markieff.  The Nuggets (minus Murray and MPJ) has Barton, Morris, Millsap, Dozier, and Green. That’s not great but they would’ve have time to figure their depth out surely"
I still miss Danny Green
"""Draymond Green, Danny Green, shit even Green Goblin. Don't matter to me spurs in fo"""
"Practice, practice, practice.  The main point is being able to bring it to your shooting pocket quickly to start your shot. Doesn't matter if you catch it high, low, left or right, once you get your shooting motion from your pocket, its muscle memory at that point.  Just to add, there are also skilled passers who can hit shooters right where they want it (the shooting pocket). There was an old Danny Green video where he talks about it and being ready to catch it while in your stance. It allows you to be ready and not have to set yourself before going through the motion (so if Lamelo caught it lower, he doesnt have to spend that time bringing the ball down)."
This fake Danny Green is buggin me
Dillon Brooks looks like a chubby Danny Green
Maybe over Danny Green? I doubt it.
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
&amp;#x200B;  Brooks like a thicker Danny Green
"Unfortunately we only have one year of data for both these guys together, and unfortunately we keep moving the goalposts in this discussion. Danny Green was prioritized above Alex Caruso throughout the regular season and the vast majority of the playoffs - is that statement incorrect?   And two more notes: 1.	The playoffs are much more matchup dependent so of course there’s going to be some variance between series. 2.	The sentiment here was very low on Danny Green’s contract just last year, especially his perception by Lakers fans. If you’re going to argue that Talen Horton Tucker deserves 15M a year, there must be better evidence than Danny Green"
"From Philly - at best Danny Green, expirings, and a protected 1st or unprotected 2nds. We would definitely get outbid, as Lowry still has value, but the team is playing well enough to not go overboard on an offer. Can't go with unloading Shake/Thybulle/Maxey for an expiring vet contract."
"I’ve been talking about it around the thread, but you’d match salary with Danny Green(expiring) + filler (Scott + Poirer/Ferguson). For the actual assets/incentive, the pool we have available is 2 first round picks, Shake, Maxey, Thybulle, Korkmaz, and then a bunch of solid 2nds from other teams as sweeteners.   I don’t really know precisely what I’d offer (ideally Thybulle + 1st, but I don’t think that’s enough, Raps will and should push for Maxey) but Morey definitely has enough pieces there to offer something compelling if that’s a move they want to make."
"Okc didn’t get a prospect for cp3 however no offense to ty Jerome.  It was a 1st, decent expiring(oubre) and slightly negative contract(Rubio) which they turned along with 2 late 1sts into a bad expiring and a mid 1st.  Add on even though cp3s on a bad contract and older, he was a little better than Lowry is now and has 2 years left.  I read on realgm that a team that trades for Lowry can’t resign him now and that’s a huge deal.  Think raptors fans on here are asking for a bit too much looking for a first and a good prospect unless the other salary is bad.    I’m talking like Gary Harris as the bad contract Barton as expiring and a 1st and Denver still is only attaching like bol bol.  Realgm trade board(suggest people check it out) also threw out stuff like just Lowry for Drummond and a prospect/1st and rarely include maxey in any Danny green deal."
"I think for me personally, watching Schroeder play is great, but sometimes he's really hit or miss, almost like a PG version of Danny Green. I remember a stretch of games where i'd be watching him shoot 30%, and then his other games he's going perfect from the field. He's definitely a great defender though but idk if the big contract would be worth it, he'll be asking for 20/year probably."
"Pretty easy. Danny Green, Maxey, and picks"
"Sixers have solid young prospects, all their first round picks, and Danny Green on a 15M expiring"
Two 1sts for an expiring 35yo Lowry is excessive.   It'd be a three team trade: 76ers get Lowry; 3rd team gets Danny Green; Raptors get 76er's 1st &amp; 2nd and the third team's 2nd.
"So now the criteria is crunch time minutes? Look at their mpg for last season, Danny Green played ahead of Caruso"
"As a European fan it's quite hard to actually watch all the NBA games or teams since they only show selected national TV games I think for me so thanks for the heads up since I have limited access to actual game footage.       One point I'd like to add is that in contrast, Giannis who actually also is not the most talented shooter tries to integrate it into his game. I don't want to jump to any conclusions here but I think maybe playing alongside Joel and the current iteration of the sixers with their shooters in Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Danny Green gives Simmons faith that the space he creates will be used but also lets him rely on his team a bit too much on the offensive side? What I'm trying to say is that if Simmons would be able to at least score at a medium rate from jumpers or 3 pointers, he would be up in this tier of players who will be regularly in the MVP discussion as well as it would improve the chance of the sixers actually winning the title.      at least thats what Gianni's is trying to do I guess and he doesn't have a clear cut MVP candidate on his side. I know the comparison isn't entirely fair in terms of game impact or team environment but their lack of shooting touch is obviously a problem for both"
I don’t know why your surprised. Most of Bleacher Report’s trade articles are garbage. Like Beal to the Warriors for nothing but role players and the Timberwolves pick or Lavine for Thybulle and Danny Green.
danny green played behind caruso in crunch time minutes and made 15m a year exactly lol
At that point we might aswell just get Danny Green and Siakam and quickly move to Toronto while the Raptors are in Tampa
"As a raps fan I'd love anything with at least 2 if 3 of Maxey, Milton and thybulle. We can take Danny green for contract matching to"
"It would have to be Danny Green, Mike Scott, Ferguson, and Bradley to match salary and then probably 2 1sts or something. Or Maxey and a 1st maybe. I'm guessing the Raptors would ask for more draft capital than that but id be surprised if they could get that because so few contenders have a full stock of picks left."
"They don't really have a floor general without simmons. Milton is a great scorer, but he ain't running the offense. Still think they should trade danny green for harrison barnes."
"Not necessarily. The salary is made up with Danny Green and out of rotation guys (Scott, Poirer, Ferguson, etc) and then we’d only lose one other rotation guy in like whichever of Thybulle/Maxey/Shake would get included."
"Name me a team that has won a championship in the last 10 years that doesn’t have either of the following players: Danny Green, James Jones, Patrick McCaw.   These are the guys you need to max!"
good lord Danny Green going on a rodeo trip getting traded left and right
People have already run this through the trade machine. Danny Green or Seth Curry plus salary filler meets the match requirement. From there it’s a question of what young players/picks makes the deal work.
Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.  He would’ve personally delivered Jacob Poeltl in 1995 to make him a part of the package.
"Danny Green has gone multiple times in the past 2 championship runs where he was literally dropped from the starting lineup on both teams from being too icy on his three point shot, so I don't see that necessarily on the margin at this point. I think it's reasonable you could include Norm Powell in the deal with another first round pick and play him at the 3."
I don't think it that big of a problem. If you can turn Danny Green into a \~top 35-ish player in the league with late first round picks or young fringe rotational pieces you do that every time.
the problem for a potential sixers deal is theyd need to send Danny Green for salary matching purposes and hes super important for us.  Id still do it but maybe getting a third team in there that wants a free 2nd round pick would be better.
"I think wings can impact a ton if they play help defense, provide secondary rim protection etc.  But Kawhi didn't do that, he didn't need to do it, because he often played with 2 rim protectors + Danny Green who is/was a solid help defender for a wing.  Wing stopper get more important in a playoff series, against specific match ups. But that's why for example a guy like Robert Covington (before this year, he sucks this year) can be more ""valuable"" defensively in the regular season than guys who are way way way better than him on ball"
We can do 20 mill with just danny green and mike scott
Danny Green plus a bunch of salary filler I guess. Probably not super feasible
That will hundred percent be the asking price if discussions start with Philly. What else could they ask for? Danny Green + picks? That is not gonna move the needle much.
Bro you were a 3 seed with Jimmy and Redick and a fucking 6 seed last year. You’re trash. Can’t get out of the 2nd round and Jimmy did it on his own. Sixers will always be bums and Danny Green + Seth Curry ain’t changing that.
"&gt; Stanley Johnson  You mean the guy averaging 3 points per game for a below .500 team who has a total of 20 postseason minutes since his rookie season?  &gt; Danny Green  He showed a shot pretty early. He shot 37% from 3 his second season, and then 44% in year 3.  &gt; KCP  In years 2-4, he shot 34% from 3 and averaged 13.7 ppg. Ntilikina's best season saw 32% and 6.4 points.  Frank is nowhere near where Green and KCP were after 3 years in the league. And Johnson hasn't exactly been a stellar role player."
Don't forget Patty Mills and Danny Green.
Danny Green is a winning culture
"Notable players you forgot for the Suns were Leandro Barbosa, Stromile Swift, Matt Barnes, and Robin Lopez.  Notable players you forgot for the Spurs were Boris Diaw, Danny Green, and Patty Mills."
damn bron why u passing it to danny green
Danny green jumped into Klay in behind twice while he was airborne and he’s been out for almost 2 years now. The league needs to do something to protect the players.
"Yeah and then last season to make the perfect play to set up a game winner but Danny Green bricks the wide open shot. As much as people complain he needed ""ray allen"" or ""kyrie"" shots to save his legacy, there were plenty of other chances for someone to be the hero and they failed lol"
"2 seasons ago we lost Kawhi and Danny Green, this season we lost Ibaka and Gasol. That's 3 out of 5 starters and our 6th man.  ""Tampa"" isn't our excuse."
KCP started the season as an elite 3pt shooter and then turned into discount Danny Green. For real tho - his decline in the last 2 - 3 weeks is very noticeable and concerning.
Lakers won the chip without anyone excelling at this role. The guy they brought in Danny Green was ice cold ....very dependant on play style .
It’s like saying the Cavs should’ve started Danny Green in 2010. He wasn’t the player he is now

Hope somebody else remembers and updates us."
"i mean being a 3-and-d guy doesn’t really make you a two way player, unless you wanna say danny green is a two way player. if they can barely create their own offence it’s hard to even call them one of the best offensive players, let alone discuss if they are a two way wing"
That's the Playoffs Danny Green special right there.
THT gives me some Playoff Danny Green vibe. Gets the ball at the three point line and proceeds to drive into the paint.
Danny Green and Dwight were with the Lakers and Seth with the Mavs. Their new guys got less rest.  Lakers got a bunch of new guys too. Heat retained most I believe.   Also Heat played 22.
wes matthews is not a nba rotation player. Lakers really miss Danny Green
Is Wes Matthews the new Danny Green?
I think most people don't consider Klay elite defensively because he's not a very good team defender. I guess prime Danny Green fits that criteria though.
Klay and Danny Green when he's having those seasons where he shoots above 40% from 3. Klay is pretty much the star version of this role.
Danny Green has mostly been terrible on defense with Philly...Lakers lost nothing
"Hot take: I have the Jazz at a higher probability to win it all than the Nets.  Danny Green as it turns out wasn't a major loss for the Lakers, but at the least is a decent gain for the Sixers. Philly needed a guy like him more than LA.  Milwaukee did a 180 on their ""depth plus superstar"" roster approach and are kinda paying for it, never mind the fact that Coach Bud's inability to adjust in the playoffs was their undoing."
The main difference is he can take more pull up trigger threes and he's more decisive with the ball in his hands. Also he now plays the 4 and with seth curry and Danny Green instead of al Horford and josh Richardson. I think that's bigger for tobi.
"IMO one big thing the NBA needs to clean up is fouls on and after dunk attempts. People get seriously injured from silly contests on dunks, and nobody talks about it. Klay's never been the same since Danny Green pushed him sideways on a dunk in the Finals.   In soccer that same type of foul is a red card, in football it's targeting, in baseball it's an ejection, in basketball it's not even a technical for some reason.  What's infuriating is the NBA has clear path violations and they don't use them hardly ever. It should be that if you're not between the dunker and the hoop and they go up and you foul them, you're ejected with a suspension. These guys need to be protected from hits from behind or the side while they're flying through the air at full speed.   And then after the play why is it okay for a guy to be under the guy landing on a dunk, but not on a 3 pointer? Like JV is in the RESTRICTED area and takes offense, what a joke."
"Nonstop cycle. I removed just last season Laker fans complained until their way to a championship. Everyone outside of Lebron, AD and strangely Alex Caruso were traded, cut and dumped on, on social media by their fan base. I think Danny Green actually received death threats at one point"
"I don’t think we’d necessarily be limiting our window by trading for Lowry. We’d be able to sign him after this season with his bird rights. Lowry is 34, but I think his game will age pretty well.   I think he absolutely solves big issues for us. He’s much better at defending guards than Green, which we’ll badly need to beat the Nets. He provides more spacing that Green does, and as I said before he’s a pick and roll ball handler who can shoot.  I think he significantly increases our chances at winning the next couple years, and the cost would be something like Danny, a pick and a young player. To me, that’s a good deal."
lol it’s so funny.  I wonder what other team would be interested in Oladipo.  I wonder if Lakers would do a Schroeder and Dipo swap.  Or Sixers would do Danny Green and Thybulle for Oladipo
Danny Green and A 2nd.
"We do, but we also got rid of Rondo, Dwight, McGee, Danny Green, Bradley, and Cook.  Our new additions include Schroder, Marc, Trez, Wes, and THT(well apart of the rotation). That's helped a lot as they're not on as tired of legs as the rest."
Harden puts elite numbers on everyone. Kawhi and Roberson at least gave him problems. Danny Green a few years back too.
"Yet some of our fans will still think Chicago is going to trade him to us for Danny Green, Mike Scott and a poo poo platter of late firsts."
please take Danny green out
wtf is Danny green doing
"I've posted versions of this before, but it's always worth a re-visit.    There's [3 or 4 moments](https://www.magicalquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Colossus.jpg) that really define the Cavs fuck-ups with Lebron 1.0  **1\. Drafting Luke Jackson:** The only lottery pick we got during the Lebron 1.0 years.  Really it was a prescient pick for the fit with Lebron, realizing a big with 3-point range would be great, but dude's back was never healthy and he ended up being a bust.  Cavs were 1 pick short of pairing Iggy and Lebron and having a lockdown defense and dunkfest for years to come, but oh well.  A fun fact, we were also 8 picks ahead of where JR Smith went, so we also missed on what could have been a decade of [this](https://imgur.com/JsP53nF)  **2\. Handshake deal with Boozer:** FO got absolutely bamboozled/maliciously fucked over by Boozer and the Jazz, depending on whose position you want to be sympathetic to (personally I'm always in favor a guy getting paid).  But we lost a great young player for nothing; a guy that would have been a great 2nd option to Lebron and who played at a fringe all-star level (20 and 10) for the next decade.  So those first two were really it for decent draft assets and young players.  Sure, they didn't do anything else much in the draft, but the best pick they had during that tenure was 19, and J.J. Hickson was ok for a 19th pick.   Varejao ended up with a great career for a 30th pick.  Shannon Brown (25th) ended up a role player on championship teams in LA too, and Boobie Gibson was way better than most 42nd picks.  But Lebron was just too good for us to have good draft assets, and we were too impatient (and likely poorly coached) to let young talent develop.  And as an aside, I enjoy the irony that Danny Green was an obviously good fit next to Lebron last year on a championship team, since the Cavs drafted him the year before Lebron left.  But oh well, on to #3 &amp; 4  **3 &amp; 4\. Not signing good players &amp; panic-signing Larry Hughes:** This was the biggest and worst reason that played out over a couple of years.  We realized Lebron was amazing and that we needed to get Lebron help.  We identified that a shooting guard with an elite shot who could create off the dribble would be ideal pairing.  We pursued Ray Allen, didn't get him.  Next year we pursued Michael Redd, didn't get him.  Both those guys would have been amazing.  Then, management apparently preferred a warm body over signing nobody 2 years in a row, so we ended up with Larry Hughes, who was nominally the same position (SG) as the other two, but in reality couldn't shoot for shit and was a terrible fit with Lebron.  Our contracts were then fucked for the next five years, and Lebron left before we could unfuck them.  A lot of the rest that gets memed - Big Ben, Antawn, Old Shaq, Mo Williams, etc. - was bad.  Like, really bad.  But at that point it was just trying to flip our trash for slightly better trash while being limited by the cap and luxury tax.  The lack of any young talent through the draft and the Hughes signing was what fucked it all up for years to come.  There's some alternative universe out there where we were even semi-lucky and/or semi-competent and got Nike's puppet finals with Lebron/Allen(or Redd)/Boozer against Kobe/Pau/Odom.  Would have been a hell of thing to see."
We’ll just take... your entire roster for him minus Danny Green. Deal???
wtf was that Danny Green?
Who did he used to do the James Bond handshake with on the Lakers?  Danny Green?  Loved that one.
"He's exceptional, if he could maintain his streaky 3 point shooting he'd be peak Danny Green."
"I'm not even sure yet if that's better than Magic-Kareem-Worthy or Bird-McHale-Parrish ... hard to compare with the game and rules so different.  And not just on the court - those guys had better supporting casts too.  The Nets sure don't have anything like Byron Scott + AC Green + Michael Cooper + Mychal Thompson, or Dennis Johnson + Danny Ainge + Bill Walton.  You just can't build a full roster like that in the modern era, although the Warriors came closest with the salary cap oddity."
Okay  What's the difference between 58* and 57?  Clearly regular season win totals don't mean shit. But the bulk of that warriors team already won a ring the Raptors besides Kawhi and Danny Green did not. All things considered that's the difference.
"As a fan, no, but objectively it would probably make us title favourites. And the gap between Dame and Giannis is much less than DeMar and Kawhi (+ Danny Green). The raptors knew they were never going anywhere with DeMar, that's not the situation with the Blazers. Whether or not people agree, the team does think they can win a championship with this core"
"Draymond spoke for a little over 2 minutes and not once did he ask for a rule change. What he’s asking for is that front offices across the league get their shit together. Danny Green went on JJ Redick’s podcast and praised the Lakers for how  they handled his trade this past offseason, and Quinn Cook had similar remarks about being waved by them. You misconstrued Draymond’s very first sentence, where he talks about seeing Andre Drummond begin his pre-game warmup then return from the locker room in street clothes because he had only just then been informed that he was being held out.   I think Draymond stumbled a bit when he brought up Harden because the heat Harden took was less about his trade request and more about the fact that the organization bent over backwards to put a winning team around him, shuffling in one all star after another and constructing the roster specifically around his offensive talents, all for him to say “we’re not good enough” when the reality is that he’s been underachieving. But even then, the fallout from his trade request was something Houston’s FO anticipated. The GM was quoted as having said “We’re prepared for things to get uncomfortable” and that’s what happened.   Draymond overall point is that there’s a right way to do these things, and when an organization fumbles away a player’s prime years-or even when they don’t and they just wanna trade that player for whatever reason there’s a way to go about it. When Harrison Barnes was traded mid game LeBron spoke up about it that very night on Twitter. There was no reason the team’s broadcasting crew should know before the player. Maybe you call that player before he leaves for the game and tell him he’s being held out because you’re close on a trade? Maybe you tell DeMarcus Cousins before he leaves town for AS Weekend and that you’re working towards trading him and hope to have something done by the weekend? There’s a right way to do this sort of thing and that’s what separates first class organizations from the rest of the pack. That’s what Draymond was talking about."
You have tobias Harris and danny green 💀💀 cant wait for when you get second rounded again
Honestly might have when we had Danny Green last year lol
Danny Green is very much alive and playing for the Sixers. You’re thinking of Dennis.
RIP DANNY GREEN
"I mean you’d be getting Danny Green and Shake to fill out your shooting guards, with Shake already probably being better than Seth and having a lot more potential than him.   Yeah you got some big contracts already but with the exception of Lowry they’re all with guys who are in their mid 20s, which Shake is a little younger than that so he’d fit. If I thought Seth was better than Shake I’d agree with you for sure, but watch some of Shakes highlights and I think you’ll come around.   Tyrese is still very young though and shows flashes, so with what you’re saying I don’t think he makes much sense but Shake definitely does. I would really hate to see either of them go but gotta give some to get some"
Danny Green obv
"But seriously, we need more shooting. We should package Danny Green and Mike Scott for salary purposes, that’s $21M, which could get you a player who makes up to $26M due to salary matching rules. So who can we get if we send a FRP out? Obviously it matters if that pick is in the next year or two or 2027. A lot of Sixer fans want a shooting big like Bjelica, which would be good for the bench obviously. But personally I feel the biggest upgrade for the team would be a shooting wing to replace Danny Green. In the playoffs, the starters are gonna be playing 38-39mpg. I don’t think a bench upgrade is make or break.   Who do you think we should get, assuming you agree with my premise?"
Danny Green has been pulling of the biggest heist n NBA history. Idk how this man stays employed. Great guy tho!
I think you put Danny Green in there instead of Wade/Lowry/Dame.  I have a feeling lowry is either going to be a coach or he’ll disappear &amp; spend time with his kids that he’s missed because of playing.  Danny Green is a pretty funny dude &amp; wants a career in media after he’s done
Danny green
fuck danny green
Danny Green retired a few championships ago.
Get Danny Green the fuck out of here
"Yeah I agree, now if only the rest of the team stepped up a little. It's Tobias, Ben, Joel, and Howard doing most of the heavy lifting. Seth is hit or miss and danny green doesn't seem to be doing much either."
"move over danny green and thon maker, there is a new cardio king in town"
"Danny Green is a corpse these days. His defense isn’t good enough anymore, he’s still an ok shooter. Decent chance he gets traded"
Damn! That really is a bummer. What are your thoughts on Danny Green? Are the amount of mins he gets a net positive?
Is that really what you choose to believe? Lol that’s actually tragic. Okay buddy good luck in the playoffs this year against a real offense that can make 3’s whenever they want. I’m sure Ben is an outstanding shooter but he just chooses not to do it because kicking it out to Danny green is a winning play.
His 42 points were an effort to fight off Danny Green 3 pointers
danny green airballing a three in the fourth quarter is the first thing I saw when I started to watch the game.
We had 40 minutes of Furkan and Danny Green combining to go 1-11 for 3 points in 40 points. Ben Simmons had a phenomenal game and you are judging him because you don’t like him and set him to some ridiculous standard. How come Beal isn’t judged when he stops big points and loses games? His teammates are blamed.
Danny Green is so lucky this game wasn’t on national TV
The sixers need to waive Danny green
What is Doc thinking? The 2-3 zone worked the other because Matisse was at the top. Danny green is way to slow for that
Danny green has more airballs than field goals
Danny green is garbage stacked on top of garbage
Danny Green second airball
Danny green is soo damn trash
Philly messed up going to Danny Green.
danny green hits his first 3 in a year and a half and immediate heat check
"I like when Danny green hits one, just means he’s confident to miss the next 3"
Danny green and rondo got their chips then just said peace out
Sounds like a solid Danny Green performance
Danny green has been horrible tonight
If you had to get pegged by someone on the opposing team who would you pick? I think Danny green would be gentle
Danny green is so freaking slow. Watching him try to defend speedy guards has been a nightmare
Danny Green cannot guard a high school player
Danny Green is not good
I dislike Danny Green
Lol Danny Green is the most well known JAG in the league. I haven't seen him have a good game in years.
If Danny Green wasn’t good at defense there’s a real possibility he’d be out the league
W I D E open. Thought he drained it. Saw his reaction. Had to check the stats. WELCOME TO THE DANNY GREEN EXPERIENCE
What the hell was that sequence by the Jazz?  Only topped by a Danny Green airball lol
Is Danny Green playing?
We need to take more threes. We have fucking seth curry and danny green and we have god damn furkan korkmaz shooting mid ranges off the dribble
"https://lakersnation.com/danny-green-critical-of-bandwagon-los-angeles-lakers-fans/2020/09/04/  https://www.talkbasket.net/60890-orlando-magic-roasts-los-angeles-lakers-bandwagon-fans  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2605412-bandwagon-fan-puts-on-warriors-jersey-over-his-lakers-jersey-during-game  Here's 3, if you're actually saying that it's not a known joke that half the Lakers fanbase are LeBron fans/bandwagoners that come out of hiding whenever the Lakers are good you're kidding yourself"
Sixers are gonna need Seth Curry and Danny Green to get smoking hot to stand a chance in this one.
"Nope, just watching the Lakers since ya'all on damn tv all the time. You lost McGee, Dwight, Danny Green, and Rondo. Sure ya'all replaced those guys with other players but with shorter guys with less wingspan. The Lakers length is what propelled them over so many teams last year. This year they're struggling to beat average teams without AD. Losing to the Pistons and going to so many OT games that should be blowouts.  The Lakers aren't that scary this year."
"Between Danny Green, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Tony Bradley &amp; Vincent Poirier, the Sixers have enough expiring salary to take back $38.1M, Lowry's only getting $30M  Those guys aren't particularly great assets but the salary can be made to work and draft capital can be included"
"My guy you apparently want Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Mike Scott and picks for Kyle Lowry on an expiring with the hope that he will take a discount to resign.   You can take that nonsense elsewhere."
"he’s gotten better defensively on the ball this year, still needs to add weight to be able to switch onto bigger wings. but he’s pretty close to already being an elite impact defender  i actually believe he can be more than roberson on offense, he’s shown flashes of being able to at least play the danny green role on that end. he’s willing to shoot for the most part and he can get hot. he’s gotten incrementally better at finishing/putting it on the deck since the start of last year but he’s still well below average  right now he’s a defensive weapon who is hard to play for more than like 15-20 minutes in a game"
There’s no way we trade Danny Green and I don’t think the Sixers will extend Lowry at the price he would be asking for.
"That’s a stupid idea, if a streaky shooter like Luka gets going, he’ll start making all of his shots. He gets into rhythms by seeing the ball go in the basket. That’s why even tho ppl like Danny green and RoCo are streaky asl, teams will still run em off the 3 point line hoping they don’t shoot it."
"Definitely starts over Danny green. Powell has been much better than DG the last two years. I have Powell and Tobias as similar level players, he would fit very well playing off of embiid/simmons."
"Nope.  Without Tobias or Lowry they’ll have just over 80m on the books for next year. Cap is 109m. So they have 30m and the MLE to fill out the entire roster   That’s with only Ben and Joel. Seth curry and their rookie contracts  Lowry would need to be signed again, obviously not to 30m a year but he’s not taking some 10m deal either. So let’s say you have 20m in cap space, which looks like the absolute best case. That’s nothing   So no you’re wrong.   The 6ers best case is to trade for Lowry using Danny green as their main salary piece. Include picks and young guys as needed   Danny, TFerg, Scott and the Horford TE will work salary wise. Obviously there are pretty much no assets in this trade yet. So it’s gonna take Maxey/Thybulle/picks to get the Raptors to agree   The 6ers will be in the salary hell. But that’s the absolute best their team can be."
"This is a concern, but is far down on the list. We need to upgrade from Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Korkmaz to have a real chance. Shake and Maxey can cover the gaps in PG minutes. We've stopped iniating ball movement from Embiid in the post, where we were getting great hocky-assist perimeter looks off him being doubled.   Lowry feels like a pipe dream, or something we'll end up massively overpaying for."
Danny Green was great for the locker room
"Danny Green, Mike Scott, T-ferg, and a pick would work"
"Gonna be a Danny Green or Igoudala situation with one of their shooters going off for 20ppg on 40% 3pt shooting.  With how much the game has changed towards high volume 3 point shooting, and the fact that the finals MVP is a 4-7 game sample size where anyone can get on a hot streak, I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these random role player FMVPs."
"Shipped him off (along with Collins) for Adebayo, Joe Harris, and Danny Green shortly after the Allen trade. I’ve won every week since."
"The 2019 offseason we opened up about 40M of cap room for Kemba and/or Danny Green. We got nobody so we resigned all of our UFA (Dwight Powell) and RFAs (KP, Kleber, DFS) to go over the cap and used the trade exception from the Harrison Barnes deal to ship two 2nd round picks for a sign and trade Delon Wright. Seth Curry signed via MLE, Boban BAE. Later on in the season we used more of that TPE to trade another 2nd pick for Cauley-Stein who didn't play in the bubble and was later resigned. We let the remaining exception which was still around 10M expire.  Then we traded Delon Wright and Justin Jackson and one or two more 2nd picks for James Johnson lol.  Our draft picks this year aren't looking too great so now idk what the front office is gonna do. This is the last offseason coming up before Luka signs his big ass extension."
"While I disagree with the guy you responded to, I also think it’s unfair to compare big, dominant centers to 3 and D players. One is that it’s not just post ups that made these centers memorable, but rather that their games were really good as a whole. Also, aside from the fact that the Shaq’s and the Hakeem’s were superstars whereas 3 and D guys such as Danny Green or Iguodala are role players, for every dominant post up threat there are also a whole lot of centers that failed to become good post up threats. It’s just that dominant centers have been here since 1949 approx. while 3 and D guys have only been this popular since 2007 ish."

I am now open to trading Danny Green
"the only reason it is got back under 10 pts is because of the refs, they are just trash in general.    how you have not won with 6 v 4 any time danny green is on the court..  what is he doing."
Jesus Christ Danny Green
Danny Green should be allowed to spot up shoot and spot up shoot only
What the fuck is Danny green doing?
always have time for danny green
id love to know why Danny green is in
"Good court vision, his head is facing Danny Green so he freezes Norman Powell."
"Good court vision, his head is facing Danny Green so he freezes Norman Powell."
It worked 2 days ago. Literally triple team Embiid and hope Danny Green is icy
the only reason your franchise won a title is because danny green made a dangerous play and tore Klay's ACL.  that was after ya'll cheered for KD tearing his achilles.  sit down.
LOL Danny green is a sleeper agent. This man just threw us the ball.
Sleeper agent Danny Green still active
"Spurs,Raptors,Lakers snd and sixers fans all have flashbacks of danny green doing something like that.  It’s tradition at this point."
Danny green should never dribble
Live by the danny green die by the danny green...
Probably something involving a big man to Toronto. Maybe Drummond and picks to Toronto but idk. It’s actually pretty easy to match with Green and Scott but losing a wing shooter like Danny is less than ideal I guess
Sixers or jazz. Sixers for Danny Green and I like Embiid. Jazz have been making good decisions for a while and did amazing with the draft getting Gobert and Mitchell. Conley is a cool guy too.
"Duncan, Bowen, Kawhi, Danny Green, Mills. We probably can't out shoot you. But i wish you good luck against this defense."
76ers.  I love Seth Curry and think it would funny if Danny Green won his third ring in a row before even receiving the other two.
"To be fair, he learned from Danny Green"
It physically pains me to watch Danny Green play basketball
"No way Morey is giving up Maxey if he was the piece that stopped the 6ers from trading for Harden.  Green for Eric Gordon would be a good trade for Philly if they are down on Danny though. Not sure what else they would have to throw in (prospect? pick?), but Morey obviously loves the guy and he is playing at a really high level."
"Need scoring from the bench and to get rid of Danny Green if possible, his only reedemign quality was his defense and it has fallen off a cliff. Something like Terry Rozier or Lowry would be lovely, idc if we'd have to give Maxey and picks"
"Having watched every single Laker game, Schroder and Harrell are literally the main problems on the team.    Schroder's refusal to come off the bench as a 6th man has hurt this team a lot. The starting lineup has gone from a lineup that had two spot up shooters in KCP and Danny Green, which was our championship formula last season, to a lineup that only has one spot up shooter in KCP. Schroder is a terrible three point shooter, which offsets the three point shooting that Marc Gasol brings. Schroder also steals shots from LeBron and AD. Schroder is a role player who thinks he is a superstar on this team, and does not play winning basketball.   Harrell is an undersized liability. He struggles to defend real bigs, score against real bigs, and rebound against anyone. He is simply too short. Harrell singlehandedly turned our size advantage, which was a strength last season, to a huge weakness this season. He simply does not fit on the team."
"&gt;You can keep coping but so far all the issues that I expressed about the team have born fruit.  Well, I guess I would 'cope' if that were true and you actually elaborated on why they were all bad moves, but you haven't. I mean, I don't know what else to say.  You just keep acting as if you've been a soothsayer in regard to all our problems for the past year+ but you've been wrong on a lotta things, including on things so far this year. Like Schroeder being a worse asset than Danny Green who shot terribly at the worst times &amp; got blown by defensively all the time.   Trading for Schroeder was the right move (not 'awful'); extending him right now and not exploring benching him when he comes back would make it a so-so move.  It seems like you're a contrarian just for the sake of it."
"Live by Danny green, die by Danny green"
Best we can do is one slightly used Danny Green. 2 second round picks and one mint condition Gritty T-shirt
Major what if for raps fans. Tough to say whether Freddy and norm make the same improvements last year  with Danny Green still around eating minutes. Siakam and gasol both weren't the same last year either. Still a super deep squad with defense built for playoffs.
"Embiid is having an MVP caliber season, if the Sixers can create some separation in the east and steamroll the playoffs its worth it to push in the chips in exchange for Danny Green, some prospects and a pick or two.  Also Morey is the kind of guy to make that trade."
Wesley Matthews is the worst player in the NBA this year  I never thought I’d miss Danny green
Danny Green been winning for the last 8 years...   Interesting.
"Draymond has accolades outside of just championship rings, whereas Derek Fisher and Danny Green (except for 1 All-Defense selection) do not.  DPOY, 5x All-Defensive Team, 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, 1 Olympic Gold Medal"
So does Danny Green  Although I personally think Draymond belongs in the hall of fame considering his all star appearances and DPOY awards plus an Olympic gold medal  Just saying rings aren’t the only argument
Don't remember the stats but did Danny Green have a case? He was on fire and set the Finals 3pt record at the time
You mean getting ridiculed for playing the right plays at the crunch time? Dude got clowned for passing to Danny Green when it was the absolute right play
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
"Not seeing it.     We already have FVV/Norm Powell/Matt Flynn/Matt Thomas     you sayin we gonna add Danny Green, and Maxey to our two guard rotation but still manage to leave a giant donut at C? Then we add Mike Scott to play behind Boucher who is already our second string 4?"
"""we just beat you but here's our best asset and what do we want back? oh don't worry about it just send us thybulle and danny green""     lol FOH they better find a way to acqurie us Vuc or we out this bih and Canada's ass is staying in Tampa and only visiting home for 7 games in the second round."
fact: the raptors have never won a championship without danny green
No argument here. Lowry has long been my favorite player in the NBA. But this thread is about trading him to Philly and I find it weird that no one thinks Lowry is worth arguably the best asset the sixers have. This is a *pro*-Lowry argument! Lowry for a washed Danny Green and a potentially-eventually-good Maxey feels like a steal for Philly to me
"What if it was 3-team trade?     Toronto Receives: Vucevic   Philadelphia Receives: Lowry   Orlando Receives: Danny Green, Mike Scott, Thybulle, Maxey + 1 or 2 firsts"
"Embiid and Simmons don't have chronic injurys, I'm so tired of hearing how they're going to fall off a cliff any minute. They're not under all that much pressure when were healthy. We have like 2 losses on the year when were healthy. There's basically one open spot in the rotation off the bench, our starters are fine. We score and defend at a high level. If Lowry were under contract and 32 it would be one thing. He's going to be a 35 year old FA. Raptors should've traded him last off-season if they wanted a serious return. It wouldn't even be just one of our young guys, it would have to include danny green so you're really just back at square one with a bench lacking firepower."
"I love Lowry but Embiid is 26 and Simmons is 24 we could be in contention for the next 6-7 years if we continue to build depth around these guys. To do that though you need to retain and develop our picks.   I just can't give up Shake, Maxey, or Thybulle for a 34 year old Lowry. Like Thybulle could easily replace Danny Green as a starter next year. Maxey's statistical profile ironically mirrors a young Lowry. Maxey isn't quite ready for the rotation yet but I'm projecting him to be a starter in this league and I think like lowry he has the tools to become a good 3 pt shooter and for a guard he doesn't really have any other holes in his game. I think he'd be playing better if we didn't have Dwight packing the paint.   Shake is actually already valuable for us. He's also hit a wall but how many combo guards with 7 foot wingspans and all around skill set are actually out there? Not many. Shake has also been defending at a high level and whereas in the past he's excelled shooting it and struggled getting to the rim, this year he's been excelling getting to the rim and struggling shooting it. So the best version of Shake probably hasn't been seen yet.   I think we should bring in a stretch 5 maybe Demarcus Cousins and trade for Jabari Parker. High end stuff, Otto Porter and Evan Fournier.   The most disappointing part of our roster has been the dead weight we're carrying in Tony Bradley, Poirier, and Terrance Ferguson. Those guys just bring nothing to the table. It makes no sense we're just keeping them when there's no chance of them playing or ever being useful."
and raptors legend danny green
"Lowry - Curry - Simmons - Harris - Embiid would be an insane line up, three legit ball handlers and a lot of spacing for Simmons to work with.   You’d have to rotate the first three guys around during the game to make sure one stays on, and you’re probably thin on the bench for the remainder of the year.   Maxey, Danny Green (salary), idk who else they can use as salary unless it’s Tobias for Lowry in some shape."
"Danny green, mike Scott, Maxey, and Porier for Lowry. Could also throw mike Scott to they thunder, tag a pick with it, and get muscala"
"I have to lean Philly. The Nets have nobody to stop Embiid from scoring, and Embiid in the paint and Simmons on the perimeter is about as good as it gets for slowing down the Nets offense. Other guys like Danny Green, Harris, and Curry can help keep up with the Nets offense, too. The Bucks, on the other hand, have great defenders in Holiday, Middleton, Giannis, and Lopez, but their defensive scheme often allows for too many open threes. Giving a team with KD, Harden, Kyrie, and Joe Harris open threes is not good. The Nets don't have anyone to stop Giannis, of course, but three is more than two and that has often been the issue for the Bucks."
Lakers don’t have the same pieces that made them lethal on defense.   Sixers have a DPOY level center in Embiid with probably the best perimeter defender in Simmons.  The Lakers have one of these pieces.    Danny Green has shown up every year in the playoffs defending great players.
Danny Green went +18 wow
"Yeah. Got cold at the wrong time. I, for one, still enjoyed my Danny Green experience."
"Based on the fact that Danny Green instantly did the T sign, I'm guessing Harden swore at the ref there  which is understandable because they 100% missed the call, but still, they didn't T him up for not passing the ball."
"Danny Green was solid as hell for us, and you know it."
"I don’t know if it’s possible contract wise without   Danny green, he makes like 18.  The staggering helps but I think the defensive dropoff would still  matter.    Also shake might be decent enough to be the scorer off the bench in that Crawford/Lou role that doc loves."
He's following the Danny Green player mold with potential to be better.
"It was a tough battle, but Danny Green pulled through for the raptors tonight"
"Shout out to Danny Green, he's been terrible against us every game since he left for LA"
Danny Green really can’t stop catching strays lmfao
"I blinked, when did Danny Green get back in the game"
NO!! Why did Danny Green have to foul out man 😔
Danny Green wants out
Nice to see Danny Green still playing for the Raptors
"raptors fan here, thank god for Danny Green"
Danny Green never stopped playing for the raps.
Danny Green is garbage
Danny green is +27 so far tonight in only 20 minutes of playing time
Why is Danny Green credited with 5 steals lol
God damn Danny green and his elite transition defence
Danny Green is feeling himself. He’s showing off his new ring to his old teammates.
I have NEVER seen Danny Green yank the ball out of someone's hands like that.
"I would rather have danny green, there is a reason that he has been starting on the last 2 championship teams, his play actually contributes to winning games. Kemba is washed, and he's an inefficient chucker making over $30m, he can't play defense and his only redeeming quality (shooting) has fallen off a cliff. Nobody would go into the luxury tax to get kemba on their team"
"Kemba is still better return than Danny Green and giving up future first, high second and Micic. And a better player this season too. Overpaid but Sixers wouldnt have any cap space either way."
Successor to Danny Green
"So if the Knicks got into it then less would have to be given with Horford. Getting Danny Green would be good, but at best is a late first.  So that’s less than a 2025 first for Horford (though maybe those players moved in the deal are worth something, I don’t particularly know them), and whatever you could flip Green for.  That’s all able to be done by keeping open one slot, and is nowhere near “5 first rounders”, the amount teams get paid to take bad contracts has gone down steadily.  All that said, the Knicks still should have kept at least 25-30 open for those sorts of deals, but they did flip Morris, which was a good bit of business."
Is Danny Green the 6th man?
Philly had contracts to give and firsts. We gave away Danny Green. Etc. With 70 Mil of cap space do you honestly think 1 first rounder was the best they could do? Because I don't.
take the knicks out of the deal and u can send both lowry and beal to the sixers by adding danny green and a couple of their 3rd stringers to salary match
Danny Green is not worth a 1st; I wish.
"Yeah it's tough to say. Earlier in the season when they were still struggling I would definitely say you could grab him for cheap. Now they're back to playing decently well and he might not be on the table anymore.    &gt;I’d say Maxey + a good FRP and the Knicks 2021 2nd.  Danny Green can be flipped for that 1st as we've seen. He's an easy guy to trade off to another contender, so I think even a retooling Toronto would value him."
You are kidding right? That would be like Lakers retiring Danny Green.
"How does Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green and like 5 late firsts sound?  Irresistible, I know"
"How is my take ignorant? There are amazing players who did not win championships because they were on crappy teams or were up against unbeatable dynasties. There are mediocre players who have hands full of rings. The number of championships won is irrelevant to a best player at a position list unless that player was a one man band leading his team to a championship, something that has happened only a handful of times.   Kawhi Leonard, while being a driving force for Toronto was hardly alone on that team. They had 6 guys average double figures on that team. Siakam, Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka, and Danny Green were all awesome defensive players who helped Kawhi carry the load offensively as well.   I am not looking only at offense, but being able to consistently put up points for a long period of time is important. Kawhi will be on my list someday if he keeps up the good work. He isn’t there yet. Make your own damn list if you want to ride his dick so bad."
"But like... by some of the advanced metrics that try to measure defense, Jokic doesnt rate out that much worse than Embiid. DBPM he's quite high for instance, among others. He gets a ton of steals for a center which is arguably more valuable than blocks since blocks dont necessarily result in a change of possession.   I'm just saying, the idea that Jokic is a bad or awful defender is just flat out false. He's a solid defender who struggles with one VERY specific matchup type that even guys like Rudy Gobert sometimes struggle to shut off. Furthermore - I'd wager that Jokic's defensive stats would look even better if he was playing with Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, and so on. Jokic's supporting cast is extremely light on guys who can defend, let alone on the most important kind of defenders in today's NBA - wing/perimeter defenders."
"That Danny Green would've won Finals MVP in 2013.   The league did took the media vote tally towards the end of game 6 before the Ray Allen shot, and those ballots came out to what would've been Tim Duncan's 4th fmvp."
danny green game 5 comes to mind * *faints* *
You guys need sharpshooter Danny Green
Lebron getting nam flashbacks of the Danny green miss
Now I know what having Danny Green last season in the playoffs felt like.
Open looks threes by shooters in infinitely better than your superficial 2k takeover bullshit. I bet you're the type of person who believed that LeBron shouldn't have kicked it back to Danny Green.
This felt a lot like the Danny Green brick in the Finals. LeBron made the *right* play but really should’ve taken the final shot.
"Wes ""Danny 'Icy Hot' Green"" Matthews"
"No Danny Green, no rondo, no Howard. Schruder out and AD out.   Bad roster decisions and injuries."
I mean you beat Embiid without Simmons so I wouldn't take too much stock in it. The Nets have a shot but it's not warriors level stuff. The question is if you'd rather have Embiid guarded by DJ or Kyrie/Harden/KD guarded by Simmons/Thybulle/Danny Green with Embiid in the middle. I'd probably take the 76ers there but we'll have to see.
"Watching him play this season has been a crime against basketball, my god literally sign anyone but a WORSE Danny Green"
Wes fitting nicely into the Danny Green role.
They replaced Danny Green with a worse shooter lmfao
You talking about back to back nba champion Danny green ?
"Tobias Harris, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, wait, we dont have anyone named dinwiddie."
"Danny Green, Maxey, future 1st, who says no"
"I really don’t have a doubt he’s gonna feast, but the Nets scoring just scares the shit out of me. Seth Curry gonna get destroyed on D in the playoffs, and some nights Danny Green can’t guard a fucking traffic cone"
He's like Danny Green on higher volume.
Danny green kinda sucks man
you are not understanding the ways in which Danny Green helps teams win basketball games.
"When Danny Green plays like ass, he plays defense, gets guarded off-ball, doesn’t take many shots, and doesn’t turn the ball over a lot."
Dillon Brooks looking like prime  Danny Green both physically and shooting wise rn
"This casual just talking reckless, I’d bet he hasn’t watched a full Danny green game"
I think Danny Green has a better shot of hitting a pull up 3 from 40 feet out than furkan has of hitting a floater
Have you seen Danny Green?
I feel like I’ve seen Danny Green airball from three feet away at least a dozen times so far this season
&gt; The difference is Danny Is still a threat from 3 and teams respect it.  This. Even if Green weren't shooting significantly better than Thybulle this season--and he is--reputation matters more than current-season shooting percentages when it comes to how defenders guard you. Teams don't want to leave Green open. Teams are happy to let Thybulle fire away from the perimeter.
He could be a Danny Green tho
Originally thought this was a joke post about Danny Green and aspartame
Danny Green is worse than Gordon and Peej
"That 09 team is one of the all time greats in college imo.  They had 5 first round draft picks on that team -- Hansbrough, Ellington, Ty Lawson, Ed Davis, Tyler Zeller....and yet the best NBA career belongs to a 2nd round pick, Danny Green.    Just an absurdly stacked team that had a ton of experience playing together.  That doesn't really happen in modern college ball because players leave early for the draft.  This was just a perfect mix of elite talents that all had 1 or 2 things that sorta turned the NBA off of em for a few years."
Danny Green would unironically be one of the worst players on a G League team. But he can cut it as a role player on a contender
I can confirm Danny Green should be banned from dribbling the ball.
Danny Green himself is more proven than anyone on this roster
The covid sixers one was probably worse. Danny green was forced to dribble the ball and it was painful
"Alongside Danny Green, Wayne Ellington and Ty Lawson."
"What's the deal with Bledsoe?  Hes known as a good defender. I know hes a streaky shooter at best, but hes making 38% from 3 this year...   I would do Danny Green for Bledsoe in a heartbeat if thats available."
"I know the whole Danny Green Holocaust Museum thing was hilarious in a very dark and morbid kinda way, but it was also super instructive. People can crucify me if they want, but when you combine Green’s actions, with that of DJax and Stephen Jackson, it’s clear there is a lack of education about Jewish people in the African American community. I was listening to a Bomani Jones podcast this week, and he said he had never met a Jewish person until he was an adult and moved to Miami. And that makes sense. There isn’t a lot of overlap between the two communities. This isn’t something that is really discussed enough when black celebrities parrot the “teachings” of the NOI leaders."
"Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, Tony Bradley and 2 firsts and two swaps"
"How would you like Danny Green, Tony Bradley, 2 firsts and 3 pick swaps?"
"Idk man, we traded Al Horford for Danny Green on an expiring contract."
I mean I’m also Jewish and not mad at Danny Green at all. Why would I be? I’d rather someone take a silly selfie at the Holocaust museum and spread some awareness that it both exists and is worth a visit than nothing at all.  You also don’t speak for Jews everywhere by the way.
Is he taking a selfie with Danny green?
"Yeah he was really putting some clamps on Danny Green, really forcing Danny Green to miss all those open corner 3"
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/08/san-antonio-spurs-danny-green-holocaust-selfie
"On the one hand the Sixers absolutely need a PG to be true title contenders. Their best lineup, far and away, this season has been Shake-Seth-Ben-Tobias-Embiid, aka a lineup that doesn't have Danny Green and has another ball handler  But on the other hand, Ben Simmons has never lost a game to Kemba in his career"
"I think it depends on Kawhi agreeing to stay of course, and the overall package - but based on the combined $67M that PG+RWB made that year, it would’ve required $54M roughly in matching salary outbound.  The rumor was that OKC asked for Siakam+FVV plus picks, so you still need $43M in salary to make the money work. That means Lowry+Powell, or Lowry+one of Gasol/Ibaka, or both Gasol+Ibaka. Let’s say Lowry+Powell for argument’s sake and it’s the deciding factor in Kawhi re-signing.  TOR ends up with RWB/PG/Kawhi/Ibaka/Gasol with OG/McCaw/Boucher off the bench plus any ring-chasers and whoever they can get with their MLE. Also they could re-sign Danny Green for additional backcourt depth if he’s willing to stay. TOR probably wins the East last year with that team but the long-term outlook gets dicey as early as this year, especially depending on the draft capital in the trade.  OKC then ends up with Lowry/FVV/Powell/Siakam/Adams to build around"
"My take- if he were worth finding/wanted to play/was actually a good candidate, the NBA could/would find him... and if he was worth about a million dollars to an NBA team, and wanted to play, I feel like he would make himself findable. In other words, there's got to be a good reason we don't hear about him and that he doesn't show up.  I hate to be that guy, because I want to believe in these reclamation projects, but who is the last ""everyone had given up on this guy but we believed and it was a good feel good story?"" And no, I don't mean Danny Green. I can't think of anyone recently who really panned out (I don't feel like J.R. Smith, Bogut and Nene count--they weren't completely given up on). It wasn't Ty Lawson, Andrew Bynum, Larry Sanders, Michael Beasley ... anyone think of someone recently in this type of scenario where it actually panned out well and everyone was so glad they ignored the red flags and tried to revive the career of a guy who'd been given up on?"
"oh they can reliably create shots bro. they just dont always hit them lol. danny green could not reliably create shots. all those guys i listed can create their own shots. id say they even could in the playoffs. theyre young and use speed to create their shots. theyll have that speed advantage even in the playoffs. itll just be more difficult because the other team will know what shots they like to take. they wont be ""good"" shots either.  all that said, i dont want any shots created like that in the playoffs. i want beautiful game, where players create shots for other players via screens, ball movement, and cuts.  id say the miami heat last year, and the spurs in 14 showed that you can win off of systems as opposed to just star power. tho in the clutch star power helps. i dont think demar counts tho cuz his contested midrange shots are terrible. because hes not a threat to shoot a three the defense knows what hes going to do and it doesnt work. bad shots.  EDIT: i think harden does actually want to do isos and prefers to play that way. jordan also wanted that. carmelo wanted that. its a thing.  EDIT EDIT: most recently on the spurs LMA wanted that and it was terrible. im glad hes finally gone."

"Would have to face the Cavs in the East still.  Kyrie, Joe Harris, Lebron, Jae Crowder, Tristan Thompson  Bench: Garland, Sexton, Wiggins, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Tyra Jones  Would probably beat y’all out"
"You'd think people with names like ""Danny Green"" and ""Meyers Leonard"" would be more cognizant of antisemitism, but no.  ... Just to cover my ass: I'm not comparing the two at all. Danny was being insensitive and ignorant years ago, Leonard was saying something overtly bigoted and hateful a few days ago."
"I’ll give you Danny green and mike Scott, take it or leave it"
Heat are one Jae Crowder replacement away from making a second run. They miss his switchability.    * Rudy Gay? * Doug McDermott * Otto Porter * Danny Green * Bobby Portis  I don't know but they need that gap filled and then it's all gravy.
"The hate against LaMarcus are mostly things that were outside of his control.   The hype surrounding his signing was huge...adding the top FA to the Big 3 shortly after two straight Finals appearances.   His one year with Timmy was great but got derailed by the KD/WB Thunder who almost toppled the 73-9 Warriors.  Then Timmy left. Then Zaza happened...follwed by the Kawhi fiasco, so he walked along with Danny Green. Then Manu and Tony...  Next thing you know, he went from being on a championship contender to a rebuilding team real quick.  We all knew life was gonna be hard after the Big 3, and Aldridge gave us some solid years...I wish him luck on his path going forward."
"i used to make this mistake before, but ""no love lost"" actually means that you dislike them, danny green made same mistake recently"
"Come on, Kawhi and Danny Green were both free agents immediately after. But yes, Masai and the organization have kept us flexible so that we won't be ""crippled"" like most instances when 30+ vets inevitably move on."
"Hmm. Idk who the sixers have off the top of my head, but maybe mattise, Dwight Howard, and Danny green?"
"3x NBA champion Danny Green, soon to be 4x NBA champion Danny Green, welcome to the Denver Nuggets."
"So you're specifically limiting it to the help Harden had in the 2019 playoff series against the Warriors lol vs Kawhi's help against the 76ers? So if you have an ATG on your team and he doesn't play as well as he could in a single 5 game stretch suddenly you have no help.   Regardless, lets play your game. Here were the other top Rockets players stats in that series:  Gordon: 20 ppg on 60 % TS  CP3: 17, 7, and 6 on 57 % TS  Tucker: 11 and 8 on 64 % TS and 48 % from 3  Capela: 9 and 10    Now compare to the other Raptors' players against the 76ers  Siakam: 19 and 6 on 53 % TS  Lowry: 13, 5, and 5 on 50 % TS  Gasol: 9 and 6 on 52 % TS  Danny Green: 8 and 4 on 37 % from 3  Tell me how Kawhi had way more help?"
+ Danny Green.  (Said on his podcast he got it right before the Bubble restart)
"I see no reason, barring injury, the Sixers can't run it back next year as well. Embiid will be 27, Simmons 25. The only major expiring contracts are Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard. Surprisingly, legitimately everyone else is signed until the 2022-23 season."
yep he is our danny green
"My gut feeling is that Lowry packed already few weeks ago and what's holding up the deal is that the 76rs need to find a home for Danny Green.   Hey , who knows, maybe you'll be getting Aldridge is some 3 way deal ..."
"If I were the Raptors, I would look long and hard at Paul Reed too. Dude is tearing up the G league and will develop into a really solid player. Although I doubt Toronto is interested in a package of Maxey, Reed, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and a first."
"What, you aren’t interested in Maxey, the ghosts of Danny Green and Mike Scott, and the 30th pick in this draft, for the greatest Raptor of all time? Fake fans man smh."
"That would make Lowry, Kawhi, Gasol, Ibaka and Danny Green from the Raptors championship team walking without the Raptors getting anything back in return. Pretty much a championship starting lineup walking for nothing in the space of two years.  In most instances that would cripple a team for a generation."
"LMAO look at my comment history im FAR from a green teamer. But you do know you don't have to say the same ""oh danny leaks again"" to EVERY trade story involving boston right?"
"&gt;Because what you're essentially asking for with late 2000s/early 2010s basketball is just more long twos and more post possessions from mediocre post players. That's stupid.  No, it's not. It's a decent mix of midrange game, driving, post up and 3s chucking. Objectively more variety than now, and your feeling on it is simply your opinion.  &gt;Nobody actually wants to watch guys like Danny Green or PJ Tucker take catch and shoot 20 footers instead of corner threes. Nobody wants to see five Myles Turner post ups per game. The only reason they think they want to is because of the stupid romanticization of 1990s/2000s basketball, which might be the cringiest thing in all of sports.  You talk so confidently as if 'no one' wants to see that brand of basketball without literally any proof to back it up. Have you ever considered you live in your own echochamber here in r/nba when it comes to this stuff and that the casuals are detested by the evolution of the game the past couple years more than you think?  After all, there's a reason ratings have been noticeably down in the past few years, even moreso than they ever have at the peak of the 90s basketball, and it isn't likely just because of cord-cutting (because the NFL resurged in 2019 after a couple down years, for example).   The nature of today's game (only 3s chuckin, foulbaiting on the perimeter, softer defensive rules, more ref involvement in games, more ads, games start late, superstar talent more &amp; more concentrated, superstars run the league more than ever, etc) undoubtedly has to be a part of it."
"Last 9 years have had 4 players in common. Lebron, Curry, Leonard and Danny Green. So this year it’s mostly likely Clippers, Lakers and 76’rs in the finals. But yes Detroit and Rockets are out liars. If Miami won it would have been another special case. Straight up and down. Hall of Fame players win chips."
Danny Green to heat?
"I think Orlando would probably prefer ""their own guy"" in a situation like that where both guys value is relatively similar. Barton is weird everytime I watch him this year I dont know what he's doing but last yr he was also their 3rd best player. Whether that version ever comes back Im not sure but I might prefer holding out rather than selling low.   Here's one: Will Barton for Danny Green? Green is old but he's still better defensively than Barton which Denver defensive wings is what I think they need to be looking for with MPJ at the 4 looking set. Green is also an expiring if you dont want Barton's deal on the books next yr.   Someone posted yesterday Ja'Sean Tate might be available, I would make that call if Hou. I do in general think there is a move to be made for Denver, not a blockbuster but I dont think they should be sitting back this yr doing nothing at all. MPJ at the 4 aside I would also call about Larry Nance the fit for Denver is very clean."
"What is your definition of elite? He was a second team all nba defensive player ONE time, during the 16-17 season.  Dudes a plus defensive player who had great coaching and understands team defense. There is nothing elite about danny greens defense,  no one is scared of danny green. If you've been watching, he has really fallen off on defensive over the past two plus seasons. The decline started in Toronto."
"I'm annoyed because it's complete bullshit at worst and lazy parroting at best.  1.  I don't think he's the worst defender in the league - that's just nonsense that /r/nba  says to drag him, but you know what, I'll let you have this.  Trae is the worst defender in the league. 2.  has tunnel vision - kid that averages 9 assists a game - with tunnel vision. Of course.  Perfect match for Trae.  Well done.  Tunnel vision assists! 3.  But you said remove the playmaking - only one of his primary attributes - of course, easily done.  Rudy Gobert without his defense is still the exact same player more or less, after all.  Let's look at some more criteria now:  &gt;He doesn't really do much besides shoot giving you 1 assist and 2 rebounds.   1.  2 rebounds is the same as 4 rebounds right?  So what if Trae at 6'1 is averaging more rebounds than david bertans, or marc gasol, or robin lopez, or danny green, or duncan robinson. 4 rebounds is basically 0 rebounds if you round down.  Another perfect match for Trae.  Great job.  2.  doesn't really do much besides shoot - of course, if you take away a point guard's playmaking, all he can do is shoot. You've just described all of the league's point guards.  Trae's one of all the league's point guards!  well done again.  another criteria met.  ​  76% of Duncan Robinson's shots are 3s, compared to Young's 38%.  He's 6'7, and averages 3 rebounds and 1.2 assists ​and is also a terrible defender.  You don't have to change a damn thing and he fits the criteria almost perfectly.   So by your logic, trae young, if you remove his playmaking, is duncan robinson.    You literally just focused on one thing - worst defender - then lazily tried to shoehorn Trae Young into the rest of the description based on that one bit of circlejerk nonsense."
Portland so 1. Danny Ainge 2. Young Sabos 3. Damon Stoudamire 4. A.c. Green
"I can’t bear to see danny green being a point guard again, dude looks so damn awkward dribbling the ball"
"The reality is he has a 30 mil contract that not many teams at all can even take if they wanted to. So raptors aren't getting a bidding war going. And of those teams who can take it on, not many have much in the way of assets to give up. A 1st round pick, a young guy with potential, a reliable bench piece in danny green...that might be the best offer they get for a 35 year old expiring contract who isn't a top 20 player right now.They might choose to keep him instead which is their choice...but they aren't getting much more."
"That's why Danny Green was so underrated by fans. Kawhi was relegated to picking up some secondary player and Green got the primary matchup almost every time and killed it.  Yeah he's a step slower but here we go again with Ben Simmons getting maximum love -- another Green teammate whose defense gets all the shine. And Embiid is incredible too, probably even more impactful than old Duncan."
"I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I thought there was a minute there were there was a lot of Gary Neal buzz.  Like ""the Spurs have done it again, they found another random guy that's good, he's another Danny Green.""  He hung around and played a lot in the playoffs but never amounted to much and then just bounced around the league until everyone forgot about him."
You are calling danny green an elite wing defender? Lol that word gets thrown around way to much.
"Totally agree. My point was just that a significant portion of Ben's value on defense is that he makes hunting those switches more complicated with his anticipation and tenacity. But in a long series, when teams are gameplanning each possession, the offense obviously will maintain a huge advantage regardless of those qualities.   I am excited to see what the sixers D looks like come playoff time. With Ben out front and Jo in the middle, they will be formidable. But, as you point out, often in the playoffs the defense is only as strong as it's weakest link. As the roster stands right now, that obviously Seth. But I'll be curious to see what roll some of the bench guys play come crunch time in the playoffs. So far Doc has seemed to favored Shake over Danny Green. Will be interesting to see if Matisse can force his way into some crunch time minutes (needs to be a 3pt threat). A lineup of Ben/Shake/Tisse/Tobi/Jo is awfully switchable."
"&gt;that shows his supporting cast was better  we have already established that the Spurs were a better team. It's not mutually exclusive that the Spurs team was better than the Rockets and Kawhi was better than Harden. Both can be true, and both were true.  &gt;Everyone knows harden choked in game 6 of 2017. Thats not relevant to the argument  That is completely relevant. If Harden was so valuable to his team, he wouldve done more than 10 points and 6 TOs in an elimination game.  &gt;but games 1-5 hardens stats were better and it was actually 2-2 going into OT of game 5  Game 5 of OT, where Harden also choked?? You are really not helping yourself at all here lmao. Another opportunity with no Kawhi where Harden had the chance to win a game, and Harden goes 0-3 with 3 TOs in overtime. Not to mention the play where he let **Danny Green** blow by him on a drive to get an and 1. And the final shot where he got his shot destroyed by 40 year old Ginobili. Harden was dogshit in game 5 OT and game 6. He choked hard in both games.  &gt;Kawhi did not “clearly” outplay harden if he didn’t even play in hardens worst game  He outplayed him for the series. Harden was so bad while Kawhi was out, Kawhi outplayed him by not even being on the court lmao. Harden was a net negative in game 6 and game 5 OT. Kawhi played better in that series than Harden did."
"Lowry, Van Vleet, Siakim, Gasol, Ibaka, Danny Green, OG (who was injured during the playoffs) and Kawhi. Definitely an all time great defensive team. If that team stayed together with Terrence Davis, Powell and Boucher they’d definitely be remember as a defensive power house. Even last year they shut down a lot of teams best players."
Nah I did watch them and I thought Danny Green was better at it.   Reputation DPOY. Should have went to Draymond Green.
That was *mostly* Danny Green who Chris Paul was scoring over.  &gt; and smacked away like an annoying fly by kd  You mean zp?
"There's a difference between adding shooters and trading shooters.   Bucks just got Jrue and lost Korver and Hill who were your most reliable shooters last year and Bledsoe who was admittedly not as reliable but still an efficient scorer.   76ers still have Korkmaz and Shake but they also added Danny Green and Seth Curry. They lost Richardson and horford which were terrible fits for that team.   The bucks stayed the same, the 76ers got better."
  Morey doesn't care about Danny Green.  That's just who he took back to unload Horford.  Guy is probably not even going to be on the team next month.
I doubt it. Danny Green is a more valuable player at this point
"Predicting a quarter, i'll take my chances. Danny Green won himself 2 championships with that"
At least Danny green was a big body who could defend very well in a team setting. But that 15 mil price tag was killer
"Exactly, it wasn’t his fault. No matter how good he is, you’re just not winning a series unless everybody else majorly steps up. Problem with the Sixers is, they have guys that can maybe defend a little, but those same guys cannot give you much on the other end. Mattyse Thybulle is going to be unplayable, Danny Green is borderline. For them to have a chance, Tobias Harris is going to have to be an efficient 25-30 a game monster, something which he has been the polar opposite of in the post season throughout his career."
76ers also got Danny Green in that deal who starts for them (and started on the last 2 nba champions). Pels didn’t have Danny Green to trade.
" maxey/danny green/and 1 or 2 1sts. If we don't trade green i'll be kind of happy we keep him, he still brings value. But I don't think a 35 year old Lowry on an expiring contract is going to bring in a monster haul particularly. One or two firsts, a young player with potential, and an experienced piece to use in trades or your rotation...that seems about right to me."
Kinda hoping the Sixers win this year so Danny Green can threepeat with 3 different teams
Danny Green is the clear answer
Danny Green.
Matt Bonner and Danny Green
Danny green bout to 3 peat
they gonna send him death threats just like they did with Danny Green lmaoooo
"A couple days before last season started my wife and I traveled to Iowa to go to a friend's wedding. While at one of the local breweries we hear a couple friends catching up and one of them confidently stated that the Lakers were going to win the title solely because Danny Green was on the team, nothing to do with LeBron coming back healthy or the acquisition of AD. My wife and I laughed it off until the final result happened; I will never question the GOATness of Danny Green again."
If you don't already think Danny Green is the GOAT then there is no help for you.
"Guess what, you can’t get Ingles or Danny Green or Iggy for $1mil vet mins. Go look at those guys’ contracts right now. Useful role players cost money for the rest of us."
&gt; It's like teams signing Igoudala or Ingles or Danny Green.  Those players are counting more than $800k against the cap.
"Just a reminder that you didn't win anything until you had Danny Green, and now we do."
"Willis Reed is technically the only 2nd round pick to win an MVP.... but that was 1964 and the rounds were different then, so he was still 8th overall, not really the same thing as Jokic who was picked 41st overall. Other than that Jokic is pretty clearly the best 2nd rounder ever, or will be if he wins MVP this year (+110 odds).   Other 2nd rounders who were/are good but not MVP level: Draymond, Manu, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Millsap, Lou Williams, PJ Tucker, Rodman, Gilbert Arenas.   None of those guys were as good at their peaks as Jokic is now though."
"yeah but people are overreacting as if they signed 2 more all stars. No they're just really good role players now. It's like teams signing Igoudala or Ingles or Danny Green. Sure they're good signings that put you over the top, but are the nets a stacked superteam?...Well yes, but not because of those 2 lol"
"&gt; Danny Green  Three peat?! C'mon, ass much as I like him, we all know there's just one Patrick McCaw"
"Posts like this are useless to be honest, we all know that Danny Green is threepeating."
"&gt;Do GMs really have to purposely underplay their hand and selectively not win trades too much to not alienate their peers ?  Spurs traded Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and the Raptors’ 2018 1st round pick"
Yeah because teams rest star players during the playoffs. Listen to yourself man. Any player has the capability to make a difference in a playoff game. Didn’t Tyler Herro drop 37 off the bench last year in the Finals? Didn’t Ron Artest drop 20 in Game 7 and hit the clutch go ahead bucket? Did you watch the 2013 NBA finals? Danny Green might’ve won Finals MVP if the Spurs won. Idk how your argument is ‘a player can make a difference if they play’ like that’s not the aim of any signing made in the NBA.
"No one forced the Spurs to add Danny Green lol   Kawhi was 100% a gamble, it’s only with hindsight that you act like this because he played out the season. Everyone thought he was a huge injury risk and therefore no one made better offers.   I get that you pretend these things are different, but a GM making a ballsy trade and trading their star player isn’t the same thing as a Top 3 player taking a pay cut to join the team that eliminated him from the WCF."
"If Joe Harris counts as an all star here so does fucking Danny Green and idk Lopez? Don’t get me wrong, Harris is a super valuable piece, but he’s not a perennial all star."
"Nah the point of the trade for the raptors is getting pieces for the future, Horford moves the needle the same amount Danny green does, which means Masai would still ask for Maxey, Thybulle and 2 firsts but I guarantee you Elton wouldve taken Thybulle, Horford and 2 firsts for Lowry but thats why Im happy we have Morey now"
"Maybe he'll be the reverse Danny Green, trash in the regular season, awesome in the playoffs"
"They also lost Danny Green, Javale McGee and Dwight Howard. Remember Bron and his 2017 side couldn't take down KD, and that was when Bron was more in his prime."
"Every team has a scapegoat player it seems.   Lakers had KCP/Danny Green last year, its Montrezl/Wes apparently with a lot of our fans this year"
This is the same fan base who villainized danny green for playing defense
"It wasn't just Duncan, he always had a strong supporting cast backing him up. Against the Heatles, he had Ginobli, Parker, Kawhi,, Danny Green, Patty Mills and Boris Diaw. In his earlier runs he had David Robinson backing him up."
"but that's my point, what does it take to prove that? they're 34-11 which is far superior to last year's jazz team. they're leading all other teams now. they're clearly playing better than everyone else by quite a bit.  do they need to make a deep playoff run against these exact same teams to show they can do it? because all these teams are new. the lakers have lost rondo and howard, the sixers have picked up howard, danny green, and seth curry. the nets are playing with an entire new squad.  none of those teams have proven their playoff credentials either because none of those teams existed last year."
Lakers SOS - Need Danny Green back for his 3's
"I love danny green, but I hate danny green, but i really love danny green..."
And Danny Green hates you :)
"2021 and I don’t think it’s close. You lose howard, mcgee, rondo and danny green but add trez, Schroder, drummond and wesley... 🤔"
Dwight would wreck that big duo of Gasol and Trez. Playoff Rondo would out smart Schroder. Danny Green is just a better player than Matthews.  20 is already proven champions.
Danny green is off the team remember
Danny green is off the team remember
I hate Danny Green.
"You don't call teams superteams based off of how good they are relative to their competition. It has never worked like that. It's either the team has at least 3 all-stars or no. Hardly anyone called the Twin Tower Spurs or Shaq Kobe Lakers a superteam.  Secondly, you still can't call the Lakers roster strong in hindsight considering they opted to replace them in the following offseason. Rondo had a good stretch during the playoffs, but they still replaced him with Schroeder. Danny Green played like ass on offense, so they hoped to replace him with Wes Matthews (even tho he's currently also playing like ass). JaVale and Dwight were benched for most of the playoffs and only played in specific matchups, so they were replaced with Marc and Montrezzl. Whether or not these were the right moves, last year's roster left a lot to be desired which is why their front office looked to replace them."
"We Lakers fans cyberbullied KCP into being a solid role-player last year.  We tried the same for Danny Green. He didn’t work out, so we sent him to a more talented group to have a go at him."
"Lmao wrong. Without 5 players on the floor the Lakers couldn’t play the game. Without Rondo they don’t win, without Dwight and danny green they don’t win it’s a team game and LeBron and AD aren’t the full team."
"You misunderstand the term ""role player"". Danny Green is a ""role player"" and he starts for us for us. It doesn't mean your trash lol it just means he's not a star player and is really good at a select few things"
Danny Green kept missing open shots while having tattoos of bullseyes and sharpshooters. He was practically begging for the criticism.
"&gt;Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.” according to Athletic.  And what were Philly ACTUALLY willing to give up?"
They had to get a 3rd team because okc traded the players NYK ended up with in the off season to philly in the danny green deal.  So they weren't elgible to be traded back there.
"Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.” according to Athletic.     So let's say you removed Maxey and Thybulle and even a 1st rounder, the Raptors should've done it. Green could've been flipped or even ride out the rest of the season since he's a free agent anyways.     Instead the team will walk away with absolutely nothing to show for Lowry staying with the team for the rest of the season."
"I could see this for sure. I feel like trading him now would’ve been the best option, if not for the Raptor’s org then for the GROAT.   He’d be able to get a cool 40-50 million extension while getting to kinda choose his destination for a chance at a ring. Meanwhile the raps could at least get 2-3 FRPs of value with Maxey/First/Danny green"
Laker fans. This crew of clowns sent death threats to Danny green and KCP for bad play in the playoffs
I thought they got rid of Danny Green?
"I've seen so much stupid Danny Green slander on this site (not just this sub) where people act like he's some garbage player lucking into situations where he's dragged to championships. Nephews seem to forget these contending teams want him because he's a great role player and an experienced vet in this league.   If Lebron trusts you to take the last shot to clinch a title, you're doing fine."
I am glad I am not a GM because I too would have shipped Danny Green off after that game 5 miss. I don’t even like the Lakers and that still pissed me off.
It's impossible to not love Danny Green    Forever in our hearts
Love that she first held it like she just did a jersey swap with Danny Green
Danny green sent a gift to the 94 year old woman who picked Danny as her favorite 76er**
"Sixers usually, but the Danny Green thing with the Lakers....sheesh.  Celtics are also up there too."
"Danny Green is legitimately playing amazing this year, he’s been the Sixers’s best 3 point shooter, he’s not just some deadweight salary or something. Trading him is a legitimate loss for the Sixers and means they can’t afford to give up too much more."
"Manu came off the bench, Danny Green started at SG"
"If your Danny Green says ""hey"" to me he's *our* Danny Green now"
"Clearer, if you had titled it - Danny green sent a gift to the 94 year old woman who picked him as her favorite 76er."
Phildaphia Danny Green &gt; Toronto Reptons Danny Green.   DG is good peoples.
"I think there's a couple important things to note. The raps wanted a young player or two plus picks, but to match Lowry's salary the heat and sixers wouls have to give up too much depth. Lowry is the greatest raptor of all time, he didn't ask for a trade and you can't just give up your franchise player for scraps just because he's expiring, it's a bad look on the org. And The raps really didn't let their championship squad just ""walk"". Kawhi was gone regardless, Gasol didn't want starting centre minutes, and Danny Green wanted to contend. The only fumble was lowballing Ibaka for sure. Overall I don't think it's wrong for Masai to overvalue Lowry, and for Riley and Morey to undervalue him, sucks that they couldn't get a deal but that's just how it is. Oh and Lowry made it clear he would most likely re-sign so he wasn't exactly an ""expiring"". I think he probably moves the needle for the sixers but not the heat, and the sixers couldn't give up two young players plus all the depth from salary matching."
"I liked the Sixers offer if they didn't have to match salaries using Danny Green.  If they had a lower end player that they could use, I would have really liked it."
"Odds on Drummond to get the Danny Green treatment as he's the first option for a month with no Lebron and AD, allowing him all the post-ups he wants?"
"Drummond is a negative player my guy, if your sending death threats to Danny green I pray for Drummonds life"
"That grandma is so sweet, and for 95 so lucid! Great from Danny Green"
Fuck Danny green
Danny Green and Mike Scott was enough with Maxey to match
Maxey first round pick Danny Green  Thybulle is too much for an all star
"The 60 something virgins that downvoted you, smh. Fuck Danny Green."
"We love Danny Green actually, he's shooting over 40% and his defense is still decent especially if you consider his age.  Theo? Not sure how that relates to us, all we had to give up was a 2025 first to move Horford, and Danny has been a great return on our investment, plus we got a trade exception from that deal too."
Nah literally Danny Green dribbles like a kid even against no pressure
Thanks! Danny Green at 5 is surprising
1. Joel Embiid 2. Ben Simmons 3. Tobias Harris 4. Shake Milton 5. Danny Green 6. Mattise Thybulle 7. Seth Curry 8. Dwight Horward 9. Furkan Korkmaz 10. Mike Scott  Haven’t seen George Hill yet but I’d imagine he slides in right under Seth
Danny green nose how to play that next level d
"Honestly, yeah. If playoffs Danny Green doesn't show up, 76ers really got a chance. Harden won't be a thing in the playoffs. Ben simmons can definitely guard everyone. And they don't have anyone against Embiid. Same thing with the Bucks, Jrue can guard anyone. And the nets has no one to guard Giannis."
"I hope they lose. But if they don't, it'll be a truly disgusting thing to see. It also proves a point that everyone clamoring for just wanting ""cOmPetiTiOn"" in the league was totally full of shit. They didn't want competition. They just didn't want the teams who ""weren't supposed"" to be good, to be that good. No one expected the warriors to be that good. So it pissed everyone off when they got good and STAYED good. But now that everyone expects the Lakers and Nets to be good, it's all fine and dandy.  BTW, everything in my previous comments applies 100% to the Lakers as well. KD joining Steph is league-ruining. But AD teaming up with LeBron is fantastic and great for the league apparently? But not after also adding Danny Green, Rondo, McGee, and every single other player the Lakers had to have just to feel satisfied that no one else could have as much as they did."
I can’t believe it only took a 2025 lightly protected first and we got Danny Green back in return. His contract would have shackled the Sixers for years.
"Yup, some players confuse me like Danny Green dribbles like a middle schooler like how have you gotten so bad at handling in the NBA??"
Warriors fans looking at this like Lakers fans looked at Danny Green a few days ago
"&gt;Not denying that it was a solid move. Saying you ""got an actual player for Horford"" is quite clearly disingenuous, as Horford was unanimously a negative asset and the reason you got Danny Green was because of the picks.  This is literally the point of the comment. Instead of giving up Horford + picks for nothing (which easily could have happened, especially after the CP3 trade), we got a solid contributor back.  &gt;Not an excess, but a 1st and a 2nd to get rid of a bad contract is far from 'genius'.  Given the struggle we've seen for teams to get rid of players with bad contracts, with most of them being waived in recent years, it's a pretty low price   &gt; And to add to that, Danny Green earning more than 15 mil is not exactly a hugely positive asset.   On an expiring deal he absolutely is. We also have his early bird rights so can resign him over the cap if he wants to stay.   &gt;Think of it this way, if the Thunder packaged Horford with those two same picks, they would not struggle to find teams to take that package.   Not without getting another terrible, non expiring contract in return   &gt; Horford's contract is not bad enough for those picks to quite clearly make up for it imo.  Given what he's shown the past 2 years and his age, I'd comfortably say it's around one of the 5 worst contracts in the league. Which is pretty bad"
"Not denying that it was a solid move.

"Oh, so now we hunt out Danny Green 3s lmfao"
"&gt;Morey's best move, the fact we got an actual player for Horford is a stroke of genius  Daryl Morey (Sixers President of Basketball Operations) trading Al Horford to Oklahoma City, along with a 2025 top 6 protected first round pick, and a 2020 second round pick (Theo Maledon), for Danny Green, is the best move he's made in his current job. Philadelphia not only got rid of Al Horford, who has a large contract and didn't fit well with the team, they got a player in return who is valuable to the team, whilst they didn't have to part ways with an excess of future assets. Morey did very well in making this trade.  I expanded it a little, does this help? Let me know if you don't understand anything"
i think the 2013 Spurs are contenders for that  Tony Parker  Manu Ginobili  Tim Duncan  Danny Green  Stephen Jackson  Boris Diaw  Kawhi Leonard  Tracy McGrady
danny green is like 9/9 from 3 today
"*After the game Danny Green revealed he was helping PG breathe better by removing some nasal blockage.*  ""It was a bad snot"""
I love Danny Green. He really does all the small things that don't show up on the box score to help his team win.
Danny Green still hitting
Salary filler wasn’t the difference. Any gm would do Danny green and whatever else in a heartbeat
"Have the Lakers really gotten ""everyone"" in a while? I feel like we're talking Nash and Howard, then the dying years of Kobe, and then KD. Everyone laughed at Dwight 2.0, Danny Green and Rondo up until they won a title dominantly.   The Warriors got ""everyone"" during their run, and here we are with Brooklyn now.   LA hasn't deserves their reputation for a long, long while."
"mcgee was an elite lob threat, also that starting lineup had either bradley or danny green, not schroder"
Idk about the nuggets or lakers but I am a sixers fan.  Put Ben on harden or kyrie.  Play Danny green and Matisse on the other based who’s in.  Have Tobi on KD and let embiid lock down the paint.  It’s not perfect but I’d be confident they’d be able to contain them enough to win a series
"Since when did fans or no fans change anything  If the ""no crowds equals better shooters"" shit made sense Danny Green wouldn't brick a wide open ass three  Hell the Lakers shot ass or below average from three besides Bron, KCP and AD"
"Acting like Danny Green was useful for anything besides defense, Dwight and Javele were barely used, KCP was only somewhat consistent, and Rondo was useless all of the regular season  Not their fault Kawhi and Paul George turned jnto George Paul and Cry Lonard, and that Russ was trash, Harden gave up 2 games in, and that the Bucks have a coach that is holding back that team terribly in the playoffs and let the Heat obliterate them with shooting"
"Lol it's not even close to the Nets' level. It'd be more accurate if say, Lakers traded Caruso, Kuzma &amp; Danny green for Damian Lillard. And then picked up Paul Millsap, John Collins, and somehow acquired Seth Curry. And Clint Capela"
"Thanks for Danny Green, Thunder."
"That in 20 years, he will be on TNT studio with Draymond and Danny Green and he will keep talking about how he was competitive while Draymond yells ""RINGS"""
well i for one am so fucking relieved we don't have that bogus contract anymore. Can't beleive we somehow got Danny Green out of it.
Danny Green enters the chat
You guys might get lucky and get hot version of danny green for 4 games vs bkn lol
"Because you believe everything that comes out of Morey's mouth lmfao. Obvs Masai is gonna start high with an asking price of Maxey, Thybulle and 2 FRP. Green is there to match salaries only. That's how negotiations work.   The trade could've been made with the same package minus Thybulle for Tony Bradley. The only valuable piece in all of this for the 76ers this year is Thybulle.  If you think Lowry isn't worth Maxey, 2 low FRP, Danny Green and George Hill then you should tamper your expectations and not be surprised when the Sixers inevitably lose in the 2nd round or CF."
"Any lowry to sixers deal would have been centered around danny green, so I'm sure masai did his due diligence beforehand to find a landing spot for green. In fact, I believe that's what the noise about a green for oubre swap was about."
You also got Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green in their primes for DeRozan and Poetl...   That kind of shift in value makes it much easier to spend assets on ancillary players.
"The report was matisse, maxey and 2 picks. Danny green and Mike scott could be added to make salaries work. Danny green has played well as a starter for the sixers. Raptors absolutely could've flipped him to a contender for *something*."
I guarantee you some reporter made that shit up because it does not work salary wise.   Theres no value to danny green other than salary dump for us.
I mean we offered Danny Green who's a food veteran who can be re-signed in the off season potentially or sign and traded. A 1st round pick which not high is still something. And Maxey who shows lots of flashes and potential but needs a team that can take the time to play and develop him more.   I don't see a team offering more than a good young prospect on a rookie deal and a 1st for him. Not to mention a role player who has real value. That's also not counting Mike Scott who would have also had to be included and Terrance Ferguson.
Hoping for a Denver/Philly finals so JaVale and Danny Green can duke it out to prove which one is worthy of having as many rings as LeBron James
"If we were ""just"" giving up Maxey + Thybulle + Picks (2 firsts even), I'm okay with the trade.  But we need to match salary and the only realistic way to match salary there was to trade Danny Green, a starter, 40% 3 pt shooter and they STILL wanted Maxey + Thybulle. Maxey isn't doing anything for us right now, but I'd pack his bags for any trade, but Thybulle is a significant contributing factor to our 2nd ranked defense. We'd be giving up a ""raw"" prospect in Maxey, an all-NBA level bench defender in Thybulle (who HAS been a 35% shooter in his career, but is not doing well this year) and a starter who is contributing like 4 3s a game and solid wing defense. Kyle Lowry is a big deal, but he's not worth losing two major contributors to our team, 2 low 1sts and a raw prospect who is likely worth a low first right now. That's insane and probably doesn't even improve our team that drastically."
"You’re not including the fact that to match contracts we’d have to add Danny Green. He’s been a key player this year in providing spacing to Ben + Jojo and not worth giving up alongside a future all-defensive player, Maxey, 2 frp and another salary filler for a 35 year old expiring"
"So IF the Warriors might get the 6th seed this year, 9th overall, the narrative could shift towards Steph because of many reasons:  First of all:  No other team in the top 8 (current standings: Utah, Phoenix, Philadelphia, L.A. Clippers, Brooklyn, Denver, Milwaukee, L.A. Lakers) has a better player. Even Embiid and Jokic aren't this important for their teams success respectively.  The Sixers are stacked and wouldn't be Cleveland or even Detroit bad. I do not know the stat yet, but I'm pretty sure Embiid's record without Simmons isn't that great. Harris also provides a meaningful impact this season. The supporting cast and bench is very solid, some guys like Thybulle and Curry are on the rise. Shit, even Danny Green is lighting it up from deep since the allstar-break.  Jokic on the other hand now has the opportunity to push his case for MVP. He currently is the favorite and will win it, if Denver ends the season 3rd in the West (still realistic to catch the Clippers) or even higher (they won't, Utah and Phoenix will not lose that many games).  The other six teams have Superstars (e.g. Leonard, Harden, Antetokounmpo, James), but their narrative is pretty weak because of different reasons (Superstar-duos, injuries, fatigue).  Secondly: Steph's supporting cast is weaker than ever. He is carrying a bad team into the playoffs. His stats are insane, but what's really fascinating is the eye-test. You have to watch the games to understand the impact Curry has and how he makes everybody around him better when he's on the court.  Last but not least, even the most important reason:  Momentum. If the Warriors go on a run and Steph continues this insane production, there is no way you can overlook him. He already is in the discussion, but now's the time voters have to see what Warriors and NBA fans know:  Steph is the personification of the Warriors success (maybe since 2014 and onwards), thus making him the MVP of the NBA's 2020-2021 season."
Danny Green drives really slow in the ultra fast lane.
I heard Danny Green throws his garbage in the compost bin
Fuck Danny Green. Dude probably doesn’t recycle and still uses his @aol email address.
Danny Green probably feels bad because he's literally the reason why we need Steph to drop 50 to win a damn game
Seriously who the hell hits someone's eye during an intentional foul? Dude has a history of being dirty af. Fuck Danny Green
Fuck Danny green
Danny Green at it again
Theres actually no argument for anyone except for Danny Green for MVP and also everyone wants to set the corporate tax rate to zero theres no argument against it
Good guy Danny Green fouling Steph at the end for a chance to get the 50 piece. Unfortunately he was also poked in the eye and missed the first free throw.
"Idk about this one, but Danny Green is 100% one of the most low key dirty players in the game"
Unless Danny Green became the first human to ever master the double jump this is a really bad take
Nice guy Danny Green fouling Steph so he could potentially get to 50 lol
Alternative title: Danny Green perfectly normally  contests a lay-up
Someone link the superman photo of Danny Green injuring Klay
Fuck Danny green
Fuck danny green
Danny green fouled him for 50 lmao
Wow fuck Danny green
"Danny Green fouls the shit out of you in the most discreet way by going for the torso. This is how Klay got injured the first time, Green making contact with Klay's hips which led to him missing game 3."
Steph / Seth  Klay / Danny green  Wiggins / Simmons  Dray / Tobias  Wiseman / Joel  Seems like a super fun matchup. Y’all’s bench is sooo much better than ours tho
that should be warriors ball and lol @ that danny green pushoff
Me too lol. Danny Green has that punchable face
Danny Green off the dribble 27 footer lol
"I like how Masai was like hmm Maxey, Danny Green, and 2 firsts for Lowry? Throw in Thybulle too lmao. I think it was just his way of saying there was no deal to be had with Philly"
never noticed danny green had a bullseye tattoo
Why does it feel like the Warriors  play against Danny Green every week for the last 7 years?
Please keep Danny Green away from Steph
Danny Green attempting a lay up has to be the worst play in the history of basketball.
Also just had Danny Green and Tobias Harris vs Jeff Green and Joe Harris
Danny Green
"Yes, especially with Danny Green shooting 44% from three since the start of Feb. and is a playoff/ championship vet.  If Danny Green was not on the team Thybulle would be the starter"
I knew this was totally off as soon as I saw the legend Danny Green left off our best lineup
I swear Danny Green has like a must-start requirement in his contract. The man just starts on every contender whether he deserves it or not.
"It's not improved though. They're worse on 3s and offensive efficiency than they ever were.   Season| 3PM| Offensive Rating ---|---|---- 20-21| 26th| 14th 19-20| 19th| 13th 18-19 |19th | 8th 17-18| 12th| 12th  People forget the 76ers have actually had pretty good shooters over the years.  Seth Curry and Danny Green aren't a new development. The 76ers had JJ Redick and Robert Covington, who were better versions of Seth and Danny.  What's changed for them this year is their defence, but their offence and spacing is worse than it's ever been."
Defense - Jayson Tatum   Shooting - JR Smith  Both defense and shooting - KCP or maybe Danny Green
"I’m curious why you think Danny Green, a career 40% 3pt shooter and currently 41.2%, can’t make outside shots."
To answer both of your questions: Danny Green
"I’d rather have rondo and Danny green than Dennis, trezz in the playoffs we’ve seen How that story goes. And id rather have Dwight and McGee than Drummond and gasol."
"&gt; I don't think this version of their team is as good as the 2019 playoff version.   Bruh this team has way better shooter and defenders. Its all about fit and J Richardson and Al Horford didn't fit compared to Seth Curry and Danny Green, who are pretty good shooter. There is a reason they have been amazing to watch this season."
Two words bud: Danny Green
"The mistake is thinking that JRich is a 3-D player. Danny Green and RoCo are 3 and D guys as like 95% of their offense game is hanging out at the 3 point line and shooting threes almost immediately catching the ball, while always hustling back and providing good defense. J Rich doesn't take enough 3s nor is he good enough at it to be considered a 3 and D guy."
"&gt;Their roster construction makes no sense  Even just a Burks, Bullock, Korkmaz, off-brand Danny Green/Joe Harris would help us a lot honestly. Zion generates a lot of open looks, but no one can knock them down."
"U only get doubled or something when you get too close to help. Kind of like LeBron in the finals that led to the infamous pass to Danny Green. The real GOAT would have stopped on the midrange, rose up for the win, and hit the shot"
"&gt;I'm pretty sure both parties in the trade knew AD was going to re-sign with LA  No.  &gt;Whether or not the Pelicans trade Anthony Davis, his agent says he [won't sign a contract extension with any team](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-celtics-anthony-davis-trade-one-year-rental) and plans to enter free agency in 2020.   &gt;   &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, [told](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)*Sports Illustrated*'s S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.   &gt;   &gt;“Where he’s going to land? I have no idea,” Paul told SI. “And it don’t matter. We’re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We’re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can’t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.”   &gt;   &gt;[https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Not to mention, if you don't trade for AD there's no guarantee he comes to LA as a FA. KD+Kyrie could have recruited him, among a number of other teams   This insinuates that Davis is the key to building an NBA team.  He's not -- or the Pelicans would've made the playoffs more than twice in his seven seasons there.  And again, there was no guarantee that Davis signs with Los Angeles five months ago in any scenario.  He was an unrestricted free agent, and his agent literally screamed to the entire world that he was going to test the free agent market.  &gt;I don't think you can necessarily assume the Lakers win the title last year without AD. DG and Markieff probably don't come to LA if they don't have AD. AD was a key part to that run and   I said ""probably"", I did not assume.  That said, their chances were very good.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Caruso, and Morris is by far the deepest and best team in Orlando.  And that's if they don't decide to make a different trade -- the Lakers could've traded for Jimmy Butler instead of Davis, and the former went for pennies in comparison.  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and that bench dominates the bubble, and wins easily -- and the Lakers maintain most of the assets they blew on renting Davis.  &gt;I doubt BI+Lonzo could have made up his production on offense and defense   Those are only two of the seven players the Lakers traded away in that deal.  Eight if you count Zubac who was traded separately to make room.  Ingram alone last year nearly matched Davis' offensive production, so your only argument is on the defensive side -- but Ball is better on both ends than Danny Green, and cheaper.  Like I said, the Lakers probably win the 2020 title without Davis.  James has won with far less help."
"19 year old rookies are bad and tend to make big leaps in year two.  But 23 year old rookies are not.    Hardaway Jr. maybe.  I've never really liked THJ so he might already be there IMO.  But no I don't think he'll get to Middleton levels.  Danny Green, Raja Bell, or something like that is what I would be looking for, but he's not far from that as it is.  Depends on what his defensive motor looks like when he's playing 28+ mins every night for a full season and how badly his shooting splits regress once crowd noise starts to exist again."
don't forget Danny Green! he was resting too
danny green. ruined our franchise.
"Schroder isn’t in the top 10 lol so idk where you got that  He’s been a good defender but the top ten are Gobert (100.9), Simmons (105.6), Capela (105.8), Giannis (106.4), Jimmy (106.9), Randle (106.9), Ayton (107.1), Danny Green (107.2), Tobias Harris (107.3), and Kuzma (107.4)  I’ve said that he is comparable to Rose &amp; Clarkson in terms of the spark plug role. He is a better defender than I thought but no need to gas it up more than it is"
"Ben is unreliable come playoff time, you can’t go in the playoffs with him being your 2nd player and be a contender  With Ben having the same impact as Danny Green, your second best player is Tobias Harris and you’re not gonna win anything past round 1 with him being your second best player   Embiid is cool and all but those calls he gets right now will decrease in the playoffs"
"Clippers. The 6ers would have *absurd* interior defense, and their bigs aren't particularly lumbering either so they can go out on the perimeter, but that Clippers team just has too much of everything. The scoring, floor spacing, defense, and IQ are all of the charts. Rondo is one of the best passers/floor generals of all time, regularly averaging double digit assists back in his prime and he was also a good defender. Prime Ibaka was a shot-blocking savant. Prime Boogie isn't even that far removed, so people should know what he's capable of. Prime Batum was a swiss army knife.   Clippers get upgrades at every position outside of their main duo. They're currently posting the best ORtg of all time right now, so just imagine how lethal the offense is going to be when you've got a younger Rondo and a prime fucking Boogie, lmao. The sixers get an upgraded Dwight Howard but that's pretty much it. Embiid is who he is, so is Ben Simmons, Danny Green hasn't really changed his whole career so him being in his prime doesn't change anything, and Tobias Harris is already currently having his 2nd best scoring season PPG-wise and his best season efficiency-wise."
Probably Danny Green.
Danny Green and going cold for the playoffs. Name a more iconic duo post 2014.
Don't forget about Tobias and the inevitable Danny Green cold streak😉
"Danny had way too many draft picks to use and didn't find a trade he liked so ended up using all of them. Every year we seem to replace productivr established talent with rookie contracts. It all came to a head this year where we lost Gordon Hayward, Brad Wanamaker, and Enes Kanter with Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. This season was always going to be hard with so much of the roster being made up of rookie contracts.    Look at all the other high seeds above above Boston and you see teams that added veterans. Milwaukee went out and got Holiday, Philly got Curry, Green and Dwight, Brooklyn sold the farm for Harden and filled out the roster with cheap veterans like Jeff Green.  The young players needed to get on the court and either show they're NBA level players or not so Ainge can finally make a decision on some of these guys. Pritchard broke out early and Timelord came on strong late."
"Danny Green. He can be really up and down, but he is a proven role player with great leadership qualities. Need more people like that that younger players can look up to"
"Another fun stat, number of games with 20 or more 3PA  &amp;#x200B;  ||| |:-|:-| |James Harden|7| |Stephen Curry|2| |Klay Thompson|1| |Marcus Smart|1| |J.R. Smith|1| |Danny Green|1| |Buddy Hield|1| |Kobe Bryant*|1| |Damon Stoudamire|1| |Damian Lillard|1| |Vince Carter|1| |George McCloud|1| |Michael Adams|1|"
"I think Desmond Bane could be a good player, maybe like an Eric Gordon or Danny Green type of player"
The Danny Green 3 pt attempt yesterday against the clips deserved more of a foul call than this.
He also put Danny Green and not Tobi
"Totally ignoring that Philadelphia went out and got shooters (Seth Curry, Danny Green, George Hill).  Thompson is a fine Kanter replacement comparison but Robert Williams and Daniel Theis are 2 totally different players where the offense is run differently and have different defensive styles.  We also don’t have Hayward and we have yet to see what Fournier (and Jabari Parker if you want to include him) can bring to the team at full strength.  This is also ignoring the context that Simmons was injured and didn’t play in the series last year, and Embiid is dominating way more this season than he has in the past. Plus Jaylen Brown has emerged more as a ball handler (with Hayward’s departure).  Both teams are totally different."
"We didn’t get harden cause the rockets owner is a dumbass not cause we wouldn’t offer Simmons. Do not get that twisted lmao. The Lowry package was Danny Green, Maxey, Thybulle and 2 firsts which is far too much for a half a season of Lowry especially if he just signs with Miami in the offseason"
"Danny Green just tried this last night, but of course Steph made it lmao"
"what a terrible argument.   Curry scored 47 points on the raptors in the nba finals, as the sole option of his team. He scored on Kawhi, Siakam, Lowry, Ibaka and Danny Green. Are they all of sudden bad defenders ?  A one game sample doesn't show anything. Terrible argument really."
Danny Green did practically the same thing last night and got appropriately roasted.  The refs should call a technical on bullshit like this.
Why when Steph does it everyone wanna suck the tip but yesterday when Danny green tried it everyone agreed it’s better basketball to shoot the open shot instead of foul baiting???
"This team is a huge upgrade and last year's team would have been hopeless in this long absence of LeBron and AD. I would take Schroder over Rondo, Drummond over Dwight, and Trez over Javale. All upgrades. Danny Green is a loss, but at least Wes and McLemore largely make up for him (Wess defensively and McLemore offensively).   Bradley wasn't in the playoffs, so I really don't care about him one way or another."
Not really true. Danny Green said most players live paycheck to paycheck. You have to consider that even though they make more money they spend more money on their living expenses. Most of these guys are paying huge mortgages on mansions and things like that.
Danny Green
"Danny green will single handily lock up harden, KD and Kyrie and we will get to the finals and beat the lakers. #DannyGreenRevengeTour #JustAKidFromBabylon"
"Ben Simmons was an all star and is a DPOY candidate and currently a better overall player then Murray.   Tobias Harris was a fringe all star, very good defender and one on one player, and currently a better player than mpj.  Danny green and seth curry are both better players than will Barton.   AG has been in Denver for 11 games and they are 9-2 in that stretch."
"NBA really needs to change this rule. I’m so tired of players doing this (much more subtly than Green) and getting rewarded. That said, Danny needs to learn to do it right or stop all together. 😂"
Well according to [The Offical NBA Site](https://official.nba.com/explanation-of-anti-flopping-rule/) :  &gt;A “flop” is an **attempt to either fool referees into calling undeserved fouls** or fool fans into thinking the referees missed a foul call by exaggerating the effect of contact with an opposing player.  Danny Green tries to fool the ref into calling a foul on a play where the defender *clearly* was no where near fouling him. There was no reason for DG to jump the way he did other than to draw an unnecessary foul. He had a wide open shot fo take but instead tried to fool the ref into giving him 3 foul shots instead
Friendly reminder that Danny Green leads the league in corner 3s.
god i hate danny green fuck
Perhaps Danny Green?? And idk maybe add in Kawhi Leonard as a trade filler
"he could play some back to backs but he'll never go a full season without load management. it'd be irresponsible to do anything differently  i'm glad you brought those 18 games up - 8 of them were because of that fultz injury i mentioned in my previous comment, and the other 10 were all load management. if you can win a few games without embiid (and thanks to tobias harris and ben simmons (and danny green for a couple of games), the sixers have been able to win without embiid this year so far) then the load management is way less of an issue"
"Damn, Danny Green -&gt; Danny Ghosts"
"Depends on what you consider guys like Danny Green, Bellinelli or Patty Mills for example, we didn't draft Any of them"
Danny Green already look evil though
It worked! Danny 'icy vein' Green.
Danny Green thought he was (*insert player who gets these calls*). Fuck Danny Green.
Evil Danny green lmaoooo
"There is no embiid stopper. Dealing with Philly comes down to what we do against Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny green, Ben Simmons etc. Joel can do whatever he wants as long as we do well against everyone else, they are not beating us"
"Raptors legend Danny ""hasn't gotten his ring yet"" Green"
Danny Green making game sealing FTs and then a game saving contest.
danny green is legitimately playing like he is in his prime  he has been sooooo good for us over the last stretch.
Lol Brian and Jim were doing everything possible to try and Jinx Danny Green right now
As bad as Danny Green earlier tn
I’m definitely guilty of underrating Danny Green in the past but I think I’ve finally watched him play enough to finally appreciate everything he does.
Danny green has strong hands
"It refers more to the jazz, I know you got rid of Al and added Seth and Danny Green, which is great help, but it's still the same core of Embiid, Simmons and Tobias, without adding star level players.   I can tell absolutely no one expected this kind of turnaround from either team, while the nuggets were expected to be at the top of the conference."
Is Danny Green okay? He is running weird.
fuck danny green
beautiful pass by danny green. winning play
Lakers legend Danny Green
Danny green has been so good for us this year on both ends
"Ups and downs, but he's on a good contract. Honestly he's shooting like I thought Danny Green would and Danny is shooting like I thought Seth would, so it evens out."
Danny Green needs to calm down with trying to draw fouls on 3’s.
Thank fuck Embiid was there to bail out that terrible side jumping foul baiting shit Danny Green was trying
"The opposite version of this being the sixers give up Thybulle, picks, and Filler for Lowry where filler includes not only some decent potential prospects but also a starter in Danny Green"
I think you can argue they missed the opportunity for a wide open dunk because their spacing was god awful. This was a poorly run fast break by Simmons and Harris that Danny green turned into a good play by running to he corner.
So the gameplan against Klay or Duncan Robinson isn't different than against Danny Green?  It's The difference between having a man glued to you and just guarded tight
"Because defense is more complicated than that and the list includes OP's subjective opinion on what a good defender is. Not to mention there's a difference between a streaky three point shooter and a good one and there are definitely guys up there that aren't good defenders(FVV). Some aren't good/consistent three point shooters or simply have higher three point percentages based on their shot types(Covington is awful at threes most of the time and Wiggins mostly shoots wide open ones so isn't actually taking heat off the star).   Danny Green is the archetype 3&amp;D. Danny Green's are also rare. The defense is the more important aspect of the 3&amp;D because a lot of guys can shoot now, but most aren't good to great defenders."
"I was thinking bout Serge, thinking bout Danny Green, thinking bout Gasol, that championship team, opened my eyes yeah, it wasn't just a dreeeam"
No they did not run it correctly and they got bailed out by bad ATL defense who runs back slowly on defense.   Danny should’ve ran closer to the 3pt line to give Ben spacing to be aggressive to drive to the hoop. This would’ve guaranteed someone to have an option shot.   In this scenario if ATL played better defense then Green would’ve been followed to the 3pt line and someone (Collins if he didn’t get there so slow) would’ve already gone back to Simmons already.
"A 3&amp;D player IMO is a player who plays above average defense or is considered an above average defender (ideally someone who can guard the opposing team's 1st or 2nd best player), isn't really creating a lot of shots for themselves or others with the ball in their hands, and their primary role on offense is limited to taking and making threes. So guys like Danny Green, Robert Covington, Pat Beverley, Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and OG Annuoby would be what I'd consider 3&amp;D players.  Some of the guys you listed are good three point shooters and defenders, but they create too much offense for themselves and/or others to be strictly seen as 3&amp;D players."
"Yeah, who wants a high percentage high value look, right?  Danny Green only shoots 45% in the corners. Smh, what terrible offense.  That's 1.35 PPP....which is better than any team in the entire league averages in transition ."
Thats true.  Ben cutting left kinda ruined the opportunity for an open layup being created on the break  Also Danny green running down there like a handicapped person
Yup.. this one always gets me. And half the shooters out there have absolutely no d such as Reddick or korver. That's why getting a guy like Danny Green and Seth Curry in the same off-season has given us such massive improvements.
"Danny green somehow finds himself on a lot of contenders, I think that should say something"
"On a good team, Danny Green. On a bad team, Dillon Brooks."
Danny Green. Brooks has a horrible shot IQ.
I was thinking of Danny Green too. And Dwight at least knew and mastered his role.
Danny Green hits threes...all night long
Steven Adams+ Jason Mamoa  Ashton Kutcher = Kyle Korver  Danny Green = Lionel Richie  Tyreke Evans= Chris Tucker  Enes Kanter-= Freddie Mercury
Jayson Tatum deserves so much better than someone like Jaylen Brown.  Jaylen Brown is an embarrassment to the Celtics jersey and he should be embarrassed he even considered himself to be Tatum's equal. Aaron Nesmith showed more hustle and heart in one game last game than Brown did for the entire season. But we all know Brown is going to make some feel-good PR message after the game so green teamers will forgive him.  Brown needs to personally apologize to Jayson Tatum and the rest of the team at the very minimum. I hope Danny Ainge trades him in the off-season.

"Yes,Danny Green was robbed of finals mvp last year."
"While that may be true (it isn't) he has very real biases, for instance he thought he was a better player than Ginobili and Danny Green and complained that he should be playing over them which got him cut in 12-13 from the Spurs."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles.

Did you see how they reacted to Danny Green missing a shot?
This hypothetical was pointless because the real goat Danny Green would have won finals mvp in 2013
I thought Danny Green would have won that FMVP. He was playing lights out all series
"If they can get a more experienced veteran 3 and D and power forward it could potentially spark great things for the Wolves. If they fortunately keep the kick they have to GS, Mobley could even be one of the closing players in those lineups.  I feel like someone like Daniel House, Danny Green, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, JaMychal Green, etc would be good free agent or trade targets for boosting their defense and experience."
i would probably switch ginobili with danny green personally
"You can take your pick of Kawhi, Danny Green, FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol, OG and Ibaka"
"If the spurs win then there is almost no chance danny green doesn't win that finals mvp, he had the narrative of stepping up big and he was going crazy from 3.   Duncans legacy changes but he has 6 rings and 3 finals MVP's   Lebron isn't top 5 until last year when he won with LA although he would be criticized for never repeating"
"Tony Parker didn’t even have as much final mvp talk as Danny green did lol  But after Danny cooled down, it was clearly Duncan. Heat had no answer for him"
"He's looked a lot better these last few months on offense, way more than clueless  Also, 61% of his shot attempts are 3s, so just hitting his shots a little more consistently would go a long way towards his effectiveness / impact on that end  He's also shown improvement and more confidence attacking closeouts / taking people of the dribble   He definitely has potential to be a Danny Green type 3&amp;D player, but with less shooting and more defensive impact"
Jordan literally wouldnt make the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 Cavs teams LeGOAT took to the finals  IM not talking about in the d league expansion plumber era late 80s and 90s where jordan made the playoffs going 30-52. Im talking about in the modern era  You obviously don't care about facts  None of Jordans finals performances was 1/10 as good as Lebrons vs the Spurs and Warriors. Even though Lebron was being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and Green instead of Pe teachers  like Danny ainge and Jeff horansec  Learn something before you start yapping non sense
The same instathot tried to get Danny Green caught up because he was messing with her behind his girl's back lol
"Danny Green is way better defensive player, most of the time people forget because he didnt have athletic blocks. Matisse still lose his players on backdoor, i believe he will fix it in 1-2 year"
I did not know that Danny Green started his career in Cleveland
Danny Green
"If the ask is for the raptors to spend their cap space on Danny green and George hill, then there had better be some serious sweetener. Otherwise Kyle can play in Miami and Philly can waste another year of embiid’s prime."
Our offense is pretty  balanced after Joel and Tobi  Ben Simmons - 14.6 ppg  Shake Milton - 13.3 ppg  Seth Curry- 12.2 ppg  George Hill - 10 ppg  Furkan Korkmaz - 9.6 ppg   Danny Green - 9.5 ppg  Tyrese Maxey - 7.5 ppg
My goodness danny green has been mobile
Danny Green has been good on the Sixers this season tbh
"1995 was definitely a huge chokejob. It’s close to the Warriors choke job, but it’s not as high since it wasn’t in the Finals. Suns were the heavy, heavy favorites in 1995. They had home court over the 6th seeded Rockets and were up 3-1. And their second best player, Kevin Johnson, had the best playoff run in his career. You usually don’t ever lose with that combination, but somehow they found a way.  The Suns were loaded: Barkley, Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle were multiple time All-Stars with Barkley a former MVP, and they had great veteran role players in AC Green, Danny Ainge, and Wayman Tisdale (the first 2 with multiple championships). They also had former All-Star Danny Manning, but he got injured, which probably cost them since it was so close."
damn i totally forgot danny green played with shaq
"Yo I totally forgot danny green was on that cavs roster. That dude has been on so many great squads, wtf."
you're comparing all time with right now. When Kobe was playing his last season he was arguably the worst starter in the league but you wouldn't say Danny Green was was better all time than him. Russ has clearly had a better career than Embiid and Jokic and a better one than Dame and Kyrie too.
is that Danny Green? next to Shaq?
Danny Green hate was a strong one and he would have been our best shooter this season lol
"True. Thought his contract was up but I was mistaken. Ah well, wouldn't mind a Danny Green reunion, we can always use a bench vet"
&gt;assets that can be moved for more picks  Which assets? Be specific. Nobody is moving picks for maxey and Danny green.
Tyrese Maxey isn’t scraps. Dude has real potential to be a star one day  Plus Masai apparently had a team lined up to flip Danny Green immediately
"Lol buddy he got traded as a salary dump that was sweetened with a 1st round pick. Aka his contract/player is so bad that they had to give away assets to get rid of him. I like Danny green but I don’t know if he is worth a first rounder.   Do you really think that a team would give away positive assets for a 34 turning 35 year old on a 25 million m/year contract? Can you think of a team who has the cap space and/or assets to do that?   And yeah, I think presti hasn’t gotten as much heat because it is still early in their tank, and the Horford mess isn’t of his own doing."
"If that happens to them, I wonder what will happen to Danny Green???  Dare I say he may get.....death threats...."
Tobias and Simmons contracts are miles better than Siakam and FVV lol. And we got off of Horford for Danny Green who’s shooting 43% from 3 this year and playing great D
"&gt;his contract is so bad that he can't be traded  Bruh he literally just got traded 7 months ago. You can't even say that he can't be traded for positive assets because we got Danny Green in the trade who has been a starter for us all year and is one of the reasons we're competing for the one seed rn.  I also absolutely do not fault them for benching him, it's what I would do too. My whole rant has more to do with the hypocrisy of the NBA than it does with a personal issue with the Thunder. I think what Presti is doing is great, and he can be much more extreme about it because he is in a small market that doesn't impact the revenue sharing of the league. Which is really why Hinkie got ousted and Presti isn't getting any backlash for this. Never get between a billionaire and their money, let alone 30 billionaires."
"sixers have shown Thybulle is untouchable, so who are they going to offer? Mike Scott and Danny Green? I don't get it."
"I mean we had ibaka and danny green just a couple of seasons ago, but i get what you are saying."
"Paul George wasn’t even the best player on the roster dude. They had prime George hill, a really good David west, Roy hibbert anchored the number one defense in the league and lance was great off the bench.   The other team that took them to 7 was the Spurs who had 3 hall of fame players, future dpoy/2X nba champ kawhi, Danny green who was the best transition defender in the league at the time and they were all coached by the second greatest coach of all time."
so danny green goes to gsw
What can they even offer to match the salary for us to be interested? I don't want a Danny Green on a 20m contract
"It was also reported by multiple journalist that 6ers offered no picks, Danny Green and Maxey"
If Danny green doesn’t run into Klay Thompson under the basket on a breakaway I feel like they’d have at-least won game 6 in 18-19. That’s just my take though.
 i don’t even know how a sign and trade would work for us. Danny Green will be a free agent so if we wanted to sign and trade the raptors would have to agree to a 3+ year contract with him. also pretty sure he can’t be signed and traded with other players?   George Hill and Seth Curry could be used to get to like ~17 million i guess
"Are you suggesting that OG would struggle playing beside Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, prime Danny Green, Manu Ginobli with Pops as his coach?   It isn’t like Kawhi was a true first option at age 23 and he was on one of the most equal opportunity offences of all time."
This man really just put danny green ahead of thybulle lmao
Third best defender on his team? Whos better lmao joel and danny green? 😭😭
Honestly I think Vassell’s ceiling is somewhere between Middleton and Klay. It undersells him to describe his ceiling as an improved Danny Green imo
"The post was one in a series exploring their patterns of consistent growth and how it has us excited. I don’t think Sexton’s 25 game sample size means he’s better than players who average more points on more consistent efficiency. Sexton is also a much much more consistent player than Murray. Guys like Murray and Danny green and even ray allen are prone to shooting streaks, but that means who they are at their peak is not who they are as players.  &gt; Imagine thinking 24 ppg over a small stretch of hot shooting from a notoriously inconsistent player is anything at all, let alone justifying a guy who averaged 30+ ppg on higher efficiency   That’s what I said. If anything my post just shows how little 24 ppg is. Even guys like Sexton can average higher ppg over 25 game sample sizes. Go look at harden. Dude averaged 43 ppg over 20+ games lmao."
Don’t forget about Danny Green. I think that’s what hurt the most about the trade.
"Demar is way more talented than Danny green, but if I already had my core established, I would rather have Danny green.  For example, the sixers are much better off with Danny green than if they had demar"
"Definitely. They had Siakam, Kawaii, Danny Green, and Lowry. I really wanted Raptors to win that one"
"Danny Green is my favorite Spur outside the big 3, but I remember reading that thread last year, I almost spit my coffee all over my computer while reading all the dumb takes  No way Danny is better than Demar, and that's coming from a huge Danny Green fan"
if you actually think Manu coming off the bench for Danny Green for the Spurs is the same for DLO coming off the bench for Ricky fucking Rubio then idk what to tell you bud other than that you're dumb as hell lmfao.
"Ok Danny, time to go get these 2 and get javonte green back please"
It maybe because Danny green is a positive defender who makes good rotations?
If Danny Green was so bad at his job why was he playing so many minutes in the playoffs?
"Of course you can look at them with scrutiny or question the kind of player they are, you can trade them or waive them or whatever you want to do, that’s all totally normal.  You will *never* convince any players organization to penalize players who make a good faith effort but do not succeed, because that undermines the whole nature of the business. Nullifying contracts due to good faith failure is completely beyond the pale.  If Danny Green shoots threes and misses them, he has fulfilled his contract, even if you’re dissatisfied with the result.  If Danny Green hypothetically refused the shoot the entire playoffs, or committed intentional turnovers like we see here, then *maybe* you would have a leg to stand on in arguing he was derelict in his contract obligations.  But these are two different issues that *must* be approached differently by any governing body or Player’s Union."
"I won't ever forget ppl saying that Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma were better pieces than DeMar, never."
"This is silly, couch-tier analysis. No one would take this seriously when considering contracts and their implications.   Sometimes shots go in, sometimes they do not go in. If you gave Danny Green the choice to make those shots, he would obviously choose to hit them and it’s silly to suggest otherwise.  This year he’s shooting well. Are you suggesting he is trying for the Sixers in some way he wasn’t for the Lakers? This model role player who has been on multiple title teams? Your argument doesn’t hold up to any scrutiny.   Shooting well or not is a fundamentally different issue than actively not giving effort or whatever the hell Love is doing."
"No, not right. You’re completely distorting the original point, which actually made sense. Danny Green didn’t shoot poorly because of lack of effort or professionalism, he just shot poorly.   That is the natural risk of any contract. Sometimes guys underperform, sometimes they overperform.  Has nothing to do with the kind of stuff Kevin Love is pulling and the questions it raises."
Because Danny green isn’t running a bank that makes money giving out bad loans to poor people.  You can’t equate doing poorly at your job to billionaires robbing people and not paying taxes lmao
Sometimes players really think they’re oppressed when you got guys like Danny green making 15 mil for the Lakers but shooting 29 percent from 3 in the entire playoffs for them. The owners are far from perfect but it goes both ways
"I think they definitely have gotten better. Outside of individual improvements between seasons like Kuzma and THT, the lakers basically replaced rondo and Dwight with the Shroeder and Montrezl. One was the 6th man of the year and the second was a runner up. Danny Green has been replaced by Wes Matthews and Ben McLemore. And Javale has been replaced with Drummond and Gasol. I’d consider them much deeper this year than last year. In terms of getting reps in with the full team healthy, you have a point, but hopefully with LeBron returning in this last stretch, they will begin to pick things up."
Dillon Brooks = Evil Danny Green
"Are you seriously saying that a combined DeRozan and Peoltl are worth less than Danny fucking Green?? This has to be the hottest take I’ve ever seen on this sub, and that’s really saying something."
Somebody in a game thread called Danny Green FaZe Tony Allen and I haven’t moved on from it since
Danny Green
I was one of the few Lakers fans who loved Danny Green
My guys a Lakers fan and he said he trusts Danny Green for shooting 💀
"Come playoffs I trust Seth Curry, Danny Green and Shake Milton over the Bucks shooting outside of Kris and Jrue."
Their team is poorly built. They got a good deal for AD and they are by no means where they could be. It's still a team hastily thrown together and now that they can see what zion and BI are like playing at that level scoring wise they can work on finding some good shooters and or some guys who can play good defense.  Idk if it's whatever scheme they run but their defense shouldn't be as bad as it is.  They are no means a guaranteed good team eventually but to say they don't have an opportunity to do so is unfair imo.  They are not a good team right now obviously. But zion and BI both have more room to grow. They still have Hart and Lonzo as of right now that have more room to blossom as well. They have a lot of young players and a team that was not built for zion. Lots of room for improvement in general.   Would I bet my money on this? No I would not but hey sometimes franchises get that break they need.  Toronto got Kawhi and Danny Green and that pushed them to the level they needed to win after years of mediocrity and lebron james sweeps. Not to mention they got fucked pretty hard. Boogie going down and then AD forcing his way out.
"Well Rondo may be shit spacing but he's a genius basketball mind.  Your second unit was in good hands and he can play call on defense and offense as well as LeBron in the way that he elevates teammates.  Losing him is rough, and it's not something you see in the regular season since he phones it in harder than anyone.  I think Marc Gasol is saving himself for the playoffs to an extent, and with him picking up playmaking duties and spacing the floor some you guys will be on par with your offense last year.  You also lost Danny Green, who was streaky throughout the year but hit big shots in the playoffs while playing killer defense.  All that being said, Drummond is an animal and will allow AD to avoid the physical beating while dishing out a pretty insane beating himself.  Rebounding will be insanely lopsided and nobody is scoring in the Lakers key with Drummond/AD featuring LeBron helpside, Morris tackles and Gasol off the bench.  Teams are just going to have to be insanely hot from 3 to touch you, that or hope you get injured."
"No, Kawhi was not the biggest reason - it was the fact that once klay was down, the raptors pretty much had better players from 2-8  Steph Kawhi is close, Lowry was better than dray (and better than klay too imo), and from there it's iggy, looney, cousins, mckinnie, bogut vs ibaka, vanvleet, siakam, gasol, danny green, norman powell"
"Sixer's no doubt.  Embiid is great but Minnesota is built on mobility and he wouldn't really fit in that style.  Meanwhile KAT is the best 3p shooting big man, and they already have Seth and Danny Green. So having that kind of space inside would definitely help Ben Simmons thrive on drives to the rim. I think the synergy clearly tilts on the Sixer's side."
"Lmao yup. Someone will say something about Danny, and then a Lakers or Raps fan will jump in with ""well, as a Danny Green expert, he is called Icy Hot for a reason""  It's like damn I guess he wasn't with us for the better part of a decade lol"
"Don’t think this is a good take. He’s much better as a PF next to embiid than as a SF next to horford and embiid. Especially with Seth and Danny green to now provide additional spacing.  The roster last year was just FUBAR. Morey came in and made a couple of smart moves to balance it out. And while I don’t have a ton of love for doc as a coach, he’s better than Brett brown. And he’s coached tobi before and has familiarity with his game and how to use him.  Contract might still be a bit of an overpay (and I say this as an alum of UT who loves tobi) but it’s nothing crazy bad. He’s still productive and a solid fit next to their two best players."
"Oubre, Schroeder, Danny Green, and KCP all make around $15M/year. Zo is getting more than that for sure"
Danny Green
"Post 2014 Championship Danny Green. He was so frustrating Tim Duncan flat out said he sucked at one point  Current? I think it is Rudy Gay, he takes Minutes off our young guys and isn't really that good when on the court"
Contending teams like to pick up Danny Green. It's not an accident.
"Did the Raptors win the trade? Yes, a championship is worth anything. But a 4x All-star still in his prime, a decent bench big, and a 1st rounder for a player that wasn’t gonna play for you and Danny green is not getting “scammed”"
Tough choice between Danny Green and Anfernee Simmons
Idk but I am scared . They are a scary team and that evil Danny green guy is good.
"Presumably we're not including LBJ.  Kyrie's the most obvious choice if we're talking just top-25 level players IMO as a few more with the nets seems possible and then maybe one down the line as a bench retiree.  If we loosen the ""star"" requirement a bit Rondo  If we loosen it even more Danny green."
Danny Green
I'd put those right up there next to Danny Green for Horford's salary dump and a pick lmao east GMs been on one this year
Seth Curry and Danny Green will totally light it up while Green can neutralize a hurt Beal and Simmons too big and too good of a defender for Russ
"yep just switched on danny green for wes matthews. Really loving Matthews ability to step up under pressure, thats a good vet. Struggled all year but when it really mattered he knocked down the tough shots"
"Spurs had TP Manu Danny Green Kawhi Marco belinelli patty mills and Cory Joseph, they were really deep. Tony Parker was absolutely an elite scorer, Manu was still explosive, Kawhi made big shots and Danny green couldn’t miss, pretty disrespectful statement to that team. Also imo jrue and Kris are capable of avg 25+ easily considering higher volume and mins in the playoffs."
"Somehow I thought Jeff Green and Danny Green before Draymond, my less dumb brother."
Fr this man jogging around like Danny Green
Danny Green getting the recognition he deserves lfg
Danny Green best defender of all the D. Greens
It's so dumb. We literally just took Horford off their hands and traded them Danny Green and George Hill lol. They should be thanking us for tanking!
I really love the nickname Evil Danny Green for him
"Man, remember when Danny Green missed that game-winner in the Finals?  That poor dude."
How exactly do you know I’m mistaken? Are there stats that point out how much better Thybulle’s shooting has been with Danny Green as a mentor?
I wish more people on this sub got to watch Danny Green during his Spurs title run.   Way too many people just watched him the last two years when his shot was off during the playoffs. They forget about how great of a 3&amp;D wing Danny was in his prime.
"I never made an assumption of that.   And never said that having a teammate good at a skill will benefit you. However if you think having someone like Danny Green being able to mentor you provides no value than you are mistaken. So much of shooting is about confidence, mentality, getting yourself in the right spot, etc. This isn’t just Danny Green saying “tuck your elbow in” this is Danny Green being able to pass down the years of drills, information, advice he received from experience or from working with one of the best shooting coaches of all time in Chip Engelland.   Clearly it takes hard work and practice to get better, all I’m pointing out is that mentors also help. Acting as if having a prototype 3&amp;D guy who played on 3 different championship teams, provides no value to a young inexperienced player is an odd take."
"Oh yeah I’m rooting for Thybulle to become as good of a shooter as possible because his defense is legit fun to watch.  I just don’t like when people assume a guy is going to improve shooting because he gets some tips and tricks from other good shooters. If Thybulle’s going to become a good shooter, it’s going to be because he dedicates himself to working on it all off-season, every offseason. Not because Danny Green told him to tuck his elbow in a little bit more."
Schröder is just coming back from being out. Before he went out he was playing better than regular season Rondo ever had.  Also it's not really fair to compare them since they replaced Danny Green with Schröder.
I absolutely wanted Danny Green to still be on the team. He's awesome and imo a huge locker room guy too.
"How can you say ""You don't represent the entire fanbase"" in one sentence and in the very next, say ""EVERYONE wanted Danny Green off the team""? You also do not represent the entire fanbase and clearly, at least one person in said fanbase did not want Danny Green off the team."
I'll never forget the incredible defense Danny Green played on Klay during 2019 Finals. It's like Klay couldn't even move
if Thybulle could shoot anywhere near Green he is immediately the best 3 and D specialist in the league.  Tisse is 35% on 2.4 attempts. Danny is 40% on 6.3  i would absolutely take 35% on 4+ attempts out of Tisse
Perfectly fine actually with Danny Corner and Seth Green Machine
"Disagree, Warriors fans are nowhere near our levels of toxicity  If we have a role player that plays bad (a la Danny Green or KCP) we’ll have a field day of salty trade this guy. Danny Green got death threats after missing that 3 in the finals last year (which was pathetic that people would do that)   If a role player on the Warriors plays bad they’ll have zero slander tolerance threads all over"
"I mean I’ve never hated cp3. I don’t think I’ve ever hated a player except for probably Danny green and Hollins’s stupid ass, and that’s really more of a strong dislike"
That's just Danny Green. Brooks is pretty fucking fun.
"You don't represent the entire fanbase. EVERYONE wanted Danny Green off the team. His 3 pt shooting was Kyle Kuzma level bad in the finals. His IQ on defense is elite, but everyone wanted to off-load a $15 million/year player who was only playing defense. You're not seeing my point that we still needed Schroder this regular season to deal with the Lebron/AD injuries. You can't debate that."
Evil Danny Green
Kuz and Danny Green were not great at all
"I've disliked Schroeder for years, nothing new about this one for me. He doesn't plays intelligent basketball.  I love Green, he's just expensive. People who don't watch basketball much hate that dude. But he's one of the great role players. His IQ on defense and offense is phenomenally high. Love Icy Hot. I have no complaints for Danny.  Rondo and Caruso would be a much better PG tandem. Schroder just plain doesn't do anything exceptional and it hurts us when he's out there. Can't rely on him to do anything.  I hope Vogel kills his and Drummond's minutes. Cause we ain't doing nothing with those two playing more than 15 a game."
"How ? Caruso, KCP and Kuzma are all better than they were last year.  Drummond/Gasol/Trezz gives us way more flexibility than Dwight/Javale did.  Schroeder is better than Rondo.  So really it's just the downgrade for Danny Green to Wes, and Kieff slumping hard."
Danny Green shouldn't be on the list.
"Because you are effectively fining them for making errors in their job. You dont fine baristas for bad coffee, Danny Green missing a three or a chef overcooking their food."
"Yeah but we need that secondary ball handler and driver penetration. Schroeder has a better handle than Caruso and THT second to only Bron on the team. Also Schroeder plays hard and has good D, not as good as our other guards but not bad. He replaces rondo and brings other things to the table save for leadership, IQ and passing, it was a trade off. Wes Matthews replaces Danny Green, and they are about equal with the edge to green in shooting and Matthews in defense."
I strongly disagree on Danny Green being put in this list.
"It's the Danny Green, FVV, Pat Bev style   If refs don't call it, it's good defense in my opinion. I hate that it isn't called though."
If that's the case then the Lakers should have held onto Danny Green. He knows his role and isn't asking for more than $24 million a year.
Danny Green money is his max if his agent can negotiate
evil danny green
Yeah just like Danny green a Klay right......
Evil danny green is so accurate
"""evil danny green"" LMAO"
Danny Green looks slightly more like Lionel Ritchie than Brooks looks like Green if that makes things less confusing 👍
Almost as good as evil Danny Green
Just how good is Danny Green?
Schroeder doesn't work on Lakers nearly as well as Rondo/Danny Green did even if he's the better player  &amp;#x200B;  Lakers genuinely look better as a unit with Caruso on the floor
Don’t disrespect Evil Danny Green
"I'm sure trading for a top 5 player, upgrading the centre, getting Danny Green while there was still hot to his icy hot, and FVV and Siakam having breakout performances had nothing to do with it."
Good Danny Green could NEVER
Pop traded Kawhi and Danny Green for Derozan and Poetl + a first round pick lol
 Dillon Brooks does look and play like an evil chubbier Danny Green.
Evil Danny Green
Dillion brooks aka Fat Danny Green makes 11M per year. Danny green makes 15M per year. Something lakers fans in our sub can never get behind
Evil Danny Green is just a nickname this sub came up for Dillon Brooks Because they look alike haha.
Danny Green + Josh Hart = Dillon Brooks  Edit: + Michael Jordan
Fat danny green is balling today and i love it
"2020 regular season:  KCP 38% 3FG  Danny Green 37% 3FG  AD - deadly midrange   Playoffs  Morris 40% 3 FG  Rondo 40% 3 FG  AD 38%   Tucker 40%  KCP 38%  Way more shooting than Russ, Roberson, and Adams"
holy fucking shit poor mans danny green has sucked off the refs to get away with everything
"Danny Green is evil Danny Green. Just ask Klay Thompson, or a Holocaust survivor."
Dillon Brooks is evil Danny Green
Did you watch Lakers regular season and playoffs. KCP and Danny Green couldn't make 3's for their life and only for spread out games. they weren't consistent at all. 2020 lakers team wasn't a great 3 point shooting team im sorry
So you think Russ at 30% 3FG and Roberson at 25% 3FG is better than KCP at 38%3FG and Danny Green at 37% 3FG in 2020?
EVIL DANNY GREEN AT IT AGAIN
"I understand that's what it does. I think that's bad for the league. Upping max contracts would balance out. Stars would get higher contracts, role players would take a bit of a hit. Instead of Danny green getting 15 million a year he might get 10. Jarrett allen wouldn't be looking at getting 100 million, hed be probably getting 60. Guys would be getting paid much closer to they're actual on court value. All the current system does is hurts team like cleveland that are forced to pay exorbitant amounts for role players while bigger markets can get stars for bargains"
Danny Green and KCP are good 3 point shooters. Much better than Russ and Roberson. AD is awesome at mid range. Much better than Adams who made 3 total baskets beyond 10 feet in the entire 2016 season
"As a team they were not great. But they still had KCP and Danny Green who are good 3 point shooters. Plus AD is deadly at mid range. That is much better shooting than Russ, Roberson, and Adams"
Evil Danny Green is the heart of our team
Fat danny green got more hops than danny green
Evil Danny Green cannot be stopped.
Someone called Brooks 'Fat Danny Green' a minute ago and now that's i can see when i look at him.
Evil Danny Green strikes again.
Dude said fat Danny Green
Fat Danny Green came out to play today
Wtf fat danny green can fly
"1. No, there's nothing wrong with being an elite athlete, but relying entirely on your athleticism over improving your fundamentals makes you predictable, and predicable players get shutdown in the postseason.  There are all sorts great players that come from different molds from Jokic, to Curry, Lebron, Kawhi. Embiid, etc.  The one commonality between all these players is they have deep tool kits, allowing them to beat you in a myriad of ways, WB is just a one trick pony, and its a good trick, but not good enough to make a deep playoff run.    2. His defense is the same as his offense, entirely reliant on athleticism, with poor fundamentals, he makes flashy play but get beat way to regularly, most top guards are wayyy better defenders than WB, which is sad since he has significantly better tools than most of them  3. Within the NBA ecosystem there are a variety of different types of role players.  Some are purely one dimensional guys, spacers like Korver or Mcdermott, defenders like Thybulle, they have one elite skill and are meh at everything else.  Others have 2 skills they excel at, 3&amp;D players like Danny Green, Alex Caruso, etc.  Still others are multi dimensional role players, like Andre Iguodala, Aaron Gordon, etc.  WB turns all role players into one dimensional tools, which if youre a one dimensional role player is great, but if you have more to your game it hurts those players ability to contribute by crowbaring a round peg into a square hole (see Oladipo's and Sabonis's growth after they left OKC).    4. Sure but WB takes it to another level, dude hunts Triple doubles.  There is no rebound myth, lmfao WB collects tons of ez defensive rebounds rather than leaking out so his bigs can pass him the ball to start the break.  You can easily inflate assists, just run low percentage actions off P&amp;R, EZ.  5. Ah yes the KD choked narrative, lets look at the final 3 games of that series  Game 5:   KD: 12-31, 40 pts, 7 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 3 TO's, -4  WB: 11-28, 31 pts, 7 rebs, 8 assists, 5 steal, 1 block, 7 TO's, -9  Verdict: they either both choked or both played meh  Game 6:  KD: 10-31, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 2 steal, 3 block, 3 TO's, -6  WB: 10-28, 29 pts, 7 rebs, 9 assists, 4 steal, 0 block, 5 TO's, -11  Verdict: once again they both chocked, but WB def chocked the game away turning the ball over 4 times in the final 2 mins  Game 7:   KD: 10-19, 27 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 2 TO's, -4  WB: 7-21, 19 pts, 7 rebs, 13 assists, 2 steal, 0 block, 3 TO's, -14  Verdict: WB chocked  WB chocked 3 out of 3 games, KD chocked 2 out 3.  Also just for fun Wb career playoff stats  106 games played, 24.8 pts, 7.7 A, 7.0 Rebs, 1.8 steals, .3 blocks, on 41/30/83 splits, with an eFG of 44.4.  6. 2011 playoffs, game 5  OKC vs. Denver, KD definitely didnt carry his ass.    KD: 14-27, 41 points, 5 rebs, 2 assist, 1 steal, 2 blocks, 0 TO's,   WB: 3-15, 14 points, 5 rebs, 4 assists, 1 steal, 0 blocks, 3 TO's  7.  Really?  Then how were the Spurs so successful? or the Mavs with Dirk?  or the early 2000's Pistons?  Or the 2012-2016 warriors?  There are plenty of teams that found postseason success without multiple superstars.  Virtually every WB centric team has catered to his needs and its proven not to work.  If he needs such a narrow team construction that its virtually impossible for a GM as good as Presti to build around him, maybe he just isnt that great of a player."
He should be thanking Pop for being petty enough not to deal with LA and for Danny Green for taking Klay out
"&gt; You won a championship because Kawhi became available and **they got him**  Lol. People always skip over this part like we just tossed a coin and it landed Raptors.. How did we get him? Why are you ignoring that very relevant part? We played consistent Basketball for 5+ years. That's what made Demar appealing at the time for a team that didn't want to tank and wanted to keep making runs in the playoffs.   Was Masai some kind of wizard getting Danny Green and not giving up Pascal or OG? Yes. Did Masai capitalize on a perfect opportunity? Yes. Was he the only one with the balls to do it? Yes. But the fact that he did that is because the team we had built over the years was able to make that trade.   You can't just ignore that because it's inconvenient for your narrative.   &gt; The lack of tanking didn't win you that title.  You're being incredibly naive. The lack of tanking and focusing on our G League system, and drafting smart in the lower positions in the draft that we had is 100% why Kawhi had the team around him that he did. Pascal, Fred, OG, and Delon, a key piece in the JV trade for Marc, were 100% from that system, drafting well and not tanking to do it.  &gt; GSW got injured.  And GSW won their title the year prior cause Chris Paul got injured, or they injured Kawhi a few years prior. Almost every championship team in the league can cite a direct case of a star player on an opposite team getting injured.   You're also doing an incredible disservice to the sport of Basketball by saying bullshit like this. No other team in the league barring a fully healthy GSW would've been able to get through those Philly and Bucks series. Just because Nick Nurse exposes Giannis doesn't mean he was exposed prior to that series."
"and Gasol, Danny Green. Cleveland has these two, Okoro, Allen and a bunch of guys who either belong on the bench or out of the league."
I meant they do in Seth curry and Danny green tho. At some point it's on the top guys. Embild has shown some flashes. But we haven't seen a Simmons fully take over.
"He shot 37% from three in the regular season and over 33% in the playoffs.   And his value on the defensive side, made up for whatever offensive short comings he had.   In the playoffs where the game grinds in the half court, having a guy like Danny Green, who cannot be targeted, and who is an elite transition defender is so valuable.  I mean the guy has been the starting shooting guard on four finals' teams and won three chips. And he will probably make another one this year."
I mean you’re kind of putting them all in a box. Mid range is only needed if you’re a shot creator and dribbling. But there’s plenty room for a guy that shoots 3s and no midrange so long as they play decent defense. Someone like Danny Green for example is always on good teams for a reason
"Just because it normally doesn’t happen because it’s not the most common method of team building and there’s only one championship each year doesn’t mean it’s literally impossible for it to happen. Do you really think the Jazz have zero chance this year? Do you really think a lineup of Holiday/Beal/Danny Green/Randle/Gobert would have no chance? 3 allstars, another allstar level player and an elite role player, but Gobert is the clear best player while Beal would clearly be the first option."
"he's already a very good defender and looks like he's finally turned the corner on the wrist injury that has been affecting his shooting since his senior year of high school, his biggest weakness has been his inability to stay healthy  he's not going to be a star but he's going to have a long career and make a lot of money as a high end role player à la Danny Green or Trevor Ariza if the injuries are behind him"
"For me, it's more I don't trust Tobias, Shake, and Maxey. I'm a little iffy on Danny Green, but the stats don't really match his reputation."
"Danny Green is a beast. He is criminally underrated year in and year out. This man is a 3 time champ, was undervalued when he moved to Tor in the Kawhi deal, and again when he joined the Lakers. He has played a solid role in all 3 of the titles he was in. You NEEEEED high level role players to have a big time time that aren't breaking the bank. The man just plays D and shoots 3s, spaces the floor. You don't hear complaining and he isn't trying to be a superstar. Its exactly what stars need around them"
seth curry and danny green. so obvious.
Danny Green has shown for a decade he can be the fourth best player on a championship team.  Laker fans don't know what the fuck they are missing. They still think the guy is a scrub because he didn't shoot 50% from three for them... Even though he helped them win a championship.
Yeah if they only had Danny Green they wouldn't be down 30 right now
"Its because every day he wakes up, he us either Danny Green or Danny red."
"He was given away by one, theirs no doubt that Schroder is an upgrade over Danny Green and it’s what we needed. We already have defensive guards  Danny Green is great though, provides great defense when his shot isn’t falling. A huge reason he has 3 rings"
"He also had an insanely good supporting cast though. He had great guard defenders, prime Danny green who was historically good in transition defense. A young kawhi who wasn’t a super star yet but was still a great defender  Duncan was still great as an anchor but he wasn’t exactly Rudy gobert"
Now show 40 point games in the finals  Versus defensive players of the year like Leonard and green not pe teachers like Danny ainge and Jeff hornasec
"There was another thread a few months ago, of someone actually doing an analysis of how many 3&amp;D guys there are in the league.   The conclusion was that we use the phrase as if there are a bunch of them to choose from, but 3&amp;D guys are actually pretty hard to come by.   And Danny Green is, even at his age, still one of the better ones and one of the few."
"That’s fair but outside of rondo, what other guys who left had stellar playoff performances? Danny Green was solid on D but played poor offense, Dwight had 1 or 2 good games against Denver but nothing crazy outside of that, Javale didn’t even really play… I just think it’s a safe bet that the new combo of Trezz, Drummond, Shroder, Gasol, and Matthews will be better than last year’s guys."
"To be fair, people stupidly shit on Danny Green because he played for the Lakers. He was great on the Raptors, a liability in LA, and then all of a sudden he’s “sneaky good” in Philly."
Already considered good and added Danny Green and Seth Curry and Dwight Howard and found a way to effectively use Tobias Harris
Saving this comment for the playoffs. Loved Danny Green last year. Also hated Danny Green last year.
Forget this streaky BS. Danny Green is an elite 3 point shooter. Simple as that
"Only if KD blows his achilles and Danny Green checks Klay Thompson while in the air so he tears his ACL.  Other than that, no."
"They lack defense and playmaking. Like on our team you had Gasol, Danny Green, Siakam, Lowry, FVV who are all good quality defenders to put around Kawhi who is obviously a great defender. And we had Nick Nurse as a coach who can run a great defense with the correct personal. Clippers have Kawhi and PG but other than that there is literally no defense, scheme wise and personal wise.  Playmaking wise we had Lowry and Gasol, Clippers have...20 minutes of Rondo? That's it really"
"I think there's only really a small table of elite 3&amp;D swingmen in the league, and Jae is certainly one of them:   * Jae Crowder  * Robert Covington  * Mikal Bridges  * Marcus Morris  * Danny Green  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * OG Anunoby * Dorian Finney-Smith * PJ Tucker"
It's not just Embiid. Doc is always treating him like some special needs kid too. Danny Green too.
The difference is a series is not that long. They could very well shoot that good for the whole series. Like vanvleet going nuclear against bucks and warriors or Danny green against heat in 2013
"Agreed. Losing Danny would be losing an important dimension to our lineups, and a solid vet presence on the wing. Losing Green is the same but just for your frontcourt. Hope he's able to tough it out and get back soon"
It’s a huge loss against bucks and Phillys front line. Also he’s being reevaluated in 10 days it’s unlikely he returns at the 10th day. Also even if he does return it’s something that will likely bother him for the rest of the postseason. He was the 5th guy in our best lineup.  I know everyone doesn’t care because we’re a super team but it’d be the equivalent of Philly losing Danny green. He’s a key cog for us and has been all year
-fan of the team who sent Danny green death threats for missing a shot
facts fuck evil danny green tho with his mugatu ass haircut
It wouldn't be dropping back off of those guys.  Plus Miami shot 20 threes in a game and still lost.  Bucks will make the sixers shooters beat them not Embiid and Simmons.  Plus if they need to they have a switching scheme.  Also I hate when people say haven't seen them play.  Wtf I'm watching the playoffs I know what they are doing.  I've seen them all year.  If you lose a series because Danny Green and Seth Curry goes nuts then so be it. The fact is Philly plays 2 in and 3 out which Milwaukee is exploiting against Miami who granted aren't as talented as Philly but it's not like the Heat suck.
Devonte Graham  Danny Green  DeAndre Hunter  Chris Boucher  Jakob Poetl
Sigh he’s been out for two years and the nephews are forgetting who Klay Thompson is. Thanks Danny Green!
"I mean I guess if instead of putting Joel Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Tobias Harris (all great shooters) we just put five Ben Simmons' out there."
Ugh he’s like a spur that has never played for the Spurs. Danny Green 10 years younger. Good in Matisse!
Dillion Brooks is 10x better than Danny Green on offense. All Danny Green does is shoot 3s and is one dimensional on offense
Danny green
"It happens, man. Every fanbase will have those assholes doing inexcusable shit. Like when some Lakers fans sent Danny Green and his fiancée death threats after Game 5 of The Finals last year. Fuck these types of ""fans"""
Why just replace danny green with tisse.
I love evil Danny Green
Imagine being an evil version of Danny Green
Evil Danny Green has got to chill
That's what I think of Evil Danny Green
Shall not underestimate evil Danny Green
I can’t get over someone calling Brooks the Evil Danny Green.
Evil danny green getting the Trae Young treatment
evil Danny Green thriving against boos
"Add Lowry to this team for one or two rotation players, then yes. But for the trade to work, we needed Danny Green, Maxey and Matisse. That's 2 or 3 rotational pieces (depending on Maxey's role atm) and basically our entire wing depth."
We were holding Tisse back in the Lowry deal. We offered Danny Green (salary match who they’d flip) + Maxey + two firsts and they asked for Maxey + Tisse   For Harden everyone was on the table
Lakers fans sent Danny Green death threats over a missed shot
Says the fans that went Danny Green and his fiancé death threats.
You guys were sending Danny green death threats lol
"I mean most teams don't have Simmons, Thybulle, and Danny Green"
Donovan about to shut down evil Danny Green to 2-13 shooting
"Wait were all the Wizards fans shitting on Danny Green? Oh that’s right no, they were not"
youre forgetting we have Danny green so we basically have won 2 rings in a row
I just noticed Danny Green has what looks like a Captain America and Iron Man tattoo on his shoulder that's pretty dope
Danny Green never misses the playoffs lol
athlete possibly. wouldn't count on him to hit a clutch shot in a Finals game though. he'd probably pass it to Danny Green again lmao
"I mean, if anyone was criticizing Ben for only scoring 6 points in this game, they shouldn't have. He had 15 rebounds, 15 assists, 1 block, 1 steal and was a +18. That's a damn good stat line. The Sixers had all the scoring they needed this game between Tobias and Embiid, not to mention Danny Green and Seth Curry.  Ben shouldn't be getting criticism for not scoring when his team doesn't need him to, the question is going to be whether he can score when the Sixers do need him to."
"THJ isn't really doing an impression, tbh. He's like the logical conclusion of Danny Green and just happened to hit a long enough streak of stellar shooting in time to dunk on the Clippers.  For all the shit KP gets, he was fine last game too."
"Seeing how lakers fans treated Danny green, locking the sub was a good move"
We don't have Danny Green anymore. He was always brave enough to clank an open 3.
"it's tough... but the one thing for sure is they would have steamrolled the east.  And if the Heat could go 6, the Raptors would at mininum got to 7 games.    It would have been the rubber match for Kawhi &amp; Lebron.  It would have been the dude who had kept the Raptors from winning... so many stories.  Would have been an amazing series.    (and we would have resigned Danny Green)"
"Yeah, at least Danny Green was willing to let it fly, death threats be damned."
Kawhi can't handle him? Ok throw OG or Siakam on him. Hell we'd still have Danny Green... God we were STACKED.
i think bucks sixers are nicely matched:  giannis/embiid ben/jrue middleton/tobias  i think it could come down to how seth curry and danny green play on a given night.
"All fun and games until they run into Embiid, Thybulle, Simmons and Danny Green for Harris"
Loved Bogdon for the Kings. Was tough to see him go but really glad he's shining in ATL. Dude's like a young Danny Green. Just needs himself some clutch playoffs game winners.
Throw in a Danny Green and OG Anunoby for good measure
6ers with Simmons/Embiid/Thybulle/Danny Green is nasty defensively. But I do think that the Bucks matchup the best at the end of the day.
We turned Horford into Danny Green. Don't let your dreams be dreams.
"I get what you're saying but I have to disagree.  I've watched him since SDSU, the guy is a winner.  Its not a coincidence that Spurs team continued to be good after Duncan left and who was his 2nd best player?  Aldridge? Danny Green?  He took them to the WCF and had a 20 pt lead on the Warriors before he got Zaza'd.  Also, yes Toronto had a good roster before he showed up but what did they do before with essentially the same team but DeRozan?  They were a joke lets be honest who always got owned by LeBron.  Insert Kawhi for DeRozan and suddenly they're winning a chip?  It can't just be because he had a ""good cast"".  There's a reason the Raptors aren't doing anything right now.  He proved he's the guy by carrying a team with Lowry as his 2nd best player to the chip vs the 76ers with Embiid, Simmons, Butler, the Bucks with Giannis and then the Warriors.  He made the Clippers relevant again and has been the only guy playing consistent, he laid a major egg in game 7 against the Nuggets as we all know but he played great before that against the Mavs and now again against the Mavs.  He also still has the highest winning percentage of any player ever.  Yes a big part of that admittedly is being drafted to the Spurs, load managing and maintaining a good win %."
"You can't say that when you guys beat us when our guys were just getting back from covid and we beat you when both teams were both healthy. I mean, you guys have reason to be confident against us, but we do too, seeing how Luka dominated that last game.  Anyway I don't really want to face that young Memphis team again, especially evil danny green. Definitely cheering for Jazz on this matchup."
"&gt; But with switching now where 1 on 1 defense is tougher and team defense is super important, and where Kawhi can't just be a defensive specialist on younger legs like he was on the Spurs, that gets tougher.  This, 100%. Kawhi can be that guy for a couple possessions, but he can’t sustain that kind of intensity all game long because of his offensive workload and his quad. When he was in Toronto, Danny Green would usually guard the other team’s best player, and then Nurse would sick Kawhi on him in crunch time."
Say what you want about Danny Green but at least he always shoots it because he knows that's his role.
"Yup. Bucks look about as complete a playoff team as possible in the East. If the Bucks can't stop the Nets, I doubt the Sixers can, unless Tobias, Seth, and Danny Green have the series of their lives."
hm that’s interesting too because if Danny Green stays who would we get instead to replace him?   I wonder if we would’ve picked up Seth instead who would’ve fit amazingly with LeBron. Definitely a very close series.
Kawhi and Danny Green to last year's almost ECF squad? I'm biased but that seems like championship was very possible. Like 50/50 odds at the least. A better vanvleet and norm too while siakam gets to be 2nd option.
"Can't do shit without the the lucky charm, Danny Green."
Well they would still have Danny Green to take out an important player of the other team so they definitely have a good chance
"These are all indisputably true, except obviously the Baby Thunder ages are exaggerated by a few years.  The way people overlook LeBron's 2011 esque choke in 2013 pre Ray Allen save is nuts.  7/16 and outscored by Tony Parker (who hit the game winner on him) in game 1 (loss)  7/17 and outscored by Mario Chalmers in game 2 (win, carried by Chalmers)  7/21 and outscored 27-15 by Danny Green in game 3 (loss)  8/22 and outscored by Tony Parker again in game 5 (loss)  2 turnovers and a bricked game tying 3 in game 6 before Ray Allen saved him"
hot take: drummond and gasol both suck; also losing high iq defenders rondo and danny green really hurting the coverage
"Reminder that LeMickey has the **most overrated** legacy of all time. **If Ray Allen didn't hit the most improbable shot in NBA history he would be 2-6-1 in the finals with 2 massive choke jobs in 2011 and 2013.**   7/16 and outscored by Tony Parker (who hit the game winner on him) in game 1 (loss)  7/17 and outscored by Mario Chalmers in game 2 (win, carried by Chalmers)  7/21 and outscored 27-15 by Danny Green in game 3 (loss)  8/22 and outscored by Tony Parker again in game 5 (loss)  2 turnovers and a bricked game tying 3 in game 6 before Ray Allen saved him  Not even top 10 all time"
Danny green if anything chased ring one time that is in LA.  He was traded to raptors and Spurs gave him a chance at first.
Unless it’s Danny Green
The Danny Green special
no I don't think so  should have kept Danny Green and D12
KCP is our new Danny Green
"I'll give you a refresher if you forgot, and don't disrespect Manu by calling him 'decent' lol. When Kobe, KD, LeBron, Wade and more, says he's one of the hardest match-ups and opponents you know he ain't just decent.    **2005 - Against the reigning 2004 Champions, Detroit**  This team is arguably the most defensive team in the league, so good they defeated the Lakers in 2004 and caused Shaq to leave the Lakers. In 2005 they faced the Spurs, and in that smothering defense, Manu was the one creating and making the shots. He was behind Timmy in scoring by 13 pts but had the playoff series high FG% of 49%. No Manu, no 2005 ring.   **2007 - Against a young LeBron, Cleveland**  In retrospect, LeBron's welcome to the league moment for his playoff career. Some could argue this was the time he realized that getting rings isn't a one-man affair. Manu took a smaller role since he was injured, but was still a key part of the team. He's just 2 pts behind Timmy in scoring, the next person behind him had 47 less. No Manu, no 2007 ring.  **2014 - Against the back to back Champions, Heat**  The infamous Heatles and the loss that cost them a three-peat and LeBron to leave. Manu at 36 has taken a step back here to make way for the younger Danny Green. But as a bench player, he still posted a series average of 50% FG, 40% 3PT, 4.4 AST, shot creator off the bench and veteran defense intensity whenever Green sits. This is debatable, but whenever Heat had a run, Pop would put Manu in to shot it down and create a run of their own. Kawhi was the bonafide star of this series, but it's ignorant to say that Manu wasn't a key contributor. No Manu, no 2014 ring.  Just to cap it all off how much of a winner and great return of investment he is, Manu Ginobili is one of two players to have won an NBA Championship, Euroleague Championship, and an Olympic Gold Medal. Find me a ""decent"" supporting cast/player that can do that."

"When guys get hot like that, it literally breaks the game. Not in a bad way...just gotta tip the hat.  If only Danny Green hadn't gone cold in 2013 after breaking the Finals record in the first 5 games, Spurs would have another banner."
"We’ve seen Embiid on Giannis before, man. Plus Simmons. Plus Danny Green. Plus Matisse.   Made threes is one thing. Our percentage with our guys that start is another.   Seth Curry and Danny Green shooting threes with elite defense is exactly how to beat you guys.  We have defenders that are not only capable, but are elite at defending your studs. And then Embiid is back in the paint."
"Danny Green is better than everyone thinks, but the rest is incorrect.  Rondo was awful in the regular season and didn't close games."
"You do realize that the only people you listed who were traded are Javale Mcgee and Danny Green, right? Lol"
Danny Green scares me bro. He’s always on the right team at the right time.
trading away danny green is honestly the biggest blunder in nba history. in an intense playoff series u got the 6'11 black morty from rick and morty playing like ben simmons or draymond green as a compliment to another star who can’t see the rim. meanwhile danny ain’t no pussy bitch he be bombing away that shit at a 40% clip. the lakers would’ve won in 4 if they didn’t trade danny green away for a 6’3 cheerleader that thinks he’s worth 25m a year when he’s outta the league in 3 years but now they gonna get swept
Here's an old grantland article about it https://grantland.com/the-triangle/danny-green-spurs-transition-defense/
"I think that is very short-sighted. Saddiq Bey is already six months older than JJJ. He is not a prospect and was not drafted to be one. He's supposed to be an nba-ready three-point specialist with decent defense and he's so far met the expectations for that. That's why he was a late first rounder. The one caveat being that he's been terribly inefficient from the floor this season and needs refinement on defense. He's not expected to ever be an all-star, his ceiling is a high-value wing on a championship roster (e.g. Danny Green).  But the problem is that Memphis just filled out their roster with solid, older college three-point shooters like Bane, Allen, and just added Melton. I don't see enough of a difference between Bane and Bey's ceilings to throw away JJJ. Besides, JJJ is one of very few shooting bigs with shot-blocking ability in the entire league. He's played basically 1.5 nba seasons. Steph Curry played 5 before even being an all-star and he's a top 5 all time player at his position. There is really no reason to worry about JJJ yet considering he just tore his acl and his per36 numbers (only played 23 mins this year) are already excellent."
Evil Danny Green getting that bag
Danny IcyHot Green. I miss him.
"no, he's evil Danny Green."
"What kind of shitty take is this.   LeBron being injured is an excuse, when has injury not been an excuse? They were 4th seed before injury. Did injury not affect the team's record?  2019 and 2020 also had completely different roster. How did you evaluate Bron vs AD's effectiveness on court when 2020 season had 10+ different players signed.  Like, Rondo played his brains out. Danny Green provided elite defense. You gonna use that as an argument for AD &gt; Bron?"
Danny green former champion was a big part of that too defensively. He was a great help defender. Also Dwight Howard a former multiple defensive player of the year and hall of famer . While maybe on offense they can be overlooked they did a lot of little things defensively I feel like we are missing. Mainly communication and knowing your role to a point that your rotations are happening in sync with the opponent.
"The fact we flipped him for Danny Green, who has been tremendous for us this year, is pretty astounding. Thank god for the tanking OKC Thunder."
"Well yeah I agree with that but the answer shouldnt be hunting for isos on danny green, unless by the answer I mean AI"
"But Im saying thats stupid to hunt for danny green, he will lock them up"
"Yeah he made a nice practice dummy for the Lakers last year lol. And LeBron got his 4th, AD his 1st, Danny Green his 3rd team"
"2013: Spurs Danny Green breaks Ray Allen's 3 point record in Finals, potential FMVP  2021: ex-Spurs Bryn Forbes breaks Steph Curry's 3 point record in Finals, potential FMVP"
"They have a great fucking culture in the organization.  Gasol, Conley and Tony Allen might not be playing there anymore, but the culture they established is going strong.  Evil Danny Green, Ja, Jonas, JJJ, etc... they all fit that hard-nosed ethic."
"Honestly - not even upset. When you get obliterated that hard it hurts *way* less than a close loss. This reminded me so much of the 2014 Finals vs the Spurs. An AMAZING start to the series (first 2 games then, Game #1 of this series) and then the team wanting revenge clapped the shit outta us shooting what feels like 70% from 3-point range. Bryn Forbes Spurs energy also added to that effect lmao, some Patty Mills/Danny Green/Boris Diaw bullshit.    We're gonna get clowned for being considered bubble frauds. That's fine. I wouldn't trade that improbable run for anything('cept for a title lol) - plus I think it's looking more realistic that all 4 conference finalists get eliminated in the 1st Round this year. There's a bit of Heat soul-searching that'll need to be done if we get swept tho(I don't expect us to, I expect us to respond in Game #3) but if we don't - it's gonna be a long offseason, 'specially cuz the only rotation guys under contract are Bam/Jimmy/Herro."
Fuck danny green clumsy ass
Dont disrespect and compare him to 3-time NBA champ Danny Green
I call it the Danny Green.  Ball out from 3 in the playoffs and your reputation will follow you no matter how icy hot you get.
"the bucks got Khris, donte, and jrue to backup giannis, who gets walls formed around him all the time. the Sixers tore through the league while dealing with injuries at the same time, they got danny green, seth curry, and tobias to complement joel."
Danny green dribbling
"I don't even think you have to compare our team to a dynasty to be disappointed. We basically traded Danny Green for an all NBA player, a pick, and a decent young center and over the next 3 seasons we got a 48 win season and two 37 win equivalent seasons. The year before we made the trade we had 47 wins."
"&gt;green wasn't misdiagnosed, spurs staff told him he had a strain and he played through it the rest of the season  Not according to him https://uproxx.com/dimemag/danny-green-groin-strain-undetected-spurs-medical-staff/"
Doesn't Danny Green hold the record for most threes in the Finals? Also isn't he one of the better wing defenders in the NBA?
Majin Danny Green
Now they got a confident Memphis and evil Danny Green to check Donny
Danny Green also worked with lethal shooter in the off season who has a track record of making guys elite shooters. He worked with randle and Bobby Portis as well who had career years
"Lebron effect of being a ball dominant player   Danny Green is really good as a shooter when he moves around a bit before shooting. In LA, he was spotting up a lot.   Schroeder and LeBron aren’t a good fit because Schro can’t shoot well"
"I agree with the 2020 Heat being far from a juggernaut and MKE should've stomped them by any considerable metric. As a fan, that series was a humongous disappointment and embarrassment.  However, the 2019 Raptors were a great team, and built considerably better than the 2019 Bucks. That season Kawhi legitimately had the best playoff run since Michael Jordan. Kawhi was far and above any single player in the league the postseason, and that obviously includes Giannis. So the Raps had the best player on the floor, and then significantly more depth, as their roster was peppered with borderline stars.  Lowry &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bledsoe  Danny Green &lt;&lt; Middleton (the Bucks only real advantage in the starting lineups)  Kawhi &gt;&gt; Giannis  Siakam &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mitotic   Marc Gasol &gt; Lopez  Bench of Ibaka, VanVleet, Norman Powell &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brogdon, Illyasova, George Hill  Us Bucks fans were hopeful in that series, especially once we were up 2-0, but that Raptors team was easily better than us on paper, and that's before accounting for Nuclear Kawhi being on a different level than Choke Giannis.  That 2019 Raptors team is somehow still underrated, despite winning a title. They were one of the most well built and deep teams the NBA has seen in a long, long time.   Kawhi, Siakam, Gasol, Ibaka is one of the best frontcourts of all-time. Combined they have 8 All-NBA teams, 9 defensive 1st teams, and 3 DPOYs.  The guard rotation of Lowry, Green, FVV, Norm was a step above MKE's Middleton, Bledsoe, Hill, Brogdon.  Nurse is a way better coach the Bud.  Toronto had every single advantage over the Bucks in that series, and again the only reason we were so disappointed is because we were up 2-0, and then game 3 was in our grasp and Giannis and Bledsoe choked harder than Boban's wife the first time she got on her knees.   So we felt like it should've been our series and we choked, but it's not like we were so much better on paper that it was flabbergasting that Toronto ended up winning, as *they* were clearly the better team on paper and on the court. Had MKE won, we would've felt like we stole that series, but not that we were heavy favorites that should've swept them."
"Bad shooters, but they turned on the 3 point shooting for the playoffs. Only danny green and kuzma seemed to be bad"
Seth Curry and 34 year old Danny Green? I suppose one is 3 and D
"Because his defensive capabilities were partially (at least) dependent on his athleticism. His shooting probably won't be impacted as much (will probably be rusty but thats diff), but he *may* see a dip in defense, and thats honestly what made him one of the best wings in the league. Plenty of players can shoot and have weak defense (seth curry for example).  Compare him with Danny Green, who played under the coach obsessed with fundamentals and ""good"" basketball for almost a decade during many of their championship runs, and was a very good 3nD wing (much like Klay). His defense comes from relatively high defensive IQ and less so athleticism, which is why he was still a player who could get minutes towards the end of his career (or so).   Not to say that Klay is low IQ, but he was way more of an athletic defender."
"Yeah.  He is no Danny Green, on defense, but he's improving. He still has room to improve on defense, but he's not the same liability he was before.  His decision making and shooting touch  are things he has to work on.  A LBJ style offense isn't the most natural of fits, but Kuz is working on it, even if he hasn't achieved what one hoped for."
I mean come on obviously injuries to role players matter less. All of what you said can be true but that doesn’t mean it means the same thing if Embiid gets hurt versus Danny Green. Green is a very useful veteran defender and shooter and it’s no coincidence he has three championships but if Danny gets hurt it might be harder for the Sixers to win the eastern conference finals. If Embiid stays hurt we might not even make it there
Between Jeff green and Danny green it’s probably a lock
"That's tuff is oversaturated partly just cause Lakers, had to do it one time is literally Danny green doing a heil Hitler at a Holocaust memorial, BEFORE the 3-1/Harambe chaos speedup, imagine that happening today, one is well above the other imo"
Who did Danny Green hurt?
It’s more brutal when guys like Danny Green spear your star player going up for a dunk. Fuck Danny Green
Yeah but Schroeder wasn’t our Danny green replacement.
"I don’t like the fact that ad being hurt is being used as an excuse. When ISN’T he hurt? You guys had defensive bigs that could protect the paint and weren’t old and slow. You also had a much better defensive backcourt with either Lebron, kcp, Caruso, Danny Green or Rondo playing. You guys replaced Dwight and Javale with Drummond who can only really rebound, Trez who’s only good in small ball lineups and Marc Gasol who’s decent in the paint but can never be drawn out on the perimeter. Then the back court was replaced by Wesley Matthews  who I wasn’t too big on he just felt like a worse kcp, Schroder who isn’t good on defense with an inconsistent offense and Ben McLemore, who didn’t play much but was dog shit and can’t play D.  None of the players you traded for or signed complimented this team at all"
Danny Green at the Holocaust museum when he sees the thousands of abandoned shoes from children that were put in concentrations camps:      “That’s tuff 🔥💯”
"We def need a ball handler than can hit the 3 at a consistent rate (doesn’t have to be elite) that can take the duties from lebron some plays, but who also can play defense. Tough thing is that we don’t have cap room to sign someone of that caliber. So with who we do have on our roster, I think Caruso would fit better in the starting lineup over Dennis. Sadly, Dennis didn’t bring his 3p% with him in that trade for for Danny Green. 39% with OKC compares 34% this year on way lower volume."
"your core was danny green, lbj, ad, rondo, kcp, dwight howard half of it is already gone lmfao"
I mean we did keep the core. On paper Dennis was much better than rando in almost every way and Danny green shot like 30% from 3 for us so he was not a good shooter when in the Lakers. The only regret I have is losing Dwight but the reality is the core was here. We just had injuries and players super underperformed in the playoffs.
76ers over Suns.  Whoever Danny Green plays for over Mavericks.  Whoever Danny Green plays for over Warriors.
"Flipping Danny Green and not resigning Dwight are probably the only moves that could even possibly qualify as mistakes. Danny for Schroder is only a bad move in hindsight, and even then Dennis provided solid playmaking and scoring that the Lakers *desperately* needed for a lot of the season, which Green would not have been able to provide. Not resigning Dwight was stupid, but it's not like he's a *huge* impact player or anything, he was DNP'd for tons of the playoffs last year and doesn't solve the Laker's core problem of bad shooting. Drummond probably played better than Dwight would have this series, for instance. Plus, GM's can't really be expected to predict locker room issues, which is really the only other major flaw the Lakers had this year. The fact is everything rests on whether LeBron and AD are fully healthy. Last year they were, this year they were not."
Plus if you keep Danny Green Seth Curry and Tobias you have awesome spacing.  Like thats a top 3 offense and Danny plus Embiid and whomever else can make you a top 10 defense easy.  That's a team that Brooklyn can't beat and everyone struggles with.
Yeah we still don't know that Kawhi can win without Danny Green
Aggressive Simmons is better for the defense when you have Danny green and Seth Curry in the corners
No bias. The 6ers are much better suited to stop the trae young high pnr than the knicks. Trae goes from getting guarded by reggie bullock or whoever on the switch to defenders like George Hill Danny Green Matise Thybulle Ben Simmons and Tobias harris.   Hawks have the size to match the 6ers but not the talent on defense to out play the 6ers offense.
He got he got a 6Moty in Dennis for Danny Green. Then Signed Gasol. If you want to get on him for signing Drummond or Not keeping McGee or Howard that’s fine. But to say he’s below average is terrible take. Faulting any GM because a superstar “fell into their lap” is dumb as hell
I think it's very close. Hawks can win if they play very hard. Coz trae would be guarded by Ben and you have great two way player in Danny green and offense in Tobias and curry. Moreover they have some toughness and veteran ability with Dwight. Not to mention sixers have great support pieces too that can evenly match the Hawks players. There is a reason why sixers didn't drop hard when Embiid was injured.
Your center and PG situation was always dicey. Drummond / old ass Gasol are worse than McGee / Howard. Rondo was better than Dennis. And Danny Green was miles better than Wes Matthews.  I thought last year's lakers squad was much stronger than this year's lakers. Don't most Laker fans feel this way?
Remember when everyone on r/nba kept saying what an upgrade over Danny Green he was? That was so funny.
"yeah lmao like sending Danny Green and Sheoeder death threats is fine, but mild criticism of lebron is off limits"
"I like how you just ignored SHAQ like I didn't bring him up lmao.  Lebron has played with multiple legit career 40% shooters from 3 every year like Kyle Korver on that 2018 squad but somehow those 3-pt snipers always shot like shit when they play with Lebron. Why is that? Maybe it's the Lebron system that they were playing in? For a guy who has the reputation of making the guys around him better, Lebron's teammates sure always underperform when they play with him don't they?  Speaking of 10+ points, Jae Crowder has looked like an above average role player on every team he's played on except the Cavs. Same with Danny Green with the Lakers, he's has been great on the spurs, raptors, and sixers this year but everyone could've sworn he was the worst player in the league last year.  IT was garbage on the defensive end, but could've at least averaged 10 ppg. You're acting like he didn't average 30 the year before. I'm also just listing you players on the Cavs squad that could've given Lebron 10 points on the Cavs squad."
"Dwight Howard, Rondo and Danny Green were not only good fits on the court, but off the court chemistry. Schroder, Gasol, Harrell, Drummond were downgrades at every position. I think everyone agrees that LeBron is a top 10 player of all time, but the whining, bitching, posturing, flopping and being a shit teammate is what people dislike about his antics."
Danny Green for any team come playoffs
Kawhi has only won one playoff series without Danny Green
"Yeah, that ship has sailed. They already did try for a 3rd star lol. Kawhi rejected them and so they blew their budget on Danny Green, KCP, &amp; Kuzma which ties up their salary for the next couple years.  They had an opportunity with Lowry, but would've had to give up Schroder, KCP &amp; THT (which in retrospect was the better play) for him"
"Nonesense, Luka is a willing passer he constantly feeds his teammates, he even sets'em up with great looks, he's an elite playmaker and if you're Porzingis you can at least spend time working on being a good roll man cus Luka will feed him endlessly.  Porzingis could be a lethal 4/5 if he knew how to use his size or be a little bit more agressive cus there's the potential of a lethal pick and roll and pick and pop game with Luka, instead he's playing like a 7 foot Danny Green on offense"
My man looking like Danny Green
"&gt;If there was no offers it wouldn’t have been discussed by management or any of the other credible reporters.  Of course it would, for exactly the reason I explained at least twice.  Toronto wanted to trade him, but was underwhelmed by the market, so they leaked rumors in an attempt to drum up something better.  This happens almost every year with the Lakers.  Pay attention.  &gt;None of those teams can afford to pile up $30 million dollars worth of trash players to exchange for Lowry. Danny Green, Duncan Robinson, KCP, Dennis, etc. aren’t trash.  None of who teams?  What are you talking about?  If Lowry were half as good as you claim, every team in the league would be lining up to trade their ""trash"" players for him.  Instead, no one even made an offer.  &gt;And IIRC we are two years removed from Kawhi being a Raptor.  Fine, Lowry is second to a Clipper, who played one season in Canada.  Is that better?  No.  I don't care enough about this point to continue, but suffice it to say that a few weeks ago, before their most recent disaster, the Maple Leafs were the most popular athletes in Toronto.  As recently as 2019, Leafs' tickets cost more than double Raptors' tickets, on average.  Why would that be, if Lowry is so popular?  &gt;The Lakers had opportunities to move on from him and fully rebuild but were content with keeping Kobe...because he is Kobe.  Maybe you don't remember, or weren't old enough yet, but Bryant was largely hated by everyone he ever played with, except Pau Gasol, and most of his coaches, too.  No team was trading for the most-expensive player in the league, whose skills and durability were in serious decline, and destroying their lockerroom in the process.  And again, he was a Laker lifer.  There are extremely few lifers who have won multiple rings with a franchise and were subsequently traded late in their careers.  And the Lakers have **never** traded any lifer who won more than 2 rings with them.  There are a few such players that they let walk as free agents -- Kurt Rambis, AC Green, Derek Fisher -- but none have ever been traded.  These are things you might want to know, if you are going to pretend to be knowledgeable on the subject.  &gt;Of course he would, lol. Dennis is an expiring (and no, we wouldn’t have paid him, which is why we traded Norm in the first place). KCP doesn’t have much value and Trez isn’t good.  Caldwell-Pope has way more value than Rodney Hood, and more to the point, way more value than Lowry now does.  And if those guys are all worthless, I guess that means my point has been proven.  The league -- who has watched Lowry for \~15 years -- agrees with my opinion of him, that he's just not particularly good anymore, and certainly not worth $30M either in assets or in salary.  &gt;Trez isn’t good  Utter nonsense.  He was one of the more sought-after free agents last November.  He played well for the Lakers, but Vogel is not very good at figuring out how to allot minutes when given a bunch of options.  &gt;Masai didn’t get what he wanted from a trade, and Lowry never suggested he would leave (even if his contract was over), so yeah he kept him. I don’t understand what’s difficult about that.  Because passing on the best available offer, and taking nothing instead, is the mark of a rank amateur.  And there's no evidence that Masai is that incompetent.  The only explanation that is actually sensible -- and backed by about 70 years of professional basketball history -- is that a 35 year-old 6'0"" guard is neither particularly good, nor valuable, and especially not for $30M, so no one was interested and Masai simply had to eat the remainder of Lowry's contract."
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
"yeah he did. Every single player on that raptors team was hot or cold up until the warriors series. lowry had a couple of bad games, danny green only had 1 good game in the finals,Vanveleet didn't show up until late in the bucks series yall seem to forget that part. I swear as time goes on it seems like people are rewriting history and downplaying what kawhi did that playoffs."
Kind of shoots like Danny Green
That's back-to-back depending champion Danny Green you're talking about!
Plus you'd also have Danny Green if Kawhi stayed.
"No, that's what you want from Danny Green not a max contract player"
I don't know that he's in maverick? I thought danny green grew to 7'3
Danny Green and Jae Crowder are still in the playoffs so lemme get back to you once the dust settles
He doesn't wanna be hurt by evil Danny Green.
"If they can get past the nets then definitely but I dont see that happening. The sixers are a good team and their roster works, it's all just up to if people like Ben simmons danny green and Seth curry come through. They don't have to be dropping 20 every night but If they are inconsistent then sixers are gonna get dropped"
"&gt;So judging from these comments it seems you misunderstand on/off numbers. Lowry is a positive on the floor, a significant positive.   I understand them fine.  The Raptors were better with Lowry tucked safely on the bench.  That's rarely good news for a $25M player, especially one on the downside of his career.  &gt;Danny Green has a better +- than Jokic these past two postseasons. In fact Jokic is a negative these past two postseason. Is he a better player?  Jokic and Green have been playing for the deepest teams in the league, with among the best records.  Lowry is playing for Toronto, who didn't threaten to make the playoffs... in the East.  Only 13 East teams were even trying to win this year, and Toronto finished 12th.  &gt;Why wouldn’t it make sense?   Because it leaves the Lakers with no backcourt to speak of, and is more than anyone has ever traded to rent a 6'0"", 35 year-old guard for a couple months.  This is not difficult to understand.  And I already explained to you the situation with reports that ""the Lakers are interested"" in a trade.  Almost all of those are just fake news leaked by GMs trying to drum up business.  &gt;They were all reported to be interested, only thing that prevented them was Toronto asking for too much.  It's almost like that's exactly my point.  No one valued even Lowry close to what you are claiming, because he's not that good.  &gt;No one is forcing him to take less money. But if no one is offering $25 mil, he obviously isn’t getting $25 mil. What is hard to understand about that?   And the team that just traded a bunch of assets for him is now screwed -- they just traded $30M of assets for an aged $20M player that no one else wants at that price.  Or, he walks, and leaves them with nothing.  All bad options, that no one was interested in just this very season."
"eddie (whoever that is) is right tho.  KD is the one taking the shots but he's helped by the fact that his team is stacked.  the jazz forced the ball out of MJ's hands to let steve kerr beat them instead. heat did the same thing to lebron, letting danny green beat them instead.  now what the fuck would you do against the KD warriors or nets? lol? double team KD and give steph an open look? or klay? or kyrie? or harden? cmon now  it is why KD's playoff efficiency skyrocketed with the warriors. the defensive attention is vastly different from his OKC days, where he did get doubled in those situations"
Same deal as last year. I remember Danny Green telling the media that he really wanted to run it back with the same squad.
Lonzo is Danny Green with full court passes
"&gt;For the third time, there were plenty of injuries that happened in December 2019 as well.   Injuries happen.  Lowry has been a negative for his entire thirties, save the one season he played with Leonard.  &gt;Also mentioned the bench. You failed to address it.  So Lowry isn't better than Toronto's bench players?  Again, how is that a $25M player?  &gt;As a result we went 1-13, Lowry played most of the minutes, so his numbers were affected the most. Not hard to understand.  We are talking about on/off deltas.  If Lowry was a negative on a team that went 1-13, I sure don't want to pay him $25M/year.  Nor am I trading assets for him.  &gt;\+16.2 is better than a lot of guys Danny Green isn’t better than.   And +3.4 is worse than a lot of players making a lot less than $25M, and who aren't over 35 years old.  &gt;They offered two of Dennis/KCP/Trez and Wes...  Source.    As previously noted, every GM in the NBA uses the same playbook.  When no one offers anything acceptable for their player, they leak a rumor about some crazy Laker offer.  Those leaks rarely make sense, as in this case.  No one is dumb enough to trade an entire starting backcourt for a 35 year-old guard, who is long-since past his prime, not particularly good anymore, and who thinks he deserves a huge new contract.  Which is exactly why no one traded for Lowry.  &gt;Alright, enlighten me Mr.GM, how do negotiations work?  Surely not as you proposed.  If it were in any way ""easy"" to force a veteran player to take less money after you traded a bunch of assets for him, we would see that happen.  We do not.  The player has all the leverage in that situation.  &gt;Very few players Lowry age has played as well as him period lol. Dragic is a worse player and he’s getting $18 a year and he’s probably recognized as a worse player.  The Heat have been better with Dragic on the floor in each of the past three seasons, and were +11.3/100 with him in the playoffs last season.  And he's younger than Lowry.  The previous two playoff runs, the Heat were +9 and +6.9 with Dragic.  I believe you just stuck your foot in your mouth, up to the knee."
In game 6 of the 2013 NBA finals? You got the crucial rebound and pass and a game saving block on Danny Green. Did your mindset change at any point? What was going through your mind towards the end of the game off that Lebron miss and overtime?
"&gt;I already proved how the on/off numbers are misleading,  No, you used the virus as an excuse, which applies to less than half of the time period in question.  And even then, it's not like only Toronto was effected by COVID.  &gt;when I’ve shown you his on/off’s in the playoffs  \+3.4/100 last year.  That's not much for $25M.  Danny Green was +16.2 (almost 500% better) for the Lakers last year, for 2/3rds the money.  &gt;The Lakers, Heat, and Sixers were willing to get Lowry, they just didn’t want to give up the assets we wanted.   Sure, I'm sure they'd trade Matthews for him.  They'd trade Matthews for anybody.  That doesn't really help your position.  &gt;They could’ve easily negotiated down to a lower salary (like $20 mil a year) if no one wanted to give him $25 mil a year.  You fundamentally misunderstand how these negotiations work -- especially after trading a bunch of assets for a player.  Lowry is an old, 6'0"" guard.  There is no precedent for such players being worth $25M/year, or significant assets in trade, and that includes Lowry's recent play."
Walmart *Kawhi*? That’s generous dawg I’d say he’s more like Save-a-Lot Danny Green
"I see you missed lakers fans sending death threats to Danny green and his wife, along with KCP last season"
loser lakers fan. these dudes were sending death threats to danny green last year
"Trae will guard Danny green, Bogi will guard seth, Hunter will guard Tobias, JC on Ben simmons, and obviously Capela on embiid"
Hey Chris! Nice to meet you! What was going through your head when you had that game-winning block on Danny Green in the finals?
"Turns out playoff games are played between teams, and not the two best players.   Knicks were a good regular season team but entirely untested, wildly inexperienced, and just not good enough in the playoffs.   Even if embiid doesn't play at all in this series, sixers win easily in 6, maybe even 5.   Trae Averaged 30 and 10 against a top 5 defense that completely lacked any lock down perimeter defenders.   Trae is going to be playing a top 5 defense that has 2 lock down perimeter defenders in Simmons and Thybulle, and 2 very, very good veteran perimeter defenders in Danny Green and George Hill."
"I mean, it's the same logic why Dame Lillard  (37% career 3P%) is obviously a more elite shooter than Danny Green  (40% career 3P%)."
"Lakers fans that’s how. Danny Green did have a *major* shooting slump all year though.  The combo of Howard and Javale was really good because you always had a defensive center on the court. With the swap to Harrell and eventually Drummond the defense just wasn’t there. AD has offense covered but since he refuses to play the 5 there isn’t the same kind of paint defense. Lakers aren’t built well enough for modern LeBron teams. They were last year.  You need a primary scorer from the guard and pf spots, a defensive center (needs to be center), some reliable 3p shooters, and a defensive guard who’s in the main rotation."
Exactly. How the hell did Lebron make Danny Green worse by giving him wide open 3s all game. Schroder also isn’t a starting nba point guard.
They traded Danny Green😂
They traded Danny Green 😂
They traded Danny Green 😂
Hard to feel bad for Lakers fans when they spent all year telling me how much Danny Green sucked and that they wouldn’t miss his shooting
Danny Green
"I guess they thought Danny green was washed and wanted to get some value out of him bc Schroeder is younger and better player but they were arrogant when they didnt trade him for Lowry especially after he denied the extension, now they lose him for nothing or pay a guy who wants to start and take shots and doesnt have the cleanest fit next to the 2 stars."
"That’s because lebron’s playstyle isn’t suited for player development because at this point in his career, he can do it all. But just because he can do it all, doesn’t mean that he should. He needs established role players that are already developed in order to flourish. Like, look at last year. He had Dwight, KCP, Javale McGee, Rondo, Quinn Cook, and Danny Green, which most would agree is a solid supporting cast. Losing most of those guys was a huge blow for the lakers success and their replacements haven’t been able to match their success. Plus mans is already 36, he simply doesn’t have time to develop young players"
Danny green in the finals? More like Danny green wins the chip
"Danny Green is the most overly shitted on role player and I really just don't get it. Yeah, he can be streaky, but he's still gonna give you great defensive effort and he's gonna have games where he will hit 5 3s. It's like Jae Crowder. You live and die with it. They can win you games and lose you games, but that's why they're so important in the playoffs. At least Danny Green has a good looking shooting stroke lol, it was painful watching these Lakers shoot the 3 this series"
Danny Green is still active on the sixers who are in the second round right now
Danny Green was starting
"Danny Green shot .455 from 3 for the Raptors in the regular season, and .333 from 3 in the playoffs. And that playoff % is severely affected by one terrible series against the Bucks. Other than that, he was rock solid. Danny Green was excellent for the Raptors, and his contribution to that title winning season is woefully undervalued."
Run from it. Dread it. Danny Green in the Finals arrives all the same.
"Any sexperts know, Lakers lost cause they don't have Danny Green. He is the key difference. Look at 76ers, swept last bubble. Add Danny Green = Championship contender."
Danny Green confirmed GOAT
Replace curry with KD or Danny Green and the streak continues. and the streak continues
You kinda need the salary via bird rights but also can't really trade him easily if he gets overpaid. Danny Green was their big chance to get a good third option and it did not work out.  Feels like the one out is risking it all in a sign and trade for Kemba.
Prime David West and KMart off the bench...and Danny Green as the third guy in your SG rotation. Damn
And Danny green 3peats
Or lebron or Kawhi. Or lebron or Danny green
It is a truly blessed day  I hope Danny Green is smiling right now
"- Love played worse after Bron left. - Schroeder has been a career 43% FG shooter, he bricks just as much when Bron was injured - Danny Green had terrible shooting % as Raptor before being picked up by Lakers.  2007 and 2018 Cavs that made it to the finals. How many good or already all-star players are on that roster? Did LeBron not make them better?  K thx"
"I checked, looks like rondo and danny green are the only ones still alive"
This is some revisionism lol. LeBron didn't make Danny Green go ice cold for an entire postseason. He also didn't make KLove worse
Could have used Danny Green
"LeBron can’t make all players better. Most of them were good or all-stars already to begin with. In fact, sometimes he makes some of them worse like Love, Schroeder, and Danny Green."
will Lebron take the final shot with the fate of the universe on the line or will he pass it to Danny Green?
Danny fucking green
Danny Green must be stopped.
"I'd rather have Lonzo, Kuzma and BI (and Danny Green) than DeRozan, Poeltl and Samanic. Brandon Ingram is the best player of the bunch. And imagine what Pop could get out of Lonzo Ball. Kuzma is a pigeon, but so are Poeltl and Samanic. And you would have gotten to keep Danny Green."
Is Danny Green gonna win 3 straight rings on 3 different teams? I don’t want to jinx it!
"Lakers going home, but their whipping boy from last year, Danny Green, advances! How nice would it of been to have him to put on Booker or Paul?"
Danny green and rajon rondo (very close to getting eliminated)
"I don't think people mean killer instinct as in wanting to win, anyone who thinks LeBron doesn't want to win is stupid. You don't get to 8 straight finals by not wanting to win. They more so mean killer instinct in the sense that Jordan wants the ball in his hands at all times when it matters and will put the team on his shoulders. LeBron will always try to get his whole team involved or make the best play by passing it to the open guy. Jordan thinks him shooting is always the best play. Best example is the Finals game last year. Bron had a monster game and passes to an open Danny Green instead of shooting it.  They're just different types of players."
"Rondo and Danny green are left, and Jeff Green"
Danny green I think
Or Dwight with Gasol/Drummond  Or Danny Green with anyone who attempted a 3 point shot
He was gonna drop kick Danny Green when he didn’t pressure Trae in game 1 hehe
Not trying to be a Danny green hating but he’s been looking really slow to me lately. I feel like his defense hasn’t been all that
"The best roster around Zion and Ingram are 3&amp;D guys. Turner, Danny Green, guys like that."
How does Danny Green contribute? Not trolling.
To what end? Lowering title odds after a great season? An Embiid Supermax wouldn't kick in until the last year of Harris' deal. That's why they moved off of Horford for an expiring Danny Green. George Hill could also be cut and signed for a smaller number (most of his contract is non-guaranteed)
"Everything you said.  Zion's style meshes best with a stretch 3&amp;D big in the mold of Ibaka, not only to space on defense snd but have the length to guard the paint on defense.  Lonzo is an up temp floor general which also suits a young Zion and BI.   Other than that, Pels need savvy veterans with a calming lockerroom presence. Maybe 3&amp;D vets like Danny Green, Otto Porter, Avery Bradley, Covington, Ariza, PJ."
"the Hawks shot impossibly well game 1 and Danny Green was on Trae. neither of those things are happening at all anymore. if Danny Green isn’t on Trae OR (not and) the Sixers don’t repeatedly commit unforced turnovers, it’s 3-0.   doesn’t occur to you that Trae is more passive because he’s not being guarded by Danny Green???"
Yeah but he’s gonna have to score 60 if they defend the pick and roll like that Harden is gonna violate Danny Green with no hedge especially because you can’t double off of anyone else in the Nets starting lineup (KD Kyrie Harris)
The Nets pick and Roll is different they play 5 capable shooters so you can’t play like any help (especially off of Harris Kyrie and KD) so you gotta play 2v2 with it that’s difficult to guard they will probably have to put Danny Green on Harden and have him have 0 help with the nets shooters and Danny Green can defend but he’s BBQ chicken vs harden 1v1 no double teams
Doc left Danny Green on an island vs Trae in the first half and Trae did literally anything he wanted. We were down 20 at half and only outscored them by 16 in the second half.   Game 2 and 3 Ben and Thybulle have mainly been Trae’s defender and 76ers fans (and NBA fans who actually watch Ben) knows what happens when that happens
He has the Danny Green syndrome.
"That's Danny ""Back-to-back Champion"" Green sir"
"Someone mentioned in the danny green injury thread that Jae Crowder and Dwight Howard are the only ones from last years finals that are still in the playoffs without being plagued by injuries after a very short offseason. KCP, DG, Bron, and AD all got injured during or right before the playoff."
"He's -32 for the series.    Yeah, he's been contained.    He's not been a serious factor since we took 48 yr old Danny Green off him and put Simmons on him, with a side of Thybulle.    The Hawks go as Trae goes.   And, if they aren't setting franchise records to only win by 4 like in Game 1,  they just aren't winning.   2 straight blowouts shows they're out of their league in this series."
"And all it took was one first, iirc. We even got Danny Green out of that. Felt like a fleece."
"Jazz are the best in the West and it depends on Conley’s health if they can maintain that security   Coming out of the east there is the Nets who have stupid amount of offensive potential or some team who is capable of beating them which would be an impressive feat in itself   Funnily enough they are having some injury luck that could pick up every round   AD goes down and Lebron is not himself (injury or attitude whatever you pick)   No Murray or Dozier at Denver, Barton recently back   No Ibaka at Clippers &amp; Jazz are awaiting Conley (hopefully nothing beyond that)   Nets-Harden questionable for now   Bucks-DiVinceno out   Hawks-Hunter &amp; Reddish out   76ers-Danny Green strained calf &amp; more importantly Embiid’s meniscus tear severity is relatively unknown"
"LoL replace Draymond green with Danny Green to play with Klay and Curry during 2014, they are still champs. You can replace Draymond with Gerald Green or Jeff Green or any of the green brothers and the warriors still win with the splash brothers."
Lmao all while Donovan cooks Danny Green for 40 every night because Ben Simmons won’t guard him
"When people don't think coaching and scheme doesn't matter, remind them that we lost Richardson and Horford and replaced them with Seth Curry and Danny Green and became a top two defense somehow."
I don’t see Philly beating the Nets even with 2013 NBA finals Games 1-3 Danny Green
"With Danny Green at least the Sixers have his early Bird rights so they can offer him up to a 4 year deal that starts at 175% of his current salary (he'll get far, far less than that), so they won't need to use an exception on him. But if Dwight wants more than the minimum to come back, the Sixers will need to use the MLE on him."
Completely disregarded the fact that he already tried Danny Green in the regular season and it didn’t go well
"There is not a single GM who would take Westbrook over Danny Green to make a championship winning team. Any contender would easily rather have Danny Green over Westbrook. And you might say, what if you're building a team? You cannot win a ring with current Westbrook taking up a large Usage rate, so even though theoretically Westbrook is a far more ""skilled"" player and gets more points and assists, you still would take Danny Green."
"Not a ton of room. We need to make decisions about Danny Green who will want a last solid contract and Korkmaz, who is due his first big deal. With any luck we dump Mike Scott and use some of that money for Dwight. We do need a real 3rd option Center though, who can give a different situational look than Dwight and give meaningful minutes if Embiid is out."
“DANNY GREEN ON AN ISLAND THEYLL NEVER EXPECT IT”
They played in god mode and Danny green was the primary defender on Trae young for 70% plus possessions  Doc and crew went back to the drawing board and Ben became the primary defender on Trae followed by tisse. Shut him down in games 2 and 3 less garbage time where Trae got to stat pad a bit.
"Sixers might've won this game but if Danny ""NBA Finals"" Green can't play, we have no chance."
Danny Green in street clothes.
Bruh Danny Green came back but this time in a suit/outfit XD
Danny green is trash put him back in
"so, Danny Green plays 3 minutes and we win by 20something. Hmmm"
"When Danny Green went to insert his foot in the boot, he bricked it off the side a few times."
"Agreed....I’d much rather have curry out there shooting, driving and penetrating. I’d also rather have thybulle out there harassing the other teams scorers.  Don’t see any reason Danny green should get a ton of minutes - he is fine to get some backup minutes as a shooter, but should not be the primary option."
Right but that was with Danny Green guarding Trae
Danny Green in Anthony Davis clothes - not a good sign.
And Danny Green played like 5 minutes lol
Danny Green is in a walking boot on the Sixers bench. Sixers in 5 guaranteed
Danny green on the bench  Sixers up big time  Coincidence?
Solomon Hill and Danny Green tightly locked in a battle for who can be the more useless starter
He’s not being guarded solely by Danny Green
Not seeing any Danny Green transition threes has honestly been refreshing. Sorry Danny I still love you
Is Danny green really a loss?        /s
Hawks are really gonna miss Danny Green
"Wait, why does everyone hate Danny Green? He's great!"
"Ugh no, they’re basically the same offensively and Danny green plays defense"
It’s not a coincidence that the sixers are playing well without Danny green
"His inefficient ball hog style of play contributes little to winning so I don't really have to appreciate it. He represents the exact kind of player I despise; a selfish player whose negative BBIQ hurts their team. I prefer players like Danny Green, Rudy Gobert, Kyle Lowry, smart players who know their role and don't harm their teams by shooting 47% TS."
Yeah man I get that.  Danny Green is either red hot or ice cold and it’s easy to live with when he’s red hot.
"That’s how I feel with Danny Green, really sucks for us he got hurt hope he gets better soon"
having Danny Green out might be a blessing for the 76ers goddamn
Dollar store Danny green
"The Nets haven’t even beaten the Bucks yet who the Sixers are better than. Take a breath, it’s Danny Green."
George Hill basically Walmart Danny Green
George Hill the new Danny Green
"With Danny Green out for the game, guaranteed win.   See you in the A lol"
"Danny Green went go talk to a ref about a foul during the break, now he out the game diagnosed with mono 😔"
"Just tuning in, what happened to Danny Green?"
Danny Green getting injured is gonna benefit the Sixers somehow
"danny green being out for the rest of the game probably helps the sixers much more than atlanta, it means matisse 'CLAMPS' thybulle is on trae all game"
"&gt;I don't know why you would try to ruin a good thing   I think if the Lakers had time to have a normal off-season they probably would have just run it back. But considering they only had 6 weeks off it's not difficult to see why the Lakers could have been wary about bringing back Dwight Howard (35 years old), Rajon Rondo (35 years old), Danny Green (34 years old), and Javale McGee (33 years old).   Bringing back the league's oldest team with such a short turnaround probably would have gone poorly also. After all, it's not like any of those guys are having a great playoffs for their other teams this year. The players who are playing best in these playoffs this year are the ones who were gone before the second round in the bubble, if they played there at all."
Danny Green wasnt the thing standing between the Nets and the finals lmfao
danny green right calf strain and will not return
Forgot Danny Green was on the Sixers. How has he looked?
"Because they just want to shit on the Lakers' off-season moves. Rondo got a DNP-CD last night, Danny Green has been struggling, Javale has barely played (after barely playing for the Lakers in the playoffs last year), and Dwight Howard is averaging 9 mpg so far against Atlanta.   Those guys were all quality contributors for the Lakers last year, but the reality is they're all older vets who were coming off of a 6 week off-season after winning the title in October. It's really not hard to see why the Lakers might have thought that simply bringing back the league's oldest team under those circumstances could have gone poorly.   The Lakers instead went for younger, more well-rested players, and got screwed because LeBron and AD both got hurt anyway. It was a shitty situation the Lakers (and Heat, and Celtics and Nuggets) were all put in, but it was what it was. The Lakers tried a different approach to a unique situation, but it ended up not mattering because their two 1st Team All NBA stars from last year both got hurt. Way it goes."
What will Philly do without Danny Green bricking 3’s???
"Simmons is so hesitant. Dude seems terrified to play offense. Tough to have Danny green sit when simmons is already struggling, only 3 guys who can play offense."
"Continuity helps, but I think the Lakers clearly thought with the short off-season this year and having just been to the Finals that they'd probably need some guys who could be fresher for them during the compacted season. It could have been an even bigger disaster if they'd just brought back all those same vets and everyone got hurt or ran out of gas together. It's not like Danny Green, Rondo and Dwight are tearing it up these playoffs either. The reality is just that the Lakers were fucked by the 6 week off-season and this year was always going to be an uphill battle for them."
That Danny green pass was sick
Danny Green is not quality right now.
Danny Green getting cooked again. Doc needs to realize he will need to bench him soon
Someone other than Joel and Tobi needs to step up offensively tonight.  I'm saying it will be Danny Green.
I'm once again asking Danny Green to do something tonight offensively
Definitely got a different look then Danny Green on him to start. The drive to floater/lob killed us in Game 1 and was quiet in Game 2. It'll be interesting to see if they can find a way to get that back.   Good luck but not too much
Danny Green in a slump? During playoffs? What a god damned surprise.
Need a decent Danny Green game. Trae will most likely shoot better tonight.
Danny Green went mental.
Yep. Danny Green *will* break out of his slump. He'll do it when the regular season starts in the fall.
"Yea Trae’s is so obvious. Watching the philly vs atlanta game 1 was so frustrating cause of it. Granted having danny green defending him was also part of it, but my passionate dislike for danny green’s game is an entirely different post haha."
"i think its hilarious u kids talking smack about The Goat, Danny Green. u wouldnt say this right after he won not one, but two! Championships, hes jacked.   not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol"
"Can’t believe that these casuals are disagreeing with you. Danny Green was a really good defender for us and we wouldn’t have won the championship without him, even though he shot below league average from deep in the playoffs.   These people are insane."
"I think the Sixers match up pretty well without Harden playing. Ben guards KD, Thybulle guards Kyrie, plus Embiid in the middle with Danny Green as a help defender. That’s about a solid a matchup defensively you can have for the Nets.  Offensively - do the nets have anyone that can guard Joel?"
Danny Green has been in a slump for two years.
Danny green didn't play in the 4th bro. He took 2 3s in the 2nd half. One was the bad shot I'm talking about and the other was wide open from the corner.
"seriously doc came out and pooped himself in g1 vs the hawks his gameplan more or less lost us the game.  either you assume danny green is good enough to guard trae, which makes you an idiot, or you're intentionally deploying a shitty gameplan, which makes you an idiot.  hopefully it doesn't come back to bite us in the ass, but it may already be too late.  also he has no clue how to use ben in the half court or get the best out of him. but somehow that was all previously brett brown's fault. brett never coached a game as poorly as doc did in game 1"
The Danny green cut is a goated move
"Danny Green is a miracle. I swear he's the only player I can count on to miss almost every shot he takes, yet he still magically has a respectable shooting %. He's like a sneaky predator, only making shots when you're not looking. Very cunning."
"Had Danny Green made that open game winner from Lebron, his whole legacy would be different haha."
"I mean yes and no. What I mean is not put Danny green on an island, I still want Ben and Tisse on him but I’d rather have Trae taking difficult shots than having him be the complete focus and his teammates having open looks. In G1 4 other players had double digits, 2 having &gt;20."
"Unless you’re trying to run the clock down, I’m fine with it. An open Danny Green three is a very good shot"
Odds are everyone will start making their shots eventually. But not Danny Green
Contract year Danny Green only shows up in contract years.
Losing danny green probably had more of an effect on the lakers than people realize
"Kawhi got his teammates look after look during those last 5 minutes. Couldn't make shit, Morris is a bad shooter. His percentages look good in the regular season, but he can't buy a basket in the Playoffs. Straight up Danny Green type player."
"A little disingenuous to say that one guy leaving his team and joining a team where one guy was drafted and been there 12 years and another for 3 years, all at age 33+, vs lebrons superteams as an example forming in one offseason:  - wade 28 (MIA), bosh 26 (TOR), James 26 (CLE) - kyrie 22 (CLE), love 26 (MIN), James 30 (MIA) - James 34 (CLE), kuzma 23 (LAL), Davis 26 (NO)  Not to mention the obscene amount of ring chasing discount veterans they brought in to each spot. (Ray Allen, Mike miller, deron Williams, shumpert, jr smith, gasol, Dwight Howard, wade, Danny green, rondo  etc just off the top of my head).   **Lebron was on his third super team by the age Charles hit the rockets. Kyrie is on pace for the same number by that age as well.**  Lebron (and other guys today) pretty much premeditating/colluding to get a whole team of prime stars together and then having a slew of vets taking the ring discount to hitch on for the ride. That’s a whole different ball game.  Even KDs first championship in GS was a team drafted and built from the ground up that he was only able to join because of a fluke cap jump. I get if you or other people hated it because outside of the injuries they were pretty much a lock to 3peat, but It’s not like they all came from different teams to GS.  The star cache where players are now essentially determining where/who they will play with and then playing GM with the create a roster, that didn’t exist in the old school era. It’s always taken multiple star players to win, that’s not what the “super team” criticism is about, it’s the contrived way of colluding to make it happen, of taking big pay cuts to make it all feasible, unnatural nature of it."
"Yup, he’s a great team defender and deflections darling but he was never had the lateral quickness and athleticism to be a great individual defender.   And offensively he’s more limited. On top of missing layups and lacking the handle or quicks to create anything, hes a specific kind of shooter. Not a threat to shoot off the dribble, n not flying off a screen, or even hitting super efficiently like 40%. No, he’s a threat because he has a very high willingness to take shots and hits enough that you need to respect him. That’s how he generates value  So if you expected a bigger Klay, you’ll be super disappointed, but if you expected a bigger Danny Green then you’ll be happy  But watching him play his value on both sides is evident. He’s a solid starter on a bargain deal"
"I bet against the nets vs philly in ECF because I didn’t see how Griffin, Jordan, Green could stop Embiid. Especially because the Nets refuse to play Claxton   And the 76ers have defenders that can match up well against the Nets and potentially slow them down. Simmons on KD / Harden. Danny Green / Thybulle on Harden / Kyrie   Now that Embiid tore his meniscus I think the Nets are a sure win"
"Its in a relatively same sense as the Celtics. Veteran players, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, Rondo, and AD are all veteran players with most of them having very concrete play off experience and success. Pre-2020 Danny Green as well. If someone told you five years ago these guys would all be on a team, it would have raised red flags for everyone.   Its incredibly similar to the Celtics of Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, and KG. Both even had Rondo. Only reason people didn’t call them that was because almost everyone on the team were given serious bad press. Rondo not being on contenders, Dwight and his series of injuries, AD and his injuries, Javale’s rep from Shaq, etc. Kawhi and the Clippers pretty much also stole a lot of the lime light as well."
Mike James missing so many open looks doing his best Danny Green impersonation
Bruce Brown gonna be this playoffs Danny Green lmao
Bruce brown floater followed by Bruce brown contested layup.     Can't imagine how pissed nets fans are seeing that shit. I akin it to if that was Danny green doing it for the sixers lol
"Idk what you would expect us to do when the $170M man scored 5 and 6 points in elimination games. Lakers fans sent Danny Green, a role player, death threats 🤔"
"Now we know Kawhi didn't choke, he simply was not good enough to defeat the curse that Doc Rivers brings to every team. It's like a reverse Danny Green or a reverse McCaw."
"You just made me realise there are no Greens left, now that Danny, Jeff and JaMychal have been eliminated this round. First time since 2012 there has been no Green in the finals."
First of all no package short of Embiid and Simmons would make the Houston owner say yes to trading Harden to his enemy Morey   That being said the proposed Lowry deal had two major issues that people are neglecting to mention.   First it was heavily rumored that Lowry was looking for 3 years/75M extension if he was committing to re-signing in Philly.   Second the final offer from the Raptors side was  -	Danny Green -	Maxey -	Thybulle -	multiple first round picks   That is a lot to give up for the pleasure of paying a guy on the wrong side of 30 - 25M a year for the next three seasons.   I would have made this move bc he instantly makes both Simmons and embiid better but he has justification due to Masai and his ridiculous demands from not only Philly but with the Lakers and Miami as well. In Masai’s mind Lowry was more valuable than James harden.   Morey made the Curry deal which saved the Sixers season as after Embiid he was the clear number 2.   He drafted Maxey and somehow managed to get rid of the Horford deal when his value was at an all time low point.   Signing Doc Rivers can also be defended to a certain extent as well. They could have gambled on a young up and coming coach but he figured Doc could get more out of the team and during the regular season he had the Sixers playing the best they ever have played maybe even when they had Butler  You are completely factually wrong about the Harden trade and are acting like Masai was begging Morey to take Lowry when he was basically asking for a kings ransom from multiple teams while Lowry was asking for $60-75M extension.   Elton Brand and Colangelo destroyed this team   3 key mistakes  -	trading multiple picks when they could have signed Tobias for nothing that off season and probably for less than what he is making now  -	not re-signing Butler -	signing Horford   That simple. I think they could have even ran it back with Brett Brown and had a better outcome then they did this season.

Danny Green retweeted a tweet saying it was a weak out to scapegoat one player
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
"He's atrocious defensively and the Mavs don't have the personnel in Embiid,Ben,Tobias and Danny Green to hide him.  They bet on Luka and KP stepping up and replacing the production he brought and that JRich would improve their D to a respectable level."
Even Danny Green retweeted a tweet saying  “Making one person the scapegoat seems like the easy way out”
No.  He got him Seth Curry and Danny Green.   Harris was also over 39% from 3.    You gotta give them a try together.
Morey made the right moves bringing in Seth Curry and Danny Green.
Well the other side of the story is he really thought be should he playing over manu and Danny green. And of course he was wrong
"Sign and trade for Kyle Lowry, trade Ben for CJ, roll out an Embiid, Harris, McCollum, Lowry starting five plus somebody (Danny Green?). With that backcourt honestly Seth Curry needs to go, he is just too bad defensively and you can get something decent for him."
"Send Curry and Embiid to the Warriors, Simmons to the NBL, build around Danny Green. That guy is the real charm. And I have no bias for my first sentence, just sounds good"
"It wasn't thought they'd lose Danny Green, Ben would be THAT atrocious offensively and Embiid would be playing with a torn miniscus but yes they should have won anyways"
Danny green stops Huerter from going off tbh
Jeff Green in 2011 when he was traded from OKC to Boston in exchange for Perkins and Nate Robinson  Danny Green was a rookie on the Cavs in 2010 when Shaq was traded (by Steve Kerr) from the Suns to the Cavs
"If Frank was getting paid what Ben is getting paid we would have sent him to JFK airport a long time ago though.    Like if Ben wanted to be an elite defender that's cool, but he needs to be making between Seth Curry and Danny Green money"
Danny Green
Honestly a glorified Danny Green
People keep saying stuff like this and stuff like had they had Danny green they would’ve won but no one is saying how we played the entire series without our starting small forward (De’Andre Hunter). Put some respek on our name.
"People don't understand. Look I know Doc isn't a favorite here but I've seen every Sixers game this season and let me tell you guys something: he has *absolutely no clue* who will be playable on a game to game basis. Both Maxey and Milton take turns being unplayable, sometimes both. Honestly tonight looked like both. No Green to defend and also score, so he out Milton in because he can defend better than Maxey and shoot better than him. He needed Seth's shooting but not the part where he gives up a basket to Huerter every damn time on the other end.   Going into the playoffs he had seven guys he could really trust. Once he got there one of them entered the worst slump of his career and then another got hurt I'm Game 2 of this series. Danny Green led the NBA in corner threes this year he was a legit source of easy offense and he could defend as well. As long as we don't stick him on Trae Young he's excellent.   Bottom line is both Milton and Maxey were terrible for most of this series. They each basically spent one game being good and that's it. And when they weren't good they were dreadful. Korkmaz was also getting cooked on the defensive end and not making up for it with threes.   These aren't his fault. But giving up 18 and , 26 point leads is his fault. That's a big enough lead to just keep trying shit until something works enough to get a win. That's not on Ben, or Milton, or Embiid, or Maxey that's on the coach."
"i do not under any circumstance want to see a philly squad with joel embiid, seth curry, cj mcollum, tobias harris, and danny green. so help me god i will fly to america and burn down philadelphia myself to stop that dominance from rising."
The defending Danny Green is out as well
Honest question but would Danny green been the difference maker ? His composure and leadership to calm the boys down might’ve been able to prevent those terrible collapses in game 4 and 5
They thought they could win a chip without Danny Green
danny green suddenly going to replace ben on the court and run the offense?
Losing Danny Green was huge for the 76ers. He’s the only real 2-way guard they have. Even when his shot isn’t falling he’s still guarded like a 40% 3p shooter. 76ers were stuck with 1 way guards
I know but let us see what Morey has in mind. He turned Al Horford  and josh richardson into seth curry and Danny Green after all.
"simmons for kemba is intriguing. but that would also mean seth gets relegated to a 6th man role, with danny green and thybulle starting along kemba."
Danny Green was part of the last 2 championship teams but I get what you’re saying lol
Danny Green misses one series and they break his streak smh
Fully healthy minus one starter! Danny Green played some great basketball tonight!
Danny green woulda helped them out today. Wayyyyy more than anything simmons would do
They really needed Danny Green out there
Would’ve won if Danny Green was healthy 🤷🏾‍♂️
Naw. We should have kept Dwight but I wouldn't want to pay Danny Green 15 million again
We gonna steal a top 4 draft pick this year and get Danny Green back and shock the world in the next few years.
We treated Danny Green like shit he’s not coming back here. Especially because we would just continue to treat him like shit
he needs to team up with evil danny green to seal the three peat
"And Danny Green was out for the Sixers, who had been playing fantastic this postseason."
"wasn't the offer thybulle + maxey + danny green + two firsts? kinda a wash, right?"
Danny Green can't win with these cats
That would be crazy if Danny green of all players was the first dude to win 4 rings with 4 teams.
I guess Danny Green will not three peat
Once Danny Green went down we knew Philly won't be winning this series..
You mean 3-time nba champ danny green? He's like their best player!
RIP Danny Green winstreak 😔
"Lol, I love all the takes on the sixers sub about how they're going to send y'all danny green and some contract filler +2 firsts for dame."
Please I want Danny Green to the Jazz so we can have another wing defender
The lakers need Danny Green more IMO.
"I mean, Sixers are also running Embiid out on a torn meniscus and playing without Danny Green. Also playing without a PG most of the time."
"a healthy year of kemba on the squad would actually be kinda terrifying, if Danny Green stays"
No there is not. Danny green and Jeff green were the other two
"WITH A NEAR HEALTHY ROSTER. Danny Green was hurt, yeah, but their main core was ready to go. Biid has a tear, but obviously not one big enough to not play."
Uh.  Ben Simmons was Ben Simnons.  It isn't like he was Steph Curry in the regular season.  The difference between May 15th 76ers and now is Joel Embid's knees.  I didn't even bring up Danny Green injury.
Danny Green was on Raps
Danny Green to the nuggets DO EET
Honestly wouldn’t be surprised if we sign Danny Green.
They were missing Danny Green BAD
man i remember people saying that about danny green during last years finals
"&gt;So you get to Keep Matisse, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Embid and all you gotta do is trade Ben Simmons and 3 first round picks?!?!? PHILLY IF YOU DON'T PULL THE TRIGGER I SWEAR TO GOD  This comment got downvoted to -12. Speaks to how delusional the /r/sixers sub was about Simmons lmao."
Joel Embiid is playing on a torn meniscus you knobhead  And Danny Green
"I don't even know what else to say other than that this version of the Sixers is just the same team we've seen for the past few years. Embiid, Simmons, and Harris have never advanced past the second round and this is now their third attempt to do so, with the most favorable matchup they've had in that run.  I remember back in 2018 against the Celtics, and a lot of it just looked the same. Joel was a turnover machine in big moments, Simmons was an offensive liability, and no one on the bench could come up and play to the moment.  The hawks are a little inexperienced, Yes, and maybe that will cost them against Milwaukee. But the Sixers have no experience outside of Danny Green and Dwight Howard going deep into the playoffs."
"we just watched a series go 7 and Atlanta won with no major injuries involved, unless you think Danny Green swung the series? How is that not parity — the Hawks are good now?"
Yeah you got us there. The Danny Green death threats were seriously uncalled for
"Doc can also be pathetic sometimes,. Korkmaz has been trash and I'll keep telling people how Danny green is much better then that guy"
"Both Jazz and Nets were dealing with major injuries throughout the whole playoffs...Philly did lose Danny Green, but compared to Conley/Mitchell and Harden/Irving? There's no excuse to be made there tbh"
Coulda had Kawhi and Danny Green for a one year rental but instead the decided to get cute and look where it got em
The only injury they had was Danny Green and it probably wouldn’t have changed a fucking thing.
The Sixers let Danny Green down!
That’s why losing Danny Green was huge. offense didnt have space.
The Danny Green NBA Championship streak ends at 2
danny green streak ends!
"Danny Green could've turned this series around but he got hurt. With him on the floor I don't think Huerter could've played this well, he literally feasted on Seth alone all game   Also Morey can't make Ben improve his offense, prevent Tobias Harris from playing like shit in a clutch game, and also can't force other teams to accept his offers"
Every starter aside from Kawhi and Danny Green… saved you some time
A Danny Green is needed to advance to the next level
"I read t was Maxey, Danny Green (Buy out) &amp; Picks....might seem like a lot, but end of the day I would of pulled the trigger.  I also know i have a huge bias."
I guess Philly really missing Danny Green
Y’all memed Danny Green for years but the Sixers coulda def used him these last few games
Danny Green looking while sucking on his straw LOL
Danny Green is rocking a leather vest and what look like platform sole shoes. Homie’s been shopping with Russell Westbrook
This feels like a Danny Green type of game. Shame he got injured. Otherwise Sixers would be riding with him over Kork
"Lakers fans might disagree, but boy would I love to have had Danny Green here"
Tbf the Sixers are missing Danny Green. Maybe he would’ve made a difference who knows
"Danny Green was a crucial piece even though everyone busts on him. He makes shots, makes the right play and plays great d"
We really lost everything when we lost Danny Green
Sixers really missing Danny Green
76ers gotta do right by Danny Green. This is his best chance of HoF a potential of  3 championships in 3 years with 3 different franchises
"Danny Green, rondo"
Where is danny green anyway???
I miss Danny Green
Danny green
"Danny Green as well, PJ will likely be one as well."
What is Danny Green wearing tf he looks like one of the village People
"Durant: airballed Fans: oh dear, oh dear. Gorgeous Danny green: miss a 3pt Fans: you fucking donkey"
Danny green has been out for the second half of this series
Danny Green is injured
Danny Green injured
Do you hear much about Danny Green being out for the current series? Same shit
Wait is this Shaq streak over? Danny green got eliminated.
"oh wow that danny green injury really hurt the sixers. what injury do the bucks have? and the Knicks had the third best defense, what injury besides Mitchel Robinson did they have?"
"What does COVID protocol have to do with anything? Injured players are allowed to sit on the bench, they’ve been doing it all season. If anything, I’d think sitting in a suite then joining the team would cause more concern from a COVID point of view.  As for the injury itself, I’m not saying he gotta be jumping up and down like a cheerleader and putting unnecessary strain on his knee but lots of players had lower body injuries that kept them out these playoffs and they still managed to be on the bench supporting their team in any way they can. If he needs treatment that’s one thing but Conley, AD, Danny Green, DeAndre Hunter, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray etc etc all were on the bench"
"It’s Beverly, Danny green, Wiggins, Julius randle and Myles turner"
Forreal.  Harris was great this year. Danny green getting injured and ben simmons wilting was main the problem.
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"CJ, Danny Green, Random 3&amp;D wing, Harris, Embiid is a better, more cohesive starting 5 than any pairing of Simmons and Embiid."
"Tobi was the third option in the hawks series, after embiid and seth curry  and he shit the bed  Yeah you want more offensively from simmons but there was a lot of failure to go around in that series, danny green being injured was really bad for them too"
Teams get confused by the pick and roll. Although the 76ers self inflicted the error by putting Danny Green on him. The Bucks  should have known. That's where Bud cant get a pass cause everyone knew it was coming and Lopez would be useless
"&gt;  Prime Kyle Korver wide open from 3 is one of the highest expected points per possession plays you can imagine.  This sentence alone shows why analytics sometimes are the worst and why you didn't understand a single sentence of what i said.  &gt; No one wants him shooting wide open, and the defense would never intentionally leave him wide open. This is a guy who has shot &gt;50% on wide open threes for periods of his career. He doesn't all the sudden become a 12% shooter just because the shot clock gets turned off in the 4th.  The Warriors clearly wanted to do so in that case, in fact they were about to do that in that Game 3, but LeBron saw it, Steph read the play and contested the shot.  The Miami Heat literally did the same thing with Danny Green, a 40% career 3-PT shooter, they INTENTIONALLY leave him wide open because they would rather have two players guarding LeBron and Green open than letting LeBron get a 1-on-1.  &gt; He doesn't all the sudden become a 12% shooter just because the shot clock gets turned off in the 4th.  Oof. Unfortunately for you, he quite literally does become that. In the 2016 playoffs (a year before joining LeBron) Korver shot an astounding 0% from 3-PT range in clutch moments (as defined by the NBA), that was a little worse than his performance the year before, where he shot 8.3% , but it's fine though, he also shot 0% from 3 in clutch moments in 2005, 2008 and 2012 in the postseason."
&gt; good decisions can not work out  Danny Green missing a wide open three in the 2020 NBA Finals  &gt; bad decisions can end up working out  Damian Lillard over Paul George
Those other moves would have been extending Barnes and overpaying for Pat Bev and Danny Green.
"Ironically the Hawks are the only team that have pretty much played healthy teams in every round. Healthy Knicks, Sixers missing Danny Green, and Milwaukee missing DiVincenzo"
"I definitely agree. I'd say he's a longer and better team defender than Danny Green ever was, but DG is better from three now and then and can shoot from the corners too."
"Joel had the best season of his career? Interesting. Who suddenly became his coach?  And if Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and the other Curry (pretty sure this one was all Brand) is what separated a poor roster to a good one, that roster was pretty damn good to begin with."
"He and Danny Green are very similar. RoCo is obviously better at this point, but they’re streaky shooters who play good team D."
"The bigger question is; why isn't Pat getting so much flack about this ass of a shot? I know he got criticized a bit, but nothing compared to PG or Danny Green missing wide open shots. Those two were getting death threats for god's sake."
"Because, at least on this sub and Twitter, every play call has to be either a brilliant genius move or an absolutely dipshit one. Plus social media will hate on literally everything Bud does, so that amplifies it. People did this same thing when Danny Green attempted the game winner in game 5 last year instead of LeBron.   Armchair coaches are a thing as old as time, but in the era of social media, it's much more visible and loud."
this is the same place that overreacted when Danny Green missed a wide open 3 in the Finals last year
"It’s not a perfect stat obviously, but Rubio is 11th in win shares behind:   Harden, Curry, Griffin, DeRozan, Taj Gibson, Teff Teague, Darren Collison, Jrue, Danny Green and Ty Lawson"
"I mean Middleton won't miss every 3 point attempt the whole series, unless he wants a trade to the Rockets. I think defense on Trae is all about help and making well drilled switches. I know Philly was an absurd defensive team individually, but Doc made great changes after the first half of G1 (namely, stop leaving Danny Green on island with Trae). You can't play simple 1 on 1 defense on Trae, he's too quick, and Hawks are screen setting like they invented it. I don't know the terminology but it seemed like Philly was using some sort of zone to close down some of the driving lanes for Trae, which forced him to dish it out--often times to guys who couldn't get a clean shot. This series is really trial by fire for Bud: his talented team beat another talented team, and it ended up being about individuals. I think the Hawks are maximizing their talent through Nate, who's shown he can make all sorts of crazy adjustments."
"The Raptors maybe. I mean,   1) To start they lost to the Magic, who then went back to being the Magic(no offense) with Vucevic, Fournier, and Ross all dipping below 38%.   2) Then Joel Embiid was battling injuries in the second round, capped off by arguably the luckiest shot of the playoffs.   3) Giannis had them down 2-0, and then Kawhi said “hell nah” and led them to 4 straight wins.   4) They also had real luck with getting Nick Nurse over Dwayne Casey, as well as Danny Green and trading for Marc Gasol after Memphis held on to him for too long."
"Offensively, they are pretty equal.   Defensively is where the difference comes in to play. Luka is average whilst Trae is really bad.   However, in today’s NBA, having a guard who is terrible on defense can be hidden as long as the other team doesn’t have 5 live-ball threats who can do something with the ball, and none of the teams the Hawks have faced have had that, all of the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks have had players who Trae can hide on like PJ Tucker or Danny Green.   Furthermore, Hawks haven’t faced a great offensive guard yet who can hunt mismatches. The closest they’ve faced is Jrue Holiday, who is a solid offensive player but not a star that breaks defenses. If the Hawks make the Finals, they are in for a rude awakening against the damage that CP3 and Book would do to their defense which isn’t that great, but is getting masked by opponents who aren’t great offensively."
"Danny Green slander will not be tolerated this year. Dude balled the fuck out all year long. His vet presence was missed after the injury. I know that's not the point of this post, but just wanted to say it ha"
"How many role players have to miss open three point shots in crucial moments in the playoffs for people to understand that these aren't the right plays, ESPECIALLY when it's a 3-PT shot.  There's a reason Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton get paid 86 million a year combined and Pat Connaughton gets paid 4 million, Connaughton isn't a great shooter and a 3 there is a mistake anyways.  Every time this situation comes up i always say this: If you are LeBron James or Giannis or whomever it is, you are giving the defense a favor when you pass to a role player in a crucial moment, that's EXACTLY what they want and that's why Kyle Korver or Danny Green or, in this case Pat Connaughton, is wide open. Part of what makes a great player a GREAT player is being reliable in clutch moments, that's not the same for a role player.  And before people ask ""But what about Jordan passing to Kerr?"", That was a two pointer right around the foul line, my opinion completely changes if its a layup or a WIDE OPEN 12 footer."
"Capela is at least a threat at the rim, Zingis is just a 7ft Danny Green with a worse defense"
"I think what the bucks need is a couple of vets that have won championships - and not as guys who are bench players or utility guys, but as a core part of the team. Correct me if I’m forgetting someone obvious here, but I don’t think anyone on their roster has actually won, right? That’s a big deal.  That team could really use someone like a Danny green, or someone like that who’s been on some winning teams and can help them paint the path - right now they’re all figuring it out together, which is great, but it would help so much to have a ring or two kicking around that they could rely on to keep them on track."
For Simmons. Horford was a part of the Danny Green deal. Danny Green went to OKC in the Schroder deal.
Simmons holds Trae to 37% shooting in the entire series bar the first half of game 1 when Trae dropped 25 on Danny Green. With no Simmons on him this game he goes for 48. At some point we have to acknowledge Simmons did a great defensive job on Young despite his own offensive shortcomings.
D fish would’ve gotten the danny green treatment probably. Fans are super reactionary

I know it's not going to get you karma but it's the truth and needs to be said.
"Even the Raptors were a mini super team. Kawhi Leonard jumping ship and joining a playoff caliber team with Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol and Danny Green."
Bud is a dumbass for that first half defense on Trae and so is Doc for putting Danny Green on him.
"Hey, don't downplay Danny Green. If he wasn't injured, surely the Sixers would've won the chip, just like the last two teams he was on."
Against Jrue Holiday being the main assignment to check him  Looks like 76ers with exception of Danny Green actually contained Trae far better than whatever the Bux were doing tonight
Danny Green has entered the chat
"All defensive potential is a bit much, he’s not great in isolation more of a good help defender/team defender a la late career Danny Green"
replace Danny Green on that championship team and you got a 3 headed monster with size and length.  anyone can score 30+ at any given moment and I would dare say would keep both Bron and AD healthy come playoff time since they have a reliable scorer in PG.
"As the third star? He doesn’t even have to make a shot just his defense alone will make us unbeatable, we already saw us win with danny green bricking everything…"
Danny Green
"He helped Kawhi so much when he was here, also Danny Green. I'm proud of him he deserves this."
"Steph, Klay, Simmons, Draymond and Wiseman with Danny Green first off the bench. Simmons can swing to point guard or point forward. Draymond is already an offensive liability as far as scoring goes so Simmons can play his role while also actually playing point when Steph is on the bench. A closing line up of Steph, Klay, Simmons, Danny and Draymond has plenty of shooting and can defend anyone. Ben assisted on the most 3 pointers this season- telling me Steve Kerr is gonna pass that up…"
Wiggins and Kemba walker to the 76ers;   Ben Simmons and Danny Green to Golden State;  Kelly Oubre and GSW 7th and 14th to OKC
"Robert Covington, Trevor Ariza, or Danny Green?"
"These draft comparisons are always out there. Its never like ""he's going to be the next Danny Green"". lol"
"Yep, having a guard get caught on the screen created a lot of 2 on ones that Jokic either had to play up on the guard and give CP3 a window to lob it to Ayton or play both which is susceptible to pull up 2 point jumpshots.  I don't think people realize that a big reason the 6ers, Bucks &amp; Lakers are as good as the are defending the PnR outside of having fantastic defensive bigs, is the size, length, effort and ability to recover by their perimeter guys.   * LeBron * Simmons * Jrue * Danny Green * Caruso * Thybulle * Middleton  These are very good, big active defenders that are able to recover back into action so the big isn't defending a 2-on-1. Could Embiid, Ayton, Turner, Draymond, or Bam prevent a couple jumpers or alley oops Jokic can't? Probably. Are they all susceptible to exactly what Chris Paul did, and has been doing for over a decade, against the Nuggets w/o good perimeter defenders? Also, probably. Just ask Gobert.  What makes Embiid, Ayton, Draymond, Turner or Bam so good defensively is positional excellence + the ability to recover and make defensive plays outside of their area. Jokic has positional excellence but is limited to ""inside his area""."
"I mean, Simmons had a series long brain fart, Embiid was playing on a partially torn meniscus, and their inly 3/D guy was hurt (Danny Green).  The Bucks are healthy mostly, and don’t have Doc “worse the Bud” Rivers."
Lol “Danny green”
The Bucks can have their best 5 defenders on the floor at once without sacrificing nearly as much offense as the Sixers would when running Thybulle/Simmons together....also don’t forget Danny Green was missing
"Yeah I think each of those non-calls were defensible because of what it would have taken to make the salaries match. Philly's the one that's the least defensible because it would have just been Danny Green and someone else, but the flip side is Philly has constantly been making these big trades and revamping their roster, there's an argument to be made for introducing some stability and letting the roster that's the #1 seed in the east just go for it. Hindsight is what it is though"
"I think salaries. Lillard makes more, so Philly would have to send more salary, but they don't really have bad salaries. Besides Harris and Simmons, I think only Danny Green is overpaid at all, but they seem to like him. On second thought though, they would totally send Green to get Lillard.  Yeah I think you're right."
"Danny Green is a vet that's played under one of the best coaches ever and alongside Duncan, Parker, Ginoibli, Kawhi &amp; LeBron while winning 3 titles.  Slander the guy all you want but he knows what it takes to win"
"Crowder or Danny Green, who has been the ""better"" journeyman/role player the last decade? Feels like all either one does is win."
"The death threats towards Danny Green and KCP were horrific too. There's been this trend of people dunking on athletes and entertainers because their 'jobs' are easier and there's more money if you're a 'star' but if you gave me $100M for the work that I do and make every little move I make public and tell me I'm disappointing the communities I'm a part of or the country I'm from, I'd have mental health issues too."
We couldn't even get Danny Green
Danny green was the mvp all along
I would say 2-3 years when Sekou and Hayes have more time to develop. Some nice pieces though for sure. A Danny green type veteran would be a solid offseason pickup to mentor the young players.
"Tobias Harris was balling this season, Danny Green and Seth Curry are top level role players. They have a great team besides Ben and Doc."
"Adding on to this, Jrue is probably the best Trae stopper there is remaining in the playoffs because none of the Sixers or Knicks could keep up with his size and quickness. Jrue is a smaller and faster guard so he isn't going to get cooked as easily as Danny Green or Ben Simmons and he's far more experienced than Thybulle so he won't make any dumb mistakes. Frankly even if Jrue shoots like absolute shit so long as he holds Trae to 30 ish % from the floor the Bucks shouldn't have too many problems."
"Firstly, your English is great. Secondly, thank you for this write up. It makes sense thinking back and reading your post. This quality analysis will probably lost in all the crazy upvoted Ben hate posts but I at least appreciated it.   The fact is Doc is to blame for a lot of the issues and there's no excuse for not being able to recognize what's happening and counter when you're up 26 to finish out that win. But he was dealing with a lot of limiting factors:  -No Danny Green for most of the series.   -Ben absolutely cratered midway through the series.   -No stretch 5 on the roster, which means that Ben can't effectively run a bench unit where he just goes to work with shooters.   -Ben and Dwight absolutely cannot play together.   -Milton and Maxey take turns being unplayable, sometimes both of them. Doc has no idea what he'll get from game to game from them in this series.   -*Tobias Harris was not able to take advantage of a slower, less quick PF* (your analysis)  -Hobbled Embiid.   -The only reliable shooter after Green went down was Seth, who got absolutely roasted in this series, especially Game 7.   -He's forced to play Dwight Howard and basically live with the two to three ridiculous fouls or flagrants that he gets that are completely unforced errors.   These are just the major ones."
"&gt;I really think with Lowry on this squad, they can beat Atlanta in 6 games max.  We would've beat them in 5 with Danny Green dude. He wouldn't have held the lead down and kept us from choking in games 4, 5, and 7."
"He's had the hardest path in the East so far, too. His team is the injured one and his opponents other than Danny Green have been healthy"
The Danny Green post is ironic. Thats why it's in r/nbacirclejerk. If you don't know what irony is I can't help you.
"Morey did some magic with the roster he had, he damn near even got them Harden if not for fertita's grudge.   I wholeheartedly believed the sixers were done, imagine digging out of maxing both Harford and Harris and not having good shooters.   Not only did he get rid of Al, he also got Curry and Green uuh Seth and Danny, obviously lol"
How much of that was even Doc vs replacing Horford &amp; Josh Richardson with Danny Green &amp; Seth Curry and having pieces around Tobias that actually made sense?
I’d give the  edge to the sixers support just off of Seth playing amazing. Tobi was alright. Tbf to the nets tho Blake griffin was playing pretty nice and Jeff green was big in game 6. If joe Harris looked like his normal self I feel like it’d be pretty even since the sixers supporting cast outside of Tobi and Seth didn’t do much and Danny was out
"As long as there's a salary cap, I don't see a reason why a player (even the NBAPA President) of CP3's stature/age can't take less money.  One of the reasons Tim took less money wasn't just to get new players on the team. It was so SA could pay current players their market value without crippling SA's books/flexibility.   It allowed them to get LMA eventually, but before that it allowed SA to keep Patty, Diaw, Tiago, Danny Green etc. around once their contracts were up.  Player agency is the name of the game and that means a player can *choose* to take less. Especially if it comes with the understanding (just as an example) that he won't play in b2bs or that he'll miss a week of a games leading up to the playoffs, etc."
I’m guessing it was a player and that player was Danny Green. He’s on his way out anyway.
"CP’s a question mark for first team, might go Klay over him. I like iggy and danny green."
"Yes really. Danny Green shoots 41% from 3, Tobias Harris shoots 39%, Embiid shoots 38%. As a team they are 10th in 3PT%"
"Meh, Danny Green is giving you 2 games he’s invisible, 2 games he’s amazing, and 2 games he practically single handedly loses the game every close series"
&gt; with a treasure chest of assets and talent  *Doc Rivers exits the chat*  Also - the Danny Green injury probably cost them a lot more than they think since he was one of the two shooters on the team who can reasonably move around and create a decent shot without a basketball in their hand.
Give us Danny Green back please
"Lakers fans send death threats or hate messages to their role players on a seemingly regular basis. See Danny Green, or Kuzma, or KCP, or any of the dudes who got traded for AD. This is not a uniquely Philly thing. The only thing unique about this situation is Simmons and his culpability for tanking the Sixers this series, though Doc deserves just as much blame for that. We've just never seen a player get exposed this severely so of course it's a huge deal."
"Then we won't trade him, especially if you think you're going to get back Danny Green too"
2nd round exit realistically. Tobias Harris not a big playoff performer and Danny Green too old.
"G- Russell Westbrook   G- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  F- Danny Green  F- Tobias Harris   C- Joël Embiid   Westbrook would relish in feeding these players. He’s still a consistent scoring threat. He can pass the ball to shooters, drive to the rim, or throw it to Embiid down low"
"Do you think it's possible that Danny Green got more than one threat towards his family before issuing that statement? Lol. I said in my comment already it's likely not a big threat, but it's a real enough that if your family receives death threats, then it's absolutely fair to treat that with some level of seriousness.  Nice petty edit, I wonder which strawman that is for? I think yr being downvoted for downplaying death threats because the op only mentioned that it must have sucked to experience and people are likely seeing you as an edgy bitch; I only offered the above example under the likelihood you were a kid who hadn't thought about it enough."
"Siakam and Danny Green should have both ahead of Kawhi for All-D voting in 2019.  Kawhi was a decent defender, but he missed a lot of games, and Siakam and Green always took on the harder assignments in the regular season."
"I think Paul George, Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma all get roasted pretty equally. It seems especially bad right now since it's fresh, but I'm sure that in a few months once the season starts again and Ben has his first good game it'll calm down."
Danny Green I'm assuming
Danny Green getting injured is what robbed his chances of a 3peat now leads me to question everything I saw about those other two playoffs. Was Danny Green the reason the Raptors and Lakers won?
"Poor baby, can’t take the truth. Millennials lol  “Fuck you Danny Green…”  Lol"
"I know Ben was awful but let's not forget Danny Green let Trae Young roll the ball to half court in Game 1 or 2 iirc. That man has 3 Championships and has played with some of the best players in the world like Bron, AD, Kawhi, Duncan etc. You'd think he would know what he's doing."
"reminds me of the miss by Danny Green last season in the finals man, people are harsh"
"_is_ it possible?  can Philly afford to be hardcapped?  their payroll last year was already $146M, 2021-22 active roster cap for 11 players is already $136M with 11 players (including ben $33M; not including danny green who was paid over $15M last year, mike scott who was $5M).  they have a $8M trade exception they won't be able to use to preserve a larger contract slot if they do a S&amp;T, too."
"Danny Green, Rondo and Dwight was better. Becoming a defensive juggernaut with streaky shooting allowed us to rest LeBron a ton of fourth quarters when the shooting picked up and the other team was struggling to score 60."
"Danny green missed a 3 pointer to win the NBA championship. Nice guy, however a boy of an apologist based on his responses to missing said shot."
Fuck that all my homies hate Danny Green
They lost cause Danny Green wasn't playing
"All thess reasons man smh and when danny green, a guy much less paid, got a bad night death threat all over fcuking shame."
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Seth Curry F: Danny Green F: Tobias Harris C: Dwight Howard
So basically Danny Green a couple years ago
"That's being incredibly reductionist. Using this same logic Giannis is a bad player.  The problem for Simmons and the Sixers is that he's a poor fit with Embiid, not that he's bad. To make the most of either one of Embiid and Simmons you want to surround them with 4 shooters, but the Sixers keep going out and getting the most talented player available, fit be damned. Seth Curry and Danny Green are like their only free agent signing that actually fit either of their stars in recent memory.  At this point unless Simmons makes an incredible improvement this off season (unlikely considering his lack of development so far) they need to move him for someone who can actually make Embiid's job easier before Embiid decides he's sick of this shit and wants out, but again that does not make Ben a bad player."
"Kawhi has a player option. Danny Green is a FA. Ibaka and Lowry as well. I think the best scenario is to have the Raptors finally run it back, and have DeMar be part of it all."
"Hey, harden was pratically 6th man of the year when rookie. Kobe almost got a tittle (even got the last shot in an elimination game - which he missed btw). Kawhi got significant minutes in a team with duncan, parker, ginobli and danny green. Jokic also put awesome numbers.  Aside from giannis, all your examples were absolute units right out of draft."
"That's why Pop was allowed to torch his players, he did it to Duncan and Duncan allowed it.  The look on TP's face when Pop told Danny Green to STFU is still priceless though; ""Hah, glad it's not me/I took that shit for three straight years."""
Maybe if they throw in danny green too
It could have been avoided if: - Thybulle didn't foul on a 3  - Dwight didn't get a flagrant foul - Danny Green didn't get injured - Kevin Huerter wasn't Kevin Huerant - Trae Young didn't have ice running through his veins - The Pacers didn't fire Nate McMillan - The Hawks didn't fire Lloyd Pierce - The Sixers didn't hire Doc Rivers - Tony Snell
"KD maybe? At times better than LeBron, both have had multiple peaks where they're better than the other.  However, Messi and LeBron changed how we imagine soccer and basketball, whereas KD and Ronaldo are kind of like the perfect players of maybe just before the new era that the GOATs brought us into.  Messi didn't create the False 9 role and LeBron didn't create the idea of a point-forward, but without the change of ideas that Messi brought, there's no way that say, this season Manchester City doesn't go out and buy or at least loan in a center forward with Aguero out with a long-term injury. The old conceptions of who the PG is have some sites listing Danny Green, KCP, and Alex Caruso as starting PGs on the title-winning Lakers."
"We have a pretty good idea of how much money we would’ve had to pay them, look at their contracts. It made no sense to spend that money on them.  What point are you trying to make for Danny Green? I know what he’s done, and what kind of player he is. He’s a good role player for a contender. The Raptors have enough guards and there was no need to bring him back for a rebuild/retool.   Marc is on the vet minimum because he wanted to chase a chip in LA, we would’ve had to pay him more to stay here. He would’ve been our best 5, but that isn’t saying much lmao, he’s still old and not capable of playing heavy minutes. I’m glad we didn’t bring back a aging Marc Gasol, we were not contending with or without him.   I’m not saying Masai is a savant who makes splashes in free agency, but which GM is? The real free agency splashes occur due to the market and location of a team, OR the players themselves make it happen, look at Brooklyn this past season.   Once again, I’m not saying Masai is a master in FA, I’m saying that bringing up Serge/Marc and Danny as example of why he’s not good in FA, makes no sense. It’s a positive that he let them go, had he signed them to lengthy contracts and ate up our cap space, THAT would’ve shown he’s bad in FA."
"You don’t know how much money they would have made,   But Danny Green is a 3&amp;D wing that won a title his first year out of the Raptors and then was on a 1 seed all this year.   Marc is playing on a min and would have been our best 5 this season.   We didn’t have a 5 this year to develop either.   Masai even addressed he fucked up in free agency this year, but yeah the Raptors lucked their way into the 4th pick by fucking up in free agency, having Covid impact their team during a crucial time of the season, and then just blatant tanking once the season was done.    And again, you can’t just invalidate everything with anecdotal opinions, without providing anything to show that Masai is good in that regard. Just shows that you can’t show that Masai is good at signing free agents."
"How was it not good? What does tying money into aging veterans like Danny Green and Marc Gasol do?  We weren’t gonna be contending, and frankly Marc was a 20 minute player his last season here anyway.   I’m extremely happy we let them walk, it meant more development for our real prospects, more cap space, and we got a better draft pick out of it."
Doesn't remember that Danny Green 3 and that Vogel just had to start Caruso and it was no contest.
They would have been better off just keeping Danny Green
"The irony of your faux big brain is you’re not taking into consideration things like cap space and assets. Feel free to point out in preseason last year how we could have got better pieces than two, 6MOTY candidates for Danny Green and a MLE. I’ll wait."
"Uhh I think most fans think these playoffs suck. Watching the Suns sweep the Murrayless Nuggets was really fun. The Clippers without Kawhi was really fun. Watching Harden limp around was great. Not seeing Kyrie was great. The Celtics without Jalen Brown was awesome. Trae Young and Giannis getting hurt was very fun. *Embiid limping around, Danny Green getting hurt, Lebron on a bum ankle, AD going down, Chris Paul getting Covid- all awesome times."
I hope we get Lakers Nets next year tbh   Also the Sixers weren't hurt outside of Embiid who played well. Danny Green too ig but Simmons was the problem
"That’s unfair criticism.  Nobody could’ve made Kawhi stay with Toronto, and Danny/Marc/Serge were all dependent on Kawhi coming back, had he re-signed the Raptors would’ve obviously brought back the title team.  Once Kawhi left though, there’s 0 reason to bring back an aging Marc Gasol or Danny Green."
"You’re not finding replacements to replace these guys, these new players don’t have the personalities &amp; humor to replace them. If you want similar comedy &amp; moments this crew I had the crew I would suggest is Russell Westbrook to replace Charles, Danny Green to replace Kenny &amp; Kevin Garnett to replace Shaq."
"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed “Playoff Rondo”.  KCP: “Binary Mamba” for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers’ Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe’s word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers “ain’t the one”. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become “washed”. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to “good” teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, “to continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation”. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. “FOR KOBE” is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a “bubble” as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets’ bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a “mickey mouse ring” or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  “Job’s not done”  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
"LeBron and Curry easily, that is an all time scary duo. Give those 2 Jarrett Allen, Crowder, Danny Green and they would repeat lol"
"Negative, Duncan would have won it had we won the Finals. Green had 2 really good games, one above average game and was neutral or bad in the other 4. Duncan had 4 really good games, 1 above average game and 2 neutral games. Duncan averaged 19/12/1.5 blocks while Green averaged 14/4/1.6 blocks. The above statlines plus Duncan dominating in the later games of the series (plus being the more “traditional” candidate) would’ve 100% given him the nod, even though Danny broke the 3PM record that series. If we’d won in 5 games, he probably would’ve won it though, yes."
Danny green would have won in 2013.
"The warriors fucking suck and are going no where in the rest of you life time, Steph is supposedto be one of the best Pg's of all time yet loses a finals mvp to Iguodala, Klay talking about how if he were there, that the playoffs would be different, sure they would you fucking role player, Klay is no more valuable than Danny Green, literally the same role, and then there is Draymond, thinks he is the best defensiveplayer in the league, man is a big Pat Bev, with worse offense... There, that should do the trick"
True.  Danny Green almost had one.
Poor danny green he got shafted so bad into getting paid a big contract 🥺
"Let’s all remember the fact Danny Green got shafted because of Kawhi. Kawhi strung the lakers along in the offseason until there were almost no available players left. Danny Green agreed to hold off on making a decision because the lakers agreed to give him a big contract if Kawhi didn’t work out. Kawhi bailed so Danny got paid $18mill which he never had a chance to live up to. Even if he played well for his standards, he probably would’ve been traded to get rid of that steep contract. His wing defense was amazing for the lakers, what a shame how it all turned out."
If you don't love him at his Ben Simmons you don't deserve him at his Danny Green
I almost want to see him on the Spurs for the sheer comedy of Pop’s face turning red with anger every other possession. If he screamed “shut the f*** up” to Danny Green mid game I can only imagine what he’d say to Drummond lol
"In the word of Danny Green himself. Despite losing 2 times already against the Clippers, he said that this team was the most fun he had ever in his years of being in the NBA.  In a way, it’s a fitting way end to a story that everyone ended it there. What a storyline the 2020 Lakers were. Truly fiction-like."
"It's honestly kind of weird seeing a basic NBA finals game being played.  Like everyone's playing pretty well offensively. This is abnormal, probably the lack of Danny Green."
pretty sure danny green doesn’t have his ring yet
"I'm still mad that she implied that Klay flopped and got himself injured, while ESPN avoided showing the angle that clearly showed that Danny Green hit him."
"If he went to the Warriors, Curry probably ends up being CJ McCollum, Klay glorified Danny Green. Draymond a Ben Simmons who shoots"
Danny Green or CJ McCollum
Yeah I agree with that  It was a golden chance IMO--best since Stockton and Malone--and they blew it  There aren't too many excuses that can be made--kind of like the Sixers with Danny Green and Embiid's meniscus tear: like yeah that was bad but it was a Hawks team with no real playoff hopes going into the year beyond just making it with no Hunter or Redish (and they were up by a ton in games 4 and 5)  No excuses to be made
Danny Green
That guys tripping lol.  I guess he's mad as a Spurs fan that Bosh got the game winning rebound and pass to Allen.  Bosh also had that game saving block on Danny Green in game 6 I believe.
"I think the biggest advantage the bubble would have provided (conjecture of course) is to rookies, with a bit to streaky shooters (danny green not withstanding).  I don't think it's wholly a coincidence that Nunn and Herro were the 1st all rookie players to reach the finals since Ginobli, and nunn the 1st to do so as all rookie 1st team since byron scott in the 70s. 1st in history for a team to do it with 2 all rookie players too.  Plus the long break would have benefitted some teams more than others.  I personally don't subscribe to the ""bubble trash"" narrative. But it's definitely a factor. Same way the shortened off season was a factor this year."
Kawhi was the Finals MVP but we all know Danny Green was the real MVP
"there's no hate. just calling it like I see it. I can easily compliment Lebron. for example he knows his role very well in pressure situations and will let someone else decide the fate of the game like Danny Green, GHill, or Kyrie"
"Well at the very least Danny Green could have been that same veteran presence for the young players that you're saying DeRozan was, only in this scenario you'd have also got a 23 year old All Star talent under contract for the next 4 years instead of Jacob Poeltl."
Danny Green?
"I don’t know what this fascination with Danny Green is, dude is washed and both the Raptors and Lakers won despite of his play. Losing him is is not and was not ever a big deal. And no I wouldn’t say great, but yea personally I’m happy with how things turned out with the Raptors trade. Young guys learned a lot and they won just enough to satisfy Pop until he moves on."
"&gt;So to answer that question, how I feel having Poetl, DeMar AND (you forgot one) Keldon Johnson vs. Ingram and what would likely have been the 30th pick? (That was the reported package)  Well now it's my turn to correct you, as you forgot the trade also included Danny Green, and they didn't trade for Keldon Johnson, but rather Toronto's 1st round pick in 2019, which turned out to be the 29th pick in the draft. If the Lakers had LeBron and Kawhi I'm sure the pick they sent San Antonio would have been no worse than that, as the Warriors still had KD that year and Milwaukee had the league's best record with 60 wins (the Warriors had 57).   So what we're actually talking about is Danny Green and Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and the 29th pick vs. Ingram and basically the same pick for just Kawhi. So really it's a question of whether you'd rather have Ingram and possibly Danny Green or just Jacob Poeltl, since the pick would have been the same and DeRozan is probably gone. Was the DeRozan era really that great in San Antonio that you're happy with that return?"
"Playmaking wise, yeah. But take him anyways if they’re gonna trot out him, thybulle, harris, embiid and danny green. RFA control is nice"
"I swear Jae Crowder, PJ Tucker, and Danny Green just pick a random playoff team every year lol"
"Look, even if you think DeRozan is amazing and wildly underrated, the reality is that he's an unrestricted free agent who might sign with another team in the next month. Pop traded Kawhi and Danny Green for DeRozan and Poeltl, presumably because he didn't want to rebuild and wanted to keep being competitive, but that really hasn't happened. They made the playoffs once since then, and now DeRozan might leave them with nothing. If that happens then what will the point of all this have been? Ingram might not be as good as DeRozan (although to be fair, of the two of them, he's the only one to have made an All Star game since that trade), but at least he's young and is still under contract. Good as DeRozan might be, there's no guarantee he'll even be playing for the Spurs next year."
"Eh, I dunno. In the 2017-18 season (the one where Kawhi only played 9 games) the Spurs won 47 games. But then they traded him and Danny Green for DeRozan and Poeltl and with those upgrades they won... 48 games. They replaced 9 games of Kawhi with 77 games of DeRozan and their win total only went up by one game. And then just like the year before, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. They haven't been back since. And now DeRozan is an unrestricted free agent and very possibly could just go sign elsewhere. I think it's totally OK to be questioning what the plan is down there in San Antonio."
"I believe so, yeah. And LeBron played with Danny Green, who was in the 18-19 Finals. So LeBron’s streak goes to atleast the 10-11 Finals."
"Does it count retroactively? Like, I’m looking for the guy who played with LeBron in the 2018-2019 Finals and Danny Green played with him the next year. Does that still count? Either way, Andrew Bogut played was with the Cavs for a short time in 2017. Does it count of the teammate would eventually play with LeBron (or Shaq in the case of the streak in question)? I guess so, right?"
"Well, game 1 for starters. Ya know, the one that went to OT?  The fact that the rest of the Cavs were also trash doesn't support your case of LeBron having anywhere close to adequate help for a finals team. LeBron put up 34/9/10 on 62% TS.  We're still not talking about the 2015 finals. The Cavs were not heathy that year, they were in 2018. In 2013 the Spurs had Kawhi and Danny Green both put up 15 and 14 ppg respectively on good efficiency with great defense. In 2011 Jason Terry put up 18ppg on 70% TS. Hedo and Rashard Lewis put up 18ppg each for the Magic, with Turkoglu doing it on great efficiency. Both were also good defenders. In 2008 the Lakers had Pau and Lamar Odom. Every single one you listed either scored on good efficiency, or brought something other than scoring, or both. All Klove did was score inefficiently, and rebound against an undersized Warriors team.   The Raptors were trash and DeRozan was trash. I havent bragged about the Cavs beating them.    Keep trolling though, cutie"
"Yeah LeBron kept it alive for years. But I haven’t really checked with the 2019 finals, so I wasn’t sure if it ended there or now. Or if it happened to keep going somehow.  Edit: 2019 Danny Green was it. But it ends this year at 37…https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/07/nba-finals-shaquille-oneal-streak-over"
Danny Green had a chance to threepeat if Ben Simmons hadn't choked.
"Last year we got Schroder for our first round pick and Danny Green, and Schroders value last year was much higher than Kembas this year so OKC would probably take a similar type deal.  We have our first round pick this year too."
"A backup ball handler, a shooter(or two) if THJ isn't re-signed, and a versatile, athletic rim running center.   My wish list looks something like dinwiddie, nerlens noel/richaun holmes and maybe like a one year deal for danny green or something."
Danny Green was the same way.  I think Lebron always liked playing with Danny
Sixers were missing an old lousy washed up Danny Green LOL🤣🤣🤣 Robinson doesnt equal Hunter and Reddish. Come on try again.
Danny green was winning games for the Hawks lol. Dude played significantly worse than Simmons lol
Why would they give someone a bad contract just because they traded Danny Green and one late 1st for him? It's a sunk cost and not even a steep one. Just let him go.
"What about LeBron? 00-02 Shaq, 03 Jefferson 0405 Ben 06 Wade, 08-10 Rondo, 19 Danny Green 21 Crowder"
Danny Green being healthy would have been enough for PHI imo
"So this may sound weird but two things. I don’t see Lonzo as a primary ball handler anywhere. What I see him as is Danny Green who can be a great secondary handler. I don’t think the Celtics need a true PG. In the playoffs you want the ball in Tatum’s hands to start the primary action. I think they need a secondary ball handler who is a great spot up shooter to kick out to in case of the primary action failing. In this vision Tatum is a 20%  better playmaker. The transaction would be like the Brogdon precedent with Milwaukee and Indiana. Also last thing, this is the one move I see that makes them a top 10 offense and defensive team."
Danny Green
He’s like Super Danny Green
Danny Green is the original
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.  Suns: Prime CP3, Booker, Ayton, Crowder, Bridges, 76ers Saric, Hornets Kaminsky, Pelicans E'Twaun Moore.  Warriors: Steph, Klay, Draymond, T-Wolves Wiggins, Hawks Bazemore, Wizards Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee, Paschall.  Heat: Jimmy, Iggy, Oladipo, Dragic, Bam, Ariza, Haslem, Herro, Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Bjelica.  Blazers: Lillard, Melo, CJ, Nurkic, Covington, Kanter, Norman Powell, Hollis-Jefferson.  Bucks: Giannis, Lopez, Holiday, Middleton, Teague, Portis, Tucker, Forbes.  Knicks: MVP Rose, Randle, Barrett, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel, Pistons Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks, Quickley."
Not really. Kawhi and DeRozan were only 4M off in salary. Even with a couple million from Poeltl. Danny Green was like 10M.  Edit: Spelling
I would have Danny Green as second guy for SG and have Martin as the backup SF behind Kawhi.
Green looked completely washed at that point. I remember being annoyed that we took Danny as part of the trade lol
Danny Green was a throw-in for DeRozan
"I don't know about minor trade, but getting the Spurs to part with Danny Green as part of Kawhi deal was a pretty genius little move."
"Would you consider Danny Green (s&amp;t) for Davis Bertans?  Westbrook, Beal, Green, Hachimura, Bryant/Gafford?"
"I remember when SA's G-league team signed him, I thought he could be a decent contributor. Like another Danny Green/Patty Mills waiver addition.  He showed flashes, but he was never good enough to be playing almost 30mpg. Honestly with his 3 shot I'm surprised he hasn't stuck around."
"Who's insulting you? Unless you think bad take is an insult. And based on your bad takes I really doubt it, maybe twice as much highlights and boxscore watching sure but full games that's a big no and it shows. Trust me when I tell you Klay isnt even a 2nd option at all, Middleton is a million X better than him. For every good game Klay has he has 10 stinkers. He averages 55% TS because he doesn't have Steph and KD taking the pressure off him. Klay is a chucker that led the team in shots TF you talking about low usage lmao his selfish ass tried so hard to make an all nba team and had to cry to the media kemba making it over him, the guy didn't even deserve his last 2 ALLstar appearances either. Also khris is a 50/40/90, Klay is not when he absolutely should be. Goes to show how superior khris is to him. So he's a good defender but still gets abused? LOL.   And no shit they missed the playoffs he's deadweight eating close to 40million in cap space. Replace him with any decent player with the cap he's eating and warriors are comfortably contenders. Remove Middleton from the bucks and they lose in the first round... AGAIN. remove Klay from the KD warriors or replace him with Danny green and they still win regardless.   In 2015 when Cavs were up 2-1 vs the warriors, warriors won 3 games in a row to win the championship, Klay averaged 8ppg on 35% from 2 and 25% from 3 those games, dont ever say dumb shit like he's important piece to a championship ever again."
Very small chance Bridges pulls a supernova Danny Green type series but I agree Middleton is most likely.
"Yeah Moody seems to have a huge variance in where he’s going. 6’6” doesn’t seem undersized to me though. Same height as Klay, Danny Green and Mikal Bridges who are the prototypical 3&amp;D players you want him to end up being."
"Jaylen’s an underrated defender by this point. He struggled this season (like everyone on the Celtics but advanced stats still mostly had him as neutral or a slight negative defensively) and some cherry picked clips that could be found on almost any player made people focus on his offball defense, often criticizing him for a defensive lapse that I’d later see an actual analyst fault someone else for.  He’s still a great on ball defender - while he’s in the top sixth of the league for shots attempted against him, opponents shoot 2.2% worse than their average when he defends them. That’s better than Ayton, RJ, OG, PG, Lonzo, Capela, Jrue, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges and a lot of others. There are some defensive advanced stats that put him above Tatum though I think Tatum’s definitely better.   He’d consistently raised his defense in the postseason and was fantastic last year while also also averaging 22 ppg on 58.6% ts. He tied Tatum in defensive raptor with +3  above guys like Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This year, guys with at least a .5 lower d-raptor include Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG. He also had a 1.1 dbpm which was better than Dort, PG, Gobert, Embiid, Danny Green and more last year and this year would be more than players like Mikal Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, PG. Most impressively, he had the 4th most total defensive win shares with 1.1 only after Tatum, Lebron, and AD. Part of that is him getting to the ecf but Butler and Bam got to the finals and still have fewer defensive win shares."
Danny Green knows though.
"Today's NBA is much more entertaining than ten years ago lmao. People just like jerking off to some NBA that never was. What they were actually watching (if they were even NBA fans back then) were PJ Tucker or Danny Green-esque role players spotting up for long twos instead of threes. Do you think your average role player was taking off the dribble mid-range twos? No, and even if they were that'd be dreadful to watch."
Lol Danny green told the press Ben Simmons isn’t the kind of guy to improve on things without getting pressure.   Maybe! It’s a possibility. If that’s the case they keep him. But there’s a very real chance it’s the opposite and then he needs gone
Competitive wise I get what you mean but Danny Green loves Toronto so I guess if he didn't care that the Raptors wouldn't be as good he could potentially agree.
Why would Danny Green sign and trade with the Sixers to Toronto?
"For the last 4 years? Absolutely. You're acting like Klay contributed to a championship during those runs, replace him with Danny Green and they still win. In 2015 warriors literally carried Klay to a championship."
Danny Green and Gary Neal raining 3s on the heat
"&gt;who are some memorable role players who have stepped up in the finals  KCP and Rondo stepped up big for the Lakers last season, FVV for the raps the yr before, 2017 &amp; 2018 warriors are irrelevant, jr smith came up huge in g7 for the cavs, iggy in 2015 for the warriors  Danny Green went crazy in 2013 as well although on the losing side"
Cam Johnson is a younger Danny Green. I’ll take one of those dudes on my team all day.
Yeah and then there’s a chance Danny Green keeps the streak going
"2019 also had Kawhi and Danny Green playing in the finals, they'd won before then"
"I’m completely fine with getting Lowry, just not for Simmons. If you want to pay Danny Green 25 mil for one year to make the math work and hand them a big expiring and a good FRP I’m all for it."
Don't forget the mighty Danny Green won in 2019 and 2020.
Danny Green
40 year old Kareem averaged like 12/5 on 25 mins a game playing backup to Mychaal Thompson for ring number 6. So why does Payton's ring not count if ppl give Kareem credit for just being a role player.  Duncan was definitely more impactful in 2014 than Kareem or GP. But he was arguably the 4th or 5th best player on that team most nights. Clearly Kawhi and Tony were better. And most nights a guy like Danny Green or Manu were more scoring more.  Again. Just saying it's weird to hold Gary Payton a role against him or implying his ring doesn't count when people also use these end of career role player championships to boost the legacies of other great players.
"Danny Green might not be an all star, but he sure knows how to win."
"Bucks narrative started when we lost to the raps, which looking back on it, were way underrated.  That team had kawhi, Lowry, gasol, siakam, ibaka, FVV, Powell, and Danny Green.  Insane team"
TIL Danny Green was drafted by the Cavs.  Thanks for the heads up. Danny Green was indeed there during LeBron's final season in the first stint as a Cavalier.
Want to point out Danny Green was in Cleveland in his early years   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8G0wPTUZvak Mostly remember cause of this video.
For now he’s only missed two recently and Crowder and Danny Green were teammates so the streak is still going so it’s at least 11.
Put him with Danny Green and a few elite shot creators and do you have the greatest team of all time?
honestly im actually on board with that  its way too suspicious when Danny Green dunks in game. Test him on the court during the game
"It wouldn’t have really mattered much considering luc mbah a moute wasn’t playing either. It’s like the sixers missing danny green or the bucks missing donte, it’s not that important"
"If you need proof, someone sent death threats to danny green after missing the game winning shot in game 5 of the finals last year"
"Jae ""Danny 'Patrick McCaw' Green"" Crowder"
Danny Green in SA
FR. They just need to sign Danny Green to injure all the players on the other team who are better than him.
He's the new Danny Green
"Charles Barkley, Thunder Dan, AC Green, Danny Ainge, and Kevin Johnson this is your moment"
I can’t believe 76ers fucked up Danny Green best chance of getting into HoF for being the 1st player to win 3 championships in 3 years for 3 different franchises..
"Also got a veteran/champion in Danny Green. Then and now, I still think that was a really bad trade on San Antonio’s part."
"I like Haliburton, but I think he’s much closer to a Danny Green level player than the cornerstone I’ve seen him described as."
"I'm sure the ask was Maxey, Thybulle and 2 1sts but as you probably can guess from the title of this thread, the ask more than what actually gets the deal done. The Lakers were supposedly legitimately in consideration giving KCP + Schroder so build what you think is equivalent value to that with Danny Green + any of Maxey, Thybulle, and picks and that's probably just under what Morey offered because he's not going to bid against himself for fun."
"Lmao at the time no one knew the nets and Lakers were gonna be struck with injuries. And the sixers still probably aren't good enough to beat the bucks or the suns with Lowry but no Danny green or thybulle, and then have to give up maxey as well for a guy who can just walk at the end of the season lmao"
"Unless you're a GM who has job security and is respected, it is very likely you're going to go with the consensus pick at the top. A lot of people have said this but if you take Cade #1 and he busts, your job is still safe because who could have seen that coming? If you geniunely like another player more but it doesn't end up working out and Cade is a star, then you lose your job and get destroyed by fans and media. Danny Ainge in 2017 when he traded the #1 pick to get Tatum is an example of a GM who went against the consensus because he was able to. It even happens when it comes to trades. A lot of times when a star is traded, the biggest prize is future picks rather than guaranteed young players. The reason why is because the future picks years down the line act as lifelines for GMs, they can't be judged on the trade until we see those picks. It's understated how often GMs think about their job rather than simply doing the right thing for the team.  I honestly don't think the gap between Cade and Mobley/Green is large at all, I think they all have arguments for the best player in the draft. I've also heard that Troy Weaver is actually a guy who doesn't listen to outside opinions, but almost every front office preaches that."
You must be referring to the Labron/Danny Green situation! /s
"Dude what the fuck are you even saying. That’s Covington’s 2nd season vs thybulles 2nd season  The guy has no offensive game. There’s a reason he has no volume. Danny green, Milton, maxy, curry, all contribute to the offense. Thybulle just isn’t good lmao"
No but he was memorable in that series along with Patty Mills and Danny Green. They all have iconic moments.
"I think the first ask from Masai was Maxey, Thybulle, and two 1sts. That would've been in addition to Danny Green and whoever else, mostly likely Tony Bradley, was needed for salary matching."
"They would’ve beat Atlanta, then played the Bucks who lost Giannis midway through the series. Then Embiid would’ve been the most talented player in that Final against Phoenix and he’d have a guy beside him in Lowry who would’ve been the only guy in that series with Finals experience (Danny Green as well). So yeah would’ve been a pretty damn good chance."
"OG isn't Danny Green. 50% of his FGs are unassisted dude. He doesn't average 16ppg standing in the corner lol   Also he is not elite in every aspect of the game. He is literally useless in the half court without the ball in his hands, and even with the ball in his hands he is not an aggressive player. He doesn't have elite athleticism or handles, and he is dogshit at scoring as you alluded to. He has elite size and defense, thats where it ends. When Toronto has faced the 6ers in the last 4 years, I can only really think of a couple games where Simmons was seriously a problem for our defense."
"Also you know getting off of Al Horfords terrible contract for a great 3 and D wing in Danny Green and committing arguably the heist of the offseason last year by getting Seth Curry (a guy that averaged 21 on 79% TS in the Hawks series) for Josh Richardson who was space killer and played like 20 minutes total through games 5-7 of the Clippers series, netting unleashed MVP Embiid with all this spacing and a 1st seed finish  But continue"
"but wait, how will this work with zion?  i got a feeling that new orleans are looking to trade jonas valancinus.  quite possibly for a two-way shooting guard, because that's what the need.     i also see memphis trading eric bledsoe for danny green, since the 76ers are one of the teams ""eyeing"" eric bledsoe."
"How's this?  Sixers get:   * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * OG Anunoby  * 4th overall  Raptors get:   * Ben Simmons  * Tyrese Maxey  * Matisse Thybulle  * 15h overall (from Wizards)  * 28 overall, 2023, 2027 Sixers 1sts  Sixers move Ben for Beal. Instant upgrade, and worth burning future 1sts and prospects for. A core of Embiid/Beal/Harris with Danny Green, Seth Curry is filthy and actually has a chance against the Nets imo   Raptors want to win now, they get an upgrade at SF and also assets that they can use or flip for another vet.   Wizards start their rebuild right by getting an incredibly talented young SF and the 4th overall pick in exchange for their all-star."
danny green the elite dancer
Danny Green was Bron's number one dance partner for this
"By not trading Kuzma and KCP and ideally leaving them as they fit well as role players.  Our issue this past season, well one of them, was the fact we traded Green and let Dwight go even though they complimented the team well. Danny was inconsistent from three, but he was still at least a solid threat."
"Iirc i believe kcp and danny green were starting last year. Lebron played point on offense, but those 2 defended guards on defense."
Yeah I'm gonna be glad to see the guy gone. He was an all NBA player replacing Danny Green and led us to 1 win more win and then two straight lottery years for the first time in our history. Literally the worst 3 year stretch in spurs history.
"He's still a very solid coach, but as a manager (Pop is President of Basketball Operations for the Spurs) he has been bad for quite a few years now. The Danny Green trade (where we disastrously traded away Danny Green and an expiring and got DeMar DeRozan on a poison 3 year contract in return) marked his decline.  Pop was not willing to have any sort of rebuild on the Spurs and was hell bent on win-now moves, but more accurately ""win some"" moves. DD + Lamarcus was guaranteed to generate *some* wins, but to never be even close to contending. It was effectively a medium ceiling - medium floor situation were we we won't suck but can never do great. All because he couldn't stand to have even one losing season.  This ""never have a sucky team"" mindset has been leading his thought process ever since. I get it, since he's close to retirement and only cares about the short term, but you need long term thinking on top. It's harsh."
Slovenian Danny Green
don't bring danny green into this
"I mean on a team composed of Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Javale, Carushow, KCP, Danny Green, JR Smith, Jared Dudley, Markief Morris, Kuzma, it was always going to be a fight for third"
More recently     * Danny Green 36.7% vs 40.1% career
and Danny Green thought it was wrong that we booed them off the court...
Danny Green in a sign and trade?
"A little bit. The guy had 3 or 4 hall of famers on his roster each pretty much every year he won the title. TD won Mvps under him, and Kawhi and TP both had near MVP level years during his tenure in San Antonio. He is no doubt one of the best  2 or 3 coaches ever, but I do think a lot of people overestimate his impact on winning.   Coaching is still important in the NBA, but for the most part, the team with the best roster wins, and he had a winning hand multiple times. If you look at their roster in the 2013-2015 range, it's absolutely ridiculous. They had 4 HOFers in TD, Parker, Manu, and Kawhi with prime Danny Green, Patty Mills, and Diaw to boot; any respectable coach could win with that roster.   Replace him with an average coach, and I still think TD wins multiple titles, but their success probably wouldn't have been as consistent without him."
"&gt; Making Simmons your number two means that your number one is being doubled/tripled on defense.   this is incorrect. it depends on the rest of your team, if you have enough shooters to space the floor the opponent can't reliably double or triple the best players. part of why the sixers struggled is because Danny green went out and they didn't play enough shooters to space the floor  &gt; Second yes any 4th pick is going to come with weaknesses but their weaknesses are much easier to work around then not wanting to shoot the ball.  this is also incorrect. many number 4 picks also can't shoot the ball, have low basketball IQ, can't play defense, are injury prone or a myriad of other issues. Simmons can't shoot but he can do everything else at a high level  &gt; Finally, how are you saying that too much blame is being put on Simmons when it's clearly his weaknesses that led to the losses  you're looking at the series from a really limited perspective. Once it became clear the hawks were exploiting Simmons the responsibility is then on Doc to change his gameplan to put his player in a position to succeed. he could've run more plays with Simmons off ball so he could create off a lead pass, could've given Simmons more run without embiid as a small ball 5 or really a number of things. instead doc did as doc does and just stuck to the plan while telling his players to play better. it is no coincidence that doc has blown a 3-1 lead in the last 4 decades. he doesn't make good adjustments.  you don't look at players just based on their most recent performance when you have a whole body of work as data. ironically you're taking a 4th pick with 0 playoff experience or even NBA experience while dismissing all of Ben's NBA experience and saying his most recent playoff performance is indicative of who he is and always will be as a player.   anyway I can't reply anymore, only time will tell"
facts. danny green is danny green lol. and no one gives too hot shites about darius garland right now except for cavs fans and super bball nerds like me who think cavs should go all in on garland and get a decent haul for sexton
fr... DG is Danny Green and even Darius Garland nowadays
"This feels like the type of package Presti would be in on. He loves getting distressed assets that are still fondly looked upon, and flipping them later - Rubio, George Hill, Danny Green, et al.   I wonder what kind of value LAL is looking for out of those two... OKC probably doesn't really have what they are looking for but I imagine they are at least engaging."
Lakers are desperate for playmaking and ball handling. Dennis is certainly more important than Danny Green. Other than LeBron the Lakers have absolutely zero shot creation. If Danny Green dribbles the ball he should be fined 5k.
"Remember when people got pissed that Dennis schroder got traded for danny green and a late first? Yeah, i remember"
"Just like there was no way the best package for dennis schroder was bricklayer danny green and a late first, am i right?"
"It’s not really a coincidence I think it’s bc Bron in LA and at the end with Cleveland was always maximizing flexibility, so no one they brought in was on long term deals. No one was comfortable.   Jae crowder, clarkson, Danny green, Schroeder to an extent. Plus the added pressure of fans, knowing they’re gonna blame you for missing shots. There’s this perception that bron gets everyone wide open looks and you’d be an invalid if you miss them."
"&gt;Pop is laid back  LMAO bro this is Coach Pop we're talking about. The guy who famously told Danny Green to, and I quote, ""Shut the fuck up"" during a game. Pop is about as laid back as Harden is humble.  The real problem is that everyone is expecting the USA to just curb stomp the competition like the dream team did in 92 but forget that the best players in the world aren't all necessarily American anymore. The MVP and the Finals MVP are not American. There's so much talent imported now that the rest of the world is on pretty much even footing with team USA. The byproduct of making the NBA an international fixture is that you're seeing the culmination of their efforts to get other countries kids into basketball starting roughly 20ish years ago. Those kids are all really fucking good now. Also, we didn't exactly send our best to the Olympics as many top NBA stars sat out this Olympics for various reasons."
"&gt;Schroder decreased his three point percentage.  Nope, he’s a career 34% shooter. He had one outlier season in OKC.  &gt;Danny Green decreased his three point percentage  In the regular season, but not in the playoffs.   &gt;Reggie Bullock decreased his three point percentage  This is because he was taking more threes and had a bigger role.  And KCP is shooting better than ever from 3"
Danny Green shot over 45% from deep one season before joining LA and one season after leaving
Schroder decreased his three point percentage.  Wes decreased his three point percentage   Danny Green decreased his three point percentage   Reggie Bullock decreased his three point percentage
"There are no examples lol, I’m not sure what they mean. KCP just had his career-best season from 3, LeBron is shooting a respectable 36%, and Schroder has always been a below average shooter (barring one outlier season).   And guys like Danny Green and Wes Matthews have always been streaky inconsistent shooters, it’s not a Lakers-specific thing."
"Man, remember when people were praising Shroeder for being seen as an upgrade over Danny Green after he also shit the bed in the playoffs?"
"we're obviously a fortunate franchise there's a real trend of shooters from other teams coming to the lakers and forgetting how to shoot lol  wes matthews just had by far his worst shooting season of his career with us. 33.5% 3pt%, was never below 36%   dennis shot 38.5% from 3 last season with OKC on high volume. dropped to 33.5% with us this season  danny green was a 45.5% 3pt shooter for the raptors in 2019. 36.7% for the lakers in 2020. goes to the sixers and goes up to 40.5%. lol."
"It's honestly not clear what Kawhi would've done if he stayed healthy, nor is it a meaningful discussion considering Kawhi's issues stem from a genetic, degenerative disease.  He also had more than one reason to want out, particularly the recent roster moves that narrowed his championship window, as well as needing to prove he was healthy enough to warrant a supermax extension.  He also just had a kid and possibly felt a desire to raise her where he considers home.  Considering he told Danny Green he was staying with the Spurs two weeks before demanding a trade, it's likely he was on-the-fence for months.  The Spurs would've still been great with Kawhi, but he would've had to have done the heavy lifting on a bum knee, so it's hard to imagine it being a better situation than either Toronto or Los Angeles have been.  Kawhi wanted a situation where he could sit a quarter of a season and still have a high seed, and that's precisely what he found when he left.  Reading any reporting on the subject reveals that Kawhi never really *loved* playing in San Antonio and, while he had (and still has) a good relationship with Pop, he had notable disagreements with his approach to coaching and practice.  He wasn't a boy scout like Duncan."
"It’s the little extra   Idk if he is what they need.  Pj Tucker, Danny Green, brook Lopez, Roco … low usage role players who can shoot 3s and just defend.      You don’t need KD, Dame, Booker, Levine, Tatum..plus originally Beal.      You need 3 of them so that roles can be sorted out."
"Deandre Hunter has better statistics in literally almost every metric that doesn't involve games played. Higher PER, better ORTG and DRTG proportional to team.  Danny Green has a higher percentage from 3, which he should, seeing as Hunter creates substantially more of his own looks than Green does catching and shooting."
Danny Green was fantastic for us this year you don't know what you're talking about
"Danny green has been ass the past two years, idk if you’ve noticed. Stop acting like he’s still in his prime."
There is not a single team in the nba that would take danny green over deandre hunter
"Pop is officially senile  He obviously has no clue how to construct a roster that will excel at offense  The 15 all stars formula is a recipe for disaster because there is NO ALPHA  The only way 15 all stars works if its the 15 best players \[dream teams\] and they overwhelm you with talent but this current assortment is as shitty as possible.  Where are the Mikal Bridges, Duncan Robinson, Danny Green, Covington????  Where are the Rim Protector? The Stretch 5??? The post up scorer  WHERE ARE THESE ROLE PLAYERS  The current team is soooo Ass they would have been better off sending the Sacramento Kings entire team. At least they would have had some camaraderie"
Danny green is a really good role player to have on your team. But Hunter is the hawks’ second best player.
&gt;DeAndre Hunter is more valuable to the Hawks than Danny Green to the Sixers  I disagree
DeAndre Hunter is more valuable to the Hawks than Danny Green to the Sixers. We have no defensive presence and lose our 2nd/3rd best independent shot creator without him.
"Pretty sad that you have to scroll down this far to find the first reasonable take.   Schroder got really unlucky that both AD and LBJ got injured, otherwise the Lakers probably beat the Suns/Nuggets and are clear favorites against the Bucks in the finals.   Schroder clearly isn't good enough to be the second best player on a contender, especially when that team has huge spacing issues and a hobbling LeBron as first option.   Is Schroder a perfect fit for LBJ and AD? No, far from it, but he clearly was their best option during the last offseason and the Lakers would've had a pretty good shot at winning another chip this year with LeBron and AD healthy. Is what Schroder has to offer worth 25Mil per year in a vacuum? No, but considering the Laker's cap situation, he would've gotten paid if they won another chip.   Besides, if the Lakers still had Danny Green instead of Schroder this year, they probably woud've missed the playoffs altogether. Schroder hustled and carried the team hard during that stretch when both AD and LeBron were out."
"In the regular season he made that. Also he gets a lot of money for a long time.  &gt; Dude had Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake, and some others, he doesn't need to be relied on to shoot  The playoffs would suggest he would have to. As taking away Simmons has been a easy winning strategy for 4 years now."
"Yeah Danny Green plays solid Defence. I know his 3pt shooting was very lackluster during the Lakers championship run last season, but I feel like his perimeter defending could've definitely helped"
Danny Green was barely a trade asset at his current valuation.  Lakers were just lucky OKC was having a fire sale.
"You see I think that if Lakers were healthy Danny green is the better piece. Knows his role and will do I’ll shoot threes play D. Schroder was thrown into a big role but couldn’t fulfill his mission, I don’t thin Danny green would’ve been able to lead a team, I think he would’ve done worse in Schroeder’s situation but if the teams health give me Danny green"
"Danny Green was trash, glad he left"
"1.	Kawhi 2.	Pascal 3.	KLow 4.	Danny Green 5.	Serge/Fred based on matchup 6.	Marc Gasol 7.	Norman Powell 8.	Rest of bench  OG would’ve had great rotational minutes in there too, crazy that we were quietly one of the deepest teams in NBA history"
"Danny Green definitely wouldn't have made a huge difference in the playoffs, and Schröder did enough to get us there in the first place.  Is Schröder worth $100m, or even $84m? Fuck no.   Was trading Danny Green for him worthwhile? I personally think so."
"Danny Green had a rough season but he was great for you guys in the playoffs on defense, and teams respected his 3 point shot even if he didn't hit a ton."
Can you imagine trading Danny Green for this man... Big regret
"Hate what shit? I’m talking about the trade being fine, not defending Schroeder. Danny green would be worst, you’ve seen it last season"
"Danny Green + a first round pick for Schroder was such a fucking disaster. That said, I'm impressed with the Lakers willingness to cut their losses and not dig themselves into an even deeper hole.   -  ^(*nervously praying they don't trade for Westbrook*)"
"On the other hand if there’s a godfather offer (like 2, multiple future first including their own, Tate, etc.) out there for 1 that they don’t take and Cade ends up a bust/isn’t even an all star while jalen green or Mobley become amazing, then weaver gets shit on and put on a short leash.   Or if he does do it and it ends up like that, then he gets super big praise and a long leash like someone like Danny ainge had for a long time."
"&gt; some dirty work  Mikal Bridges, Danny Green, PJ Tucker and Robert Covington entered the chatroom"
"Hard agree. I wasn't happy initially about the doc hiring but thought he had a good regular season.  But God doc didn't make any adjustments in the playoffs. Just chilled and let curry get switched onto iso scorers the whole time, kept trying to have tobias iso John Collins when tobias mostly thrives against mismatches, sticking ben in the dunkers spot even though his best quarter of the playoffs was when he was featured as a post playmaker, Danny green on Trae in g1, bad rotations with too many ben-tisse minutes, I could keep this list going.    People meme him but ty lue is a significantly better playoff coach. Not sure I see us getting anywhere with doc unless morey can give us an absolutely stacked roster"
"&gt;  I don’t know how much it impacted them  I don't doubt it impacted them  But their road record dropped more than their home record compared to the last couple seasons.  Not having a 'real' home court surely hurt and cost the team games... but its hard to argue its the driving difference if even road games were seeing equal or greater change.  The Raps lost Kwahi and Danny Green, then both their Cs in Ibaka and Gasol in 2 years... that's going to make any team, and especially their defense, fundamentally weaker."
"If that trade actually went through, your team would be reduced to only Embiid, Harris, Lillard, Curry, and Danny Green (assuming you re-sign him for market value) + about 10 league minimum players who are most likely not NBA caliber.   You would be in the tax for this year and next until 2023-2024 which is when Embiid expires, at which point you'd have to go deeper into the tax to re-sign Embiid and Curry. At that point, even if you let go of Harris the following year, you would still probably be in the tax or very close to it since Embiid will be getting a supermax and Curry is gonna fetch 20m.   Overall, I think that starting 5 would probably be one of the best in the league but I doubt you could make a playoff run without at least 1-2 being out with injury from the 82 game season, and once they get replaced with a G leaguer you stop being amazing."
Lonzo in the halfcourt is closer to Danny Green than he is CP3
Funny enough my moms a teacher on Long Island and taught Danny Green and Bria Hartley(she went to UConn and made the WNBA) .  I went to the Danny Green camp and she was there playing one on ones w campers I was 17 she was 20 and she legit CLAPPED me. There’s definitely levels to this shit
"we got danny green somehow too lmao  I mean he was mostly ass in the playoffs, but he arguably had  his best regular season with us. In the playoffs he was still a great defender and had some good games."
But Bradley Beal is no Danny Green
KCP is a pretty good two way SG. He's worth his contract and look at what Philly traded Danny Green for. Kuz could be a hit or miss but his contract is small enough to not take a big hit.
"I hear you, I hear you. The LAKERS are not 3 point shooters. But imagine lebron with klay.  He’s had a great shooter with him on every chip hasn’t he?  Ray Allen  Kyrie (Mish mash of ad/kcp/ what Danny green was supposed to be about)  Correct me if I’m wrong I’m actually not an expect"
"Who cares if he can't shoot? There's plenty of other people on other teams that can shoot. Dude had an all-star season averaging 14/7/7/1.6/.6 and got the all defensive first team. It's ridiculous that people act like he's trash because he doesn't shoot. Dude had Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake, and some others, he doesn't need to be relied on to shoot"
I feel like the best deal the Sixers could get would be Lowry and role player sign and trade with a salary dump. Or maybe 6ers want two big contributors and will trade Simmons and Danny Green
Evil Danny Green.
"Portis, Middleton, Connaughton, Portis, Lopez, Vanvleet, Lowry, Kawhi, Gasol, Danny Green, KCP, Morris, Rondo in the playoffs were all good 3 pt shooters"
"Lakers were garbage in the regular season but that bubble magic had them all shooting lights out except Danny Green, who everyone still respects. Rondo, kuzma, Morris shot +40% from 3 KCP wasn't far below either iirc. Add in AD becoming prime dirk for a month and they had more than they needed."
Run it back is the best option but if they making a move it should be adding one more danny green/wes matthews back or something but tbh I wouldn't want them bc that would remove donte and connaughton mins so I would rather get a pg that's not a liability on defence a la bryn forbes and can also shoot
"We also had Rondo shooting above 40% for like the entire WC playoffs (low volume but still making them), Markieff shooting above 40% for a while, KCP being at least 38%+ (might’ve also been above 40%) and then Bron and AD shooting around or above 38%+ as well for most of the playoffs. Danny Green was our worst 3 point shooter for most of the playoffs."
"I mean it's Daryl Morey, there's only a few guys that argument works for and he's definitely one of them. Came in last offseason and got us off Al Horford's contract for Danny Green and flipped Josh Richardson for Seth Curry. There's not many others I'd want to be our GM"
I miss Danny Green
Like what other shooters lol the wings are Seth Curry and Danny Green and Tobi is a great shooter as well   The only space killer on the floor is Ben
Do you not remember what Trae did to danny green game 1?
Agreed. Then I'd say probably embiid for Shoto? Although Danny green would be ideal since he's icy hot lol
"Danny Green, Dwight and Rondo werent gonna be able to get u thru a season. They knew AD and Bron would need rest. They wanted minute eaters to get them to postseason"
"yea no, the 'laker' fans who insult kuzma are just r/nba nephews who like to karma whore. Any real laker fan would talk to you about kuzmas drastic increase on defense and him being part of the reason we were able to maintain the number 1 defense after losing dwight and javale mcgee and danny green."
"Thybulle isn’t a starter lmao, and if he was that means CJ or Seth wouldn’t be a starter making the trade pointless. And no, actually I don’t think Thybulle can step up in place for CJ defensively. I don’t mean to sound abrasive when I say this but when the Sixers lost to the Hawks it was because we always had 1 less defender than they had scorers. Huerter torched Seth, even if we had our best defensive team (minus Danny Green) there was always one open guy. Embiid’s job is to anchor the paint. Simmons and Thybulle (who again, only plays 20 mins) cannot both guard 2 people."
"Really? Going to be pretty honest, after his rookie season I thought he'd turn out to be quite good. Not as good as he is now, but like a prime Danny Green level of player. I just felt like he had a lot of tools."
"The Blazers problem is not offense it is defense.   They are the worst defensive team I have ever seen.   This is a coaching and personnel issue.   Hopefully Billups who came from Piston D 2004 title can see this aspect.   Go sign FA Nerlens Noel and trade CJ for a perimeter defenders.   They need to do something EXTREME.   CJ to the 76ers for Thybulle and Danny Green.   Sounds crazy? Nope. They need the defense that badly.   Dame, Green, Powell, Roco, Noel, Thybulle \[6th man\]   Now THAT is a defensive minded team with some shooters too."
But Danny Green does not shoot at his career average in the playoffs
I'll take him over Danny Green...
"Nah. I'm even more sick of people making excuses for us losing in the first round because of injuries. CP3 missed 1 game and left another. Exactly the same with AD. The series was completely even. We lost fair and square plainly because in game 6 LeBron quit on the team.  We should've and were perfectly capable of beating the Suns without Anthony Davis.  In the past two years, the Lakers, just by having LeBron, have not lost a *single* game because of a talent disparity. Every game the Lakers lost from the Anthony Davis era and onward has been because of effort. Hell we willed ourselves to victory multiple times while LeBron was hurt this season.   Also I know it's not your comment but how the hell did we ""blow up"" our team? Dwight, Rondo, and JaVale were the only guys we lost that played any meaningful minutes. Danny Green counts too I guess but he was easily replaceable. The only other guy I can think of, Avery Bradley, didn't even come to the bubble. The core of the team-- Bron, AD, KCP, Morris, Kuz, Caruso, THT, were all still there."
"Timmy was putting up his season averages in the finals (and he's always done very well maintaining his numbers in the playoffs).  Meanwhile Bosh was blocked a tony parker stepback and blocked a danny green 3 in game 6 , and pressured manu ginobli into throwing it straight to lebron at the end of game 7.   He wasn't a great rim protector and could give up points to bulky 7 footers, which is why he was never in contention for DPOTY, but he was a solid good defender because of his mobility and ability to make his rotations."
Lmao I had no idea that he bit Danny Green. Hilarious.
Danny Green made a point not to let Gasol talk on stage because he was absolutely plastered. Lol.
"Danny green, Tristan, Joe Harris, Jae Crowder as well. Cavs in 4"
"My point is regardless of what did happen, that Nets team STILL should have won and its BS that people think the Bucks got it easy.  That team still won the 2 seed in the east.  They still had Blake Griffin, they still had the #1 3 point shooter in the NBA.  They still had DAnny Green, who shot 7/8 in a game 5 win from 3.  People act like the Bucks beat a team compromised of KD and 6 make a wish Kids.  Injuries suck, the Bucks just won a title starting a shooting guard who literally CAN'T shoot or score in PJ Tucker because our starting shooting guard was lost early in the 2nd game of the playoffs for the season."
One Danny Green and Avery Bradley please
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that’s not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
"you won the title with:  * Kentavius Caldwell-Pope  * Good Rajon Rondo  * Danny Green  * Kyle Kuzma  * Alex Caruso  Instead of those guys, you now have a 33-year-old point guard who relies on his athleticism and can't shoot, defend, or play off ball."
It's been quiet on Danny Green
He’s actually gonna become Danny green. His shot is turning around. Defense is elite
Danny green and rondo next?
Bruhhhh i thought u meant danny green JUST signed with the lakers again dammnit
Danny Green
"Danny Green and Caruso are great shouts, though I think the Sixers will pay more keep Green. I personally think Valentine is worse than Oladipo."
Danny green
danny green all alone
"I kinda wanna see if one of the good PGs gets stuck with no teams having money anymore and having to settle for our MLE for a year or something. If we sign someone before the market craters, I'd like someone like Denzel Valentine or Danny Green personally. Or putting pressure on the Lakers with Caruso."
Avery and Danny green inbound
"If we're patient enough, the market is going to dry out pretty quick here and we might be able to get a starting caliber player on the cheap. If we're not patient, I've been hoping for someone like Denzel Valentine personally; I think he'd be really good in Bud's system. Maybe Danny Green or something? Not sure. I'd imagine it'll be a point or wing. Would be really nice to have a good backup ball-handler but unless guys like Schroder have their market totally tank, the pickings for point guards are really slim."
And Danny Green
Danny Green Gonna end up being our MLE. And I won't be mad about it
That’s enough for Danny Green
Yeah he's a starting quality 2-guard  The ballpark of what you pay for that is 15. Danny Green. Hardaway Jr just got 18 for four years. It's a pretty fair deal.
Losing Danny Green and Korkmaz would fuck the sixers spacing  (which was already worse than people realize)
If they lose a combo of Danny Green + Dwight + Korkmaz   oof
Sixers have a few assets they could let go of danny green would be making 15m this year. Not resigning him would give them nearly enough. I just see Powell as a good fit the guy gets buckets.
sad but theoretically we have isaiah joe who should be able to step into furkan's role with limited drop off. furkan can't hit a shot on the road it's kind of insane.  if danny green walks i'll start to get a bit more concerned.
"Honestly better than the year beforehand. We won a chip, but the LBJ-less offense was still chickens w/ their heads cut off. No way would the 2020 team have survived the injuries the 2021 team sustained the LBJ &amp; AD. Didnt work in the playoffs due to continued injuries to those stars, but I dont blame Trez Schroder, et al for the playoff loss, ridiculous to think Rondo, Danny Green &amp; Dwight were beating those Suns in their place."
Lakers: get rid of Danny Green  Also Lakers: just kidding we want you back
"If he leaves for nothing it would be a major failure. Pretty much gave up Schroder, Danny Green, KCP, Kuzma, Montrezz, and 2 first round picks for Westbrook"
"Lakers need him for defense more than anything. The Lakers defense has been their identity the past couple years. But now they've lost/could lose: KCP, Kuzma, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Schroder, Wes Matthews, and Caruso. Vogel is a good defensive coach, but at some point you need the personnel too. The only plus defenders we have under contract right now are Lebron and AD"
"I don't fully disagree, but it's worth pointing out that it's not just about the actual number of 3s you make, but about the spacing shooters provide. The issue compounds, because by not having shooting threats, it also limits your bigger players by not letting them have the space to operate. That was probably the biggest value Danny Green provided for the Lakers last year, even if his shot wasn't falling, teams would often still have to respect it"
danny green would hands down win. Just randomly finds himself on championship contenders all the time. and has won multiple times. while having an important role but not too important
Danny Green is becoming a journeyman for contenders
"Lowry would be nice but he’s a short term fix.  If you are going short term trying to swing Dragic so,show doesn’t hurt.  Derozan is superfluous with Luka.  Luka has the ball in his hands a majority of the time he’s on the court anyway so an off ball shooter and secondary playmaker is more useful anyway.  Honestly Dragic or Reggie Jackson fulfills a similar purpose.  They do need another wing though. Danny Green can’t dribble but he shoots and defends."
"Next years Heat Roster will include:  Lowry, DeRozan, Danny Green, Nic Batum, Rudy Gay, Harrison Barnes, and Kelly Oubre."
Because players like Danny green aren’t interested in going there lol.
Danny “how many more (missed 3s)” Green
Yeah he is not Danny Green at all. You can trust him to take the last 3.
"If you watched how we won the 2020 championship and how we were playing when AD &amp; LBJ were both healthy then you’ll know we do not rely on our 3pt shooting. We win with defense which the casual fan do not understand because casuals think it’s all about 3pt &gt; 2pt.  With that being said statistically our 3pt shooting was probably better this year then it was when we won during the regular season if you take away Dudley, D12 &amp; Javale’s out of the equation. Why take them because D12 &amp; Javale won’t be shooting 3s during real minutes &amp; Dudley barely got any real minutes. Kuz, Caruso, LBJ, shot better this year than last. Gasol &amp; Schroder were upgrades. The only player we missed was Danny Green &amp; Avery Bradly but their 3pt shot were non-existent during the bubble for different reasons.  So why would you say our 3pt shooting is lacking during the playoffs? It’s simple, we didn’t have any playmakers and once AD went down we were down to just LBJ. That’s why Westbrook will help even though he can’t shoot 3s. These spot up 3pt shooters aren’t going to get open on their own."
"I don't think it is though. He shot 46% from 2P% this year, Covington for example shot 45.1.%. Danny Green shot 43.8%.  KCP also shot 46%.   The main reaosn his FG% is so low is because his 3PT shot is in the low 30's wheras the other guys are in the 40% range, and also, he's taking 5 2PA's a game while the other guys are taking 2.   His archtype is a very switchable 6'8 wing. He just needs to shoot 3s and defend. As long as he ups his 3P% while also cutting out some of those non-3's he'll be fine. I would 100% take him on my team no questions asked."
"It's gotta be an under the radar player who's found themselves on a few different great teams - someone line Crowder, PJ Tucker, Danny Green, maybe even Rondo"
"This is all in all a ridiculous ill researched article. I am a casual fan and i know that lakers can't take Danny green or Dwight via sign and trade Schroeder. The former are free agents. Lakers would hardcap themselves adn with Russ now, its impossible. Why wouldn't a professional looking writer or blogger know this?  And the blogger also suggests that DG will ask something around $15mill! I love DG but he is in no way worth this. At most TPMLE."
"For sending Danny green to us, they will have to sign him.. and then trade him to us. That's sign and trade. DG is a free agent. Accepting him does hardcap lakers.   Lakers don't get hardcapped if they just Sign and Trade a player away and receive players who are already under contract. That's what Lowe said."
"Additionally, idk if LAL offer him the mini-MLE when they desperately need shooting on the team. I’d much rather pay Reggie Bullock or Danny Green with that money if I was them."
"I do understand the hard cap.  You are hard capped as a team if you operate as a team who is operating below the luxury tax.  The two transactions that hard cap you?  Signing a player for the full MLE or receiving a player in a sign and trade.  In this scenario, the Lakers would be receiving Danny Green (via sign and trade) and that would hard cap them, which is also called the apron which is approximately 6m above the luxury tax line, which the Lakers are only 14m from currently with only 4 guaranteed roster spots for them (12m if they guarantee Alfonzo McKinnie) and would still have to fill an additional 5 roster spots AT LEAST, so it's not a realistic option."
"I know you are kidding but deadass this is THE best landing spot for KUZ CONTROL  And the Wolves can actually make some noise if they can also add a perimeter defender like Danny Green.  D-Lo, Green, ANT, Kuzma, KAT \[starters\]  Rubio, Okogie, Beasley, Naz \[bench\]  this is honestly not terrible at all. Good offense and improving the defense with Green/Kuz who also bring title winning experience."
"I’ll make one observation. In our championship pre season every ringer hot take artist and espn/athletic media member were clowning the lakers off-season. The narrative was we couldn’t play defense and couldn’t shoot, funny enough, with only Danny Green being a solid signing but even then an overpay. We won the championship and the narrative was oh of course Lebron and AD win a championship what a surprise.  Last year every single media member outside of maybe hollinger loved our preseason and our roster because it consisted of guys they all hyped up the previous year. It didn’t go so well.  All that to say when it comes to the Lakers, it all starts and stops with Lebron and AD. If they are healthy they are dangerous. If Westbrook can help set up AD and Lebron and maximize their outputs and scoring then it’s a good fit. If he doesn’t it’s going to end poorly.  That being said, when Lebron AD and Westbrook had dinner I’m sure the conversation wasn’t oh let’s do what we normally do but on the same team. It was about whose going to make which concessions and adjustments and where."
"Right, in this scenario the 76ers would be also be sign and trading Danny Green back to the Lakers, so it wouldn't work."
"Right, in this scenario the 76ers would be also be sign and trading Danny Green back to the Lakers, so it wouldn't work."
"Right, in this scenario the 76ers would be also be sign and trading Danny Green back to the Lakers, so it wouldn't work."
The dude has never played in the playoffs ever before and is not a star just a good shooter. He could be potentially Danny green again. I’m glad we got Russ
Isn't he basically Danny Green without a wacky handle?
"That's fair. I personally don't think Chris Paul or Jrue Holiday raise the ceiling for the Clippers as much as Paul George does (we saw the carry job he did against the Jazz and Suns after Leonard went down). Not only did Jrue get a huge extension and Chris Paul is in line for one as well but, SGA is extension eligible this summer so he's gonna start making even more money than George now.   Also it's not as simple as you're putting it. Teams with high level assets get those leveraged in most trades they try to discuss. It's why in Lowry deals you saw Masai (rumored) asking for Simmons and Maxey and/or Thybulle from the 76ers, Herro and Precious from Miami, but only THT and Danny Green from the Lakers.   Im sure the Nuggets have been going through something similar with Michael Porter Jr.. Opposing teams know what assets you have and they're not going to let you be stingy lol"
None of Danny Green or Tony Snell move defenses around like Duncan Robinson does just running around screens. Terrible examples.
"That’s fair. Could also get other vets for cheaper,Danny Green, Snell, etc. over paying for 3 pt specialist is tough when they are already going to be maxed."
Shocked Danny Green isn't rumoured to be going to the Lakers considering everyone seems to be going that way.
"It's certainly true he wasn't as effective, but he was having to guard Booker or CP3 in the Suns series, so he was constantly defending out of position.  he had to due to our injury situation, but it'd be similar to arguing ""Why didn't Danny Green have good opposing FG% when his primary defensive assignment was Durant?""  If you had a choice, you'd never pick those assignments.  PJ was vital simply because he could at least attempt to guard those guys."
This is some troll shit. We had to overpay Danny Green and get random guys as filler cause we waited for kawhi. You literally don't know who the lakers could have gotten cause we didn't pursue anyone... If we didn't pursue people obviously they'd sign elsewhere
"When (Danny) Green turned it over with 11 seconds left in that game, Oracle was absolutely electric. God I miss crowds like that, nice to see things start to get back to normal… fingers crossed."
I was hoping to get Seth Curry but we ended up with Danny Green
"Miami's got their BAE and their non tax MLE. I'd assume they'll be looking at Danny Green, Malik Monk, Nic Batum, Oladipo, etc."
Danny green
"I don't know. I disagree. We didn't *need to trade him*.  Lowry was always going to be worth more to us in our system.  I'm not gonna look back and wonder ""what if we had traded him for Danny Green and filler?""  Can't say the same for the teams that didn't make it to the finals though."
"https://theathletic.com/2478518/2021/03/26/why-no-kyle-lowry-trade-got-done-and-a-closer-look-at-the-ones-that-did-amicks-nba-trade-deadline-reflections/  doesnt directly say that but it does say it was over draft compensation  &gt; As for Philadelphia, which was reportedly close to a Lowry deal but wound up opting for Oklahoma City’s George Hill instead, a source with knowledge of the talks said the Raptors indeed believed they were very close on that front late in the process and that the draft compensation was the final unresolved hurdle. The plan, the source said, was for Toronto to re-route Sixers guard Danny Green to a third team."
"Danny Green, Mike Scott, Maxey.  The deal fell through over Philly wanting to keep their 1st rounder (28th overall)"
"You literally cherry pick Lonzo's defense BPM...Man...what is your plan if you're GM dude? Like sign someone like Danny Green, use him for that one or two year of eight seed playoff and then rebuild? You're missing the point of why they are signing Lonzo...it is not just defense btw...actually nvm, forgot this is the internet lol."
Kawhi and Danny Green for Derozon. Who says no?
"I honestly think we've earned a solid player development rep. If I were a prospect or someone on the precipice of being out of the NBA, I'd definitely see if the Spurs were interested in signing me for cheap just to develop and try to carve out a role.  Think of all the dudes who got great second contracts after playing for SA.  Beno Udrih - drafted 28th overall, played decent minutes as a rookie as the backup PG for a title winning team in 05. We trade him to Minne in his final year of his rookie deal to cut costs, he ends up as a FA and signs with SAC, who then extend him on a 5 year 32mil deal.  Ian Mahinmi - he barely plays with us, but we keep him on the roster for 3 years. He signs a minimum deal with DAL, then winds up being part of a S&amp;T to Indiana on a 4/16mil deal. Eventually makes bank with a 4/64mil deal with the Wizards in the dreaded 2016 off-season.  George Hill - we took a chance on him when other teams were scared off due to IUPUI being deemed too small of a school. He develops, we trade him again in the final year of his deal and signs multiple high $ contracts over a very long career.  Gary Neal - a guy we brought in from overseas, who I think was 26 at the time, signed a 3 year contract for relative peanuts with team outs after the first season. His total earnings from SA were only ~2mil over 3 seasons, but then he signed a 2 year 6.5mil deal with MIL, then another 1 year deal for the vet min with the Wizards, which because he had been an NBA vet for 5 years at that point was a little over 2mil  DeJuan Blair - made 4mil on his rookie deal over 4 years with SA, then made another 4.5mil while bouncing around the league another 3 years.  Kyle Anderson - develop him into a great roleplayer, he signs a solid deal with Memphis that he's actually out-performed and is in line for a bigger pay day on his next deal.  Johnathon Simmons - probably the best example of this trend. He literally walked-on to try out for the (at the time) Austin Toros. The FO sees something in him and signs him to a 2 year deal with most of the money unguaranteed. He makes the most of his opportunities in 16 and 17, playing great defense on Harden in the playoffs and doing enough on offense to take advantage of Harden's defense. Signs a 3/24 with Orlando.  This isn't even counting guys like Danny Green and Patty Mills, who were claimed off the waiver wire and have ended up earning a ton while becoming fantastic players."
"Those were just examples. Not the best case scenario. And why wouldn't lebron try? he was on his path to first team defense when he got injured. And i believe in Vogel, that it would be atleast a top 10 defense.   May be we can get patty mills. or Danny green back. DG just shot 40% in philly and lebron and russ would give him more open looks. so does patty. For the second unit, we have caruso to defend and shoot 3. Carmelo, if we get him, is a 40 percent shooter last seson. Kief is a good defender and can play 4 or 5 and can also shoot threes.   And maybe we can get a couple of $10 mill each 3 and D players outof SNT Schroeder. They can be our starters with AD on 5.   My point was... we have 10 places to fill. Can't judge at team by 5 signed players. There are many options and possibilities. Talk bs after we have the whole team ready for the season."
"1. It hasn’t died completely yet. I admit it’s not probable but still definitely possible. Tomorrow when free agency opens, they are legally allowed to add Schroder to the deal, he signs and trades to Washington where they keep KCP and the pick, Kuzma and Harrell go along with the two second round picks from Washington to Sacramento, Lakers get Westbrook and Buddy. Kuzma and Harrell were already linked to Buddy, they get 2 second rounders in addition so it’s something they would want. Wizards have already admitted they are shopping those two and they want to keep KCP. They need a point guard as well after losing Westbrook. Everything actually does make sense, and there’s a lot of talk around the league about they’re already being a deal in place before the Westbrook trade was announced, but they need to make it look like there wasn’t, so what happened to the Bucks last year doesn’t happen to them. Definitely a conspiracy but it makes sense so once tomorrow passes we shall see, but like I said unlikely, but not dead like you said.  2. I doubt Batum stays, I’m honestly expecting him to go to the Warriors and not the Lakers but it’s still a possibility. But if he doesn’t come, maybe someone like Otto Porter Jr., Rudy Gay, Danny Green, someone like that would replace him at the 3&amp;D spot for the MMLE.  3. I can’t agree about Bradley, still think he is a great defender and can hit a shot, but if not him, maybe replace them with another three point shooter like Matthews.   So Westbrook | Matthews | Gay | LeBron | AD"
Ideally Luka-Danny Green(for the memes)-Kawhi-KD-AD
Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K
Danny green
"So if Danny Green or Jusuf Nurkić would play for Slovenia noone would have a problem? I doubt it very much. We've always had naturalized players, people just didn't care because they weren't very good."
"The complaint is NOT that Westbrook is some obvious negative.  It's that they gave up two of their 3 &amp; (almost) D wings  (Kuzma was 2nd on team in 3PA, KCP was 1st on team in 3P%) to get a secondary playmaker. If they can replace KCP+Kuzma, then getting Westbrook is likely a positive. But I don't think players like that are just waiting to sign vet minimums.   Westbrook won't have Beal or Bertans or KD to kick the ball out to in LA. The classic ""LeBron + 4 shooters"" lineup will likely never show up. I think Danny Green was the 3rd most important player in the Lakers title run, exactly for that 3&amp;D role (and stats back it up: Playoff On/Off leaders were AD +17, Danny Green +16, LeBron +15 and no one else close by).  Who played the playoff minutes during the title run? #1 AD, #2 LeBron, #3 KCP, #4 Danny Green, #5 Caruso, #6 Kuzma. AD+LeBron and 3&amp;D guys is a real death lineup. Trading away all those guys for another ball-dominant playmaker may make LeBron's regular season a little easier, but I don't see how it helps them beat any serious contender in the playoffs; LeBron being a little more well-rested doesn't seem like enough."
"You can't put Olimpija and Dinamo Bucarest in the same tier lmao. They produced so many NBA players in the past, its not even funny. Just current ex. Olimpija players in the NBA: Doncic, Samanic, Cancar, Bertans, Baynes, Danny Green"
&gt;I feel like JR would actually be a good pickup though? Fill the same role as Danny Green or DeRozan?   Which role is that lmao? Those are two very different players
"I feel like JR would actually be a good pickup though? Fill the same role as Danny Green or DeRozan?  I’m really surprised we haven’t even seen anything about him returning to the Lakers? I highly doubt he cares about just playing side chick to Lebron, but they have 2 rings and 3 or some finals appearances together?"
"RJ Barrett. Jaden McDaniels.   Anthony Edwards will be a legitimate all star and the Wolves will fight for a play-in where nobody wants to play them.   Also not star, but as a role player Aaron Nesmith is going to surprise a lot of people. Think Danny Green esque role player."
"The Raptors had multiple good 3 point shooters that year in Kawhi, Lowry, Gasol, Danny Green, Vanvleet and Siakam. Bucks had Middleton, Lopez, Portis, PJ Tucker but sure none of those two teams needed 3 point shooters."
in what world do you think jeff green is getting more shots by playing with the lakers? jeff green averaged 7.9FGA his season in cleveland and 7.8FGA this past season in brooklyn. this past season KCP averaged 7.6FGA and danny green in his season with the lakers averaged 7.0FGA. what makes you think jeff green will be getting more shots than what those guys got?
"No they really wouldn't  0.5% makes zero difference, especially if you're known as a shooter  Danny Green has gotten paid after building brick houses, if teams know you can shoot 0.5% makes zero difference"
"Yeah, it would've been Lowry + Siakam + one of Ibaka/Gasol + possibly FVV/OG if not both to even match salaries.   To be completely honest I think Masai would've done the deal IF Kawhi gave us the guarantee that he was going to stay if we pulled the trigger but he never did. I think Presti offered us the trade to use as leverage to get more out of PG which is pretty genius.   Like if we were able to field a team of Russ, Green, PG, Kawhi, Marc Gasol with FVV and Norm coming off the bench.... yeah sure we would've done it. I don't know whether or not we would even be able to afford Danny Green at that point tbh.   But no way were we going to risk being stuck with PG/Russ with zero draft capital for the next idk how many years."
LRMAM and iggy are both role players. Nobody really gives a fuck if they played or not in the grand scheme. It’s like danny green for Philly and donte for the bucks this year. Or Hunter for the hawks (who is way better then Iggy)  Chris Paul is an actual star. You were losing 3-2 with him on the floor. You won after he got hurt. Refs bailed you the fuck out and you won.
"Sixers get: CJ, 1st round pick (from raps) ZC, Yuta  Raps get: Simmons, Mike Scott, 2nd round pick (from Philly)  Blazers get: Siakam, Danny Green, 1st round pick (from Philly)"
"Danny Green at least attempts defense, he is a homeless mans Davis Bertans."
I remember the year before Gary neal and Danny Green went insane in game 5 I believe.
He’s a poor man’s Danny Green
"It's not nonsense! When Duncan played with Robinson, Leonard, and Bowen they were all better than Duncan on the defensive end. There's a reason Robinson and Leonard have DPOY awards and Timmy D doesn't. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard, Duncan's Spurs were unremarkable defensively -- even with Danny Green ( and Popovich ). Robinson was better without any of those players, or Popovich. Which is why Robinson won DPOY and Duncan never came particularly close. Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated Spurs defenses without Duncan. Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th in the league. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners(one being a two time winner), and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
I’m still waiting for Danny Green and Wayne Ellington UNC legends to get the respect they deserve.
Watch the Lakers get Melo/Gay/Dwight/Danny Green/Ellington for the vet min then get DeRozan for the mle.  They got a roster full of former superstars and allstars.😂🤣
"Danny Green had a terrible post-season from beyond the arc with LAL. He shot less than 34% on some pretty easy looks. By the end of the postseason he was so into his head he was even passing up open shots.  KCP was pretty reliable from three in that postseason run. He was practically the only shooting threat on that team though.  Gasol, LeBron, and Caruso are above average shooters. LeBron just had the best three point shooting season he’s ever had according to shot tracking metrics. Wes had a bad season from 3 but he’s usually an above average shooter, he should be a key re-signing.  Gay, OPJ, or Bjelica are predicted to go for around the mini MLE, which the Lakers will have.   LAL won’t get the best batch of shooters but as long as they’re willing to have AD/Gasol play almost the entirety of the minutes at the 5, I think the spacing should be more than fine."
Danny Green and KCP are pretty reliable
He was getting locked down by Danny green and shake Milton too
"The lakers in the past two years have never made a move that they couldn’t go back on if need be. They could trade Dennis( they almost did), they could trade Danny Green, they could trade Kuzma, they could cut Dwight, they could cut rondo etc. Whether this makes them a title favourite is highly debatable"
isn't this why danny green was also good for the lakers in 2020?  he shot terribly but the opponent wasn't leaving him unguarded so he was helping with spacing.
"I always like those role players who have multiple rings with teams. McGee, Danny Green, Steve Kerr."
"That’s the important part, similar to Danny Green when he was on the team he was streaky but teams couldn’t ignore him like they do other players. Spacing is determined by 3pt% yes, but also by how much teams respect your shooters"
"No, they really don't. People just assume that they do, if you actually watch games you see that people like Danny Green, Pat Connaughton, KCP, Jae Crowder, Joe Harris, etc. all get played off of if they aren't actively hitting their shots."
"Do people also understand that shooting percentages don't drive gravity?   If you have some guy out there that's not respected, even if he's statistically a great shooter, as soon as he misses a couple people are going to start playing off of him.   Like, AD standing at the 3 has more gravity than Joe Harris after a couple of misses. Same shit with Danny Green, KCP, etc."
His issues go far beyond his handle. His half court playmaking is nothing special at all he throws cool outlet passes in transition in half court he still has plenty of limitations that havent improved. He cant run a pick and roll at all which is a huge part of being able to set up playmaking opportunities in the half court. Cant finish at the rim and has absolutely zero floater game or in between game. No shot diversity or way to attack defenses. None of this stuff has improved at all it's just not who he is.   He's fundamentally a role player who does certain things well. Can be a play connector per se connecting a guy who slashes to the rim and kicks the ball out to him who he sets up for a corner 3. Can hit spot up jumpers. Can play good off ball defense. But the sooner people realize he's much closer to Danny Green who throws cool outlet passes than he is whatever definition of a point guard they had for him coming out the much better discourse will be about him.
"No, not really. He’s consistently awful in the playoffs where he chucks tons of inefficient shots, which is awful for offense. Also, we would have had Danny green on Trae young, which thanks to doc, we saw was a disaster in game 1. Russ certainly couldn’t guard him.   If Westbrook is so much better in the playoffs than Simmons, I’m curious how a embiidless sixers beat a Westbrook team that has Bradley Beal on it in the playoffs in game 5 (btw in that game Simmons led all players in plus/minus, I’m sure you can guess who had the lowest)."
That's Myles Turner and Danny Green.
So if AD shot is regular season rate of 50% instead of 57% you think teams are gonna leave him to guard Kuzma or Danny Green or KCP or Caruso??? Not sure who is actually being ignorant here acting like AD's one extra made shot is the difference between what won or lost them the title 😂😂😂
"people just look at the 4-0 and think the Spurs had no chance. the only game we truly got smoked was Game 2 because the entire team looked shook af without two of our leading starters. and even while missing players, Games 3 and 4 were still pretty competitive (contrary to what the final score might show you)  - we were missing our starting PG in Tony Parker, who was having a great playoffs until his injury, resulting us in having to start Patty Mills against Stephen Curry  - we would've won the first game 100% if Kawhi didn't get injured, giving the team huge momentum against a superteam  - Danny Green was playing without his WING STOP running mate, resulting in a massive hole in our defence  - Pau Gasol was running on fumes and getting run off the court because he was essentially our only big who was decent and gave a shit since...  - ...LaMarcus completely gave up (this was before he requested a trade and worked things out with Pop) because he was being forced to play as a center and getting double-teamed on every possession  - Jonathan Simmons looked checked out of trying to win at this point and seemed like he was just playing for his contract year  - we lost David Lee (who had become a key rotation player) after he was injured in Game 3  - our best player was 39 year old Manu Ginobili for fucks sake lol"
"Kawhi holding onto Westbrook's jersey on the inbounds, Danny Green and Durant colliding, the entire ending sequence was a shitshow of missed calls."
I’m saying lebrons finals performances make him look like dorozen   Cmon man. Lebron has more 40 point games in the finals while being guarded by defensive players of the year like Leonard and green than Jordan does vs pe teachers like Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec    Jordan honestly wouldn’t make the playoffs with the 2007 and 2018 cavs teams lebron took to the finals   I’m talking about in the modern era not the expansion era where Jordan made the playoffs going 30-52
This feels similar to random drug tests. Like the time when Danny Green went up for a dunk and got tested.
"There's no player comp imo cuz his [defense is unprecedented](https://youtu.be/dWozzO5VALs), him adding to his offensive game could make him truly unique. Danny Green was never in dpoy conversations."
"The next Danny Green honestly. Does everything else okay, really great at 3s and Defense, great teammate too"
"They aren’t though.  I doubt that the hawks win vs a healthy sixers.  Danny green being injured have the sixers one less wing defender. I doubt that they get those big games out of their wings with green tobi Ben all playing.  If you take out doc’s all bench lineups (maybe he was high?)  that’s even better, and I don’t think that it goes as poorly with green playing."
"Ouch yes Danny Green was a loss.   But that's so a reason why the Spurs are a favourite of mine, their culture, the way they keep players..."
He did. Our 2nd best player to leave us for Toronto after Danny green.
"Hold up. Boston fans being toxic doesnt change the fact that you guys are equally toxic, if not worse. The point is schroder didn't experience any hate from them YET. That was my point  Yeah, sure he does deserve some of the criticism. But you guys just go way overboard sometimes, like the Danny Green incident. Dude and his family got death threat because of poor performance. I know celtics fans sent threats to ray allen too but that doesnt change the fact that lakers fans are one of the worst in the league. Cmon now lmao"
"Lowry, DeRozan and Danny Green /s"
Let’s get Danny Green on team USA for 2023 world championship and 2024 Olympic Games.
Draymond Green  Darius Garland  Danny Green  Danilo Galinari  …  Devonte’ Graham
Especially during F5 season.  I was like Danny Green...is on the Sixers  Oh Graham? Lol
"Dude there are way too many DG's in the NBA to refer to Devonte Graham as ""DG.""  I was trying to figure out who you thought Philly was going to start alongside Danny Green lol"
"Haven't done much? Season after Kawhi left, Raptors went 53-19 for the 2nd seed in the East and 2nd best record in the NBA compared to Kawhi's Clippers going 49-23 for 2nd in the West and 4th best record in the league. We lost in Game 7 of the second round with the same core minus Kawhi + Danny Green while Kawhi's Clippers lost in Game 7 of the second round of the very same playoffs. Same exact result, minus the 3-1 comeback stigma."
Is Lowry about to get a tribute before Danny Green gets his ring?
"First of all, none of those trade offers were ever confirmed  Secondly, in the event that what you are saying is true, we would not have re-signed Duncan Robinson (@18M AAV, all he does is shoot 3s and can’t defend, which is clearly our identity) or Danny Green (doesn’t fit our timeline &amp; he was a UFA that we could have signed outright anyways)  Our backcourt is overflowing at the seems with prospects, and our front court is abysmal. Achiuwa makes more sense than Maxey"
danny green got injured as well
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jamychal Green, Javonte Green, Jalen Green… who else?"
or Danny Green how many 3s will you miss
"Patty Mills signed for less, just an example. Maybe talk Danny Green into joining forces again with Kawhi. I don't know, but they'd have the options."
I’m not blaming LeBron at all I’m blaming LeBron fans and the media who always turn things against his teammates. Look at the slander Danny green got last year even though they won the title.
Philly would be a good spot for him but who would they trade out? Danny Green or Seth Curry?
"It's not just that tho, Dwight had a negative net rating with Simmons (-8,7), Tobi Harris (-3,5), Seth (-14,4) and Danny Green (-8,5).   Like honestly there's a legit argument for Tony Bradley being better before the trade, they were absolutely horrendous when Embiid was sitting and Howard started. Now if you want to argue that it' sbecause of Simmons sure, but Dwight himself wasn't good last year"
Danny Green was even great for the Sixers this year. Dude has been a very good role player for 10+ years. The other guys are much less proven however - and had multiple seasons where people felt they weren’t very good.
"It’s weird how the sub suddenly thinks any role players who played for the Lakers are suddenly the shittiest players ever.  Happened with Danny Green, Kuzma, Drummond, Schroeder.  None of them are star obviously but they can be successful in the right role.  It’s gotta be a symptom of Bron stans who want to make it seem like he is playing with G leaguers.  Schoeder can be helpful in the right deal and situation"

"The spurs cleared Kawhi to play but his doctors wanted him to keep rehabbing. He eventually came back to play and played 9 games on limited minutes with at least 2 days off between games. Decided he wasn't ready to play and stopped coming to games for the most part. Like 3 times after that he told the spurs he would play and then he didn't. The spurs had a player only meeting with Kawhi where Danny Green said they basically just asked him are you going to come back this season or not? This was towards the end of the season and the spurs were at risk of falling out of the playoffs.  Manu gave an interview where he said they have to approach the rest of the season like Kawhi won't come back and save them. After that meeting, Pop gave an interview where he said he was assuming Kawhi was out for the season. Kawhi's group didn't like that Pop said that. The spurs end up making the playoffs and Kawhi is still in NY rehabbing. Even after Kawhi announces he's out for the season, he doesn't show up to a single spurs game.  The whole medical controversy was basically that the spurs diagnosed him with quadriceps tendinopathy which prolonged rest could not fix, you basically just have to rest when possible to reduce the pain. Kawhi's group thought he had some other issue. The raptors and clippers ended up treating Kawhi as though he had quadriceps tendinopathy, sitting him for back to backs and resting him when possible."
"I thought they'd be able to use that 9.5 to sign someone this summer to multiple years, something they may not be able to do next year. Danny Green signed for a 10m aav, Caruso 9, TJ Mconnell 8, an a bunch of role players are for less than that. The Clippers could use each of those players for 82, and Danny/Caruso for 16 for sure."
This is just as stupid as Danny Green giving his friend the chance to tweet out the news so they look like they are breaking news first.
Kawhi and Danny Green. For players who played almost a decade together I've never really seen them interact lol
"He also told Danny Green, a close friend, he was re-signing with the Spurs just weeks before demanding a trade."
"If curry lets me do it, I'm dumping Klay. His deal is likely awful going forward. Simmons is owed less money and is younger. I would like Seth Curry + Ben Simmons back. (or Danny Green instead of Seth if you must).    If Curry doesn't want to trade the splash brother for his real brother, then I've got nothing. Wiggins' deal is shorter and he's basically the same age as Simmons."
Are we going to ignore 3x NBA Champ Danny Green was a key piece of this deal?
"Danny Green is a piece of shit. Met him myself and he was just plain rude. But forget me, he had a camp my friends son went too, he got Danny’s autograph on a picture and when he handed the photo back he smudged his own signature, when my friend said he danny you smudged the signature he told them they’d have to pay for another picture or get to the back of the line.  Such an asshole for a guy who smokes layups. I can’t stand him."
"Dude you just listed Seth Curry, Danny Green and Furkan Korkmaz as like prized assets?"
"Doesn’t help that CJ is the second most paid player. Most of their payroll is going to two smaller guards with similar skillsets, and neither can play good, consistent defense.  Dunno why they would keep him..should’ve traded him and acquired another defensive piece. Danny Green was on the market for a while and would’ve helped a lot for them.. I wonder if they even bothered trying to get him. Wouldn’t have made them contenders but he offers solid defense and floor spacing. CJ is redundant on a team with Dame and Norm."
"Probably because some inconsistency is very much expected for an almost pure shooter like Klay. Unless you're Danny Green level of inconsistent, you don't get a shoutout for being inconsistent lol."
Also trade Danny Green and a first for Schroder.
is danny green really worse than oubre?
"Add Danny Green lmao. There were times where Popovich was chewing Danny and you could just feel Tony's face saying ""Sucks to suck"""
And Danny Green
"Was also funny watching philly fans react, bouncing from the highs of ben needing to be pressured, to getting so defensive when green told them he loved the city but they can be Fairweather fans. Just a devil and angel moment. Going from ""yes danny green has confirmed what I knew about a guy I have never been in the room with"" too ""HOW dare you, philly fans have never done anything  wrong, ever!"""
and 3 time champion Danny Green
"It is funny to look at the karma that those danny green quotes got  &gt;“Frustration over the years, I understand it...We are humans and people too. We're not zoo animals where you can throw things or be on our side when it's convenient. I love the city, and I love the fans. It's been quite an experience for me for the one year I've been here.""  1k karma 224 comments  &gt;""Ben has gone through quite a bit this year, and it’s not his fault that we lost…you can’t just harp on one player, and to his defense, he said he couldn’t find his rhythm but he did other things for us…I also think it’s a mistake that people think he doesn’t care""  3k Karma 486 comments  &gt;“You can tell Ben’s the type of kid if he’s not encouraged; if he’s not pushed or forced to do it, he’s not the type to take that risk.”  7k Karma 942 comments  I know it is the internet and negativity sells best, but this shit seems worse than ever on here. Danny Green took some pretty defensive stances on Ben, but oh he said dose not push himself enough, he did it HE SAID THE THING WE WANTED TO HEAR"
"They brought back Korkmaz on an insanely friendly team deal, Danny Green also returned on a good deal, upgraded the backup 4 with Niang, but we’ll have to see how this Drummond situation works out though lol.   I certainly not saying those put the Sixers in a winners position, but I don’t see how they can be worse than TBD."
"I think it's been the opener the last 2 years then, I remember Danny Green dropping 29 in his Lakers debut."
the Danny Green game
"Oh man, that game was dreadful to watch. Danny Green was like the only role player who showed up"
"But definitely would need 3rd scorer who shoots lights out like hield, ingles, danny green or duncan. I would probably do it for kuminga instead if we want to go all in. Moody at least has reliable jumper and kuminga is raw prospect.  Still not a fan for either of those."
i read danny green at first
"I mean it’s not like Danny green and Seth Curry are slouches (or Jj reddick, who Simmons played with for two years).   I think we can probably assume Simmons not being able to shoot is more on him than it is a matter of who the mentors are around him"
"No.  I don’t think Kyle Lowry makes up for the loss of Danny Green, Thybulle, and Maxey."
Danny green gets 20mil. All the lakers six 3 and d guys get less than that combined
Danny Green
"Trust, confidence, and cohesion as a unit were eroded when Trae young was in Ben's peripheral and he passed an open dunk. Trust was eroded after 3 straight years of training videos shooting 3s in the off-season. Confidence was eroded when he was finally subbed out when he was getting hacked and couldn't hit free throws. Cohesion as a unit was eroded once teams so evidently gameplanned for a series instead of a regular season game and completey took him out of the offense. The coach and the star player answered with frustration after a loss they shouldn't have had (and as sad as it was they probably win that series if Danny green is healthy) and if that disappointed Ben then so be it."
If you live within your means/a more modest lifestyle that would be true but these guys don't really do that.  Even Danny Green said a lot of players live paycheck to paycheck
"embiid i was fine with what he said.  doc? dude is a clown. two weeks prior when he was asked if he'd take simmons out for missing free throws he berated the media, then the next game he took ben out against the wizards. it fucked ben's confidence from the line. if he would have just told ben ""you gotta make free throws or we're not beating the fucking wizards. go do it"" i believe it would have done wonders. but he took him out rather than letting him work through it. huge misstep.  fuck doc rivers anyway. he's such a meh coach. doc has no room to go and criticize players or act like he wasn't the #2 reason why we lost that series. he lost the sixers game 1 having danny green guard trae. threw that shit away."
Even that. We’d be playing Simmons and Green at the same time. That makes things harder on Steph. Have to find a way to move Simmons to SF/PF and have a good SF shooter come off the bench. Danny Green is now off the market so I think we need to keep Wiggs.
It's more -- Paschall's $1.8M contract saved $12M in luxury tax. So $5.9M for TPMLE will likely be $40M+. I agree I don't think there is anyone left worth that much. I'd have taken Danny Green for TPMLE but he just re-upped with the 76ers.
"Let’s talk about matchups then. Danny Green wouldn’t be able to score efficiently against Huerter or anyone on the Hawks like Seth did. Seth was averaging 22 on absurd efficiency, he was only taking 12 shots a game. Taking away those shots and giving them to Danny Green would hurt the offense a lot, Curry was literally carrying all the shooting for the Sixers."
"Higher on Cam Reddish than most I think. I'll just paste a comment I made a few days ago about his FG%  &gt;I don't think it is though. He shot 46% from 2P% this year, Covington for example shot 45.1.%. Danny Green shot 43.8%.  KCP also shot 46%.   &gt;The main reaosn his FG% is so low is because his 3PT shot is in the low 30's wheras the other guys are in the 40% range, and also, he's taking 5 2PA's a game while the other guys are taking 2.   &gt;His archtype is a very switchable 6'8 wing. He just needs to shoot 3s and defend. As long as he ups his 3P% while also cutting out some of those non-3's he'll be fine. I would 100% take him on my team no questions asked. He's still big, has great lateral quickness, and is a good ball handler for his size.  Also probably higher on Poeltl. I think he legit needs to be in DPOY discussions and hope he plays 30+ mins this year.   Way lower on John Collins than most. I think his archtype no longer has any place in the NBA. Pure 4 who can't guard the perimeter or play the 5 defensively. To me these players will always be negative players no matter what their offense look like because they can't guard anybody."
"Danny Green is like a yellow Starburst. You’ll have it, but it’s not your favorite."
"Yeah, he was dominating as he always does but would be better the entire series instead of smaller spurts. Not difficult man, it was clear he was underperforming despite Atlanta doing nothing to hinder him.      Yes, taking George Hill out of the rotation, retaining Seth Currys offense, but incorporating Danny Greens defense would be impactful.      That’s beside the point, you’re being pathetic. All I’m saying is Danny Green makes us better, and that’s the point. You’re just desperately trying to make a stupid fucking point when you ALREADY WON. Jesus Christ."
"There's still people on r/sixers defending Simmons and saying we don't deserve him. The same people who said it was ""weird"" for us to be mad at Danny Green being critical of the fans after blowing the series with Atlanta"
"I went to Philly to watch the games. Embiid was dominating, I mean averaged 30 on absurd TS and elite defense. Do you think he would’ve averaged 35 or something lol?   I love how Sixers fans are acting in this thread like Curry was just a turnstile on defense and that’s it, he didn’t contribute at all.   He was averaging 22 points on 60% FG and 60% from 3. Did you think Danny Green could’ve possibly replicated anywhere close to his offensive production on the floor? Curry was the second best offensive player for the Sixers lmao. Sure, Green’s defense definitely would’ve been better, but you’re delusional if you think that he would’ve made more of a difference."

"guys i'm sorry this is loser shit. we simply just have to beat the hawks without danny green. he can't be the difference maker in the series. they had no hunter and a hobbled bogi. please, please stop it."
23 year old Danny green with actual passing ability is worth 21 million
Except Danny green isn’t worth 21 million
"Nah fuck that narrative, we didn’t want him and I’m glad we didn’t. He ain’t no Jason Kidd, he’s fucking Danny green with transition passing"
"Danny Green hardly played in the 2nd round, so only the 1st round mattered still. Morey is not talking about a Green-less line up."
